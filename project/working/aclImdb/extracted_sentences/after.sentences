Then again, the movie claims to have been made in 1994, but it looks -- and sounds -- like it was produced at least ten years earlier, so maybe they achieved time-travel after all.
Cagney, with his connections, brings stardom to Etting, but she loses her freedom to a miserable existence dominated by Snyder, who ultimately marries her, after a memorable fight on opening night at the Ziegfeld Follies.
Later, after marriage Ruth and Martin get even bigger and she has become one of the most successful women on stage, and her career soon comes to Hollywood.
There's a great moment shortly after the characters arrive in LA and he's been throwing his weight around, when she punctures him mid-boast.
After Judy Garland was fired from Annie Get Your Gun, the first person that they wanted to play Annie was Betty Garrett, but because of her an-gent she lost out having the role of a lifetime in the movies, and after this happened, Betty Garble wanted to play Annie in the worst way, but 20th Century wouldn't lend her out, so finally after seeing Betty Hutton in The Perils of Pauline, she was hired to play Annie.
Perhaps I just hadn't seen her at her best until now, but after witnessing her show-stopping Zigfield Follies number here, I'm a believer.
Curiously enough after I viewed my VHS copy of Love Me or Leave Me, I went to the movies and saw Walk the Line.
so, I'll lay out a few of the more glaring memories: There's a pointless scene where the bad cop humps to orgasm a car driven by a group of four college kids after belittling them.
There's a half decent fight scene between Sensei Zombie (a kung fu master undead) and the good cop after they rescue three useless girls.
But, the main stream movie-goer will probably want to commit suicide after watching this, so by all means avoid.
It will not surprise viewers that Cagney plays Snyder extremely well; he is, after all, best recalled for his numerous crime-drama roles.
That the affection is platonic is a moot point, especially after Marty decides to put a couple of slugs in what he perceives to be his wife's illicit paramour.
In the story, Etting is highly ambitious, and Marty helps her career after picking her up in a dance hall and realizing he's not going to get anywhere.
If you're still in doubt after seeing this film, watch "Julie" sometime.
Well after seeing Zombiegeddon i'll have to admit, he was right.
Strangely, his scenery-chewing complements Day's underplaying; the tension between their temperaments fuels this dark drama which occasionally resembles a musical but is closer at heart to film noir (Vidor, after all, directed Gilda).
One of their flashfire fights takes place in her dressing room after a show.
Soon after, Helen also takes the potion, and avoids a large gun shot in her stomach.
Towards the end, Ernest can't handle being with either of them, and after they co-operate, and Ernest finally dies (naturally), it ends with them finally falling apart, but Madeline still gets a good final line.
Well, after some more senseless punching and slapping, the fight is over--they really can't kill the other no matter how hard they try.
I stopped watching after hearing the Lord's name being spoken three times in vain, how much do you have to go through before you say 'enough is enough' ?
The cast bring their unpeccable goods despite all the visual effects (which still after 14 years look amazing).
Bruce Willis stretches his comedic muscles like never before or after this.
A simple premise presides: Madeline Ashton (Streep), a fading B-movie actress, relegated to performing an awful musical based on SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, sets sight on renown surgeon Ernest Manville (Bruce Willis) whom Helen Sharp (Hawn) has taken to meet her as a test to prove he will still be hers after their meet.
Because the movie is so watchable after so many viewings, I think this is a classic movie.
Meryl and Goldie play their parts with unrestrained enthusiasm, pushing them to the limit to emphasise that these two who believe they are truly beautiful are, after all, just caricatures of perfection.
Ten years after the disappearance of Dr. Kravaal, they discover the ice chamber containing the frozen bodies.
Now after all this negativity, let's have a look at the positive sides.
It is a rare film that leaves a favorable impression after 27 years.
***POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS*** His character is introduced well after the conflict between Hayes and the family is established.
I put it on fast fwd after 20 minutes into the film and made stops to catch up with dialogue, skipping violence.
The man and woman, after some banter, go back to his apartment.
That's all he does, and it gets beyond a joke after the third or fourth swear word.
In this slice of pioneer life film, William Holden and his son are left alone after the death of his wife.
There, he buys an indentured servant (Loretta Young) and brings her back home after marrying her.
Unfortunately, there never really is any romance, as Holden and son treat her more like a hired hand and after a while it's obvious she resents this--especially after she works herself to the bone caring for them.
Gary Gray gives strong support as the child who learns to love Rachel as a mother figure after his initial mistreatment of her.
Through Jim's interest in Racehl, David comes to realize what this woman is worth after she walks out on him and the farm.
David bought Rachel (who is working off her late father's debts) after his wife died, needing a replacement to help raise Davey.
Young was about 10 years too old for her 25 year-old character but this is not really a factor as the age of the character is unimportant; you wonder why they did not simply change the one reference to her age after casting Young for the part.
Gray is solid as always, one of those rare child actors who were not irritating after a few minutes on the screen.
A neighbor recommends a bond slave (Young) and after persuasion, he reluctantly marries her.
Sometimes they can be distracting (for example, you lose the illusion that a movie should create and instead you get the feeling that there are production people behind the camera) but still, the story and some of the characters depictions are so strong that you are still left with a haunting and depressing feeling long after the end credits.
My only real problem is the screen at the end claiming that the Indians got wiped out after they converted.
The Hurons are prepared to skin the rival chief they have captured literally alive, after killing and then burning alive his children one by one, essentially to make a political point.
It does not look like an easy life, and I imagine far fewer people would leave this movie thinking they would have wanted to be Indians, or live among them, than feel that way after films such as Dances with Wolves.
The title character takes a slew of meaningless jobs after the family is forced to move to the city, eventually ending up as a prostitute to survive.
If you are not American, watch this film either before or after a trip to the wilds of North America.
If you're a prof, show this film to students but lead a discussion before and after with care.
He has journeyed away from the "pleasures of the flesh," lingering on the sight of a couple making love in the communal tipi and later admitting to Daniel that he, LaForgue, lusts after the young Alogonquin woman,Annuka, with whom Daniel had already struck up a sexual relationship.
David Lloyd George (The British Prime Minister) and Douglas Haig (The General commanding the British Army) hated each other and after the war DLG got his memoirs into print very quickly - this led to the myth that the British Army was led by bungling officers and sacrificed for nothing.
With most televisions series the quality often declines and the British tradition is to end a series after 2 or 3 seasons.
She finally relents after the baby is born.
The grinding poverty of the rural South from 1865 until after World War II comes across vividly.
"Tomorrow" is a heartbreaking story set in the deep south a generation after the Civil War, and the tiny sad tale of a man and a woman and their child.
It makes us to identify with its main heroine, the orphan herself who after many years comes back to the very house she used to share with her childhood friends, also orphans and where she wants to open the house for the handicapped children.
Music suddenly stops...voices appear...sounds... after a while I wasn't all too sure any more whether the sound was coming from the movie... or from outside... not a nice experience during a movie like this one ;).
So after all I clearly recommend "El orfanato".
I usually regard a horror film as successful when a certain feeling or scene stays with me for a day after seeing it, if it can indent the terror, maybe even play with your mind after viewing it, the film has done its job.
This could be down to many reasons, but after watching The Orphanage I think the acting had a lot to do with it.
Whereas "Pan's Labyrinth" took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play, "The Orphanage" is closer to the classic haunted house themes of "The Others" as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death.
One day shortly after a mysterious visit from a social worker and SimÃ³n's revelation that he knows the truth about his adoption and illness, SimÃ³n disappears.
A solid old-fashioned ghost story that is genuinely frightening without resorting to lashings of gore or cheap shocks, The Orphanage is the best horror film of 2007 so far and certainly shows Hollywood the true definition of suspense after the laughable '1408'.
Heading to American shores nearly one year after the stunning domestic success of Pan's Labyrinth, The Orphanage should appeal to an equally wide audience.
However, it is only a matter of persistence to realize that after the big unnecessary moments of silence and boredom, the story starts to develop some of the most astonishing states of affairs, in which we see lesbian soft-core sex between two nuns, a nun taking advantage of a teenage boy and some enjoyable bloody murders inside the convent.
Soon after, a group of high school wannabe thugs come to collect money from one of the gas station employees.
Yes, I agree that this is definitely a morally bankrupt flick, but you actually feel satisfied, and I mean like cartharsis, after the credits that roll finally end(yea, you gotta see the credits too)  Above all, this is one of the best comedies I have ever seen in my life so far.
Bored again after their first attack on the gas station our 4 heroes return and start running the place with the staff held hostage - the situation begins to go out of control after run ins with the local gangsters, the "delivery boys union" and the cops.
No Mark forces the manager to fix a broken phone, but keeps smashing it after it's been fixed (after which he yells `Fix it!').
The movie goes directly to the point immediately after it starts.
One gets a different feeling for one's pet after watching this movie.
I hope Dennis fired his agent after making this T@RD.
Especially after watching them, I personally believe that similarities are more than the differences...
Yoko Saito,who astute observers will remember from Takashi Mike's "White Collar Worker Kintaro", stars as the titular Scorpion, who goes to jail after circumstantial evidence convicts her of blowing up her hubby in her car.
I agree with the earlier reviewer - save this for a Worst Films Night with some good friends after a few stiff drinks are had by all, and hope no friendships are ruined in the process.
And i know i will still love it after 10 or 20 years.
I thought it was the best series around i live about 3quarters of an our away i use to go with mum after School every 2nd Wednesday and meet quite a lot even the 2 old cogers :) one who lived in Minyip nice chap :) herb Krause very nice to have a chat with the old Emma Garage is now a Internet Cafe , the 2 milk bars have now closed down.
Before the picture starts Maltin tells of and shows many scenes that a few years after the year this film was made (1931) wouldn't have been allowed.
He falls for Stanwyck after she patches him up from a bullet wound and doesn't report it as required.
My favorite line is when Stanwyck, after wrestling with the drunken, neglectful mother, looks down at her passed out on the floor and says "You mother..." I won't give away the ending, as it is a bit bizarre, but this is an entertaining film.
Anyone who thought exploitation movies were invented in the 1960s will know better after having watched Night Nurse.
I saw this movie as a motel movie shortly after vcr's became affordable/popular.
How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paree?
That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation.
I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return.
Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant.
When she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that.
We learn those elements not in high-level drama but one of progressive mental torture going on in Marie's mind - particularly after Jean disappears beachside while Marie is basking on the sand.
The extensive majority of the film is concerned with Marie's perception of her world after her husband mysterious disappearance and her reflections on sexuality and ageing.
When Marie does attempt to move away from Jean's memory, the new lover, after only one night, is already volunteering to help her with her "problem".
On the day after their arrival at the summer home the couple go to the beach.
After the love-making scene, there is a shocking realization by the new boyfriend, that their physical intimacy meant nothing to her after the fact.
In the first instance, when confronted by Amanda after the dinner party and after a lecture, Marie uses changes in language to switch the tone of the conversation.
"Sous le sable" tells the story of Marie Drillon, excellently performed by Charlotte Rampling, whose husband disappears when they are on holiday after he went for a swim in the sea.
While Marie lies down to have a sunbake, Jean, after a reflective glance at the surf, rises, and heads into the surf for a swim.
Now, 12 years later, I have gotten the DVD (after a lot of struggle...) and re-watched it.
It begins with the cut right after the vanishing of Marie's (Charlotte Rampling) husband Jean.
However, by and by, the viewer realizes, that this is not a flashback: It is the time after Jean's vanishing and Marie lives on as if nothing has happened.
A film that will remain with the moviegoer long after viewing because of its painful emotions and its visually powerful final shot.
Avenging Eagle is the story of a man Chi Ming-sing (Ti Lung) who after years of killing for a brutal gang decides to leave and seek revenge against them and their leader.
As the movie goes on Chi Min sing tells his story of how he saw the light after being forced to kill a pregnant woman and betrayed the clan.
At age 10, she survived a deadly fall of a rooftop thanks to her mother, who made a pact with Satan himself (apparently, the Dark Prince didn't have anything better to do then to stroll around in hospitals) and, to return the favor, Nikki, after a life of infertility, will give birth to the Antichrist!
And indeed, shortly after moving to a new apartment with a dubious reputation, Nikki meets a handsome and seemly sophisticated man who quickly turns out to be the devil in disguise.
The finale brought to mind Arachnophobia as it ended in a dank basement; the film ending maybe twelve seconds after the rat's been dispatched as Weller brushes himself off as if the last two hours hadn't just happened just in time to greet his wife and kid at the front door.
I have a new found respect for him after this.
I wasn't expecting much after the first half hour, but the film surprised me somewhat by the way it eventually comes together, climaxing with an exciting sequence that sees the central character really go off the rails.
Bart takes a stand against the rat, after Bart accidentally killed the rat's babies.
There is no before and no after.
I was a bit skeptical but hey what do I know...  Thirdly-the character of Heidi just got on my nerves after awhile-I thought this movie might be a character sudy and that would be OK and make up for the sleaze factor-only it wasn't.
But then again-maybe, after all there isn't a whole lot more to this story.
Of course not, but in the words of Winston Churchill,"America usually does the right thing after exhausting all the other possibilities."
This film highlights what was probably going on after 9/11 but less so nowadays since people have had time to get their head back on straight.
This is a made-for-HBO movie, after all.
It is one side-splitting scene after another.
Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman.
That is a pity because they could have had for once a documentary about kids finding their way rather than losing themselves but the filmmaker went rather with the caricatural: -the genius overachiever (the good) -there's the tortured teenager (the bad) -the 9 year old twins who would not know what a beat (or singing in tune) is if it came up and hit them in the head (the comic relief) -the school director who spends his time screaming and berating these kids like it's boot camp time in full metal jacket (bare in mind these kids are between the ages of 9 and 17)- (the ugly) - Even after their triumph at the Zappa fest you don't see him once high five a kid or give him or her a compliment.
In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.
Fast forward 4 years later, after seeing this film, and looking for work in the music business, I got the chance to co-direct a show for the school, and for all the hard work I put into that, was (methaphorically) thrown under the bus by the institution.
I was definitely excited at first, but after being back in the belly of the beast and being treated so horribly, I curse this film and the subject.
"I don't do this kind of work," Dutch says indignantly after he learns his team ("We are a rescue team, not assassins.")
And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.
I am so sorry, after all of the online hype I REALLY wanted to like this.
The first few episodes it was a little slow (and I mean little) but it started to pick up speed and it snowballed and its just each breath-taking episode after each other now.
It's like watching heaps of awesome movies after each other.
However, after Azazeal leaves Malachi to fulfil his destiny on his own, i continued watching the show!
I would definitely like another season to see what happens after the finale of the second season.
My least favourite character has to be Roxanne, she seemed like a dressed-up little tart only after one thing...sex!
Thelma, you will find out, is probably the most interesting character, after she is killed in the first episode by Azazeal.
Towards the end they both accept their fate to fight after a little help from heaven and hell (the question though, is who actually helped whom.. an excellent twist which runs through the whole show, almost no-one seems to be only good or bad, in the end everybody makes mistakes, even big ones, and everybody have strong feelings, and acting more or less selfish from time to time.)
Even though I really would like to see more I have trouble seeing what a 3rd season would be about, after all the evil won in the end, and the end of days came.
you might recognize Cassie from "what a girl wants", this is a major step up for her and she is a great actor and should get more offers after this show.
I had it at the end of a video tape I'd recorded (off IFC) after 'Monument Ave.', a Boston-mob film that had a similar "bar tone" to it, but was nothing like 'Trees Lounge.'
Steve Buscemi has long been one of the premiere character actors in the business; his resume reads like a veritable Who's Who of interesting, complex characters who run the gamut from psycho hit-man to regular guy, all of whom he has brought vividly to life in film after film.
I guess I would ask those who attack the film with low ratings (because of the man) if they have ever had crowds bow down in front of them in a foreign country after performing so well?
Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.
The producers added commentary by Bert and Ernie after the movie proved too frightening.
I, on the other hand walk around all day after watching this singing the songs from it in my head... they are just so catchy.
(Spoiler Warning #3) When Elmo's Sesame Street pals learn that Elmo has jumped into Oscar's trash can, some of them, Big Bird, etc jumped in after him.
Elmo has this blanket that he loves very much, and after a tug-of-war with Zoe, Oscar the Grouch tosses the blanket after he blows his nose with it.
cast who were brave enough to participate in this pre - 9/11 project (things seem to change diametrically after this date), and performed masterfully at that.
Someone told them that just hours after they left, the roads out were blocked, and men were being conscripted into the army to fight.
Stony-faced Dennis Quaid is excellent as ever as the emotionally-shut-off mercenary tiring of the pointless and unresolvable fighting in Bosnia, slowly allowing himself to feel again some years after the horrific death of his family when a woman and child inveigle themselves into his life.
I was after a throw away movie (should have rented sphere) and instead got this thing that I just cannot stop thinking about.
I understand how he went through a rough time in Warrior Within, and after his victory over death he felt free once again... but it just felt like he went from 18 (Sands of Time) to 24 (Warrior Within) back to 18 in Two Thrones.
When not playing as the Dark Prince or riding a chariot, I found that jumping and running along walls was getting a bit monotonous after the two previous games; difficult puzzles are scarce, and finding solutions to situations becomes increasingly simple, with only speed kills offering some variance most of the time.
Do you like those ledges that fall off after you step on them?
It took a couple of episodes for me to get warmed up to it, but after that I really like it.
(Unlike Hitchcock's film, the source novel takes place shortly after World War Two.)
Didn't know much about it but we wanted to see what Sean Astin had been up to after LOTR.
At first, Conway get shot after Tanner tries to stop the robbery, but he, with the help of Tanner only rewinds time.
Tanner's only chance to save her love is Conway's machine, and she forces him to come with her and go after the machine.
That is she should still be wounded after the time jump.
The only one who saves face is Vinnie Jones, because, after all, he's Vinnie Jones and lends his natural ferocity to any role he's agreed to take on, including this crap.
Well after the performance he put in this, he doesn't deserve to act ever again, the over use of the obviously "Tring too hard" cockney accent was an embarrassment to watch, as was the bit where each bank robber says his "I'm hard" sentence.
The girl who played the FBI agent's acting was a laugh, when she walled up the hobbit after her partner was shot, that was hilarious.
Like I said, stupid movie, I feel stupider after watching it, and I would recommend it to nobody.
when he sees Duwayne staring at himself.Why?Belial laughs wickedly after Duwayne explains about wanting to be normal.Again, I ask why?Sure, they had a nosy reporter trying to expose them,but not much else.Gore and violence seems like it was just thrown in, to keep the audience awake.But even the violent scenes are poorly executed.The one liners thrown in by Duwayne after a violent act,made me groan in pain.I wanted to throw rotten eggs at him.At least Freddy Kruger knows how to throw in funny oneliners.Then there is the scene that made me cringe(BRRR).If there's something I never want to see in a movie,its this.I never want to see ugly people naked or have sex,and I never want to see ugly monsters naked or have sex.It had belial and Eve having sex,ARRGHH!Eww, that was something I can live without.I'd rather have my toes cut off!And that painful excuse for violin music sounded like it was played by a dog.Woof!The musical score is Laurie Anderson bad.When Duwayne tries to get it on with Susan,we find out,(SURPRISE)she's a marsupial.And she has a disfigured sock puppet pop in and out of her pouch.The biggest pisser of all, is the fact this was a ripoff of "Nightbreed",a much a better movie that came out a few years earlier.The freaks in that movie were better made,plus the story and plotting were well written.Watch "Nightbreed" instead of this dreck.0 stars for this junk.
Duane has really aged since the original that was made 8 years prior to this sequel and because the film is supposed to be set immediately after the events of the original, the way he looked just felt wrong.
The film picks up right where the original leaves off, has a few characters from the original returning, and just like "Halloween 2" it resumes inside the hospital right after the events of the original film take place.
The original "Basket Case" is one of my top favorite 80s cult films ever - just a bizarre idea that is strengthened by a great grimy New York city look and "feel", as well as awesome gore - and "part 2", though it was made about 8 years after it's predecessor, picks up right after the "dramatic" plummet from the Hotel Broslin.
Everyone's favourite surgically-separated Siamese-twins, Duane (Kevin Van Hentenryck) and Belial, return for more freakish fun in Basket Case 2, in which the brothers escape from hospital (after their near fatal fall in the first film) and find sanctuary at the home of 'Granny Ruth' (Annie Ross), who runs a haven for the physically deformed.
I really like the first Basket Case back in (1982) as it was very Gory also really funny and a lot of Fun  And now they are back again and this movie start from by showing what happened at the end of The Basket Case, Soon start from the ending of the first movie  The twins are now main headline on the news , Granny Ruth and her Grandaugter are watching the news and know who these two are, as they rush to the hospital, Duane and Belial break out of the hospital after he killed one of the doctors.
Cannell really went downhill after his brilliant Rockford Files.
There's no activity for this "Billy Ray Sharkey" guy after '92-'93, and I think RAY Sharkey died in l993.
I thought the writing and plots of the show were good enough to watch to week after week.
There is only one thing i don't like about this series, Reno's deep voice is getting one-sided after some time if you mix it with that overdone good and bad talk of him (example):'Yeah, but we must get the bastard, i can't allow that he gets away with this, we must stop him' (really deep voice)  But that's the only thing i can think of, besides that, it's a real cool series, the way he escapes again and again and the way he figures things out and takes matters into his own hands, is great too watch.
Maybe I've seen it over five times, and still I cry each time when Federico Luppi stands on the balcony talking about the desperation of life after the idea of loosing his son misunderstood.
Scene after scene falls flat, some of which at least had the potential to be funny.
This is her first film after her 18 years contract with Warner Bros. ended, and it proved once again what she could do with a meaty part.
It's popular not to like Coppola after Apocalypse Now.
The film is an amazing achievement, for the visuals and the music, which is what it sought after to achieve.
This film did not have a chance after Coppolas "Apocalyse Now".
That the story is so simple as to be almost invisible Â a couple split up over the 4th July weekend and become involved with new partners Â needn't be a problem: after all, three sailors on furlough looking for Miss Turnstiles or a backwoodsman convincing his six bachelors to kidnap six local girls to marry aren't exactly complex.
It's a classic/simple story of a couple who have lost the spice in their relationship, who break up, seek other people and then discover that, perhaps, what they had was better after all.
Possibly a classic, Francis Coppola's R rated 'One from the heart' has a very simple plot line set in neon lit Las Vegas in which a man and woman are tired of each other after living together for five years, they split apart for a night, then somehow or other they get back together.
Coppola decided to take a risk and experiment even further after Apocalypse Now- to go to something 'light' like musicals he directed in college after going through such a dark experience like A.N.- and in the process made something that, had it paradoxically been a silent film with most of the accompanying music, would've been a full-blown masterpiece.
The 1982 release of One From the Heart was universally considered a disaster because, supposedly, its theatrical run closed after only a week.
The music is some of the best Tom Waits has ever made--I only just learned that Waits selected Crystal Gayle; (FFC had requested Bette Midler (after hearing her duet w/ Waits on "Never Talk to Strangers") having listened to this LP for 20 years I'm glad he did.
One thing I can't figure out is the other reviewers of this film that are watching the DVD copy after seeing it on video, yet none of them seem to notice the difference.
And with "One From the Heart", Coppola's dream came to a thundering halt after just one movie.
The whole cast is excellent, and the sensual , open tone of the movie, mixing the fairly straight-laced couple, their young child, middle class friends and family, and the worldly young man and depicting them, ultimately, as not really all that different, is almost comforting...until that ending, which came rather fast and furious after a more slow moving development, shattering the mood.
Judge for yourselves, but I bet the rumblings from RAH's grave were heard for months after this travesty was foisted on the public.
I can't believe that after watching 6 hours straight, I was waiting for more!!!
This film about a murder case, about the trial after it, is one of these American films, in fact a TV mini-series, on a real case that does not go in the normal direction, the direction of what we all should think not truth is but justice should be.
It was his contention that Kathleen slipped and fell on a staircase in their home after an evening of wine and relaxation, while the prosecution maintained that Mr. Peterson had bludgeoned his wife, and positioned the body to appear as an accident.
(I suggest you read this after having seen the film) I don't know if what I'm gonna say can be regarded as a "spoiler", because after all, this is a documentary and maybe a lot of people know what happened.
I won't even go so far as to say that Michael Peterson didn't murder his wife, because after all I wasn't present at the trial (and even that isn't always a guarantee for justice) and I've only been offered this material in the form of a documentary (by French film maker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade) of about 6 hours.
But I've studied the law myself for several years here in Belgium and after having seen this film and having read about the case whatever I could find, I really can't conclude otherwise than by saying that there's at least enough reasonable doubt to set Peterson free.
The prosecutors knew very well which buttons to push (the emotional and moral ones, not too surprising in these Bush times) and even after all had been said and done (and Hardin and Black clearly didn't even have faith in a guilty verdict anymore), those issues simply made the difference.
The title aside, which may turn many people off the idea of watching the movie, the music is brilliant and after two months since I saw it I still cannot get one of the songs outta my head...Country Plant it's called.
Best scene ever an attractive girl singing a song and throwing up after almost every line..lol.
While the program covers the war on the Russian Front in-depth, it also contains significant portions that describe the years before and after the war.
His mug is prominently featured in the robbery photos and then the fun ensues when he goes to his ex-wife's (Hawn's) house to engender her help after being let go by the robbers and being fully on the run from the law.
This one re-teams Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase two years after they had shown how much screen chemistry they had together in "Foul Play."
I just finished watching it again after many years and it is still as funny as it was all those years ago.
I swear, I actually felt nauseated after watching this festering pile of manure.
I have to admit, after the first time seeing it I thought it was awful, but my 8 year old daughter and 4 year old son have it on tape and think it's hilarious.
So I watched it with them again and after seeing it for the second time I remembered some really funny characters Dana Carvey does.
I have not been a Carvey fan after SNL but you have to expect more from a guy with his comedic timing and characterization ability.
I can only assume he missed the daily's as any reasonable person would have quit after the first day.
The jokes are (of course) at his character's expense (he *is* the bad guy, after all), and he, appropriately, rolls out his very best "smarmy/irritated" act (the one that stole "Out To Sea" right out from under two legends).
after about 2 hours they were all insanely drunk.
It opened in Denmark nearly a year after it did in America so I had plenty of opportunities to read the bad reviews.
there are SEVEN occasions when people faint after seeing twins, which wasn't funny the first time.
Unless you are interested in knowing what Alex de Large must have felt like after undergoing "therapy" in "A Clockwork Orange".
For instance, one of the throwaway sorority girls in the opening sequence is revealed to be a virgin; this seemingly unnecessary plot thread is brought to fruition after she is raped by the werewolf before her throat is ripped out during the rape.
The director acknowledges major story elements owe a lot to the movie The Stepfather (the sheriff is named after that films director, Joe Rubin), and even Shakespeare's Hamlet.
The film apparently thrives on this to the point where it becomes tiresome after about half an hour, and the manner in which it does it leads one to seriously question the mental capacity of the individuals involved.
Five 'city boys', on a hunting trip in the wilds of Arkansas, end up being hunted themselves after running into a group of inbred poachers who don't take too kindly to strangersÂespecially Yankees.
However, the bad guys soon manage to escape (after their kin ambush and kill the lawmen) and set out to teach the interferin' city boys a lesson.
And now, after 10 years in the making "Prey" is finally out.
Because it stopped after only one season.
The score is by John Williams (famous for "Jaws", "Star Wars" and many, many Hollywood films) and it is an extremely effective one, but one wonders if Pino Donaggio might have done a better job (especially after his mesmerizing work in "Dressed to Kill", "Carrie" and especially "Blow Out").
It is probably the greatest of the DePalma endings, one of such satisfaction and plausibility that you won't stop talking about it for hours after the film is over.
Staying one step ahead of the organization he goes after Amy Irving.
First of it's kind and SADLY short lived as it went bankrupt and was demolished 6 years after it's closing.
"The Fury" came out after Brian DePalma's classic, "Carrie."
There are some plot holes that have nagged me (You would figure after the incident at the carnival that they would have had a clue to how increasingly dangerous he's become).
The author of the excellent 'All Heads Turn As The Hunt Goes By', John Farris, wrote his version of 'Carrie' after that novel's success as book and film; it was called 'The Fury'.
I wasn't expecting too much from it after borrowing it off a friend that recommended it to me.
I stumbled across this gem a couple of years ago late night after a few drinks.
Needless to say after a few minutes i soon realised that it was in fact comedy gold.
I've just rediscovered it on 4OnDemand after someone reminded me about it in work and its just a good as i remember.
10-4 (You'll get it after!)
And this is only after the fist 3 episodes
I was a bit concerned after the first episode that the jokes would quickly wear a bit thin but this hasn't proved to be the case.
glad to see here that I'm not the only one already hooked after just 3 episodes.
This nice couple moves to a new town after the husband gets a job running game design and the company seems to be very involved in controlling the lives of it's employees.
It seems that having sex is one of the primary roles of this software and the characters themselves including the main characters and after setting up the story everything starts falling apart and the storyline that could be good gets ground to a halt.
came out in 1984 one year after "Flashdance" and became his male answer.
Its also funny because lots of people fainted because they thought they saw Jackie Chan twice, one after another.
What are even funnier are the people who are in it - Lithgow did this film two years after Garp.
Teenager Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small mid Western town with his mom after his parents divorce.
Perhaps the only noteworthy thing about this movie are the performances: Rosario Dawson is excellent as the teacher who gets pregnant after a one night stand.
I was looking forward to another Ed Burns written project after seeing that film he was in with John bonJovi (forgot the title of that one), but this effort was way too bare of any believability.
Sidewalks was postponed after September 11th.
rescreenings and decide to give it a go after the disappointing "Tibbs" will be justly rewarded.
That's after almost 10 years of looking.
Some of the scores were too contrived, the scene when they were slow dancing and "You are so beautiful to me" song plays; Aretha Franklin singing the words freedom after the coming out scenario, etc.
As shortcomings may be considered the lack of "happily ever after..." ending, the somewhat too aggressive, for the spectator, plot development, the discreet appearance of several trivia and the lack of "mouth wide open" laughing humor.
At first viewing it's excellent, then after I thought about the film some more I gained appreciation for it.
The movie begins with a prologue which shows how two twins were accidentally separated just after birth.
Now had this just been an action film with fight scene after fight scene, I think it wouldn't have worked as well.
I came in after the beginning and knew that I had missed the prologue.
It was, after all, just a movie and I don't ever have a lingering reaction such as this.
But after watching it, I am inspired to write my first review ever!
Based after the play "What's Wrong With Angry?"
I felt Steven's pain as he pined for the Brad Gorton character, John, especially after the two hooked up.
It seems that the two of them did not get back together by the end, and we as the audience were left hanging and left to guess what happened after the dramatic school assembly coming out.
I'm not biased or anything (being gay myself) but gay themed movies always seem to be better than most of the standard Hollywood fare that's churned out year after year.
Gay themed films always seem more uplifting and fun to watch, and always stay with me long after I've watched them.
Being gay is not easy these days, especially for teenagers, but we all wish we were as brave as Steven, who matures as the movie goes on and we all hope the best for him as he embarks on his emotional recovery after the end of this movie.
One learns to take care of himself after living on the streets... the other becomes a talented musician.
At first I thought this would be a Santa Clause rip-off, but after seeing it, I would recommend it to anyone.
There were a couple of other good jokes I liked as well, like the guy that could not get a girl yet he looked like the type of guy girls chase after.
Slapstick humor all the way as Chan escapes one impossible to escape mess after another.
(I question the label... this is 2006, after all, and personally I am tired of labels.
Craig Russell was a unique person and after his death Canada and the world had lost one of its greatest idols.
Never mind,still an absolute delight to see after all these years.
Corrigan needs to stick to writing, but only after taking a few more classes in story structure.
Entertaining movie for those who don't like the majority of average Hollywood movies you see with dull plots and you already know what is going to happen after watching the first 10 minutes of the movie.
It's interesting to see the direction the show took immediately after the original movies and before Episodes 1-3 were thought of.
I participated in Vietnam Summer (1967), campaigned for Gene McCarthy, and was an ardent supporter of McGovern's presidential bid even after the Eagleton fiasco.
I became his greatest fan after watching Kati Patang.
Kati Patang a movie from Shakti Samanta's stable was released when Super Star Rajesh Khanna was at his peak and was churning hits after hits and it appeared that there is going to be no end to his giving hits.
He seems disgusted with her the morning after, and leaves callously, saying he won't be back - YET, we're to believe that within the next day he's become smitten with her and discovered he can't live without her?
She goes after the younger man, loves him, she is thankful he continues coming by her house to stay.
That aggressiveness to go after what she wants without worrying about what others might say(..though, she is very vulnerable and doesn't have faith in the strength of the relationship lasting).
Spader's background is respectable, white-collar but bored, he meets Sarandon after missing his deceased wife.
It's so bad I was about to leave the theater after 15 minutes of it, but I stayed, hoping it would get better (by the way, how come I saw it in a movie theater if it was made for TV?).
After reading the positive comments here and seeing the 1 star rating on my digital cable guide, I decided to give it a chance (plus, I'm a big Alan Arkin fan after seeing him in 'Catch-22', 'Glengarry Glen Ross', and 'Little Murders').
And the chemistry between her and Brody is amazing - after the first meeting of both you are not able to turn this movie out.
The real story is about what happens after he is caught as the police and the FBI race against time to get him to reveal where she's buried.
Our sociopathic villain, known to us only as Harry (after his idol Harry Houdini) is well prepared for the psychological cat and mouse game that follows as he had planned what he would do if he were caught.
And even worse, after globalization and sugarfrosted horrors for breakfast, the 'old world' is quickly picking up on this terrible excrescence too...
But on the other hand, they seem like such pointless exercises, and it's hard to muster up the energy to care time after time.
Which is interesting since it sometimes has that long feeling of an Altman shot here and there, or one that is held for longer than one might expect in a TV show; one crucial shot being when Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy) is shot unawares by a camera looking through a glass coffee table as he gives a passionate monologue to his campaign team after a bad day.
And after seeing Parent Trap, I would have expected much, much more from Lindsay.
Young and alone without a mother, Casey (Lohan) is finding it hard to live after the death of her mother.
her obsession with food..)and after the initial annoyance with her overdone stupidity in real-life, she started to warm to me.
I used to hate it and think it was really lame, bad plot, blah, blah, blah, but after reading all the comments on the first page, it really got me thinking.
( That's a good sign by the way...it means this movie is "bearable" till the end )  The monday after, my little niece told me she saw it too and she said she never saw a better movie...so, you see, it's all relative
Talk to you kids about this after the movie but enjoy Eve's bubbly attitude and style during the show.
Movies that are powerful, inspirational, makes you take the right decisions after a life of wrong ones or after a life where other has done wrong decisions for you.
Written at a time in his life when he doubted if he could (read: should) be the 'voice' of the forgotten women, the broken woman, the fallen woman, ...the woman that is often invisible in most church congregations, after the release of his novel, the overwhelming answer was 'preach on, T.D., preach on'.
Too often, I find myself dosing off in the middle of the latest block buster only to wake up grateful that I missed it after hearing the disappointment experienced by those who stayed awake.
Especially if it breaks out either just after the World's Series 2002 or early 2003 opening of the MLB season.
-- The best friend being offered a contract and a spot on the team after the manager sees him playing catch.
Those are the thoughts that I took with me after today's morning screening (actually across the street from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills which I think appropriate!!)
Auguste Neel was in fact guillotined in Saint-Pierre in the nineteenth century after waiting months for the means of execution to arrive from Martinique.
In the movie, Neel wanders around the island after receiving his death sentence for murder, performing one good deed after another -- some heroic, others mundane, but all saintly.
An earlier writer was right - this IS cinema de qualite, fifty years after.
The New Wave fizzled out after producing little of value, and the 1950s (no doubt its faults were real enough; Truffaut probably came close to seeing every single French film of that decade, so in one respect he'd be in a position to know) is looking more and more like a golden age, so maybe the phrase "cinema de qualite" is about due to be reclaimed.
His choice was motivated by the desire to work with one of the two main roles, Juliette Binoche (he had teamed up with Daniel Auteuil the previous year for "La Fille Sur Le Pont, 1999)  The title of the film has a double meaning: the "veuve" refers to Binoche after her husband's demise.
Based on actual court records, the plot begins after a Parisian military captain, Jean (Daniel Auteuil), and his new wife, Madame La (Juliette Binoche), arrive on an isolated French isle off the coast of Newfoundland, where widows outnumber balmy days 50 to 1.
Not only that, but we get some nasty views of the alien's early victims that it was studying, plus some gross after the fact corpses.
I actually had free tickets to this film but forwent using them after seeing the terrible write-ups: Tired buddy film; Samuel Jackson couldn't look more bored... etc.
In contrast, after finally renting it, I found it to be a very entertaining film with roles that seemed to fit the actors like a favorite chair.
The film paints a very emotional Asoka that Shah Rukh Khan excelled in bringing out, especially when three women in his life played an important part in his life-changing decisions, such as his mom's involvement for him to see the outside world, Kaurwaki in being his first true, and unattainable love that he yearns and pines for, and his eventual wife Devi (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a Buddhist who would be instrumental in his embracing of the religion after coming to his senses in the aftermath of his most brutal war waged just because of his insatiable appetite for more territory, though of course done in the name of uniting India.
Yet Kareena Kapoor is a revelation (after her second two films).
They don't show his transition to Buddhism and his life after Buddhism are given no significance.
One day while in exile, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful runaway princess names Kaurwaki (played to the best of her ability by Kareena Kapoor, considering that this role was supposed to be for Aishwarya Rai who personifies the meaning of beauty more than Kapoor ever could) and after a few song and dance numbers, they marry each other in the deserted forests.
Then one the day of a planned battle he is reunited with Kaurwaki on the battlefield after an intense bloodshed of her people in which left him victorious in battle.
They are all forever torn apart as they patch up their histories and sorrows and Asoka's new wife ends up leaving him after the birth of their children.
Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor meld delightfully in their romance, but after seeing a few other movies with these two superstars in them, I admit their acting skills are not exceptional-I noticed that their facial expression and vocal fluctuations are almost identical in other films.
It would help the end to be better, specially after seeing such a massive destruction and annihilation.
Finally, many things of ''Asoka'' remembers me another great epic movie called ''Atilla'', that is directed by Dick Lowry: the way Asoka stays angry and starts to be a monster ,killing everybody after the supposed death of Kaurwaki, is very similar of Atilla 's behavior when his wife N'Kara dies.
Prince Asoka,after leaving his kingdom by his mother's wishes (since he is being hunted by his own brothers), falls in love with the beautiful princess Kaurwaki.
I have to say, that after thinking about it for awhile, I really enjoyed this movie.
If there is a weak point, it might be the editing...alot of times, after a cut, I felt like there was too big a jump and a scene missing....
Both girls are hiding from their pimp Derek (Johnny Harris) and his client Stuart Allen (Sam Spruell) after a botched job in which the client's father, Duncan Allen (Alexander Morton) died in the client's apartment.
Systematically, one particular character must balance evading capture with the taking on of the moral responsibilities that come with looking after a much younger individual they've unwittingly roped into this world by way of child-prostitution.
I don't want to sound pretentious or to seem as if I saw something that wasn't really there but that previous sentence just popped into my head immediately after viewing this film.
Both are on the run after killing a gangster and his son Stuart (Sam Spruell) is out for revenge.
Watching an actor hit their mark so precisely, it reminded me of everything I could never pull off myself in front of a camera, and why I never sought to be an actor: I know that even after years of study and practice, I would not be capable of this kind of precision.
And my consideration, after taking all these factors in to account is, this is brilliant!
I also saw London to Brighton at the Edinburgh film festival, the buzz after the film was all so positive and I think this film will do really well based on this word of mouth.
Coming out of the cinema after watching "London to Brighton" I felt my senses reeling and the adrenalin pumping as if I had just stepped off a particularly fiendish theme park ride.
Abbas-Mustan after BAAZIGAR came back with SRK in BAAZIGAR which was planned after BAAZIGAR  The film is a remake of NICK OF TIME, RUSH HOUR  The movie does disappoint you compared to BAAZIGAR and is too cheesy and stupid in parts  The all detective agency office changing into a hospital.etc is too stupid The film has some funny moments but things are too lose at start  The twist in the tale where the confusion about BAADSHAH occurs it makes you interested The scenes in the plane and then the entire chain of events are well handled The film does have many convenient situations too But they are some funny moments too which make you laugh and also keeps you thrilled at times  Climax is too filmy and a complete copy of RUSH HOUR  Abbas-Mustan is good, but not at their best Music is good, title song rocks and also Mohabbat ho Gayi  Shahrukh Khan fits his role well though he overdoes it many times yet his comedy is well directed here and his pokerfaced comedy suits him most but he does make too childish and clownish expressions which irritate Twinkle Khanna is nothing great Amrish Puri is laughable for wrong reasons mostly especially wen he says OH BACHCHI Rakhee is okay Sachin Khedekar is alright in a small role Johny Lever makes you laugh like in most AM films and he is a laugh riot Deepak Tijori is okay Deepshika is average Sharat Saxena is funny Razzak Khan and Saurabh Shukla overact Prem Chopra is hardly there Neeraj Vohra is good
(His warning was ignored; the Zero came as a big surprise after Pearl Harbor.)
Scott owed $25,00 in back taxes after publishing his (most successful) book in the Summer of 1943 - during the height of WW II.
this after he was rendered useless as a combat pilot because of his nerves being shattered, from the combat missions he already flew, and the tropical illnesses he contracted in China.
Alas, after a long wait, I was not disappointed.
Award-winning script-writer Maria Goos is at her best here, and so is director Willem van de Sande-Bakhuysen, who was terminally ill when the shooting started and who died shortly after 'Live!
Maybe it seems to be kinda sentimental, but I like film that make me think about something after I went out of cinema hall.
That was formed only after the Germans overran Holland; but this movie is set before they'd captured Amsterdam.
Eva Bartok is stylishly beautiful and enigmatic as a Dutch woman with uncertain alignments who joins the day trippers after they saved her from a suicide attempt (driving her car over the pier in the harbor, a car, incidentally, that comes in mighty handy).
The film only slows down a little after the midpoint as we deal with the characters on their own, but the ending really makes it all worthwhile.
But anyhow soon after, he meets Eun-ha (Jeon Do-yeon), a "coffee" girl who also moonlights as a karaoke hostess, and falls head over heels with her.
You know the romance bit pauses and the melodrama sets in after the introduction of the ex-boyfriend, and the pacing of the movie suffered with the discovery of the illness thereafter.
The visual effects were notably a lot worse, a lot of jerky, stuttered animation in the movements of the creatures, not at all the same kind of quite natural movement I expected to see after having seen the first movie.
If you swore you'd never watch another D&D movie after the first one, it might be worthwhile reconsidering.
My favorite scene though is one of the closing scenes, where you see the wizardess and the rogue cleaning up the temple of Obad-Hai after receiving major healing there - a really nice gamers' touch I thought.
He kidnaps girl after girl taking them to his blanket furnished cave.
Man, that is about as UNBELIEVABLE as Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) speaking in broken-English, after having lived in the United States (since his teens) for over 50-years!
I decided to watch this again, after reading some of the other comments, and perhaps find a funnier movie than the one I remembered seeing, but it still wasn't there.
I was at the point of leaving the theatre after several badly written lines that would have looked out of place even in a high-school essay.
Right after I sat down and the initial title came up, flashes from a water polo match attracted my attention, and the story started immediately.
But a very strange thing happened after the film ended.
I may not be objective since I'm a Hungarian and a patriot, and especially after the very sad 50th anniversary, this was some kind of relief for me.
I never appreciated her - never saw any movie where she didn't pose in lingerie - but after this I have to say, she has to run around in lingerie because in clothes, there's nothing touching in her, nothing that makes you believe what she says, no emotions on her face whatever.
The leading lady - after DobÃ³'s failure - is surely Viki SzÃ¡vai, Eszter in the movie (DobÃ³'s best friend).
I hope less people will laugh at those cheap jokes by comedians on the US national TV after seeing this little history lesson.
I wanted to know what they did after the game?
And after that I must say: I'm proud to be a Hungarian.
As far as I can tell the story is faithful to the real events that transpired in 1928 during and after General Nobile's first attempted expedition to the North Pole by air.
With an international cast that includes Peter Finch (capturing the anguish and despair at the heart of the protagonist without resorting to the overbearing histrionics that earned him the Oscar in '77 over DeNiro's Travis Bickle), Claudia Cardinale (without doubt the most astonishingly beautiful woman on the planet in the late 60's), Sean Connery (in a small role as Roald Amundsen) and Mario Adorf (familiar face from many Italian b-movies), a rousing score by maestro Ennio Morricone, and sturdy direction by Mikhail Kalatozov (five years after I AM CUBA), this really is a lost classic any way you slice it up and just a great f-cking movie.
Instead, forth-billed (after Claudia Cardinale and Hardy Kruger) Peter Finch takes the lead as General Nobile, whose ill-fated 1928 airship expedition to the North Pole, intended to boost Fascist Italy's international prestige, instead ended ingloriously with the survivors stranded on melting ice packs for weeks while inertia, lack of initiative and the poor chain of command resulted in buck-passing, recriminations and destroyed reputations rather than rescue attempts.
I can't answer for its historical accuracy beyond Connery's philosophical Amundsen being nothing like the ruthless egomaniac of reality that he had become by this time (indeed, Amundsen's death in this rescue did much to salvage his heroic reputation after the public backlash to his bitter score-settling memoirs).
Forty years after the expedition Nobile is a disgraced figure living in Rome and burdened by guilt and sleeplessness.
He wisely turns back to Kings Bay when the weather gets bad, he is genuinely devastated at the loss of some of his men, and his actions after the crash are all reasonable.
Levy gets most of the laughs (is it an inside joke or typecasting that he's in the dental field again after WAITING FOR GUFFMAN?
The plot, i.e., the double-identity of Carmen Miranda, is totally absurd but the situation of Lionel after the disappearance of Mlle.
Forty years after the event his rest is still disturbed by doubts he has about the leadership he exercised.
It is her bitter confrontation with Nobile after he has been safely brought back to King's Bay while the others were left freezing on the ice, that is the beginning of his sleepless nights.
he asks Captain Romagna, the ineffectual rescue coordinator, after reading a cable from Rome placing him under arrest.
What I didn't understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union?
Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story.
In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war.
Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot.
Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution.
What starts as an interesting crime case and a question of Clint's character drags into an overlong boring venture as the same thing that happens at the beginning continues after 90 of the 115 minutes.
Also after seeing current "CSI" shows regularly, it does seem a little primitive in their investigative methods.
When it starts to get personal, as the killer goes after the Detective, there's even an effective moment when Eastwood finally cracks through emotionally, and one realizes what's under all of that intense, cynical gruff.
The ex-cop turned serial killer after a long sojourn in prison for rape.
The three cops keeping one woman under surveillance and protection killed one after the other and the woman assaulted.
Once he was out of jail why didn't he start with killing Eastwood instead of those prostitutes (after all, it turned out that Eastwood had arrested him years before)?
Eastwood portrays this insecure character superbly that you truly care for him and feel his pain and effort to be a perfect father figure to his two girls after the divorce.
It kind of stuck to just showing us the aftermath, with one murder investigation after another.
It pretends to be a meditative movie but in my opinion, seeing others meditate is just simply very tiring, especially after 2 hours or so...initially I thought, wow, there is so much beauty to be seen here (and I really love silent movies or movies with a slow pace) but this one just goes way to far.
I was ready to stop watching "Into Great Silence" after forty minutes.
It is after this, however, that the film resembles true life itself: rarely have documentaries portrayed such an unhurried sense of time, yet all of the film passes faster than you wish it to, each minute counting to the very last.
It's a fascinating movie if you are able to get into the slow rhythm of the film (if you are still in the movie theater after an hour, you will probably made it to the third hour).
It may seem too long after two hours.
What stayed with me after watching 162 minutes of this is the plain beauty of the cloister and the reminder of a life style that we may have thought extinct in the West.
Unfortunately, this exuded chemistry cannot sustain the rest of the material which all too often resorts to extensive flatulence sequences, resulting in two heavyweight actors floating on nothing more than hot air in a film that practically has no other substance and that lingers unpleasantly, long after it has passed.
The soundtrack was and is so cool, you never heard heavy metal music in movies or on the radio for that matter(well OK maybe on after midnight on Sunday if you got the tinfoil just right.)
But you're not after richness in art, are you?
You're after eye-candy and digitally rendered starscapes, aren't you?
When the world awoke form it's boring funk, disco, brown-yellow-orange-colored slumber after Star Wars shook it awake and revived sci-fi, heavy metal appeared during the aftershocks and created albeit for a small public a visual feast.
I decided to watch this film recently after seeing "South Park" make fun of HEAVY METAL in the so-called "Cheesing" episode.
The only surviving plane, being of course a B-17, flys off after all of the others have also gone or have been destroyed.
They all find themselves in a world where the Commies won the cold war (after a brief slide to a world where a second ice age took over and must find a way back.
This show made you want to learn about things you never knew existed like the Einstein-Rosen bride.I became more Interested In learning about these things after I saw the show.As In star treks end" All Good Things: must come to an end" I always say If It's not broke don't fix It!
I have been hooked right from the start, and it really ticked me when they canceled it after the first year, and then moved it out of Vancouver.
A movie based on human emotions - and the struggle of two individuals who meet, fall in love and then drift apart only to meet again after many years.
Finally, the two meet again, after many years.
And, as usual, reality takes a back seat to low down comedy as the boys fall into one impossible situation after another before we reach a happy ending with everyone confidently marching off to take care of World War II.
To make matters worse, their drill sergeant is the cop who went after them.
now repeat after me -- "buzz is the cola that we drink, we must have it, come and get it-buzz!"
If you were born after 1975 and most of your `movie going' experience took place in front of a cathode ray, NO!
I'm not quite sure why Albert Finney did not want to play Hercule Poirot again after the smash success of the all star Murder on the Orient Express.
Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit.
The padding argument usually concerns shot after shot of Egyptian locations without much happening.
Typically, there is no lack of probable suspects, all fellow cruisers and very questionable characters with a good reason for wanting the lovely Linnet dead...  Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis)...a sharp tongued, elderly dowager who covets Linnet's jewels   Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith)...her sullen but loyal nurse companion, who has been forced into a servant's life as a result of her father's career being ruined by Linnet  Loise Bourget (Jane Birkin)...Linnet's French maid, angry with the murdered heiress for refusing to provide the dowry she had promised her  Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury)...a sex obsessed, drunken writer facing a lawsuit brought on by the heiress after Otterbourne uses Linnet in one of her erotic books  Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivier Hussey)...Mrs. Otterbourne's daughter, who wants to protect her mother   Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy)...an American embezzling from the Ridgeway family   Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale)...Linnet's husband and former fiancÃ© to Jacqueline (see below)  Jacqueline DeBellefort (Mia Farrow)...Simon's vengeful jilted fiancÃ©e, who is furious with her former friend, Linnet, for stealing him from her and follows the newlyweds along on their honeymoon  The famous stars all seem to be having great fun with their roles.
Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit.
Tourism in Egypt apparently increased significanlty after the film's release.
This was the second of Agatha Christie's novels featuring Hercule Poirot to be filmed, after the success of 'Murder On The Orient Express' a few years earlier.
Atrocious college comedy follows a group of campus goof-offs who do little but chase after girls.
I think the plot and story is very hard to follow after one viewing and the less you are experienced with English (subtitles), the more times you will have to see this film in order to understand the whole plot and its turns.
I gladly give this 8/10 and maybe my rating will rise after subsequent viewings.
My friends and I rented this movie to celebrate a reunion after 12 years, and we were rolling with laughter in five minutes.
The most emotional scenes involve Jack seeing his ex-wife and daughter after not seeing them for ten years.
* I happened to see this as a late-night TV re-run, the day after watching the Coen's 'The Man Who Wasn't There'.
But after persevering with the movie a couple of times more, I enjoyed it.
John Travolta tries his best as writer for Rolling Stone magazine hoping to finish an unflattering piece on the faddish California health club scene, but complications arise after he falls in love with a sexy, sensitive aerobics instructor.
And, after seeing 22 other shorts, I noticed a lot of the previous films in this 30 minute film (that's very long for one of these shorts, by the way).
And, after choosing one, the other becomes a Cavalry scout who just happens to be involved in a raid on an Indian village.
At the end of the film, you see a shocking scene of the bloodstained mother walking around with a human heart in a bag... the (often heart-related) sound track songs are also very suitable, and after watching this movie you will never see all those "heartache love story" cliches the same way!
One day, after his wife has had sex with Alex, Gary has a heart attack.
But after that, to my utmost surprise, this turns into a soap-opera family drama and all this lasts for the next 40(!
Or maybe Michael Ironside came up with that line himself, after having read the script?
It is great to revisit the town of KorsbÃ¦k in 2007, approximately 25 years after it was first aired.
I first saw it - not long after it came out - on Dutch public television in my final year in high school.
Aykroyd is in virtually every scene, but since the writers didn't bother coming up with anything funny for him, he becomes tiresome after about fifteen minutes.
A sublime movie within a movie after you see it once and the ending you have to watch it again, the first time you see it tells you a whole new movie now that you know, you watch it again and see it from a different perspective.
I have never written up a review before, but after seeing this movie I feel like I have to.
Real Time, the second feature of writer/director Randall Cole (19 Months) made its Canadian debut at the Toronto International Film Festival after being the opening night feature at the Slamdance Festival earlier this year.
This thoughtful film invites us to examine how we choose to spend our time, as Andy contemplates a life that has lead him deep into a thick woods with Reuben's gun at his backÂ   This film will stay with you long after the credits roll.
The entire journey kept me captivated from beginning to end (which is no simple feat after a week of festival fatigue) but nothing prepared me for the ending.
After all, who would go after such an uneconomic source of oil as oil shale if our world supply weren't falling apart?
This process has been around since the 1920s and has been exploited by oil starved nations such as Germany and Japan during the second world war, and by South Africa during Apartheid and after.
I awoke in the middle of the night after watching this movie, and couldn't fall back to sleep as I couldn't take quit thinking about the issues discussed.
This is my honest reaction so far after having seen this film only once over a week ago.
It really is like you hear of how people re-evaluate after getting a diagnosis of a terminal illness - that is what this film has done for me.
2) Why not continue with this lover after the divorce?
When she gets back, she's got some fresh European music teacher what Cary finds out she spent the night in the country with, after her car, you know, broke down, or so she says.
However if you think about the wonderful Grant-Dunne chemistry and their outstanding performances, I guess it's really not that surprising after all.
In this classic 30's screwball comedy, Grant and Dunne star as Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a married couple who decide to get a divorce after some doubts over each other's faithfulness to the union.
This is Grant and Dunne's first screen pairing together, they would go on to make two more successful films after 'The Awful Truth'.
Lucy spends the second half trying to win Jerry back, after he falls for the same misunderstanding again when he happens upon Duvalle hiding in the other room in her apartment.
What's so difficult about saying, "My vocal coach came over this afternoon after I ran away to see if I was alright"?
And if it's romance you're after, you probably couldn't do better than THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.
As for Peppard, he becomes the reluctant hero after Flood pushes all the right buttons, and especially when he makes the move on Molly Lang's (Simmons) stagecoach business.
Fortunately we see some familiar supporting actors, including Don Galloway (of TV series IRONSIDE), John McIntire (of WAGON TRAIN), and it's interesting to watch comic actor Slim Pickens as mean, sadistic character again after his wonderful performance in ONE-EYED JACKS (1961).
Josef Fares seems to have had a much too easy ride after "Jalla, Jalla!"
(Because of a fluke, It didn't stop the 2 minute "preview" after the first 2 minutes of the film. )
One particular morning, after Beethoven is awakened from his dream of steaks, he walks himself around the park and notices a female St. Bernard.
But Beethoven goes after her and rescues her.
The mom is the first to know, and says to keep it from the dad, but that night the dad finds out after hearing barking the basement.
Eventually, after going away on vacation the bad guys run into the kids, and take the puppies.
You'd think "OK, they live happily ever after".
Nevertheless, "Metalbeast" is *slightly* better (even if they're practically the same movie, with people just running around in a facility with some beast after them).
The real werewolves from the opening scenes, seem styled after the ones from Joe Dante's "The Howling".
Despite this he proved he was intelligent, quick witted and he had a number of smarts to outwit his opponents, but he was also capable of looking after himself physically when the situation arose (he was an expert in karate, being overweight does not mean you can't handle the rough stuff when you need to, my judo instructor was 19st, the same weight as Cannon, but boy could he move fast when performing various judo throws and moves).
I am 19st myself, but I know that I can look after myself when need be, with my experience of judo.
He proved that a fat man could look after himself and that he was more than capable when it was needed to deal with violent crooks.
...after some very difficult (nude!)
Wenham is also good - after appearing in various bit-parts, his major break came in THE BOYS, closely followed by A LITTLE BIT OF SOUL and MOLOKAI: now, of course, he's a household name.
I know I'm not supposed to refer to another voter's comments, but I totally agree with someone who wrote that they saw this film again immediately after their first viewing.
I, after performing The Threepenny Opera, playing in a German Cabaret Duo and spending $100 on KW books had to see this film.
Just after stepping to the podium in the crowded town square, he is hit by an assassin's bullet and almost immediately the crowd is rocked by a bomb.
The most exciting sequence happens when Agent Barnes ends up in a thrilling car chase after one of his own, Agent Kent Taylor(Matthew Fox).
This repetitive nature of the plot gets frustrating after a while.
he risks his life for a little girl who he previously had bumped into and keeps her out of harms way to find her mother after an explosion, these events magnify the events going on in his own life(battle with his wife) and make them actually seem much smaller when he thinks about it...good addition to the movie the whole subplot with the one guys brother being kidnapped has nothing to do with the movie.
That's no way to treat Bertrand Tavernier but compared to Claude Lelouch he probably feels he's being feted; Lelouch's latest, The Human Condition: Part One, Parisiens, has been yanked already after just four weeks, I got there just in time but that's another story.
The story develops as if it were after the incident and the audience is looking through an investigator's point of view as they collect information from witnesses.
Many people left the auditorium after the third time and I couldn't help but close my eyes to avoid watching the rewinding sequences again.
We are never told why all this is happening; why people's allegiances have been changed; why a hero secret service man is "punishing himself" for what he did, (considering we only know he took a bullet for the President, we have to assume he did something after to make it appear that he might step out of the line of fire the second time); or why the orchestrator of it all is seemingly working on his own.
He is pitch perfect with every emotion he is made to elicit after the tragedies that unfold in front of him.
This film stinks of heavy handed hacking after test audience screening.
I can only hint at the angry disappointment I felt after the credits rolled.
It's too bad that after the assassination of the President (William Hurt) shown through the scope of a CNN type cable News broadcast (GNN- instead of a "C" it has a "G." Get it?
This is where the plot holes come roaring in one after another and the overly done clichÃ©s continue.
I loved when the guy from "Lost" turns around after he's carrying the President off the stage and looks at Quaid and says "find that shooter!"
For some inexplicit reason a little girl that Forest Whitaker takes a fond liking to is running through a highway- that for some odd reason isn't closed off during or after such an incredible event.
Another stinker for 2008 for Forest Whitaker to add to the heap of crap after his great performance in "The Last King of Scotland," which seems decades ago.
Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and kloncks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly!
This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.
To illustrate this scene here I will provide makeshift screen captures to get across the immense lunacy of this movie:  http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/8048/image030g.jpg http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/7955/image029a.jpg http://img371.imageshack.us/img371/4836/image028s.jpg http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/1905/image027n.jpg http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/9040/image026k.jpg http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9454/image025ww.jpg http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/1715/image024qk.jpg http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2791/image023ck.jpg http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2702/image031bt.jpg  Shortly after this scene the be-wigged mother is struck down and killed in a hit-and-run accident in which the driver asks the important question of Marcel's brother Barton; "You didn't see anything did ya?"
It is so flat and unsophisticated that it is rather hard to believe that this film was released a year after "The Exorcist".
Apparently Castle failed to learn anything about pacing, camera placement or the handling of actors after working with Roman Polanski on "Rosemary's Baby" (one shudders at the thought that for a brief moment William Castle actually intended to direct "Rosemary's Baby").
He re-animates (after he arranges their deaths) his evil sister and brother-in-law.
Their idyllic tryst is short-lived, however, when a gang of bikers burst in on them to treat a wounded member of their partyÂ   Watching SHANKS (which is the puppeteer's surname, by the way) right after Robert Hartford-Davis' CORRUPTION (1968), I couldn't help but be reminded of that film's analogous last segment (right down to the 'dreamy' coda); here, however, Castle has a trump card up his sleeve when a biker steals one of the doctor's electronic devices and fools around with the zombified 'servants' Â the puppeteer, on the other hand, re-animates the scientist who, together with the servants now back in his control, beat up the gang.
I am a real male but i cry after i watch this movie secondly, i cry, ah!
I, myself as a fan of Shahrukh-Juhi was really disappointed after watching Ram Jaane and I know that many of the other SRK-Juhi fans were let down as well.
And in fact we don't get to see it, we just get it said to Salami Coker (in typical subservient boson role) after he's faced a risible "giant walrus".
Since this film was done 20 years after those other films, I expected Harryhausen's special effects to be far better, to be honest.
Her flight is not as lucky, once arrived, she transforms into a miniature version of herself and is unfortunately discovered by the baboon, who wrecks her plan, only after much difficulty she manages to change back to the seagull and escape, but there is not enough potion left when she turns into herself: She is left with a huge foot of a seagull attached to her leg instead of her human foot, and will stomp her way through the rest of the film.
Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger starts with Captain Sinbad (Patrick Wayne) arriving ashore after a long voyage to see his friend Prince Kassim (Damien Thomas) & his sister Princess Farah (Jane Seymour), however he discovers that Kassim has been transformed into a Baboon by his evil step mother Zenobia (Margaret Whiting) using black magic so her son Rafi (Kurt Christian) can become king.
It was one of those movies local channels threw on Sunday afternoon before or after a televised ball game..or when a ball game was rained out.
However, the pig ran off after they successfully managed to achieve their goal, and had to run into the farms to recapture the pig.
The day after, Young-ju, following a farewell lunch party in a Korean restaurant with the class, (of which Mun-su did not turn up, claiming that he had some personal matters to attend to), happened to meet Mun-su's mom as she entered a hotel, looking for Mun-su.
There's also a romantic subplot -- more of a romantic triangle -- with Candy pining after a guy named Elvis in her English class, who Elvis in turn is trying to go after his Australian English instructor Cathy.
Phil Harris has a hunting dog named Millard Fillmore, named after our 13th American President.
In the fray, only young Nikita (Anne Parillaud) survives, after offing a policeman who had let his guard down at a crucial moment.
It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny.
Neil Simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version (he said that he couldn't improve on the first), and I'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor!
This is director Lee Chang-Dong's first film (of three) and the third that I've seen after his well-made films Peppermint Candy and Oasis.
During his train ride back home after his term in the army has ended, Makdong decides to get some fresh air by hanging his head out of one of the train's open entrances.
Bae is impressed by Makdong's willingness to fight and later in the film, after Makdong clubs one of Bae's men on the head with a wooden post, the former soldier becomes a member of Bae's "family."
Makdong (Han Suk-Kyu) is a naive young man who returns home after his spell in the army full of hopes and (small) ambitions.
Now that he's a man, he wants to make a lot of money and be able to look after his family.
The boss takes a liking to Makdong's simplicity and straightforward character and looks after him well, to the resentment of other members of the gang.
And of course they should live happily after killing their enemies.
But, I being a sci-fi buff of sorts, had to keep wondering, after the lab burns, how many more of those things are out there.
The whole point is monstrous alien chicks on the prowl after all and not great literary work.
The idea's not bad, but after the first chase scene in the streets of Mexico the movie shifts to a series of dimly-lit night sequences which make it hard to even understand what's going on.
The only person who may be able to help her, and explain another creature chasing after Tom, is co-creator of Miranda, Forbes McGuire (Heroes' Dominic Keating).
I thoroughly enjoyed it and think that Helena Mattsson will be a new star after people see her in this.
The plot is good and has a man avenging the death of his family and the other is the son of a genaral and they are both after the same man the notorious "SILVER FOX" hes one of the best fighters around.
It concerns two men, played by Wong Tao and John Liu who are both after Hwang but don't realize it.
Now imagine that after creating this man, God bestow on him an army of stunt-men, a type writer, a movie camera, a hefty special effects budget, and a eighty wardrobes worth of axes, black suits and top hats.
Sing wises up after the beating he endured and I think he should have been more wary of con men, when he was younger.
I twiddled my thumbs through it after having seen Chow's mind-bending visual insights.
I was less than enthusiastic when I tossed it into the drive of my Athlon, but a promise is a promise, after all.
So in KFH we have Chow spoofing the clichÃ©s of Chinese martial arts stories: the retired martial arts couple who become petty scrooge and lecher, the heroes who save the neighbourhood (one of them gay) end up getting dispatched soon after, and the con beggar who sells a wu ling mi ji to a naive boy.
well i was a pretty big fan of G-unit after Get Rich or die trying.
Multi-platinum rapper The Game is in rare form giving the world an inside look at what really went down after leaving his popular "unit" and dropping "300 Bars," including the beginnings of the "G-UNot" movement.
This movie was ridiculous after the rave party It went on and ON CHEAP and predictable Didn't look to bad but the rest of the movie and the killers were played out fast.
Film starts with an intriguing premise: a group of teens is terrorized after a party by a pack of masked Satanic cult members known as the Shadows.
The devil worshippers are a joke compared to the satanic cults in other horror films (and, although they clearly outnumber the heroes, they persist in attacking them one by one), and I hope Patrick Bergin knows that, after a role like this, his career has little hope of reviving.
Both films came and went in a flash, and after seeing both these films, it's hard to believe that could be possible.
I put this in the DVD at 11:30pm after watching the Superbowl and doing the required beer drinking that goes with that.
One frailty after the next, Son, like many of the other characters, is tested on how resilient he really is.
When they turn up to the funeral they confront the four brothers that their father raised after he left his first family behind.
The bittersweet soundtrack complements the mixed imagery, using a simple palate of acoustic guitar and cello to considerable effect and playing again and again in your ears long after the credits roll.
I would not dare reveal the films resolution, only to say that it comes sensibly, after a moment of great realization.
I was'nt even that lucky...a spoof is always more entertaining....Ramu's factory is stagnating...he should try to become creative for a change...all the characters were so stereotype...the lead Randeep Hooda tried to force himself into the shoes of the silent cold angry young man from the slums with an underworld acumen that was played so brilliantly by chkraverthy in Satya ...although this character can be traced back to Amitabh in films like Mukaddar ka Sikandar, Trishul etc but chakraverthy was its RGV version and so a relevant example to quote here....needless to say, Hooda failed miserably.....he would have done well if he had just played himself......Chunkey Pandey was expecting to redo "tezaab" but those days are long over....his character was damn clichÃ©d just like all others in the movie...this is an era of "Hazaro Khwahishein Aisi" when every thing has to be brilliantly and refreshingly "original"...  ..Ramu should have stopped dabbling with underworld themes immediately after "company" which was his last watchable movie and was good off course...its time he realises that movie-making is an art and you have to "think" and "create" the design every time you make a product, instead of doing it once and then letting the assembly line take care for the rest.....probably his engineering background has to do with it..
Thank god it was only 107 minutes and I was counting each one of them after the first 15.
Chunkey Pandey I thought would make a come-back after being re-launched under Varma's banner but, I am sure he will probably go back to where he came from.
I had a lot of expectations from Randeep Hooda after seeing him in "Monsoon Wedding" but he was a big let down with his expressionless face and the monotonously-fake-hoarse-voice.
D is a story of a young aggressive man Deshu who gets into the Underworld and changes the orthodox ways of its operation.He defies the ongoing practices and with his courage he is in the driving seat just after some time he joins the gang.
The movie tells the story how just after World War II, a train carrying 250 million dollars in gold from the German Reichsbank is hijacked by renegade U.S soldiers.
While the story gets a promising start it bogs down a bit after the first 30 minutes, the story gets just too unfocused also the casting could have been better, Sophia Loren is far from convincing and McGoohan is certainly not at his best, if Hough would not have tried to get more audience by starring a lot of big names like Loren and Montague and just have hired other actors who could played the characters more convincingly this could have been a better film.  
Patrick McGoohan makes his entry to the movie a short way in, after a classy prologue explains the plot of the movie itself.
Cassavetes seeks his help in the investigation of a huge Reichs-Gold theft but leaves disappointed, eventually, after watching Macauley enjoying a sampling of the best German wines his new Bultler can find for him, in the cellar of the castle.
he is in his smartest brown American uniform and after his mildly dissolute appearance of yesterday, we glimpse the soldier that so impressed the earnest Cassavetes.
First however Macauley must relax after the tension of his meeting with the cold gunman.
What's interesting is to see the contrast between the Brigid of the '60s/'70s and the Brigid of today (I guess we really do become our parents after all!).
Soon after this show, I bought the DVD version which has about 20 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which are hilarious.
Her cravings of key lime pie is sated only after two whole pies are consumed.
They'll be thinking about it and asking you tough questions long after the popcorn is gone.  
However luckily Hidalgo stood up soon after that.
Though you know a Mustang has to be a rather fast and strong horse because they named a rather good car after it.
One of those masterpieces where Wayne rides full tilt after the stagecoach along a dusty road lined with telephone poles, past parked trucks.
Jay plunges into the ocean and washes up on the beach long after Max has hightailed it with the loot to greater pastures.
Four weeks or thereabouts elapse before Jay recuperates sufficiently to hit the trail after Max, and it takes our determined protagonist around a year to locate the double-crossing dastard.
This movie came on the Western Channel last night after two very good, if not great westerns.
Shortly after the killing George's neurotic mistress Brooke Reynolds (Meryl Streep) turns up at Sam's practice seeking psychiatric help.
I saw this movie as a boy and it lingers after nearly fifty years as a haunting memory.
The very last line of the movie, after all, tells us that Wally will repeat the entire conversation yet again to his girlfriend, of his dinner with Andre.
The play-write....don't know why I keep calling them by these titles, the characters names are their names in real life Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn (who it's nice to see in a serious role after his mad scientist Southland Tales bit)...anyway Shawn mostly listens to Andre who obviously loves attention and hearing himself speak, but later interrogates, contradicts, and adds much needed balance to Andre's new age excesses and paranoia.
Scheider gets drawn into the murder of one of his patients after a visit from a mysterious woman (Streep) who worked with and had an affair with the victim.
Yes, as the story goes, these two old friends caught up much like in the film after Andre's return from an awakening journey of life through Asia and during dinner discussed philosophy, life/death and existentialism.
99% of the movie takes place at a table in the New York restaurant where Wallace Shawn, a playwright, and Andre Gregory, a theatre manager, are having dinner and a near two hour conversation after a long time apart.
He clearly dominates what he has to say to Mr. Shawn because, after being successful in the New York theater world, he decided to give all that up in order to do what he really wanted, to explore the world to its fullest.
What discourse: ''Tell me more'', ''So what happened after that?
Think of it as a brief exposure to a man's psyche (Andre) after he has lived and searched for meaning in his life.
The first 1 hour and 25 minutes are completely pointless, and after that, the movie gets more interesting.
The old gent passed on two years after this film was made, but, man, was he great!
This is either a movie you will turn off after fifteen minutes, or it is a movie you will watch over and over again to pick up all the things you missed in previous screenings.
The latter will find gold in every word, and veins left to be mined time after time.
His destiny twist suddenly when he loose his senses the evening after his own brother wedding, and waking up the morning after in a bad hospital he discovers to be paralyzed from the belly down.
Worse, while he dumped the woman's body back on the train before it left, Mike Bennett (Dale Belding), a kid who likes to get away from his mother and have adventures, saw him Even worse, after Dunlap gets picked up while hitchhiking and realizes he can't leave the area because of the flooding, the friendly driver lets him off at the only place to stay in town, a boarding house.
It came after his breakthrough film IF, and before the films most people recall he starred in: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and O LUCKY MAN.
I actually got Animal Instincts thinking it was a drama, and I almost deleted it after seeing a few scenes of ugly prostitutes in a sleazy night club.
Then to our surprise, after what seemed like months of neglect, without a word Dave finally has sex with Joanna.
Then, after a passionate argument and a teary eyed moment where the two lovers kiss and make-up, finally we would enjoy a prolonged and intimate love scene.
This movie challenges our apathy and screams at us to get off of the couch (after the movie is done, of course) and raise a little hell!
I never read about it before, but after watching it yesterday night with a friend, i couldn't stop thinking about the whole plot, the ending, the dialogs, all the words and actions in the movie.
because Hans Weingartner is a consummate and devilishly clever storyteller and after the first few sequences you will forget where you are, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen!
If you're liberal after 30, you have no brain."
These are young revolutionaries after the fact.
Just don't get too caught up in the way the story arc progresses, or you'll wind up going loop-de-loop well after it's over.
For me, the best part of the film was watching the relationships build between all 4 of the main characters, both before and after the kidnapping.
I have to issue a few words of warning first:  Don't see this movie after you have just enjoyed a really good Hollywood-production (as I did).
Everything takes place when 'Frank Nolan' (Jack Coleman) and 'Fay Perovnic' (Lindsay Frost) find themselves in a strange cafÃ© after dying on the same night and in the same river as each other.
My biggest fear throughout was that at any moment the next scene would see Sam (sean Penn) and Rita the lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) deciding that the best solution to their problems would be if the both united in a marriage / pseudo-marriage, so they could lay happy families and all live happily ever after, blah balh blah ad nauseum.
The movie starts out in good speed but slows down after a while.
It would be nice if things worked out as they have in this movie, which is why I liked this movie is because movies are aloud to be unrealistic and it's nice to leave the theater or turn of the DVD off after watching the film and feel good (that is if you're not so critical about movies).
`Different' is probably the word that will spring to mind after a viewing of Inner Sanctum.
So he is high functioning enough to do all that, but he can't make a drink at Starbucks after many years there?
After he accidentally has a daughter (Dakota Fanning) with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.
And after watching, you won't want to ever give the DVD back to Blockbuster.
I know that title isn't very descriptive, but all I could say for awhile after watching I Am Sam was, "Wow!"
A Truly wonderful film that left you thinking and feeling for hours after walking out of the cinema.
I question the authenticity of the film's ending, where the film maker presents that 1 week after filming Pla was dead.
I suspect that after annoying the poor girl, she most likely was avoiding him and was thus unavailable for more footage.
Viewers be aware that Pla, the girl in the film, was KILLED after the film was made.
(Spells disaster, just as much prostitution as anywhere else) So what happens after this well meaning young man has left?
The feeling I had after seeing this DVD was that the MAN himself is the style, his music is not a style but a lifestyle.
When we know the author of the original stories is white, the film shows perfectly well how the American society, after slavery and after Â up to the 1850s Â banning the Blacks from all training into reading and writing, from all speaking their original languages and even from all affiliation to any religion, rushes head first into over-Christianizing the Blacks with no cautious slowing down and with all calculated speeding up they could master after the Secession War, both south and north, though for different reasons.
But the real interest is the large presence of Negro spirituals in the film, one of the very first films entirely centered on Black music, though in 1936 we must not forget we are after Â and within Â the triumph of the radio that enabled Black music and jazz to find a wide audience, to embed its existence and force into the widest Black and white audience it had ever had, just as it enabled F. D. Roosevelt to dominate the political arena for twelve years or so.
Volumes were spoken of the Archangel Gabriel, after the Lord had done his work: "Dy'a want a cigar, Lawd?"
Among the females, Edna Mae Harris makes an impression in her brief role of Zeba who, after her boyfriend gets shot, takes a shine to the one who shot him!
We follow Harold Dunlap, a man that decides to stay at a boarding house after killing a woman at a near-by station.
"De Lawd" creates man and woman, but is soon displeased with the way the human race is carrying on, flooding the world after making a pact with poor preacher Noah.
Soon after, with the law hot on his heels, the outlaw and the widow throw in their lot together and head for the hills, where an eventual confrontation between the outlaw and the bailiff ends in death.
The cast is great as almost the entire cast became well known to American audiences after this was made.
The zenith; however, of ridiculous scenes is when Patton and family, after having just covered up what appear to be two lovebirds, see the cage rock back and forth and the birds spontaneously combust.
The story is set five years after the events of part one and now the Walsh family have moved into the house from part one and the son of the family Jesse begins to have the nightmares that Nancy from the previous installment was having.
Actually, after watching this one for many years I have come to rather enjoy it.
who starts to have nightmares about Freddy Krueger after moving into Nancy's old place.
The movie takes place five years after the events of the first film.
The story supposedly takes place 5 years after the initial Elm Street events and the house where Nancy lived has been sold to the Walsh family.
He is an old pedophile and after having recaptured some existence through the dream of a girl in the first film, and having thus gotten a couple of boys in his bag through the desire of the girl for these boys, now he moves directly to the main target of his desire : he wants to possess a boy from inside, he is a gay pedophile and Jesse, to defend his sanity in this invasion, will have to react against this gayness that is imposed onto him and kill the boys and men Freddy desires.
All this and after Jesse's girlfriend comes up to his room and says, "I thought I'd help you unpack."
As has been mentioned by other people, I think Freddy developed too much of a personality after this film, dispatching victims with comedic one-liners and more stylised, effects based death sequences.
There's also some nice camera work in there to, the shot that follows Jesse as he arrives at school the morning after the murder of the coach is good.
Plot = 5 years after the events of the first movie, a new teen and his family move into the same house where the events occurred and before long Jesse starts getting haunted by Freddy but this time Freddy wants something else other than blood.
I've rated this movie before and gave it a five and a pretty bad review but after viewing this movie a few more times I actually quite enjoyed it, OK it's not the best in the franchise, but it's still good and that's why I deleted my old review and started afresh.
Nasarudin Shah is a legend.I always expect these kind of performances from him & i always get such great returns seeing his movies.Juhi has made a great comeback after a very long time.Awesome performances too from Nagesh himself(the director) & Jackie Shroff.Gulshan Grover has too given a terrific performance.Such calmness in his acting in this movie that its so refreshing.
I was so much surprised after watching this movie and my mind still can't let go of the wonderful movie.
I liked the scene where after having intercourse with chandrika he says: `If only you were a little more attractive, I wouldn't have so much trouble'!!
With some senator, who is going to win presidential elections, but was "missing" after the battle?
Will he survive it and lead his nation after the war?
But it gets tiresome after awhile, though it does remain quite visible, so you can fast-forward without fear of missing anything.
My attitude changed drastically after the storm swept them back to December6,1941!
A cheesy after school thriller special that is meant to be laughed at.
Imagine if the day after President Jack Kennedy was supposed to have been assassinated, on November 23, 1963 when Captain Morrison took command of the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier it was really a still alive President Jack Kennedy.
This movie deals with time-travel on a large scale... And like most sci-fi films, it is easy to pick their theories apart (especially after almost 25 years).
5) An "evil-looking" *snicker* black Dodge Charger careening around the desert after Joanna Cassidy's school bus.
I know my sons were so effected by "Animal" because we talked about 20 minutes after the movie ended about the Willie Lynch letter and the boys asked questions and I answered as best I could.
Great to see Jim brown after so long and I really liked his portrayal of Berwell.
When James returns after becoming enlightened by an old black revolutionary, he attempts to instill his new beliefs in his son.
The conflict between Rhames and Howard relates to the way many African-Americans perceive themselves and their places in society after centuries of slavery/oppression.
But shortly after she arrives to take a job as a bus driver for the local school, a stranger in a black Dodge Charger begins to kidnap, rape and eventually begins to kill a number of the young schoolgirls.
While in jail for years he continues his violent ways, at the same time his son takes after his old man and becomes known as "Little Animal".
He becomes a pleasant, and is actually a warm person after all who just needed the right people to bring out the goodness in him.
I'm thinking that most people can relate to at least one of the characters in the movie and even though it is similar to an after school special, it's so much better than that due to the acting of both Richard Pryor and Cicely Tyson.
There were some scenes that I could have done without, particularly in the last 30 minutes of the movie, but overall I could watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon, before Goonies and after The Toy.
The worst part was after the long chase near end where the 'Evil black Dodge' takes a nose dive off a cliff to its death.
I had never heard of the Dogme film series until after seeing this movie.
The plot, such as it is, says a lot:  Slice of Lowlife: Loser graduates from blow up sex dolls to sleeping corpses after he takes a job with a degenerate mortician.
Several images will stay in your head long after the closing credits.
But finally, after going to a second-hand video shop and asking them to use their internet search engine, they found a copy of this film, the genuine article, for me.
Joanna Cassidy is brilliant in her role as divorced bus driver Laura, trying to raise her daughter in Arizona, and eventually having to save her from the unseen child molester after she is kidnapped.
2 things came to my mind after watching the film: 1.the saying that one is destined\doomed to repeat his\her history if it's not properly remembered 2.
When the first clues were given I thought: "well, I've seen this beforeÂ it's another "scary movie" with a predictable endÂ" And in a certain way it is, because the main topic of the plot it's very predictable and the viewer who pays a little attention to some details soon will understand that something strange happened in the past with these guysÂ But when the plot is being reveled, it doesn't give you all the complete answersÂ There are some little details that remain unclear even after the movie ends, and I appreciate this I must say!
Simon's character may have been changed from a plump prostitute to a petite laundress (this was the 1940s, after all), but the first half, based on the story that inspired Stagecoach, is still a remarkably effective adaptation that segues comfortably into the second story, linking them both by a battle of wills with the titular bored Prussian officer who wants the population to submit to his whims purely as a mark of obsequiousness.
That rating will most likely go up after a repeat viewing now that I know what to expect.
Obviously, the truth about GTO is unknown, as he invents one outlandish story after another, but likewise nothing is known about anyone else.
Though I am not from that generation, being born ten years after the film was made, I was able to get a picture of the underlying political and social atmosphere of that time in American History.
The abrupt ending is a bit disconcerting but after a few viewings it makes more sense.
Thank God she did "Naked Weapon" right after this and turned into an international action star.
All kidding aside he's a good actor but after a few crappy parts like this its understandable that his name often elicits a "who?'
I'd say it's one of her better movies she's starred in after My So Called Life, and worth buying just for her alone.
Of the seven primary characters in Gillian, only three really matter: David (Peter Gallagher), a man who, after two years, still isn't over the death of his wife Gillian (Michelle Pfieffer); Rachel (Clare Danes), his daughter, whose relationship with her father isn't too estranged; and Esther (Kathy Baker), David's sister-in-law, who's determined to remove Rachel from David's care for fear it is unhealthy for the girl.
We never find out and after a night during which Rachel goes to bed drunk and has a nightmare featuring Gillian, the conflict is resolved when Rachel decides to go live with Esther and Paul and "let her mother be dead,".
Since Gillian does contain a good cast with a notable performance from Danes, I gave it four out of ten stars but the talents of these people are ultimately lost in this poorly written melodrama that might elicit some tears and sighs from the audience, but is mostly a film about a rivalry between in-laws that is devoid of the compassion usually felt after the death of a loved one.
Many people have losses that are very hard to deal with, and they must "Let-Go" on their own time and in their own way after processing.
Wow.... Kristen Bell as Gracie plays a superb role in this movie trying to look after her 1 half sister and 3 half brothers.
They all live happily ever after.
The story is very strong and credible up until the end and after seeing it I felt somewhat cheated.
I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews.
There are quite a few chuckles and some real laugh-out-loud jokes but primarily this is one sight gag after another.
Personally I found it insulting to watch and soon after they arrived at the death camp I had to turn it off.
The German government should sue and get whatever money it can from the producers for beating this dead horse long after it's expired.
This is your typical laugh a minute family day in at the movies, and whichever side you cheer for, you are always guaranteed to end up stroking that funny bone until well after your sides ache.
Haunting to watch knowing that she died soon after.
I found after I watched this movie I was just speechless!
I watched this movie in my English class after reading the book "Night".
The budgets on Flynn's pictures dropped dramatically after "The Adventures of Don Juan."
Errol Flynn is back in swashbuckling costume eight years after the excellent "The Sea Hawk", and it feels like he never went away.
The Adventures Of Don Juan finds Tirso De Molina's famous lover sent home after a couple of escapades in the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain.
In the end of the Seventeenth Century, Don Juan de Marana (Errol Flynn) is repatriated from London to Madrid after a serious diplomatic scandal caused by his affair with a British fiancÃ©e on the Eve of her marriage with a Spanish noble.
Don Juan, wisely, persuades the Queen that her duties lies with her people, and after kissing her, he says: "I shall be the only one who knew that for a little while there was no Queen."
Alan Hale is once again Flynn's faithful sidekick but after 12 movies this was to be their final picture together.
The unexpected fact will be that the prisoner's daughter, after her long prayers to God, will decide to replace the real flower Narcissus near her father's window by a similar paper flower that will, naturally, never faint.
The only other movie she made after this one was called "12 + 1" in which she also had a major role.
I always thought Dean after seeing this film felt he couldn't do the role anymore.
I only tonight discovered in an IMDb mini bio that he was so distraught after Sharon Tate's death he refused to do the role any longer.
While he conquers one woman after another, he also manages to rescue a few tons of gold from the grip of the above mentioned villain (the later is usually considered to be the main plot - what a preposterous notion).
When the editor's wife telephones for help, after her house catches on fire, everyone thinks it's an April fool joke.
The movie made very little sense even after the explanation which was at the very end.
Instead, we get scene after poorly acted scene of the women freaking out about their ordeal, being interviewed with electrodes on their temples, undergoing various torturous experiments that are neither scary nor particularly intricate, and being stalked by a robed figure that the producers aped from Hostel.
Sweepers however was a huge letdown, it starts brightly enough the whole opening scenes on the minefield are pretty cool and after the 'Roadhouse' style bar-fight scenes i thought i was in for a good time...then it all goes wrong.
For most of the movie Dolph sits around and drinks but after about an hour he finally gets down to some action.
It has way too many quiet, somber tone-setting scenes that are obviously there to eat up time and delay narrative obligations, but after an hour they just kill the momentum.
The first of them, a man, strips naked and walks off into the unending snow fields, after muttering about "something out there" and positing some kind of sour gas (hydrogen sulfide) seeping out of the ground.
And I'm still thinking about it a few hours after watching it, which is - to me - always a good thing.
Most people cannot wait to see The Lost Princess again after the first viewing!
as part of their personal repertoire after viewing the film!
Meanwhile, Rupert lures Rudolf to a rendezvous after midnight at a deserted summer house behind the wall on the Boulevard Elphberg with Antoinette de Mauban (Mary Astor of "The Kennel Murder Case") to learn the whereabouts of the King.
Antoinette's servant arrives and explains that he will lower the drawbridge after midnight.
The surprise here is that he manages to escape after he kills Michael.
Due to my obvious enthusiasm in class, I received a high final score of 98 out of 100 points after battling some tough opponents for two years in the fencing class.
The film makes the big sword-fight a duel between Rupert and *Rudolf Rassendyll*, rather than between Rupert and *Michael* - which is understandable in box-office terms, but sadly means we lose *another* terrifically dramatic scene: Antoinette, in her bloodstained nightdress, going after Rupert with a pistol.
He reluctantly agrees but it is for a lot more than he expects after the king-to-be is kidnapped and he must remain king for the foreseeable future!
I like Coleman and Carroll in their leading roles as well as C A. Smith and Niven as the co conspirators   Raymond Massey looks like he is uncomfortable with his lines and would rather be doing Hamlet Nevertheless this is the best version and it still has legs and looks more Gothic than the MGM Vehicle which is saturated in colors and may cause headaches after the first reel  C Pope
Everyone recognizes her as Hannah (her ancestor she was named after).
She wakes up in a surreal "wizard of Oz like" setting where she is awaken after an apparent illness.
With such an outstanding, marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some, it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937; so successful, in fact, that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick.
The one that really bothered me is when Salma Hyak is moving out after the wedding fiasco.
Story is about a couple that have been dating for a few years but decide that they should break up and after spending some time apart it doesn't take long before they start calling each other and getting together for great sex.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  One day Steve shows up at Monica's work and tells her that they should get married and after mulling about it for a short time she accepts.
You will see why he was robbed of the Best Actor Oscar last year for the Insider after viewing.
*spoiler end*   I just love Russel Crowe after I watched Gladiator.
You just might want to take a trip to the Emerald Isle after watching it.
There, in time, and only after the family decides to move back to Roan Inish, the child is found, mysteriously cared for the seals.
In the literature book that I use there is a story called Sealskin, Soulskin, which is an Eskimo story about the selkies and so after we read that story we watch "The Secret of Roan Inish".
This movie celebrates that gift and passion with story after story told within the frame of the film's story.
The main heroine is a young girl who leaves to go live with her grandparents after her mother's death.
Now directly across the water from their beloved island, Fiona's grandparents take her in after her city-living father can no longer care for her.
He by the way is a serious playwright and i remember seeing him say on the later show (1:35 am after conan on nbc) that the only reason he does films like this is to have financing for his plays.
Finally after a long year of waiting i got to see this movie.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
A young teenage student, Gorgeous, rebels against her widower father after he informs her of his future plans to wed a new love in his life.
Over the night, the girls discover that wheel-chair bound Auntie is actually a ghost awaiting her lover to return home after heading off to war.
This after the one girl has become distraught and confused as to what to do or say to her composer father ("So good Leone thought I was better than Morricone" haha line), and there is not much else to do one guesses that to go off to an Auntie's house.
Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
It occurred to me a day after I watched this movie that I had seen a film by Nobuhiko Obayashi before, the campy kaleidoscopic "Sada"(a true story about a woman who castrated her lover and became an overnight celebrity in WW2), and though that is a mere hint of the full on onslaught of this movie, it makes me want to see more.
The experience eventually ends, rather solemnly I must say, although after at least 20 minutes of non-stop psychotropic hallucinogenia, it acts as a welcome buffer zone as you gravitate back into reality.
I had never heard of Nobuhiko Obayashi before (the director) and in looking at his list of films I've never heard of any of them either...I confess that after seeing "Hausu" I'm interested in finding more by him & hope it's as entertaining as this.
As I recently prepared to watch the film for the first time as an adult, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't stand up to the high acclaim I had awarded it as a kid...particularly after noting the poor rating it has here on IMDb.
Being from Pittsburgh, Terry Bradshaw's involvement fueled his fan support as this was made after he won his fourth Super Bowl.
Soon after, a car passes them going the opposite direction and therefore also driving in the left lane.
The Cannonball Run was Fawcett's first major successful film after leaving Charlie's Angels in 1977.
The music is actually pretty good too and... after purchasing the Special Edition, I have to say... the English Dub is horrible.
Don't switch off when the end credits start as after the credits for each episode there is a short "Tachikomatic Days" story, a little comedy sketch featuring the Tachikoma.
Just a couple of things I thought were worth mentioning after reading the other comments.
It's not her real body after all.
Finally: If you don't fall in love with Marguerite Moreau after seeing this film, you're made of stone.
There are some issues of how Sanjay Dutt really managed to kill all those people but I'm content ignoring that... it is a Bollywood movie after all.
It was after a long time that I saw a good hindi action film.
And so after 26 episodes, the series ended.
You'll end up looking over your shoulder after seeing this film.
At the time I was disappointed that the series ended after so few episodes.
i've seen them all Live in Melbourne, didn;t see the original Pirates though saw the one they did for the Anniversary in January 2003 i got to Meet Jon English, Gerry Connolly, David Gould, Sheila Bradley& Carmell Parentel and they signed my Program Guide i meet them at the Stage Door :) they were extremely nice and happy to sign the Program for e i meet the Conductor Kevin Hocking after the Hms Penifor and he signed the hms book for me i loved what he did to Jon English in Pirates made him do a song about 4 times ;)   i like the Singletts their so good :)   i wrote to Simon Gallaher and he sent me a signed Photo :)  has anyone seen the one with Anthony Warlow i just saw it on Abc TV in Australia
I have only just managed to get a new copy of this production after having worn the old video out.....lol.
There is a part in the middle of the film that centers on Elliot's character feeling old and, after attending a 15 year high school reunion, trying to get a job selling cars.
It's a terrific piece of work, ringing true in scene after scene.
I first saw this movie about five years after a miserable divorce.
Hey she did sit in Cosmo's lap after all sounds chummy enough to me.
The madcap escapades begin there and never end as the ghost leads poor compliant dullish but dutyful friend Topper on one adventure after another following up leads to her murder till the murderer is exposed.
The casting is frankly well.Thus is a gorgeous Carole Landis who unfortunately committed suicide with twenty nine years old after a romance with Rex Harrison.Joan Blondell is a likable ghost,she was a great comedian actress with much success and long career.
They don't recall seeing any stars and think that they visited after the days shooting was completed.
This was the last camping done until after WW 2 since Pearl Harbor was attacked in Decemeber of that year.
If it wasn't haunted before it sure gets haunted after Blondell is murdered by mistake because the killer is after Landis.
This was the third of a 3-film series, coming after TOPPER (1937) and TOPPER TAKES A TRIP (1939).
Sexy, wise-cracking Joan Blondell, who has accompanied her best friend back to her stately home to meet her father after many, many years, mysteriously is knifed after having traded rooms with Carole Landis - the intended victim.
Praise must be lavished on the script, co-written by murder-mystery novelist Jonathan Latimer (who also wrote some of the better Peter Falk Columbo episodes in the 1970s) and on the playing of Young, Burke and Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, who steal the film from headliners Carole Landis and Joan Blondell -- it is Topper's film after all.
This film is a Gothic,atmospheric melodrama about Caroline played by a young Jean Simmons as a 16/17-year-old who goes to live with her uncle Silas (Derrick de Marney)after her father dies.
When I read the description of "Uncle Silas," I thought it sounded suspiciously like "The Inheritance" - after all, did Jean Simmons go around playing one young heir after another?
"Uncle Silas" is the story of a young heiress, Caroline Ruthyn (Simmons) who is sent to live with her uncle (Derrick De Marney) in a dark, eerie mansion after her father's death.
It's a wonderful, creepy little film about a young woman, Caroline (lovely Jean Simmons), who goes to live with her scheming old Uncle Silas in his big, gloomy mansion after her father dies.
This little known film disappeared into obscurity and without much comment after its release in 1947.
I was not disappointed when the sequence that had so fascinated me as an impressionable adolescent, where the evil governess embarks with her young charge on a journey of deception, emerged as powerfully as ever after a gap of so many years.
A good movie on paper does not necessary result in a good movie on screen Â is the big, loud and clear message one gets after seeing this crap.
Wasn't the impression given to us that the movie was based soon after independence Â when India became a Democracy?
From earlier days, and continuing today, two of the cornerstone attractions in the Branson area are Silver Dollar City theme park (modeled after an 1880's silver mining complex, but with 21st-century New York City or Hollywood pricing) and The Shepherd of the Hills farm, the original cabin, the large outdoor amphitheater which presents a lavish production of the story, a restaurant, gift shop, etc.
Where Eklavya loses its 2 stars is the slightly sloppy screenplay after the interval and the okie-dokie romance angle between Harshwardan (Saif Ali Khan, intensely controlled) and Rajjo (Vidya Balan, eye candy).
Vidya Balan returned after Pareenita with Vidhu.
Bollywood has been churning up some impressive films recently,and improving the quality of their films.But they have yet to learn to master the art of film-making.Their films are not yet perfect or great; they still have a long way to go.But after having seen this film,I'm glad to say that they are getting close.Bollywood has the potential to make great movies and they are trying and improving and almost getting there.But they still fall short of spectacular results.
The story revolves around a family,that is hiding secrets that once revealed,might have deadly consequences upon them.It is inspired by some of Shakespeare's works and it echoes throughout the film.It's about one aging guard(Bachchan),named Eklavya; who has served for the family all his life.Many generations of his family has served before him and he must continue to do so,carry on their legacy.The family of the Kindom of Devigarh itself has mysteries that keeps echoing throughout the film.Eklavya has sworn to protect the family no matter what.He also protects some of the secrets that can never be spread throughout the Kindom.Until,one night,the Queen of the Kindom dies,besides her is her mourning husband.This starts the doubts and accusations within the family.The Queen's Son,Prince Harshwardhan(Khan) arrives to take responsibility of the family.But there are other things going on in the palace.Slowly,one mystery after another pops up and secrets are revealed,and as the story progresses we see more and more people dying because of the secrets.Putting Eklavya into a painful position and come to terms with the happenings and the truths about this family's dark history.
First half or so into the movie,you are hooked and quite entertained,but after the interval,the film slowly drags,since the plot becomes weak and it's going in one direction; so there isn't much to tell.Subplots are added to compensate the running time.In other words,it could've trimmed a little more of the length and finished it quickly.That would've made the film perfect.But it gets boring as it drags the story and adds subplot and makes the whole of second half contrived.But the third act,which is the big revelation of who is behind the whole scenario,somewhat pays off with satisfaction.
However,what really keeps this film afloat is the acting.Each and every actor deserves equal recognition.They all have a part to play and they all help in move the story forward.You can't just give out all the praises to Bachchan alone.He was terrific,but the other actors allowed him to emote the character well.But,of course,Mr.Bachchan's performance is the strength of the film.His silence and his eyes says more than his words.I've never liked this actor and thought he was yet another over-hyped Bollywood actor,like any other.But after watching him in this,I understand why people worship him.But I still thought he could've done a little better.Saif Ali Khan was quite competent and gives a good supporting performance,but his character doesn't allows him to do much.This guy has the looks and moves of a good actor.Sanjay Dutt was just great in his small part.Booman Irani's character was flawed as well,and his acting sometimes goes from over the top to annoying.But if that's what his character was supposed to be,than he succeeds.He manages to make his character dark enough to be impressed.Jackie Shroff , Jimmy Shergil as well as the beautiful Vidya Balan have little to do and wouldn't really comment on them.
He especially makes a big fan of Betty Field who's a hankerin' after the Duke.
'Eklavya' is proof, as if 'Black' wasn't a slap-in-the-face Amitabh is just getting warmed up after three decades example, that he is indeed a legend.
The relationships are unearthed in true Vidhu Chopra style during the next few frames as we look at one ugly facet after another of this royal bunch.
The movie is a must watch as after a long long time Vidhu Vinad Chopra directs this film and looks like a typical Chopra film.
In reality this film should be considered one of the best in the career of Harry Carey Sr. A leading movie cowboy actor in the silent period and early sound years, Carey had slowly moved into character parts after 1933.
Jackie Shroff makes a comeback to commercial cinema after quite a while.
Now for the Vinot Chopra regulars - After a good performance in the disappointing salaam namaste, saif has been cranking out great performance after performance ( being cyrus, omkara) and Eklavya is no different.
Running length is small but it was better that way because it's like a story telling film that starts to get boring after 2 hours but it was 1 hour 40 minutes, which was better.
VV Chopra takes on the director's baton after 7 years and unleashes a treat for your senses... your visual senses in particular.
Stunning cinematography is the highest point of the film after Chopra's direction of course.
Soon after, Dronacharya is taken aback by Eklavya's proficiency, which has outstripped that of his princely pupils.
Some of the scenes are exceptional; when Daniel Howitt is cashing a never seen before cheque, when Granny Becky has her eyes uncovered after an operation, when Young Matt talks about how love is so complicated, when Daniel Howitt takes possession of the old house in Moaning Meadow, when Aunt Mollie cremates her dead son and herself, when Pete the mute brother is discovered in a stream of light pouring through a window trying to catch dust motes.
Betty Field at maybe her best performance at movies pictures; John Wayne at his first film in color after the grandiose The Stagecoach; Harry Carey in the Priest; Beulah Bondi at one of her characteristic works playing an embittered woman; the very used by master John Ford, War Bond.
I can't remember it from the book, but the literary device they used to show us what happened in the past was effective as a literary device, but it also created a situation that was more than just trauma, it was full-blown PTSD and I don't think that she should have be allowed to go into fires after her performance on the test.
While doing research, she comes across the tale of the Candyman, an African-American artist who had his arm sawed off, and was attacked by a swarm of bees hundreds of years ago after having an affair with a white woman.
Helen becomes obsessed by the legend of the Candyman (Tony Todd), a son of slaves whose father became rich in 1890 after inventing a device for mass producing of shoes.
The Candyman takes his revenge, he feels obliged to come, after all she has caused much doubt about his actual existence.
Some parts of the film are definitely dated, like the zombies with Afro Haircuts (which quickly fell out of fashion after this film.
The last man on Earth wasn't exactly alone, after all...
And after a long day of this, it's home--not for a Miller beer, but to hide out in his amazing fortress home.
This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city.
We see him, apparently in 1977, two years after the plague had hit-in Spring, 1975(an old wall calendar and Easter greetings reveal this.
The film has a tremendous Ron Grainer opening score, and positively drips everything 70's-fashions, expressions,cars and including nods to blaxploitation films of the time and managing to portray Heston's Neville as "The Man...on his own"  It became a seemingly terribly dated film after the Cold War ended in 1989, (kind of like The Day After became of it's time) and many people chortled at the idea of a biological war.
Parts were just silly: vampire women disrobed to lure Neville outside after dark; the head vampire resembled Oliver Hardy.
The fight-sequences in the movie are interesting, but after a while it does tend to be a bit tedious to watch, and at times fast-forwarding is probably a good idea to keep interest.
It's disturbing indeed to note the subliminal message of the inter-racial love affair -- the nice white man is happy to take care of the black woman and her children, but only after the assertive black man is dead.
Shapeshifter is one of those awful horror films where nothing works, it's one of those films where after the first twenty odd minutes you just sit there waiting & hoping it will finish.
Overall, after the crummy start, I thought this evolved into a fairly entertaining monster flick by the midway point.
The sloppy production quality was distracting too: non-wet coat after coming in from a downpour, children who sleep through screaming arguments, bad hair-aging on Kinnear, and ... was that water in the beer bottles?
Black looks after White in the dangerous Treasure Town, stealing to keep them both alive and eventually escape.
Good actors after a bad script and worthless story.
Now, twelve years after their marriage, Tom and Beth are divorcing.
It was a Friday evening and after a long working week, I threw myself on the lounge with my wife and switched on the television for some brain numbing trashy entertainment.
With "Dinner with friends", the married life analysis goes on and this time, it's about the time effect: after years, children, does love is still there or is-it extinguished and we must start it all over again?
The movie unravels the friendships by exposing that neither Quaid or MacDowell like Kinnear and Collette very much,individually, after their secrets and lies are exposed.
Then there are marriages I know of that falter after like thirty years because there was just was nothing left.
I know it's one of those silliest things a person can do after watching a movie but then when I saw the final credit, it's a made-for-TV movie from HBO.
Tom and Beth are no different from any other couple who eventually drift apart after years of marriage, but the real focus here is Gabe and Karen's hand in their inevitable parting.
Anyway, the plot is a convoluted mix of The Nibelungen (its Teutonic visuals), William Tell (the protagonists' prowess with weapons), Macbeth (the doom-laden prophecies of a soothsayer in the forest) and even Tarzan (the son of a slain king, abandoned in the woods as a child, is eventually raised by lions and reappears after many years donning a loincloth!)
Found this film quite unbelievable because of the fact that so many men seemed to be attracted to Greer Garson,(Irene Forsyte) first met a very rich man named Soames Forsyte, (Errol Flynn) and Soames falls immediately in love with Irene and he keeps asking Irene to marry him and after many years of trying, Irene decided to say yes to marriage, however, she told him she does not love him.
He rarely gave Flynn a non-adventure part after 1940.
The murder mystery FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK, the all star romp THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS, and the interesting French war drama UNCERTAIN GLORY were exceptions   I suspect this treatment began to bug Flynn after the rape case in 1944, when Warner's was determined (for damage control) to try to retain Flynn's hero image at all costs, and to make his sexuality a type of joke.
In some ways this is very, very unconvincing--after all, Irene is nice and the idea of her stealing her niece's beau is a bit hard to swallow.
Flynn tries hard, but lacks a bit of the vocal power he developed soon after this film as released; nevertheless he is more-than-adequate and intelligent in his role.
This film made right after the time of his famous sex trial reveals another side of a talented actor.
I was very much looking forward to seeing how Sharpe got on after 10 years, but it seemed at times like being reacquainted with an old friend I've lost contact with and we both seem to have changed.
How Sharpe after one beating after another managed to shrug it off when my back puts me out is another stretch of believability.
And historically, there WERE no major uprisings in India after the Napoleonic war, so any historical accuracy is out the window.
Equally as ridiculous is the idea that the french would help Sharpe not 3 years after Waterloo.
I am so glad they succeeded in merging the first three books into one movies and make it believable that everything takes place after Waterloo.
Inevitable, of course, after the way things played out in Sharpe's Waterloo.
And a special debt of thanks is due to Sean Bean for not outgrowing his britches, after a little Hollywood success, and coming back into the role of Sharpe with such energy and commitment.
the french having honour i would never have thought it after the first lot.man singing at the end was so cool it brought so many memoires from the last episode when they were at waterloo.long live sharpe the french couldn't kill neither will any one else.
Bernard Cornwell, realizing he was sitting on a gold mine, has milked Sharpe's adventures, adding battles before, after, and in between those of the original set of books.
Combining Bernard Cornwell's original three books set in India into one Sharpe film, and resetting it after the battle of Waterloo has done nothing to detract from the enjoyment I had from the latest adventures of Richard Sharpe.
Sean Bean returned to the role of Richard Sharpe, after a nine year absence from the small screen, this weekend on ITV1 in the two-part story "Sharpe's Challenge".
Sharpe's opposition on this occasion is a rogue East India Company officer, Colonel William Dodd, played by Toby Stephens, able to put his fencing skills to good use again after his appearance as the villain Gustav Graves in the James Bond movie "Die Another Day"!
Watching the "Behind the Scenes" documentary after the concluding episode, on ITV3, it's a wonder the programme ever got made!
If you missed it, and want to find out whether or not Harper survives, after all Sharpe is a good shot, the best, then the DVD is out at the beginning of May!
Of course, there was always a rumour that 'Tiger' would be made into a feature film but that hope died after a few years.
It would have been a likely series, but it resolved tidily after 10 episodes.
The guy who became the profit and the black lady who was after him... that story line just stopped abruptly 3.
It is the city itself that rules the film, and these passionate animators do not disappoint when it comes to delivering scene after scene showcasing an unfathomable detail rendered in these massive, severely inspired cityscapes.
I expected higher profile roles for him after SFU died, and when I saw he signed on for Lost Room, I was disappointed.
Last year, the festival scored a coup in having Paprika screened just after its Japan premiere I believe, and had the noir styled Renaissance screened too.
The best testimony to the film's success as a crowd pleaser was its reception on a Saturday night, several weeks after the movie's release (mid-November), in a North Carolina theater.
A furiously intense story that takes place shortly after the Cold War where an American colonel (Roy Scheider - "Jaws") who has a troubled past, picks a fight with a high-ranking Soviet military officer, (Jurgen Prochnow - "Das Boot") that nearly escelates into a Tarantino-like standoff.
It lasts forever, as one car after another drives into the wreck.
The car pileup was sickening, and the young kids help out Linda after Coy's friend was killed.
A year after Death Race 2000, Bartel and Carradine team up again here, probably just cashing in on the cult status of their pedestrian chewing masterpiece.
The fact that the cars in this film tend to explode after colliding with something moving at two miles an hour tells you what kind of mindset you need to watch this.
It gets off to a good start with cars plowing into each other followed by explosion after explosion.
Austin refuses, even after they trot the Six Million Dollar Woman back onto the scene.
But the excitement factor was better when Steve landed on the car giving Jamie a chance to escape, while Steve flipped the car, and the car took off after being flipped.
The peak comedy scene in cemetery is really better than many comedy movie, and the last scene showing the changed world after years are really tragedy, or black comedy.
And after watching a documentary on Hank, I can say that this captures the work of the true man inside, not the reputation that he developed as a womanizer during one stage of his life.
Despite good reviews upon its release, winning several awards and getting support by Hollywood heavyweights Sean Penn and Francis For Coppola, the film vanished into obscurity almost immediately after its release.
Some of the characters are interesting enough to provide the opportunity for good acting, but what remains in the memory after the film is mostly the music, dances, environment.
And I have to say, I'm getting tired of people giving negative comments on a movie from a foreign country, about which they know nothing, after seeing a badly dubbed version..
Steve not only sets the record for longest time in the tank without cracking, but even after this horrible ordeal he has the energy to kick butt!
And unlike the resulting series, Jack Lord's McGarrett handles the bulk of the action here, shooting bad guys, infiltrating Wo Fat's hideout and even engaging in vigorous fisticuffs after more than eight hours of torture.
Fei-Hung was not one of the 10 Tigers, he was known as "the Tiger after 10".
But after the head officer of the Ching Army is killed, years later his son and sworn brother plot to kill off the students of the famous Ten Tigers.
I quickly grew bored at the beginning of the film when it seemed as if it was going to be nothing more than one blood bath after the other, although I did think some of Izo's enemies were quite creative.
How many more bodily fluids can he drown his films in, after the taboo smashing "Visitor Q"?
How more "out there" can he become after the bizarre "Gozu"?
I found the movie a bit confounding at first... but it definitely makes more sense after a second and third viewing.
Imaginatively-staged action sequences are piled on non-stop, one after the other.
When I first saw the film on a visit to Madrid 1986 it blew my mind completely and after 20 years I'm still in love with this wonderful film.
This is my second experience with a Corean television drama and I came into it with a lot of skepticism after being disappointed by my previous attempt with Winter Sonata.
Hwa Young had asked her son to return home before she did, in order to stage a comeback into the royal family where she was banished from 14 years ago after the death of her husband.
But the Noir elements (also prominent in Visconti's 1943 masterpiece "Ossessione", based, after all, on Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice") are strong: the indoor lighting (check out those stylized shadows in the warehouse), the complex camera-work (that amazing opening dolly shot!!
The paper trail totally disputes that claim since Operation Mogul was conducted in the early to mid 1950's years after "The Roswell Incident" was said to have taken place.
Within two years Forrestal lost his mind and was committed to the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Washington D.C after suffering a severe mental breakdown.
Too much of the running time is compromised of talk, and while these bits of campy dialog are entertaining in similar films, the lack of shocking elements to space them out makes them quite monotonous after a while.
Soon, Steve St. John catches Blackie after one of Jade's indiscretions, the two of them have a fight, and Blackie stabs Steve to death in a very brief and tame fight scene.
The film does not contain much dialogue but it's pretty bad when it occurs with male characters saying things like "you got yourself a great little broad there" after Jade has just served the drinks!
They came to him after reading his autobiography.
You referenced the scene where Elder Groberg walks after the soles of his feet were eaten by rats.
They really didn't have a lot to do in their day-to-day routines and it was funny to watch a man from a distant country walk after something like that.
It pulled him through when he didn't know how to heal a seemingly dead child or make it to land after losing his ship in the middle of the ocean.
I saw this movie today and can't believe I waited so long after its release to see it.
One notable exception in the movie was when he was sinking in the water after they jumped form the boat in the storm, and it seemed that a hand came and pulled him up, but no one was there.
I usually read the reviews of the users here on IMDb before I watch a movie.I have come to rely on this site for renting and watching films.When I saw the title of this film "The other side of heaven" I felt that the title was somewhat inspiring.After 5 minutes from the actual beginning, I kind of knew what direction it was heading.I still wanted to watch it though.I'm Christian Orthodox, but this has nothing to do with this film or with me thinking to better watch a sample from a movie after reading a review next time.
I bought the film after a old flame for David Hasselhoff relighted and boy am I glad it did.
I watched this movie for a bit of a laugh plus it had the Hoff in it and lets face it after Knightrider the Hoff is one cool dude!
Perhaps the single most famous of these is Pierre Seel, who saw his lover killed by dogs in the death camps and who closeted himself to a remarkable extent after the war.
Probably history was after all, meant to be a study of human consciousness in guilt.
Of course, there is always a need to realize something valuable out of the past, that a study about the past is after all a human being's reverse-troubleshooting guide.
We read on these people, associate ourselves with the affairs of their lives, judge them for their actions, name calendar days after them, hate them, worship them, write books on them, film biopics on their lives, name our babies after themÂ The reason we can't forget these people could be because they've either given to or taken from this world in proportions far greater than what you or me have.
Even after the fall of Hitler in 1945, it still took close to fifty whole years and six amendments to finally strike it down.
But, even after we thought the horrible era of an insane ideology was over and done with, heads of government still remained conservative and chose to ignore the ills of their pasts, dragging their feet through the marshes of sludge-bureaucracy.
Additionally, one of the major points of this film should be how many gay concentration camp victims were still treated as prisoners after the war, specifically because of Paragraph 175.
It was incredibly amazing that even after all those years they managed to keep the subtlest details of the forbidden love and the dark holocaust.
Enough information is given about paragraph 175 and it's application during Hitler's reign and after for us to get an insight of its consequences, and the situation of denial of our 'civilised' western countries even today regarding the gay victims of this horror.
When one thinks how many documentaries have been made about the Nazi oppression of Jews, Roma (formerly known as Gypsies), and other groups, it is almost inconceivable that it is only in the year 2000, 67 years after the Nazi persecution of male homosexuals started (in 1933), that a documentary on the subject is finally released.
One has to admire the willingness of these men to tell their story after so many years.
Instead the directors have chosen to pepper the film with well-preserved family photographs, and lively footage of gay and lesbian culture blossoming during the days of the Weimar Republic after WW1.
There's a young man who was freed from a sentence at Dachau only to be interned again at Buchenwald, and a Frenchman imprisoned from Alsace, who breaks down after telling of being raped and subject to inhuman torture.
The situation didn't improve after the war.
This 1997 "movie" is meant to be a comedy but after about an hour I switched it off as if there was anything remotely amusing, I did not see it.
She names herself Madison (after the street) and starts a relationship with Allan that blossoms into true love.
Despite the fantasy element, and even fantasy-within-fantasy (the mermaid couldn't talk and then learned English after one day at Bloomingdale's ?)
I can only imagine what people felt at the movie theaters after paying $8.25 for this bomb.
When you break it down like that, it isn't so unusual after all, and it's actually mighty touching.
It moves me and it takes me back to a time when things where simple and a good story could be told without the bells and whistles and still move you years after.
One day, Allen decides to go to Cape Cod to enjoy the sea, a place where he feels mysteriously good, but he falls into the sea by accident and since he doesn't know how to swim, is saved by a mysterious and beautiful woman,who runs away soon after Allen recovers his conscience.
The beautiful woman stayed with Allen's documents, and decides to search him in New York after some days.
I saw it in the there shortly after it came out, fell in love with it and through the years have watched it more times then I can remember.
This is the story of a young professional vertical skateboarder named Mark Rogowski - who went on to earn the nickname "Gator" after inventing a skate-style move all his own - the "Gaite - Aire" And then , later still dropping his last name Rogowski - which he was quoted as saying that the name itself belonged to his father , who was not present in his life.
Gator had become pro at the age of 14, after winning a championship skate in Canada.
It's almost as if Jessica's death was merely a springboard to more publicity for Gator, long after he deserved it.
In his mind, it's still about Gator, even after ten years in prison.
That title was snatched from her just two cartoons after 'Porky's Romance' when Tex Avery's 'Porky's Duck Hunt' introduced a certain little black duck with a penchant for scene-stealing.
Poor Porky isn't laughing, however, after he arrives at Petunia's door and gets the brush-off.
The last half is not unusual in old cartoons: the main character has a dream where he sees the future and finds out losing his girl wasn't so bad, after all!
after hearing about this film since the 80s, i finally got the chance to see it and was seriously disappointed.
I ended up sitting through a snore fest, and I can't even tell you what it was about because my attention span stops after 5 minutes when there isn't a violent murder.
John Meillon holding his garden Aboriginal forlornly after having his front garden attacked.
A pleasant, mild-mannered American tourist (a sweetly amiable performance by Terry Camilleri) finds himself trapped in a remote backwoods Australian hamlet after he narrowly survives a car crash.
But what becomes a shock to Arthur is when he discovers the main source of income is that of salvaging parts of passing motorist's car after causing them to have a car accident.
But after the 2nd and 3rd time, I love it!
But an unexpected romance intervenes, as Blake falls in love with Penny, a prostitute who, after her initial revulsion, befriends them both and helps them experience a bit of what life has to offer.
Don't expect to come out with a smile after this one, even though it is an interesting experience.
Lesley Ann Warren fares better as Francine, the twins' mother who gave them up for adoption after they were born, but she's still not as good as the three principal characters.
The other actors are great, such as Miles, the doctor friend of Penny's who helps her look after the twins.
I spoke to a couple of people after the film who said they thought they would be uncomfortable with the subject and were for a couple of  minutes but then became totally involved and forgot.
Although there is alot of sadness in the film, the overall feeling after was uplifting.
Before this movie I never cared for Alicia Silverstone, but after this I appreciate her a lot more...especially now that I know she created it.
This film is still haunting me, even long after watching it for the first time.
Ironically enough after the two collabreated on "Hollywood Scream Queen Hot Tub Party", neither's subsquesent movies were as entertaining.
Purely a vehicle for slasher T&A, the movie makes no excuses and doesn't really take it itself all that seriously - what movie COULD, after having a man fall off a 15-story building and walk away?
The highlight of the film, for me, was the irrepressible Orville coming back from one death after another, and not seeming to hold all the abuses against anyone, when it's over.
To me, HARD TO DIE delivered exactly what it promised on the box...action, blood, babes, machine guns, Corman references (this is, after all, a New Horizons video) and loads of cheesy fun.
However, after giving it some thought I rated it pretty high.
END OF SPOILER  Basically, after seeing this film I did learn just how lucky I am to possess all these extraordinary and unique abilities and I don't believe it is just an accident or coincidence.
The movie lacks a good plot, and is rather boring after a while.
Exiting after only one season Charlie's Angels never was the same again.
who lands on John's prosthetic hand after every scouting mission.
This Western-Comedy film was directed by Sergio Corbucci, the number #2 Italian director of all time for Spaghetti Westerns, after of course Sergio Leone, for the entire Spaghetti Western genre, which is saying a lot because there were hundreds of films in that genre alone!
However, he is soon relying on his companion to rescue him, after he is captured by a former partner John (Jack Palance) - who he had previously betrayed some years ago to save his own skin.
Eventually after MANY years of self-sacrifice, Barbara marries newspaperman, Ralph Bellamy.
THEN, Menjou becomes ill and pardons Stanwyck after she's already spent a year or so in prison for the murder!!!
But the best part of the movie -- the best worst part -- is how old everybody gets after only about sixteen years.
Now here's the rub - it is quite awhile after she has been seeing this man (and they have fallen in love) that she finds out he has given her a fake name - and is married!
Shortly after the early Kinetoscope experiment "Leonard-Cushing Fight", featuring the two boxers Jack Cushing and Mike Leonard in a boxing match, this movie got made at the Thomas Edison's Black Maria Studios, featuring two cats, fully equipped with boxing gloves, having a go at each other.
Old question: Can two people fall in love after two days of being together?
If you're not a fan of Jennifer Jones, you will be after seeing Good Morning, Miss Dove.
When, after his service in the Marine Corps, the grown-up Bill says to Miss Dove that he wants to use his saved money to complete his studies, she plainly hides her inner joy.
Clear: to show joy, even much time after the school-years, would mean to be partial toward her "William" (a delightful, even poetic subtlety is that Miss Dove never calls the kids by nick-name).
That's enough for Bill to learn the lesson, that is to overcome his prejudices (which coincide with her own prejudices; so, after all, even Miss Dove has something to learn).
This intelligent, heart-warming and thought-provoking story has a climax in her medical crisis and a happy ending; it is not perhaps a great film, but Miss Dove is very probably a great character, and one many can learn from long after the film has ended.
Maigret is looking after a women killer in Paris.
The film begins slowly ,but when it hits its stride,after about thirty minutes ,it grabs you till the very end ,with more and more verbal violence.
One is the scene in which Schlutt's character, Dennis, returns to his cell after being outed as having an affair with a black man.
And the scene in which the Letarsky character comforts Schlutt's character after the rape is rather touching.
And, after all, Mom HAD taken her ailing daughter to hospital after hospital.
Even her widow/lover believes she's a twin sister, even after they begin living together!
"Sophie's Choice" is set in Brooklyn in the late 1940s, soon after the end of the Second World War.
The final frame is to me, perhaps the most beautiful I have ever seen, and the film will stay with the viewer long after.
It seems that if he does connect to someone on a deeper level, he's afraid he might kill again--though he is clearly a decent person who snapped one time in his life and only after being pushed.
It's like a before and after snapshot; Leon's pretty much 'compartmentalized' his life - Nikita's struggling to get a grip on hers...  Perhaps "Leon" represents the evolution of Besson's 'paternal' instinct; as he watches his own children grow.
An intelligent and profoundly moving film which will (I promise you) live on in your memory long after the closing credits.
Yet, scene after scene is brilliant, the comedy works, the romance works, the action works, and the political/philosophical points about the American West work.
For example, after the army massacres a group of Native-Americans, Joel McCrea finds the dead body of Linda Darnell.
But the ending of the film, where the saved woman watches smilingly and peacefully the car driving away in the warm dusk after handing over the lunch bag, is blatant enough to overthrow this consumption.
On the other hand, if it is the conviction of the director that the merciless crime committed by the main character is forgivable after only 8 years prison, he does not give enough clue to justify it.
What caused the transformation from her being desperate and suicidal before to suddenly optimistic and strong in action after?
THE EEL borders on dark humour when a man, who after eight years in prison for the murder of his wife, is released from jail.
They will both date her, and then after a six-week period, they will dump her, a plan they've devised after years of being tormented and unlucky with women.
All this seems like a pleasant surprise to Christine after years of no dating--but, of course, she doesn't know the plan the men have hatched.
"Strange Fruit.A poem written by a Jewish high school teacher Abel Meeropol.A song made famous by Billie Holiday.Abel wrote it after he saw a photo depicting the lynching of a black man in the south.Something so beautiful came out of such a tragic event.Shivers go down your spine when you hear Billie Holiday perform it.Your eyes get wet.You ask yourself why and yet you get no answer.How could something like that happen such a short time ago?
Furlong sits in this room, watching monitors placed throughout the mansion and it's grounds, his voice barking orders and teases to the contestants, before and after they discover what happens once you are a loser.
The movie opens with a great appearance from Jaime Pressly, who has an encounter with Edward Furlong in her home, after something she did to him on a Reality-TV show they were both on.
If you didn't think much about Chow Yun Fat before this movie, I can almost guarantee you will after seeing it.
I did not expect much of this movie at first knowing it wasn't john woo who directed it, but after just the first 5 min i was totally into the movie and had forgotten who directed the movie, because it was equally great, and i couldn't ask for more  get this movie!
Having narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, Ko Chun unwittingly walks into a trap set by Knife, a young gambler wannabe who hankers after a big score.
That's right folks, the two cops are named after two of your favorite childhood friends.
Burt comes after them with the determination of Robocop, and what ensues is the fastest, funniest and most frantic car chase ever captured on film!
The Eel tells a story about a Japanese man who copes with his guilt after committing a crime.
Not only does he turn himself in after the crime (with a great way of response by the police) he even makes a friend out of an eel in prison.
As the movie's main character stabs his cheating wife to death after slashing her frightened adulterous lover, blood sprays all over the camera, the scene becoming skewed and blurred through the bloodied lens, forcing us naturally to want to peer around it to see as clearly as we can the violence the character continues to commit.
The motley coed crew of a spaceflight to Venus are forced to fend for themselves and determine the future of mankind after the Earth gets destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.
"An upcoming space mission to Venus becomes even more vital after a startling secret is revealed.
And the last 10-15 minutes (apparently filmed years after the main portion of the movie, with an entirely different cast of actors) is the worst patch job I have ever seen - and I'm including the codas from "Time Of the Apes" and "The Devil Has Seven Faces" in that list.
Actually the film sort of spirals out of control after the Earth is destroyed.
He opens a barbershop in a rural part of Japan but his life becomes complicated after he saves a young woman, Keiko (Misa Shimizu), from suicide and gives her a job at his shop.
The UFO sequence is very lame and the comic behavior of a man just out of prison seems inappropriate as he marches like a soldier then runs after a jogging team that is passing by.
I just felt depressed after watching this entire film.
Another important thing is Demme's Âmaybe not really art, but certainly skill, craft: it is extremely obvious from this movie that Demme knows how to film thingsÂsuch as the asphalt wet after the rain Â.
Years later after Hughes has died Melvin learns he is in Hughes' will.
He finds Keiko, unconscious after a suicide attempt, and she begins to work for him.
"My Son John" is a movie which is almost comically awful, with Robert Walker swearing on the Bible that he's not a Communist; Dean Jagger singing "If you don't like your Uncle Sammy;" the Communists tapping the FBI's phones rather than vice versa; Robert Walker dying from a blast of a Commie machine gun after a geographically impossible chase through downtown Washington; the taped posthumous speech to a collection of frozen-faced graduates with warnings of "stimulants" leading to "narcotics;" and finally, Dean Jagger more or less telling Helen Hayes that their late son got what he deserved.
He reassembles the apparatus of the home-front tearjerker, retired after deployment during World War II, to feed fears of Soviet infiltration.
Rarely resuscitated, My Son John remains a glimpse into a tribal mind-set that by no means vanished with the disgrace and death of Senator Joe McCarthy but even after the turn of a new millennium enjoys its vogue.
But on the surface, Walker's derelictions are not any liaisons he may pursue in Rock Creek Park after midnight but his abandonment first of his faith then of patriotism.
But I remember when I first viewed this really peculiar glop, at the tender age of about 10, only a year or two after it had premiered, I was unimpressed even then.
However, after getting fired by some idiots at MGM, they couldn't afford to direct cartoons with high production values.
But they always fail in one after another way in a funny way but different ways.
I almost turned it off after only 15min and then I forced myself to watch until the point that Bette walked off.
Then Davis disappears (she wisely left after a week of shooting) and is replaced by sexy Barbara Carrera.
With Davis gone this officially became unwatchable--I turned it off after an hour.
Severely ill, barely able to remember her lines, and frail as a leaf about to fall from its branch in the middle of fall, she was forced to step out of filming only a week after production on the movie began.
Cohen made a courageous attempt to put together a quick fix storyline after Bette Davis walked out after one week's filming and I salute him for giving Bette a final opportunity to appear on screen.
Thanks to the cast and crew for working on this film after the difficulties.
By the way I was expecting some race scenes after I saw some promo photos with Bay Ling on a black race bike.
I liked the fact that they focused on Bambi and his father, after his mother dies, and the story itself was very sweet and well crafted.
The male leads are the incomparable William Powell (one year after "My Man Godfrey"), and Robert Montgomery (one year before "Night Must Fall").
It explains what happens between after Bambi's mother's death and before he grows up, and focuses on Bambi and his father, The Great Prince Of The Forest.
It's an intoxicating feeling when a movie excites and enlivens us like this -- and there's a particular giddiness to be had in thinking about what movies can (but don't often) do for one's soul after imbibing such a fine vintage!
What happened after Bambi met his father in that heavy snowfall and before the spring he shook owls tree scratching his antlers?
Why was the dancing on clouds moment after meeting Faline ruined by some buck challenging Bambi.
Rondo, as far as I could tell was never named in Bambi, but the fight between him and Bambi makes more sense after the sequel.
Bambi's father takes care of him now, after the death of Bambi's mother.
I like that the story is not of Bambi's son but goes back to right after Bambi's mom dies and follows his transition at that time.
It all seemed like mindless prattle after a while.
I bought the 2nd movie the day after it came out for my two brothers who are 7 and 10.. and they loved it!
Especially after the let down of Little Mermaid II and Cinderella II.
However, after I had seen Bambi 2, I found that it was an enchanting, funny and warm movie, it is definitely one of the fewest best sequels came from the original one.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
I left soon after and never did tell her that I was messing around - I didn't make any money if I went to a call and couldn't do any work so I suppose that was my payment.
You'll be singing "I'm Me, Baaaaaaabe" long after you've forgotten the ending.
Note the blackened guns after the battle.
The film would have benefited from a German perspective during the battle rather than just the experiences of the prisoners on Graf Spee, and of course did ignore Langsdorf's suicide a few days after the scuttling.
The Graf Spee escapes under cover of nightfall to neutral Montevideo harbour where, after frantic diplomatic negotiations, foreign minister Doctor Guani, acting under the Hague Convention, allows Langsdorff 72 hours to carry out such repairs a will make the vessel seaworthy without enhancing its fighting ability.
There are also plenty of nice little details that often get overlooked, such as the gun-muzzles that become smoke-blackened after use.
The picture is a splendid British film concerning about historic deeds in WWII,the naval battle in the South Atlantic between British cruiser squadron of three ships and the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, Dic 1939 ;the protagonists and secondaries are incarnated by a magnificent plethora English actors.The film is based on true events ,these are the following: Though the British cruisers were no match for the battleship,Admiral Sir Henry Harwood(Anthony Quayle) launched an attack to Graf Spee(with 6 cannons,280 mm).German fire seriously damaged HMS Exeter(John Cregson,captain Bell)with cannons 203mm,put half of HMS Ajax(captain Woodhouse, Ian Hunter)'s guns out of action,and then damaged Achilles(cannons 152 mm),but the cruisers did sufficient damage to the German ship to make its captain break off and run for shelter in Montevideo,Uruguay.The British followed,and waited in international waters outside the neutral port.The Uruguay government ordered the Germans to leave after 72 hours.The British cruisers named Royal and Renown were near from Montevideo and Langsdorff(Peter Finch) didn't wait possibilities to vanquish.Hitler,reluctant to risk the Graf Spee being sunk by heavier British warship which were sailing for the River Plate ,ordered the captain to scuttle the vessel.He did so 17 Dec 1939 and three days later shot himself.The film contains a colorful and glimmer cinematography by Christopher Challis.The movie is well produced(with the Archers production)and directed by Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell.The motion picture will like to warlike genre fans and classic British cinema.
In any event the Uruguayans operated correctly under the assumption that they would be at war sooner or later with the Germans as indeed were all the Latin American countries except Argentina after Pearl Harbor.
She had made other films with Montgomery but there were no others after this one.
Finally, and I can understand why they didn't mention this, shortly after the German Captain scuttled his ship he committed suicide.
It turns out that Dr. Werdegast (Lugosi) has a score to settle with Poelzig (Karloff) and is looking for his wife and daughter after a long and enforced separation.
The Black Cat, like the Raven, is named after Edgar Allan Poe's writings, but has very little to do with its namesake.
I've watched this movie with my 12 years old son, him too a "movie-man", and after about 30 minutes he asked me: "Do you like this movie?
Then after off loading and driving out of town, Perkins asks him "are we just gonna let him go sheriff ?"
I was amazed by Korean audiences that after seeing the final scene sighed a collective "Huh?"
I admit I was expecting more after Scorsese's introduction.
Well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film.
IÂ´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started.
I have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...  What about the movie?
Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her)or is he cast against type (after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)?
Sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going.
I recently bought a VHS copy of this film - don't think it's available on DVD - and watched it again several times, after falling in love with it on late-night TV as a teenager back in the 1970s.
Lamest of all is the film's dubious morality: no one blinks an eye when an otherwise likable Lugosi knifes a cat; and the ending sees Manners and Bishop enjoying one of those it's-all-over-now, ho-ho epilogues after they've accidentally shot Lugosi in the back and made a run for it while everyone else explodes.
You might not sleep easily after this film.
Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up, as you do.
I suggest watching this after seeing 'The LumiÃ¨re Brothers' First Films,' with narration by Bertrand Taverneir.
To back this up, we see the first man she saw having sex, the student Frank, reflected endlessly in a mirrored bathroom after his bout with his insatiable companion, the sexually voracious student Sue.
The change of heart Bender shows towards the dog after he realizes just how much Fry loved it was inspirational.
The Black Cat (1934)   Edgar Ulmer was one of Universal Studio's hopes in 1934, when this movie was their biggest hit of the season (this is three years after the explosion of Dracula and Frankenstein).
While I watched it I thought I would give an 8, after finishing it I though it's a 9.
As the episode unfolds we learn what happened to Seymour after Fry was frozen...and what Fry decides to do when his fossilized remains are recovered in the future.
Branded was Ladd's second starring western after Whispering Smith and he proved to be equally well received here.
Other words are said about the two men having in effect already  died years ago... look beneath the surface of this movie... don't  take it literally, and much richness is there... the art deco, Bauhaus  architecture... the wondrous infusion of Beethoven's 7th after the  2nd appearance of the Black Cat.
The film that made James Cagney a star and even after all these years, it's easy to see why.
One cop chases after Tom and Matt down an alley and they kill him demonstrating how far they have come from their early days.
Whether he's shooting a racehorse or collapsing on a rain-soaked street after rubbing out a bunch of rival mobsters ("I ain't so tough"), Cagney is nothing short of amazing in the lead.
They mix in with some of the shadiest characters ever seen on screen, like Putty Nose and Paddy, both of who keep coming out with great line after great line, total 1930's style.
And, while there were so many more similar films after it, very, very few came close to it in style, impact and story.
Director William A. Wellman constructs the plot of THE PUBLIC ENEMY around the real-life bootlegging phenomenon that occurred after Prohibition was enforced.
Is Wellman actually imploring us to root for Cagney after all in his juxtaposition of the brothers?
The boys, after all, have families.
Sadly, after this film, they never were re-teamed again.
Of course any film would probably seem lacking after 70 years of imitators.
Towards the end Tom Powers is confined to a hospital bed after a shootout, and he seems ready to put his old life behind him.
America was attempting to adjust to the aftermath of World War I (which is explored brilliantly in this film in a sequence through which Tom's brother, Mike, refuses to drink from a keg of beer smuggled in by Tom for his dinner party) People like Mike were still trying to feel that sense of loyalty towards the government after World War I.
The film, made before the arrival of the infamous Hays Code, gets away with showing the morality of the gangster on the scene and the women they went after.
Lugosi plays a man thirsty for revenge, and Karloff is the man Lugosi is after.
"Public Enemy," however, was a bigger-budget production, directed by William Wellman, and it contained all the elements of successÂ It is the story of two brothers who become Chicago booze barons in the Twenties... One was Cagney, the other Edward WoodsÂ   It is sometimes claimed that the story of "Public Enemy" is based on that of "Little Hymie" Weiss, leader of the North Side Chicago gang after the murder of Dion O'Banion by the Capones in 1924Â What is more likely is that the Cagney characterization is based on "Little Hymie"; the plot itself is pure fictionÂ   When Cagney, in his striped pajama, sat opposite Mae Clarke at breakfast and decided he had had enough of this boring broad, he wasted no timeÂ He picked up half a grapefruit and planted it full into Clarke's faceÂ It was a piece of screen action which has lasted down the years as the ultimate in violence from the gangster to his mollÂ   Of course, it isn't Â it just seems that wayÂ Since then gir1s have been slapped, kicked, beaten up, run over, shot, stabbed and raped, all in the tradition of mobster violenceÂ   But at the time this scene was daring, and the more daring because it was totally unexpectedÂ We remember Mae Clarke in "Public Enemy," yet forget that Jean Harlow was in it, tooÂ There may have been good reasonÂ The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1934, commented: "The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the role of a gangster's mistress."
I can't help but wonder, after reading so many negative reviews, if people really got this movie.
JOAN CRAWFORD returned to MGM for TORCH SONG after a decade of other films at other studios, in a role that paints her character as tough-as-nails--in fact, so tough that you expect her to take out a gun at any moment and shoot anyone who disagrees with her bossy persona.
Particularly unbelievable and jarring is the ending, which has Crawford and Wilding realizing that they love each other after all the harsh words and deeds are over!!
I came back to re-watch Nikita after a lecture I heard about spontaneity and creativity.
The garishly Technicolor film marked Crawford's highly trumpeted return to MGM after she was unceremoniously pushed out in the early 1940's only to make a comeback at Warner Brothers in a series of meaty roles in classic films like "Mildred Pierce" and "Humoresque" and prove she had the chops to handle older roles.
The wretched excess is highlighted by the legendary star's dubbed "Two-Faced Woman" production number; keep watching for the moment, shortly after the song, when "black-faced" Crawford pulls off her "wig", in ghastly fashion.
Probably the most exciting scene is when Jenny decides to throw a party on a Sunday night after a week of grueling rehearsals because she has her eye on Tye and wants to get to "know" him better.
Then the ending, when, after "discovering" the review that Tye wrote about her, Jenny "realizes" that all this time he had been trying to tell her that he loved her, she rushes to his absolutely fabulous gorgeous perfectly appointed apartment and (apparently) tells his blonde sycophant wannabe-girlfriend to get lost (all very subtly actually).
This is not a movie that panders to the "and lived happily ever after" fairy tale mindset.
The scariest thing about the real main character of the movie, US-made supercomputer Colossus, later known as "World Control" after its fusion with its soviet counterpart, Guardian, is it acts the way you would act if you resigned all your human feelings, keeping your intelligence.
If you please, you can consider THX 1138 as a kind of sequel of this movie (it was released one year after this one).
I've only seen the TV edit of this film, and I think that the alternate versions section didn't list all of the scenes that were removed for it after reading the other reviews, but I hope that they don't detract from it.
), but after reflection, not as questionable as I thought.
Dr. Forbin, after activating his new computer, attends party at the White House and publicly states his wish that not only will his machine prevent war, but that it will also herald a new age of human advancement, in which famine and disease and pollution and overpopulation will be eliminated with the help of Colossus' vast computer power.
Human tyrants are driven by flawed ideology, thieves' greed, or psychotic motives, and they are guaranteed to die after a few decades, like any human.
Colossus and Guardian link up and after much communication and exchange of data they reach a common ground, with a common language (known only to these two computer) and hold the world hostage.
Because of security reasons, the link between Guardian and Colossus is broken, after much discussions between the U.S. & the U.S.S.R., and Colossus gets uppity and launches missiles at the Soviet Union, as does Guardian at the U.S.
When he blows out two candles with one breath, the lights dim after which he blows again, presumably to extinguish the remaining two candles which are off screen.
But the fear "Colossus: the Forbin Project" gave me is the same fear I experienced after reading Orwell's "1984".
You have to think, after watching it: is this the way it happens?
Shortly after activation, it discovers that another system, Guardian, has been built by the Soviets.
It isn't too long after, however, that the Russians announce that they too have built a similar computer for those same purposes on their side--Guardian.
Made the year after what many consider MÃ©liÃ¨s' masterpiece LE VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE (A TRIP TO THE MOON) and not nearly as elaborate or impressive as that work, this is still a great piece of film history no film fan will have a problem spending 60 seconds of their time viewing.
I wasn't particularly gob smacked or incredibly impressed by the film after reading a lot good things about it, but it's the performances and the look of the film that kept me glued and amazed.
That year, right after the enormous success of his masterpiece, "Le Voyage Dans la Lune" ("A Trip to the Moon"), MÃ©liÃ¨s directed 3 shorts that he colored himself: "La Guirlande Merveilleuse", "Le Cake-walk infernal" and "Le Chaudron infernal".
and Lugosi not just shooting Karloff when he has the chance, the creepiest thing in the whole movie is that after marrying Lugosi's wife, Karloff now sleeps with his step-daughter.
But after she meets up with Ben, she starts to change to become as dominant as Ben is.
I'm not-sure it should ever be remade after this one, honestly, it's so basic in the look that I cannot see it becoming-dated anytime-soon.
And genre superstar Tony Todd, who soon after was cast as "Candyman", is super in the lead.
But then after spending time with people that annoyed her to no end she suddenly gets survival skills OUT OF NOWHERE.
Patricia Tallman plays Barbara, a young woman who seeks refuge in a farmhouse after the dead begin returning to life to devour the living.
Professional and surprisingly successful remake of George A. Romero's groundbreaking horror milestone with the same title, that retells Â in color Â the simplistic, yet still very unsettling premise of recently deceased corpses that rise from their tombs for unknown reasons, and go after the living.
However, even if you swear by the original and know it by heart, I'd still like to encourage you to watch this version for the following reason: after about sixty minutes of sticking loyally to the original, Savini's "Night of the Living Dead" all of a sudden stops being a homage and NEW script-elements, either specifically added or recovered ideas that didn't made the final cut of the 1968 version, are brought in!
Now twenty two years after the war ended Maj. Grau's friend in the French Resistance the former Insp.
Sharif's hunt for O'Toole is worked into the story of the bomb plot to kill Hitler after the Normandy invasion.
In fact Tanz keeps returning to the museum day after day.
Peter O'Toole is the aristocratic German General the title is named after, he looks the part and plays it to perfection.
The tanks used appear to be fairly good recreations of the Tiger tank (though not exact), which is refreshing after seeing so many modern American tanks pressed into service as German types by Hollywood.
As for all the comments about non-German actors portraying Germans and speaking English...I would think that everyone would be used to that by now, after 80 years of sound motion pictures!
I would also agree that the end of the picture, which takes place in the 1960's, is somewhat anti-climatic, especially after the shocking scene of Grau's murder.
Obviously Inspector Morand couldn't do anything back in 1944 in Nazi-occupied France, so to have him solve all the murders (including Grau's) in "modern" times is a good final touch (though one may wonder why he waited so long to do it -- after all, the war had been over for 20 years...perhaps he had his suspicions of Tanz all along, but no proof, until the Hamburg murder.)
An eyewitness saw a German general leaving the building after a scream of the victim.
Now I'm convinced more than ever, that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story.
Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo, he has discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her fiddle.
The disappointment from this film is very similar to the one after watching Cold Mountain.
They have the power to stick with you long after the movie is over.
When Turkish is spoken, the Russian translation starts after a little delay, which makes it really difficult to hear.
The last strange thing - why do they make a film on "Statskiy Sovetnik" (the 6th book) after "Turetskiy Gambit" instead of "Leviafan", which is supposed to be the 3rd book in the series?
This film is the following step of the Russian cinema forward, after " Night Patrol ".
So to start of with the plot, the story revolves around Rishi Kumar and Roja (Madhoo), who get married in the beginning after many hurdles faced by both of them.
Rishi Kumar originally was supposed to marry Roja's sister, but after Roja's sister confessed to Rishi Kumar, that she is in love with someone else, but cannot marry him now, due conflicts between their families.
In the end, we realize that the terrorist couldn't hand over Rishi Kumar, since he escaped, and Rishi Kumar faces off with the head terrorist (Pankaj Kapoor), who after many conversations with Rishi Kumar, changed him as a person, and lets him go.
The most moving moments in the movie, are scenes after Rishi Kumar gets kidnapped.
While traveling via train, a mysterious man named Dr. Vitus Verdegast (Lugosi) shares their compartment and tells them of an old friend he plans on meeting after some 15 years of being held captive in a prisoner of war camp.
Joan is put to bed and given rest after the fright of the accident, and Poelzig greets them all with warm hospitality.
However, it does not last for long, because it is soon revealed that Verdegast has come back after 15 years to claim his wife and daughter from the clutches of Poelzig.
The story is pretty good when Reavis returns to the Arizona Territory with false documents in hand and starts to implement his plan to become the Baron of the whole territory after marrying Ellen Drew, the so-called Baroness de Peralta.
So fascinated that I did a bit of research on Reavis after I finished the movie.
Because of the fact that the USA after the Mexican War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase which netted for the USA the southern half of Arizona, the original Spanish land grants and whoever had title to them, land office clerk James Addison Reavis hatched one bold and audacious scheme that had it been successful would have had him owning more than half of Arizona.
What you're seeing on the screen in The Baron Of Arizona is a small encapsulation of an over 20 year effort by Reavis as played by Vincent Price to pull this thing off and to stay ahead of law enforcement who after a while smelled a very large rat.
one only wishes that mr ferrer could use his handicraft via the screen and put oneself to sleep after the opening credits keep rolling by ...
The plot follows a kleptomaniac who falls prey to a hypnotist after she is caught stealing from a shop.
The plotting lets this film down, as after a good opening half hour - the film descends into boredom as we try to discover who really was behind the killing, even though there only ever is one suspect.
When we first meet Ann, she's getting arrested by a store detective in a department store after attempting to steal an expensive piece of jewelry.
But I didn't buy it for a minute when Korvo orders Ann around in a trance and then hypnotizes himself hours after major surgery.
Jose is so good at hypnosis he even google-eyes himself after gall bladder surgery so he can get about knocking off people and listening to records.
Look and listen closely here and you'll see the camera fading out a shot of Tierney's husband just about to disrobe his wife after she falls into a hypnotically induced deep-sleep and at another point the salacious quote addressed to Tierney by morally corrupt blackmailing hypnotist/astrologist (what a CV!)
He completely convinces you of his strength of will over his physical pain to enable him to go after Tierney as she struggles to recover her amnesia which will of course expose his own guilt.
And there isn't a moment in "Whirlpool" that is the equal of the scene in which Tierney reappears from the dead to find a half-drunk Dana Andrews sitting in her living room just after he's gone through her lingerie drawer.
However, the Whirlpool is still fun to watch, especially for the lovely Gene Tierney who apparently used Whirlpool as a comeback after a two-year absence.
In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-sense  If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud .
Played by German actress Erna SchÃ¼rer who spent most of the Seventies in more sleazy Italian fare such as Strip Nude For Your Killer and Deported Women of the SS Special Section, Jeanette willingly volunteers to become their tour guide, supposedly to save her husband, but after a while trapped in a tank full of sweating, leering Germans her motives are quite clear, showing off her flesh and playing the affections of one soldier against the other.
I started collecting the movies after reading the books and I gotta say: I do enjoy low budget, low grade films sometimes for the simple pleasure and nostalgia they evoke.
Hopefully, in the next couple of years, studios will use the technology of "Dinosaur" to make quality movies that we'll enjoy after the first five minutes.
The film centers around a dinosaur named Aladar, who must bring his adoptive family to safety after the extinction event 65 million years ago.
"Stan Cooper" plays a more or less straight-laced young German Lt. in command of what is portrayed as the last functioning Panzer tank still fighting World War II, cut off from German lines after a devastating ambush knocks out all of the other Panzers in his column retreating from Normandy after the allied D-Day invasion, the German war effort obviously lost beyond any hope & the Nazis in a near panic as defeat looms.
I'd initially expected this movie to bomb like Waterworld, but after the initial openings almost topping 40 Mil, it may do as well as Titanic (not quite).
Could it be that the only things talking dinosaurs ever want to do is to find a hidden valley after a meteor strike?
The film is supposed to be set in France, after the D-Day invasion.
If you want a real shock, watch it right after "Saving Private Ryan" or "Band of Brothers" and you'll find out just how bad bad can be!
Despite what you read about the animation getting old after the first sequence, it never lets down.
Maybe it's the amazing musical score provided by James Newton Howard, or the drop-dead gorgeous visuals or maybe the story isn't too bad after all.
I first saw this movie in first grade not long after it came out on home video, and so my teacher brought it in and our class decided to watch it.
When we started to watch it, I thought that it was interesting, but after awhile, I really became focused into it, and so when it was over, I really was thrilled with it!
The plot that dinosaurs, after a meteorite strike, creates a large famine leading to a search for a valley of fertility is recycled from both a segment in Disney's FANTASIA called "The Rite of Spring", as well as Don Bluth's animated THE LAND BEFORE TIME.
It turns into one of those interesting microcosms that we see sometimes in stage plays or in movies, where a group of people who usually would just say hello/goodbye and be on their way (if that) are thrown together: a smart guy like Alan who becomes heroic after imbibing a few dozen shots; a gruff gangster like Mantee who talks in a way (and by Bogart's performance) where you're not sure what's sarcastic or real; Gabrielle as the girl who two guys are pining for and is not sure what she'll do.
Duke shoots the tourist at the end, escapes and is finally caught by the police just after.
But it's now four years after the end of prohibition and the real gangsters of earlier Warner Brothers films (including Bogart as a thug, along with Davis, appearing briefly in the great pre-code 1932 film, Three on a Match) are mostly gone from real life.
This is 1936, and acquiescing to what one's family expected of you and losing yourself in your husband's identity went on long, long after that.
Bogey never forgot this favor and years later named his daughter Leslie after Howard.
Bogey reportedly patterned his Mantee after real life gangster John Dillinger right down to his speech and movements.
He would play mostly gangster roles in Cagney and Robinson films with the odd lead in a "B" picture such as "Black Legion" (1937) until 1941 when he became a major star after appearing in "High Sierra" and "The Maltese Falcon".
He hadn't made much of an impression then, but he was in Tinseltown to stay after The Petrified Forest and his frightening characterization of criminal on the run, Duke Mantee.
I had just finished reading a long, thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe (all wars usually are, but this one especially), one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape.
At first watch I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending (which I will not reveal) but after thinking about it I came to the decision that it really fit the story well after all, and is actually very poetic.
Another point is the continuity where the Doctor gets his hand sliced off but is able to grow a new one because several hours after a regeneration a time lord can do this which sounds like cheating and I don't believe for a moment RTD envisaged the severed hand as a plot point for season three of the show .
True the story can at times be complex, but it is captivating and after watching it several times the more complex aspects become clearer.
And the way that Cassavetes opens and closes his film is most intriguing of all (if one is still watching by the end, as mentioned it might turn off some viewers expecting a more conventional narrative)- we see the singer, who has no self-confidence following night after night being booed while trying to have his own unique style in singing for the girls to dance to, and finally he just walks off after not being able to take any more (this is the last shot, following an ambiguous end for Cosmo, as his fate is left open to chance or damnation).
I understand that audiences stormed out of the cinema during and after the film during a couple of initial screenings when the film was finished.
It was only shown on video after his death and has slowly become regarded as an avant-garde, character driven, masterpiece.
Fascinating Cassavetes work has Ben Gazzara playing Cosmo Vitelli, a California night club owner who, after racking up a huge gambling debt, is given the opportunity to clear it by killing a Chinese bookie.
With deliberately rough camera work (containing lots of lens flares) and editing (not trimming out movements of the photographer's hands before and after actions), along with the crafted acting of Ben Gazzara, Cassavetes presents the obscure-hence-realistic underground gang world as no one else has.
I first saw this movie after renting it years ago.
Where everything falls apart is after Cosmo commences his attempt to murder "the Chinese bookie"  Cosmo manages to get through some guard dogs and enter the property by simply feeding them some meat, where if they would have barked it would have alerted the many armed guards on the premises.
Nevertheless after he returns to his club, they lure him away, and attempt to kill him regardless, at which point the hard ass muscle man decides to opt out, saying he wont do it because Cosmo is his friend, and hes the only one who listens to him, which is another ridiculous spiral to be led down, since the 2 have absolutely no meaningful conversation prior.
All it really achieved was to destroy the plausibility of every single scene after the gun shot wound, so due to the fact that everything in the entire second half of this movie never could have happened, It is impossible to give it more than 2 stars, an extra star for Ben Gazarras performance.
It tells the story of Cosmo Vitelli, an LA nightclub owner with a dangerous gambling addiction that gets him into trouble with local gangsters who give him another option after he can't pay the debt: kill a renowned Chinese accountant working for a powerful West-Coast crime syndicate.
However, after the actual killing of the Chinese bookie, the film spirals into a cinematic oblivion of unexplained escapes and inconclusive endings.
****SPOILERS****Very off beat crime drama with Cosmo on the run for his life from both the John and Chinaman's, whom he knocked off with two of his bodyguards, mob.The movie ends on a down note in that Cosmo after getting away from both John and the Chinaman's mobsters is left, from what I can see, bleeding to death outside his nightclub that he took refuge in.
This after his girlfriend Rachael left Cosmo knowing that she'll end up dead if she stays.
"You have no style," he sneers at gangster Al Ruban early in the film after the thug condescends to him.
The director said "i cut out some scenes to make audiences talk about this movie after watching it" but that means this movie doesn't make any sense.
Anyway, Tell me something is a well done thriller that keeps you wondering (in difference to twelve monkey were I figuered out the end after five minutes of watching despite what people said what a surprise ending it was supposed to have - I would rate Twelve Monkeys with 1 out of ten anyway, though.
However, it's pleasant - it still makes for a worthwhile watch on TV, and predictably - of course the best moment is when they finally are together after all.
Still, it soon seemed quite obvious who the murderer would be (my wife guessed after about 20 minutes).
Exhibit A: cop finds out his pretty but sulky witness has attempted suicide several times, turns around and leaves her alone in his flat with his one and only gun, then goes after a serial killer without any weapon, gets mauled in the process, survives the ordeal, chases the killer a second time, this time still without any weapon... And just when you think it can't get any dumber than this, well, that's exhibit A, and as Picard puts it, "Plenty of letters left in in the alphabet"  A thinking person's movie?
I suspect a lot of people who spend their working hours thinking actually like to switch off their brains when they come home after a hard thinking day's work.
Unfortunately, this film, in my opinion, and after my first viewing, has more flaws and holes than real merits in it.
Sadly, Tell Me Something has yet to get a US release (outside of all too rare arthouse screenings from time to time), and after two years it remains unreleased on VHS or DVD.
Unfortunately the director and the screenplay writer have not succeeded and the story is totally confused mainly after the last twist.
most replies r negative to my surprise ,i waned to read them to know if other viewers enjoyed it as i did , i think it was good i will report a quick summery to any of u who is about to watch  ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE   of coarse everyone knows its written by Agatha Cristie the great novelist, the plot starts by an old friend of miss marple writing her a letter asking her to come pay a visit coz she's to be married to a gentleman who have 5 kids   after miss marple arrives & is introduced to the 5 young people she learns they are all came from foster homes , & that their belated mother was a very rich lady killed 2 yrs ago   on a quick flash backs the director shows us one where the mother had a big fight concerning money borrowing from her eldest adopted son jacko that she turns down & he end up telling her that he wish her dead & he leaves the house.
2 hours later the mother is brutally dead & of coarse the young man is convicted & sent to prison for trial   all along he keeps sayin he had an alibi by a scientist doctor who gave him a lift by his car that particular night   but that witness was no where to be found & after a while the son was hanged the flash backs are over  back to reality where miss marple & the family of 5 children , their father & his fiancÃ©e ( miss marple's friend ) are happily spending the evening doing sharades & hanging around so Merrily  when a scientist doctor spots an old newspaper & reads that a young man was hanged due to killing his mom 2 years ago he comes in a rainy night to this family's night to reveal a dark secret   appearing like a ghost out of the windows where they all gathered & telling them that their long dead brother was with him around 8,30 which is the same time of the murder of their dead mother taking place , so there is no way he was the murderer & they all discover that if their dead brother isn't the one , so it's one of them  & the mystery goes on & on & gets more thrilling & full of surprises i love reading , i would support novels brought to movies , novels are harder than a 90 minutes screen adapted novel to some people ,though novels are more deep full of details & depth that no way a movie can deliver  but on the other hand a movie is easier to understand for young people, easier to watch especially for a whole new generation of Agatha Cristie's young fans  back to the movie ... i think it's done very well , miss Geraldine's acting is always awesome i love the way she does it .. the acting , her custom's ,the way she always repeat the word '' dear'' in many lines in the script makes u feel like she 's ur own granny lol  the casting of the family was wonderful & very suitable , the 2 sisters Kirsten & Hester are wonderful actors especially the younger one kirsten , she is a very sensible actress , the brothers jacko ( the thought to be murderer of his mother is wonderful ), the other brothers were so right in their own places , the lake where a suicide takes place was original ,the house & the stormy weather helped much in the belief of the realism   i don't think the movie is crap on the contrary i think if u r free for the weekend & it's on TV try catchin it or rent it if available , u'll enjoy
Its true that not many of the characters are very likable but actually the Argyle family were a rather tortured bunch in the novel too becoming more so after the revelation that it was not Jacko after all who killed the mother figure.
But soon after watching the first episode, excitement turned quickly to disappointment and boredom.
I always knew that Patrick Swayze could dance but,this was so revealing as to how well he does,even after all the injuries that he has been through.
This must've been after numerous bottles of vodka, because I don't see how you ever can earnestly even give attention to this product.
Believe me: if you hate yourself, are in a really sick mood or seek for some stimuli to throw up (for instance after a wild party) - go see this film.
The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was.
Don't get me wrong I watched this show a lot, I hated it with a passion but I watched it a lot because it was like watching a car wreck I couldn't believe this show was being broadcast night after night, and the interviews weren't much better you could practically see in their eyes that every guest was thinking about standing up and walking out and shouting "what the flying hell is wrong with you!!"
-- falls flatter than Debra Messing as one unfit comic after another tries to deliver abysmal, uninsightful and fatally unengaged material with the sort of utter absence of screen presence you expect only from German accountants talking about the decline of the euro, and Ben Mulroney.
and I still remember going to school after watching it the night before and all the girls in my class were buzzing about it.
Looking at the cover photo now after all these years makes me laugh.
It has that kind of after school special meets feature film look to it.
I am not sure what in gods name made me think I needed to have this movie in my collection, but after watching it again for the 15th million time, I REMEMBER.
I just some how got it and understood exactly what Jessie was going through, and I saw it 10 years after it came out!
I watched Star Trek TOS everyday after elementary school in the 1970's, so much so that after a few years I had managed to see every episode but two.
Returning to this film after twenty years to watch it with my three year old daughter reminded me why that was.
And oddly enough, the brilliance of this movie and the way these scenes are written by Charles Schulz and they way they are animated by Melendez in his team makes you admire these scenes after the inevitable happy ending (that's really no spoiler considering this is a kids' movie).
This sets him off on a quest to find his previous owner Lila,which comes about after Lila writes to Snoopy from the hospital,asking him to visit her.
But after a short while I realized there are many sad parts in it, especially the good bye party.
Snoopy gets to the hospital after a journey full of NO DOGS ALLOWED signs.
Snoopy goes to Lila and while leaving his Doghouse with the "For sale or to let" sign on it Woodstock runs after him crying while we can hear this really sad song in the background which later Charlie Brown is singing in his deep depression.
Charlie Brown has been becoming ever more resentful of Snoopy's recent independence (in particular going to the beach to spend time with Peppermint Patty), and, after cutting his thumb while trying to open his can of dog-food, he gives Snoopy a scolding and makes him feel guilty and worthless.
But of the dozens of Peanuts specials- and the short-lived television series- this is one of the better ones, as there are some moments that still stick in my mind many years after seeing it.
But still, shortly after watching it, that title has a point... 10/10.
With this in mind, and viewing this film a half century after it was made, the sense of history it provides is its most powerful attribute.
The Quiet American is not one of the greatest Greene books, coming after the successes of the Thirties and Forties, but it is a very entertaining read.
By contrast, this film, released in 1958 at the height of the cold war and just after the McCarthy era, could not afford to appear anti-American.
Actually, the evil family is menacing and extremely sinister - after Dean infiltrates their homestead, they beat him and burn him with a red-hot fire-poker.
The rest just wallows in constant sleaze (so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it) and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine.
However, after reading "The Ghastly One" (one of the best biographies ever) and seeing this, a sexploitation drama he made, I completely bite my tongue.
Seeing Paul Gross,after his role in Due South,is quite a change.
This 1989 French film was justifiably so popular that an American re-make followed later and then a cable television series followed after that.
Yes, after having read my fellow IMDb:ers comments I feel I have to set the story straight!
Things just happen in this movie and they happen way too quickly after each other.
All in all I just can't believe that they actually made a third movie after this.
The expressions on Kajol face when she meets Rihan after having here eyes in her house not knowing him are also very good, the illusion she has is nicely filmed.
Here comes the silent message and the sad end (as the name suggests) where Zooni has to choose between right or wrong, between the life with her son and lover/husband who has returned after years or the country's wellbeing that is in danger if Rehan succeeds in his plan.
I had a lot of expectations after Aamir's totally awesome Rang De Basanti and Kunal Kohli's Hum Tum.
The next 90 minutes were worse than the first 90.. i never imagined that could be possible but it was... i ceased to exist as an individual after that movie and now roam the roads of New York like a homeless bum..
I really have seen porno films with a better story line than this..and that too after they copied it from a great novel.. SCREW BOLLYWOOD..  and aamir khan is supposed to be good and he doesn't act in any movie, he picks and chooses the best.. if this is the best, i want to see the ones he rejects.. Wow, if that was possible..  3 hrs of crap with icing on it..ENJOY..
But after 10 minutes, it started giving me a headache.
All that remains now is for the girl and boy to get married and remain happily ever after.
A friend of mine actually spoiled the whole fun of the movie after reading out some reviews and using her own deductions.
A great made after the comedy Hum Tum.
I even liked KANK but after I saw Fanaa I think its a way different film and making its mark separate from all films from past.
Aamir after RDB and Kajol after a long break.
I'm not a movie expert but I know when there's something to watch, and something to just pass by, and this movie here, after reading the comments peaked my interest, but once I got the movie playing it was a totally different thought.
Kunal Kohli is an extremely sensitive director and while there may have been slip ups in pace here and there (it was an emotional rather than an action packed movie after all) on the whole the movie shows a director of competence and someone who has a very bright future.
In addition, this is Kajol's first film after a self-imposed hiatus, while Aamir Khan, paired with her here for the first time, is also seen infrequently on screen due to his reputed fastidiousness in choosing movie projects.
The storyÂas much as I can divulge in a reviewÂstarts off in fairly formulaic boy-meets-girl fashion: Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol), a beautiful blind Kashmiri young woman, comes to the big city (New Delhi, in this case) for the very first time, after having lived a sheltered, happy life in a pristine little town in Kashmir.
The schoolteacher first laid eyes on Tina in her flat, bawling her eyes out after an animated conversation on the phone.
Of course, our heroine makes one mistake after another, but shouldn't somebody around her see how lonely she is?
Her shyness and painfully embarrassing inability to read people makes for one social and career error after another.
Oh and I figured out how the lady (who is without oxygen for a substantial amount of time) lives after the explosion of the lab which...gently opens that hatch door.
The only time is was OK for anyone to put a growling noise against a shark was at the end of Jaws when they played an old dinosaur roar for the sinking great white after it had been blown-up.
I've seen this movie,and i said to my self after about 45 min in to the movie,what is this i'm watching?.
Star Wars: film opens with alien space ship passing before camera   The Abyss: incidental appearance of nuclear attack submarine unfriendly commando(s) underwater research station aliens at the bottom of the ocean Operatic music when aliens appear husband and wife together in underwater base   Deep Blue Sea: smart sharks that are team players   Jaws: the beach scene, including water-level camera angle   Jaws2: aircraft gets attacked by shark   Alien: blue collar crewmen, sassing the female boss   Aliens Pvt Hudson & the unwilling tech guy ("Game over man", vs. "I'm not going out there")   The Black Hole cowardly dude gets what's coming after stealing the escape pod  Leviathan: sunken cargo ship with dangerous cargo symbolical breaking to helpless support ship  and lots, lots more.
One such shot of reporters falling into the water after their 25+ foot boat is attacked and sunk by a (as in one) 'raging' shark.
Fanny became a much more human personality after watching this play/comedy/drama and I felt very sympathetic to her even though she was obviously an extremely difficult person to live with.
We should be able to forgive Chuck if this one seems weak compared to his most famous work; after all, everyone had to start somewhere.
she gets robbed by two hitch-hikers, she's put into prison because she ain't got a passport anymore, a policeman rapes her and she kills him after that and escapes with a prisoner...
Poor Yvette has one of those days which justifies the age-old clichÃ© "sometimes it's better to stay home in bed": her car is stolen by a creepy backwoods hick nutjob (an intense, jittery Robert Carradine, who's genuinely frightening in a rare full-blooded sicko fruitcake part), she's wrongly put in the hoosegow by the local yokel cops after loutish bartender Britt Leach tries to sexually assault her, kills one particularly unpleasant hillbilly fuzzball after he brutally rapes her (the rape scene itself is quite graphic and upsetting), breaks out of jail and subsequently goes on the lam with tough, but tender-hearted career criminal Tommy Lee Jones.
The Spikes Gang was made back in the days when Ron Howard was your prototypical golly gee whiz teenager, just a number of months after American Graffiti, and in the same year which Howard's TV sitcom Happy Days premiered.
Howard stayed with his acting career for awhile after this, through the 70s, but he never really broke out of that mold.
But Fleming is wise enough to know when to calm things down, and indeed the more sedate scenes have a greater impact after the usual flurry of action.
Mary Brian is gorgeous as the loved but lonely heroine from Vermont, stranded and alone in a world so wide open and unpredictable that Coop's presence (after much deliberation) proves warm and protective.
Amitabh Bachchan's Mrityudatta Vinod Khanna's Insaaf Dimple Kapadia's Saagar Mumtaz'as Aandhiyaan and Kajol'Fanna are names you cannot erase from your memory since the celebrated actors returned to the big screen after a hiatus.
You expect the songs to linger in your memory even after the show has endedÂ that's what makes a musical tick, right?
In fact, it's a treat to watch Madhuri and Akshaye together, after a hiatus.
The Movie Scores Big Time And its Incredibly Great Performances by Kunal, Konkona (Paired Again after LCMD) Good thing for them having BACK TO BACK Releases from a banner like Yash Raj!
Now after all these yrs..She is coming back to Shamli.
Full credit to Madhuri to have maintained her so well even after having 2 kids.
Just like in Devdas, she has performed excellent as expected in this movie after a period of R&R.
The director showed that even when a man is "jilted at the alter", he can forgive his love even after 11 years apart.
But, I just wanted to see if Madhuri Dixit has lost the grace and charm after the break.
The movie is fantastic.An excellent comeback from Madhuri after 5 years.The story is brilliant.It opens when Dia a dance teacher works in USA with her family.One day she gets a call that her dance instructor is dead.And wants her to come back to Ajanta.She comes back.The old Ajanta is being converted to a shopping mall.Its now dia turn to save this.At the end she does a few dances which attracts peoples.She wins their hearts.An enjoyable family movie.Madhuri was superb.Divvya was superb.Konkana was superb.Kunal looked hot and was awesome.Irfan was superb.Akshaye was wonderful.Ranvir Vinay add humour and were funny.Direction is wonderful.Cinematography is excellent.Chereography is wonderful.The music is faboulous and superb.The lyrics are wonderful and so is the picturisations.A must see Rating-10/10
She returns to India after several years when she hears the news of her dying guru.
As the would be love birds plot on each other and cheat on one another with their new girlfriends, we, the audience are subjected (treated) to vulgar atrocity after outrageous one-liner after obscene sex act, a delightful little movie indeed.
The film does get a bit boring after Divine's rape by Lobstora, but the ending shows the lust for violence found in Vietnam Era America, juxtaposed with Kate Smith's "God Bless America" playing in the background.
No one in this movie ever has the appropriate reaction to any situation.I recently attended an Eyeball Stabbing Convention, and I must say it was most refreshing after watching this monstrous filth.
They take every dramatic scene, blow it out of proportion - as is the convention of Bollywood standards - and keep showing it long after it has exhausted all its dramatic potential.
However, Ruby soon discovers that her new foster parents are after the siblings' $4 million trust fund.
They now make perfect sense (in the same way that the songs of KKHH also improved after watching the movie)  The look of the film, the humour, the choreography, the set direction, the cinematography, the everything of this movie are outstanding.
The dimpled darling's increasing demand in Bollywood is natural after she delivers such good performances.
W0w, This movie is great, I watched just bit of it when it released, It was real sad, that I couldn't finish it, but now after about 1 year I determined to watch it no matter what, and I really loved it.
But the songs grew on me after watching them on screen.
She sleeps around a lot, dumps her boyfriends after one month, and in one particularly annoying scene, hears a song she likes on the radio, turns it up, and starts dancing wildly, much to Claire's bemusement.
The cast is headed by Elizabeth Hurley, who after giving birth to a son, took some time away from her own films.
The story is, as described by others, a story within a story which interchanges time to time - an actress back into the world of acting after a few year's hiatus (due to tragedies).
Even the scenes in the movie that Rebecca is staring in come across more convincing and realistic, then those that are supposed to be not before the camera, with Rebbecca and Jake having their affair rekindled after three years.In fact the love scenes that take place in the movie with Rebecca and Jake, playing their roles of Belle and her lover Ray, are far more hotter and convincing then the ones where their in bed and getting it on as Rebecca and Jake.
Rebecca Fairbanks (Hurley) is finally returning to the silver screen, after a three year absence, in the role of serial murderess Belle Gunnes.
Jill tells Glenn that he needs to go to the toilet, he says he doesn't need to but she replies that she can smell him from where she's sitting... she asks Don to go in with him because he wearing a nappy, Don goes in after him, both look awkwardly at each other.
He is however called on one last mission to which he remains extremely suspicious even after he is told that he is going to enter a virtual reality world created by the pentagon with the purpose of simulating war games.
Hobbes also gains an unlikely companion in Michael Pinnocchio who robs him of his wedding ring minutes after entering Harsh Realm and continuously threatens to eat Hobbes' dog, Dexter.
I was dismayed and confused by the fact that Fox canceled the series after the 3rd (yes, THIRD) episode....
But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season.
James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony.
Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks.
Instead, Chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony, his wife, and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week (or should I say month after month.
Or is it year after year?
And my # 2 most favorite character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti.
Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him.
My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed right after shooting Christopher.
I mean, after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster, u thought to yourself: OK he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster's skin.
But after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life, I mean I could almost feel the pain he "made" us believe he was going through.
It should be a subject in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay waked until the episode ends, so now I bought the all Episodes in DVD format and I am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and I am getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break.
Try to keep your composure after about the 10th shot of her staring at him with that sad, pouty face and lips that look like they're about to explode collagen everywhere.
In conclusion, a great movie which succeeds to give its message, all the more crucial actually after the tragedy in Asia....
I was in a state of just *awe* for 1+ days after seeing it.
It made me feel a lot like how i felt after "Escape from Sobibor."
People comment that the director is confused over what he wants the movie to portray as - politically-minded "message movie", or romantic epic .. but its OK for it to be multifaceted isn't it, after all our life is not about dealing single issues at a time...... its a jumble .
Chronologically situated between The World in his Arms and Blackbeard the Pirate, and a year after the fine adventure Distant Drums (1951), this is a Raoul Walsh minor but right western, play by soft Rock Hudson and beautiful Julie Adams.
I like Angelina Jolie even more after seeing this movie.
I'm sure a lot of people had sex just after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Are we meant to applaud Sarah (Jolie) for not wearing perfume after Nick's ridicule, even when we can see faint traces of mascara on her drooping eyelids as she broods in Chechnya?
Nick, after all, is as irrational as Sarah.
Well I thought that the story in general was very appropriate after what has happened in Asia and the war in Irac.
Now, after reading about the genocide in Rwanda in a book entitled "Shake Hands with the Devil" by Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, I am convinced that I can do something, anything, at least on some level.
For once in a movie she is being sought after and plays the ingÃ©nue to perfection, unlike most of her famous ventures where she is nursing crazy protagonists.
why don't people who collapse face-first in a bowl of porridge drown after a few hours?)
- the cop who's chasing after the hero.
He discovers that some ominous beings are coming after him.
Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece.
Also is Murdoch's estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out.
Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does.
You'll sit there thinking about life after viewing this film.
I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.
Now I admired the director Wolfgang Petersen after seeing DAS BOOT.
Meanwhile, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is hiding after an attack on the ship where he must reunite with his family before they end up victims to Ivan's plan if the president doesn't release a Russian prisoner who happens to be a general and a terrorist.
But after one terrorist (Gary Oldman) hijacks the Air Force One and the president's wife and daughter, maybe he will have to rethink his position.
To right the wrong that the first president Bush did when he kept Saddam Hussein in power after the Gulf War?
To mollify the American people, so many of whom naturally felt a great need after 9/11 to see some kind of action taken, any action to Show Strength, like a bull whirling around, swinging its horns at anything near.
Nothing about concern or freedom for the Iraqi people, something that came stage center only after the other reasons for the war were exposed as bald-faced lies.
Extremely well done...In the form that it was, after the event as it were...Quite startling.
The film follows Ruby Baker and her little brother recently orphaned after the parents death from a tragic car accident.
The best thing about this film is that it documents the subtle changes over time by showing our leaders speaking at various times before and after our invasion of Iraq.
But after used to it, I found it to be more real.
All I'd like to say about Universal-International's The Land Unknown is that three navy men and a woman reporter land accidentally in a warm spot in Antartica with their helicopter stuck for 30 days during which time they encounter some dinosaurs and another man who had survived there for 10 years from another expedition after his three crew members died there.
Soon after this, the film turns typical Dasgupta.
However, after reading the comments of Hunterdu below, I'd like to offer my own two cents -- not because I think he's wrong per se, but because I think he's unnecessarily nasty and unfair with his comments.
I think the best way to close is to quote a personal e-mail I received from Frank Darabont (the director of "The Shawshank Redemption") after he saw it:  "Message to Natalie and Doug: Just saw SHARKTANK and loved it.
I just want to say after reading some of the "critics" responses to this documentary if you ever wondered about what exactly a gay family is this is the documentary to see.
We were very blessed to be on the first cruise ever of its kind like this and have enjoyed each year after that on this cruise.
Probably because I stopped paying close attention after ten minutes.
A moderately effective thriller featuring a capable performance by Leelee Sobieski as a teenage girl who, along with her younger brother, is taken in by a couple of old family friends after the mysterious deaths of her parents.
Though after factoring in this "film's" collection of some of the least talented "actors" (although I'm still convinced they were pulled directly from a local High School Theatre 101 class), we decided that a worse film script might be possible...but it would be impossible to purposely find a worse cast.
Usually when a really old Disney VHS gets put in, after the logos and such, something boring was to follow!
Christian faith can be like that to someone who comes to believe in it after believing in some other philosophy (such as atheism) for some time.
Sorry to sound like Scrooge, but after seeing these films once again in the late '90s, I did not particularly enjoy this late '60s Disney movie favorite, nor its sequels.
In the film, we learn rather quickly that race car driver Jim Douglas(Dean Jones) has hit rock bottom after being a prominent race car driver(what caused his demise?
Herbie gets impounded after an accident and Jim must sell him to a Chinese man who agrees to let Jim drive Herbie in a big race.
Somehow, after a night of binging in some of the local pharmaceuticals and a very rank nude scene with Sandra, he is a new man.
Although it is obvious that the money interests wanted him out of the way, the murder was performed with an arrow to feign an Indian attack, so the local police somehow decide to arrest a taciturn Indian who "hangs himself" in his cell after signing a full confession.
Well, as luck would have it, they are captured by indigenous people - the very ones they were seeking - and after some negotiations the tribe finally agrees to advance the plot somewhat:  1.
This movie and especially on the BONUS part...the making of Un Dimanche a Kigali, JUST THIS PART IS WORTH IT, where the producers, directors and actors talk about the condition 10 years later after the genocide.
The result means there are some contrived plot turns and certainly variations in the graininess of the film stock (since 1982 was still well before the enhanced computer graphics we see today), but the film is still quite a kick after a quarter-century.
The story of a diverse handful of survivors adrift in the Atlantic after their ship is torpedoed, it represents one of the technical and narrative challenges that Hitchcock at the time was beginning to impose on himself.
This Hitchcock film, made soon after he burst into prominence in America with films like "Rebecca" and "Suspicion," is a lot of fun, but it's ultimately more of a technical experiment than it is a satisfying narrative film, much like "Rope" would be 4 years later.
What about later, after Willy (Walter Slezak) is exposed as a scheming Nazi captain deftly maneuvering the boat to his own country's supply ship?
The director's full frame profile is used for the before and after comparison, prompting numerous viewers of the time to inquire where they could buy the product, but of course it was all made up.
It was interesting to me that the first time one gets a view of the entire open sea is right after it's revealed that Mrs. Higley's (Heather Angel) baby is dead.
There is plenty- from a shellshocked woman tied to a chair after her baby is buried at sea, to an amputation performed by a Nazi during a rising storm, to the experience of being in a leaky boat caught between two ships that are shelling each other- this movie was a much harsher ride than I expected, and makes me respect the genius of Hitchcock even more than I already did.
Each has surprised you, possibly disappointed you, and definitely made sure that you will REMEMBER them as a person, not as a "type," long after the movie is over.  
Tallu's lusting after sexy hot hunk, John Hodiak, well its almost X rated, note the way she caresses his pecs!!!
Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.
Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.
In one of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest films, six people with different personalities and backgrounds are stranded together in a lifeboat after the passenger-carrying freighter they are on is sunk by a German u-boat in the Mid-Atlantic.
The camera work is extremely effective because it conveys the hard voyage these survivors undertook after their Trans Atlantic ship was attacked by a German U boat.
The motley crew that gets on board after the shipwreck presents an assortment of people so different, but joined together by their predicament.
We see a glamorous reporter who manages to be in the boat by herself right after the wreck.
Gus, the injured sailor can't do much more but rely on happy moments in order to keep sane after his terrible predicament.
In a way, the ending is completely anti-climatic as the survivors realize Willy, the captain has steered them into a trap, but at the same time, after they watch the other German ship destroyed by an Allied vessel, they rescue a sailor, who threatens them, but is easily overpowered.
The story begins with Hardin (Rock Hudson) being released from prison after serving 16 of 25 years for murder.
Ready to surrender to the law after his planned marriage, Hardin is double-crossed and...........................................  Rock Hudson, on the verge of becoming a super star, turns in an excellent performance as the troubled Hardin.
Final third flags after so much Cagneyesque energy, and older national vices, such as theatricality and stiff upper lip, do briefly intrude, but on the whole, this is a British film of rare ambition.
and yes after you see Hoskins in this role you will be like Bob is the man!
Some of the violence in The Long Good Friday is very graphic; the scene in which Harold (Bob Hoskins) ends up glassing his sidekick Jeff (Derek Thompson) after the latter had betrayed him is VERY nasty.
I've got to be honest and say that first seeing this in 1983 I was shocked by the clever twist of making the IRA as the bad guys but having watched the movie a few more times over the years the radical idea of having the provos muscling in on the London underworld isn't as clever a plot as I first thought and once you know who's been putting the pressure on Harold Shand and his corporation the story becomes a little threadbare after multiple viewings .
The support cast has many future TV and Film stars who turn up every few minutes:Gillian Taylforth,Paul Freeman,Dexter Fletcher,Paul Barber,Karl Howman and Derek Thompson among them.The most notable of all is Pierce Brosnan,in a one word role as a IRA hit-man.It is Brosnan who appears with Hoskins in the film final and most memorable scene.The infamous abattoir sequence (with Shand's rival gang members hung upside down on meat hooks) is unforgettably horrifying and darkly funny,along with Harold's apocalyptic rage after finding out of the IRA's campaign against him.
The merging of past and present stars is very effective and like Roger Rabbit which came after it's a job in itself to spot whose in it and what film that were originally in.
A British ganglord (Bob Hoskins) finds his empire crumbling after 10 years of peace...and just as he's about to make a very lucarative deal with the U.S. Mafia.
After watching the film after a good many years it still holds the power to shock, amuse and thrill.
Ho Nam's love for Smartie had never been forgotten after her death.
He changed his life after her life.
Ho Nam had developed into a more mature person after seeing the repercussions of his triad lifestyle.
Disc 2:  Disc 2 contains a number of rehearsals plus a piece on what a nightmare it was to work with Chuck Berry on this project (which was, after all, to celebrate himself!).
If there was any doubt who the father of rock 'n' roll was, with all due respect to the King, there is none after watching this absorbing, if incomplete, biopic about Chuck Berry.
I saw this a few years after it came out.
It is obvious from reading the liner notes of the DVD that the writer/director changed the script on the fly (including the addition of the silly twist ending), probably after a late night session bulls^H^H^H^H^Hbrainstorming with the actors.
The funny teaming of Carl Reiner and Steve Martin after The Jerk(1979), brought you a funny send up of private eye films of the 1940's, but instead of it being just a simple spoof, the filmmakers went further, on having old film footage of great actors like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Alan Ladd, and Humphrey Bogart for Steve Martin to play off of.
This movie makes fun of those stereotypes, and in the process gives you the chance for introspection after the film.
Speaking of which...if you watch this in the theater, be sure to stay all the way to end after the final credits roll.
I was sad to see the original Marc be played by someone new (and not as good looking), but after I found out the guy was in the short film "Crush", I definitely had a better impression of him (I loved that short film!).
Yes, there is a totally unbelievable plot, but this is a farce, after all.
When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut.
Russell Crowe deserves all the success he gets after this film - he was BRILLIANT.
The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle.
They probably could have cut about 30 mins of footage, but after seeing Mike Wallace freak out...I can understand the length.
That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else.
And after two and a half hours of manipulating the interview finally IS broadcast.
After watching this film, it became apparent why Crowe was so reluctant to play the role of Maximus in "Gladiator" after acting the part of Jeffrey Wigand.
Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers, a major tobacco company.
when i've watched "Barda" i was expecting' a quality tension movie but i was disappointed when i saw it.instead of tension i just felt boredom.the story of the movie goes like this  a group of armed bank robbers entered to a bar after the robbery.few minutes later they took few customers in the bar as hostages and after that they begun torturing them until the night's over and cops bust in and arrest all of them  That wasn't the film which makers promised in it's trailers.Film completely filled with torture,beating,rape and murder.i still wonder how could they charge people to see a humans in the movie getting tortured,humiliated and so on.
If the movie did not end the way it did and the audience left the movie with the realistic consequences of a brutal event's after(not left with the relief that the bad got what they deserved), it could be much affective to establish the sense that the director passionately believed.
You see that they do not come out of the blue, instead they are created by the system and after having been victimized to the point of losing their humanity , they turn up in the scene to respond to all this, and their response does not have a particular aim, it is nothing but the fight for existence, the timing of the response completely depends on the threshold of the ability to stand more of it/or not.
"It's only after you lose everything that you are free to do anything" (quote from fight club) Selim and his gang have nothing to lose, so they are free -actually they think they are free to do anything; because what else they can lose?
Just as Undeclared, which also got canceled after one season, this show is a stroke of genius which every fan of a good TV-show and yet every fan of something good at all, should watch.
While it was canceled by NBC after its first run, it also happens to be, in my opinion, one of the finest shows that they have ever committed to the small screen.
Our primary protagonists are the Weir children, Lindsay, a good girl who befriends the freaks after a troubling event and, Sam, her younger brother, who is firmly cast into the geek category.
Cancelled after 12 episodes in 1999-2000, some years later James Poniewozik of Time magazine named it as one of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.
The implication was that she'd decided there were no rewards for being a good person after witnessing her grandmother dying, but clearly she was not comfortable being a Freak, at least not until later episodes when the Freaks seemed to develop some genuine affection for her.
Lindsay's parents forbid her from hanging out with them after she crashed their car but at the end of the episode she goes back to them and nothing changes.
The fact that NBC stopped this series after one season only is a true testament to the sad state of television these days.
While "Saved by the Bell" might have been the only show to be quite successful with it (though only after significant retooling of the original series, "Good Morning Mrs. Bliss would NBC even agree to pick up the show), my guess is that this show may have initially had a difficult time finding a loyal audience in the crucial early days of the show.
You'd think they'd have learned after the uproar following Dr. Beckett's death not to go around killing off major characters.
I tried not to read it too much after that.
The morning after I watched this barrel scraped 'slasher'; I woke up to a hefty Â£200 pound fine for unpaid parking tickets that I was unaware that I had ever received.
I expected more chemistry between Penn and Cage, they are both, after all, Fast Times alums!
Ward was great to watch and Martin was annoying after awhile.
Apparently their work together on this series made McGavin and Reynolds lifelong enemies and poor Burt was replaced by Noah Berry (Rockford's dad and Davy Crockett's sidekick) after the first season.
But being a big SCI-FI buff and not wanting to jump to conclusions after the first minutes of viewing I decided to show mercy and watched it to the end, thinking it might become better as it went along.
Different scenes after each other more often than not doesn't really connect to each other, it seems like something totally unexplainable or unmotivated seems to happen in some vain attempt to connect them.
Or it might be that after suffering through the incoherent mess it doesn't even end properly, just with a quote that so begun the Ice Planet Archives.
As shown here, the real John Wesley Hardin was shot in the back in a saloon after his release from prison.
What was added on was a scene with wife Julie Adams and Gentry loading the wounded Rock on the back of a buckboard and after a bit of dialog they ride off in the sunset.
Four teens renovate it as an after hours nightclub, unknowingly releasing Jimmy's tortured spirit.
The comic relief in the later half also reminds us (after some darker parts) that this film is not to be taken seriously at all.
Bones is no Se7en but after a healthy start, it deserved better.  
It's good that the people behind "Police Squad" did not give up on it after it failed to fit within the confines of standard TV concepts around the same time.
Why he chose that moment to take his revenge, or why he goes after the teens is unclear.
I was doubtful about this movie when I went to the cinema to watch it last weekend, but after having watched it I reinforce my good opinion about the products made by New Line Cinema.
"O Beautiful" a complicated high drama poignantly and accurately portrays gay male teenage angst, which is very traumatic and difficult to deal with especially when occurring right after the barbarous heinous act of a gay bashing.
As one would expect, the quality of the images after 28 years of sitting on the shelf is not good.
I believe Ray was involved with the original film, and ended up with the rights after some litigation, and elected to make the revisions with new footage.
The show is about a Mexican mobster, Miguel Cadena (Yancey Arias) who takes over the family business after he has the acting boss (Jacob Vargas - Traffic) shot up beyond recognition by guys with Uzis, and the original boss who was on the run, shot twice in the forehead by a .50 Desert Eagle automatic.
The second story is called "O Beautiful" and tells the story of a young gay man who is attacked and sexually molested by a group of homophobic men in a New Jersey cornfield, and is then rescued by one of his attackers who returns after everyone else leaves.
Kingpin is well written, well acted, and unlike most movies or series, actually causes you to think about it after you've watched it.
I became more and more interested in the DEA's part in the series, after Delia Flores got mixed up in the investigation into "Truck" Thompson and his narcotics officer cousin, Rolando Porter.
I thought perhaps America was not ready for that, but after seeing the "admirable" qualities of the beloved Sopranos I now ask-Why not?  
You think that after this point his whole life will change and he'll do anything to prevent the oil company from drilling and destroying the territory he loves to play and hunt in.
it's also possible that his venture into feature films came after he reached his peak.
They moved there after Hurricane Rita destroyed their home in Cameron.
It is an Easter-Asian movie, and i decided to watch quite a few others after this one.
Ray Miland plays a fop who is after Paulette Goddard who only has eyes for John Wayne.
As she uncovers the mostly gross secrets of her uncle's life and building, she begins to lose her mind under the strain, though someone in the background might be after her, as well.
I saw this film first soon after it came to cable and before I knew much about Jennifer Jason-Leigh or had come to appreciate the power this amazing young actress can exude in the careful and often understated nuances she brings to her craft.
For being a short film it will keep you thinking about the subject and message for days after watching.
I would also recommend seeing it with a group of people, because it's very interesting to gauge everyone's different reaction right after viewing the film, there's sure to be opinions ranging from emphatic agreement to stern disapproval, but that's what's great about it.
The film description mentions a surprise ending, but you still won't be prepared for it; it will leave you thinking about the ramifications of this issue long after the screen goes black.
The students instead seek Fang Gang for advice, and after some soul searching, our hero takes on the mantle that will later be carried by the likes of Louis Gosset Jr. in the Iron Eagle series, and helps the youngsters in their quest.
It was my first color movie and the scenes with the giant octopus gave me nightmares for a long time after.
He is a complex character and it is good to his emotional complications played out on screen, especially after the final battle during a celebration.
But after you see this early work, you'll understand that Lynch has been weird for over forty years...
However, after hearing Connie call the police for an 'abandoned girl' Natty runs away, unable to wait until Sol sends for her.
Oh and the DVD did jitter but settled down after clean ?, and it was letterbox for the widescreen so I didn't have to suffer amputation.
The one (1) thing we never understood about CB is that he left many (BETTER) projects go fallow after investing money and time developing them.
It is after this brief but telling moment that he realizes, as we do, there is no decision to be made and Sol accepts the work in Seattle.
Cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in The Sure Thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well.
The film's story follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner in his best role and perfermance), a Treasury officer who is sent from D.C. to Chicago during Prohibition to enforce the law and discovers after a raid that there's corruption in the city's police force.
If you think about it then it's a real life story and that's the real ending... well not quite actually Al got out of the prison few years later because of a disease and lived happily ever after.
I never could quite reconcile Kevin Costner's somewhat-high and weak voice with some of macho characters he played when he was younger, but I can get past that after a film has settled into the story.
Costner is a good enough actor to make me believe he's anyone after awhile.
However, after years of growing up watching Robert Stack playing "Elliot Ness" on TV on the hit series, "The Untouchables," it took me a bit to accept Costner in that role.
And of course Frank Nitti lived for over a decade after Capone was jailed.
Many looked upon what Ness was trying to do as an exercise in futility, but he never gave up, and went after Capone with everything he had, which wasn't much beyond his own guts and determination to `do some good.'
The bureau responded by sending Ness (Kevin Costner) an accountant, Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who first had the idea of going after Capone for income tax evasion.
It's a perfect part for Connery, whose rugged appearance and demeanor are entirely convincing; he's got that somewhat cynical, world-wise and weary manner of a man who has seen it all, but lets you know that underneath he still holds out hope that some day in some way, right will win out after all.
It is also odd seeing Wayne (on his way to super-stardom after STAGECOACH, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME, and DARK COMMAND) in a supporting role, as was Hayward.
Well what to say about Aquaman, First I thought it was some kind of Joke after watching the Aquaman silliness in the super show Entourage.
Or how many times A.C.'s hair comes out perfectly mussed up after being in the water.
The Smallville pilot was weak, but after some tweaks they strengthened the characters and improved on production values of that show.
John Stockwell and Michael Dudikoff star as two private dicks who emerge from a fallout shelter in the future after the bomb has dropped, once there we witness our two heroes fight mutants, midgets, cannibal hippies and a terrorist group, they've also grown up on 50's style literature and music so their whole "Gee whiz" attitude contradicts the mean world outside.
Michael Dudikoff who would become a B.movie level star after American Ninja, really grates the nerves as his over the top shrieking never approaches the funny but always is annoying.
(See City Limits, which is even worse than this) Also there is no action which is the only way one can handle such a movie premise, after all it's about two sleuths who save the world, give us some action!
The ending is somewhat diverting but once again this is a movie that has a great first act and nothing but sheer boredom after.
While my advice to Dudikoff's most curious fans,is to stick with Avenging Force, American Ninja, The Silencer and American Ninja 2 after all those at least offer action.
It was after all a pilot, so they were setting up the story lines.
The concept of this...for lack of a better word, Film is the story of two guys raised in a bomb shelter after being kidnapped by bank robbers Fat Guy from Cool Hand Luke, and Other Guy not in Cool Hand Luke.
Tomas Milian plays Interpol officer Tomas Ravelli, who finds himself on the trail of a gang of crooks after a botched robbery which left a police officer dead reveals that one of them is using the same gun that was used to kill his wife years earlier.
Although it's not his case, Ravelli goes after the criminals anyway to gain revenge for what they did to his wife.
i think fox is making a mistake if they cancel this show after 5 seasons, which would be a huge loss, the sixth season has a lot of potential story lines which would be interesting to see.
But Fox kept moving this sitcom around to different slots and Bernie Mac's movie career began taking off which is why I thought led to the show's cancellation after five seasons.
Bogey, fourth billed here, plays Chuck Martin, an inveterate hood who is released from Sing Sing after a five-year stretch and returns to his old ways back in the big city.
He could be any ex-con coming home after a stint in Sing Sing.
I do like to show this film to friends after they've seen John Ford's "Mary of Scotland" just so they can be amazed at Moroni Olsen's range.
George Raft and Humphrey Bogart after a stretch in prison are getting out together.
Shortly after this Bryan married Rexall Drug founder Justin Dart.
McQueen was after some of the most dangerous fellows in the old west, plenty who could shoot a lot better than he.
The action unfolds in 2010, almost 15 years after the world has blown itself up, Only one missile born nuclear weapon is left, and whatever mutant survivor holds the Keys to its launch controls will have the power of ultimate obliteration.
They've got the keys, they've also got the whole Punk District of Edge City after them!
Life after the bomb is just one big blast!
You will be inspired by one woman's courage to follow through, and will never be able to feel self-pity or make excuses you can't do something great with your own life after watching this series.
"'s becomes really annoying after a while.
This "thing" is a history lesson, with an after dinner philosophy mint (stale at that) and a dramatic ending pasted on the last four minutes.
Turning to the daughter after the mother rejects him, the story veers into tragedy.
This horrible piece of dreck belongs on Andorran Public Broadcasting on Sunday night, just after the documentary on the making of Roquefort cheese.
It is a fun thing to remember, that the little girl main actress in this film was really crying in the lap of her real mother after the movie was over and while there was a standing ovation.
Its quite ironic that this film and others before it echoed the fears of the whole planet but not long after its release the political climate started to change and it seemed the threat of nuclear war would finally be gone.
To De Oliveira's naysayers, I suggest watch at least these opening minutes immediately after the film's final frames.
John Stockwell and Michael Dudikoff are utterly engaging as Phillip and Marlowe, a pair of cloddish, wet-behind-the-ears, pork-pie hat and trenchcoat-wearing innocents who pattern themselves after laconically cool private eyes after spending most of their lives reading pulpy crime thriller books in a subterranean nuclear fall-out shelter.
The key folks who mercilessly chase after our boys are lethally enticing, cold-blooded fugitive dame Miles Archer (marvelously played to the nasty, "don't mess with me Buster!"
Scene after scene of watching the Creeper .
People continue to remember him today, right down to the naming of an award - marking achievement in horror research - after him.
During the 30s and 40s he was mainly seen in small roles, often as hulks, due to his large body size and the fact the he had contracted acromegaly after being gassed during the first world war.
Note: This film was actually made at Universal, who sold the rights to it to PRC shortly after it was completed (and Rondo Hatton died).
He lived to the age of 52, being felled by a heart attack shortly after making his last film, "The Brute Man," in 1946.
In it, Hatton plays a former college BMOC who became disfigured after a lab accident and who, years later, begins a murder spree against all his former pals and teachers that he blames for his current condition.
He makes friends with a blind woman but nearly kills her after shopping him to the police and is arrested in her home after she set him up.
All in all, I recommend this film for everybody, who wants to relax after a hard day...
Our heroes emerge after a childhood in a bomb shelter.
Convinced, therefore, that everyone wears sharp suits, talks like a hipster and goes down after one swift punch to the jaw, they embark on their journey back to civilization.
(And after Curly's death, Moe really took it out on Shemp.)
Even if one didn't know about Curly's career-ending stroke while filming this, one has to wonder why his character never comes back after walking off to go sit down -- his absence from the rest of the film is obvious and makes no sense.
All right, so it's another tidbit of trashy 80s post-apocalyptic fluff, but it's really the cream of the crop and has a great soundtrack, fun sets and costumes, tongue-in-cheek writing and acting, cannibalism, swing dancing, love, innocence, mayhem, violence, and plenty of silly 50s references... Philip and Marlowe (ha, ha) leave the bomb shelter after basically their whole entire lives, and emerge into a radioactive wasteland, to search for their fathers.
There's no way of knowing how many people have actually been detained and/or deported because the government refused to believe their documentation -- Or they lacked it; Citizens don't have green cards, after all, so an immigration officer who is determined to deport anyone without one will deport a lot of citizens.
Having been raised on 50s pulp detective novels (hence their names) while confined to an underground bomb shelter, they emerge 15 years after a nuclear war has turned the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
Purely by accident, our two heroes end up in possession of the two keys that can launch the last nuclear missile in existence, and when this fact is discovered after they reach the last outpost of civilization - Edge City - they find themselves on the run from every mutant gang in town.
He is ready to leave and gives up his spot on the transport to but this lady on, even after he had worked to get money to return.
Byrne's character is a seductive vixen who has a guy who loves her but she would rather chase after another, meanwhile her younger sister (Garai's character) is in love with the very same man whom her sister repels.
I read the book in my English class and after we had read and assessed the book we were told that we were in for a treat because we had done such great work.
Perhaps this one of those books that simply couldn't be properly adapted nearly 40 years after it was written.
Eventually she got pregnant and after the baby was given up for adoption she was kicked out by her grandfather.
The most disturbing part of the film is when Aileen is going after the death penalty as a GOAL.
The defining moment of this film is when after a fit of ranting, Aileen gives the camera the finger.
Wuornos employed " Dr Legal " at her original trial , a man , or rather spaced out hippy , with no legal experience and no office who attended court after smoking as many as seven joints .
Serling was forced to go this route after suffering from censorship early in his career that prevented him from directly addressing current social concerns with criticism that might offend the advertisers.
Caco does steal their newly acquired fortune, but not before he deals with the slippery as a rattlesnake Harold, one of the three men who set him afoot after a bank robbery.
That is, until he steals $300,000 from bounty hunters Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy (Terence Hill and Bud Spencer) who then come trailing after him all over the southwest (or in this case, Almeria Spain) and want their money back.
I can't believe that this is supposed to be made after the early 70's...
The electrician had the best quote in the movie though, which is right after he strangled that security guard.
"There are two kind of people in this world...people who pee their pants after getting strangled, and people who don't."
Shortly after a stupid ending, in which a midget flies across the room, Mr. Mascaro comes onto the screen and announces he particularly didn't enjoy that ending and thus an alternate ending comes up.
In this even-stupider ending, even after the mistress finds out that Southern Shrunk-Head has an extremely small head, she declares her love for him.
The perfect B movie to watch after coming home from a few beers on a Saturday night.
The dominatrix wife of the villain's illusive enemy is so perfect in her role that it makes you almost forget the great performances of the the evil looking dwarf, the puppet master (or the guy who looks after the dolls), the tiny headed villain and of course the blood dolls.
The movie stops after a hour and then the clownface appears telling that they had another ending of the film too, and they show it afterwards, it's not an extra.
My favorite thing that the episode does is that it presents this quiet, unassuming man who lives a quiet life as a librarian, and even after his death sentence, he manages to completely undo the man who condemned him, and in front of a widespread audience as well.
I didn't really care for them, at all..they are basically designed after modern urban street characters like a scummy pimp and muscle-freak with multiple piercings.
Well, at least I haven't seen such a weird waste of time for a long time, so if you need a good party movie for a good laugh after midnight choose "Blood Dolls" and you won't be disappointed!
Conclusion: Very bad movie, but a lot of fun to watch, but Charles Band did better in the past, I will definitely watch it again when it runs after midnight and there is no alternative.
Blood Dolls starts as eccentric billionaire computer developer businessman Virgil Travis (Jack Maturin) discovers he has lost a billion dollars after losing a legal battle leaving him financially ruined, obviously not best pleased about losing a billion dollars he sets out to kill his competitors who made it happen as well as the corrupt judge.
Though not all professional musicians, an original idea was for the actresses playing Virgil's band-in-a-cage to record a soundtrack CD and go on tour after the film's release as The Blood Dolls.
Virginia searches for Brand's second novel, "I, Madman," after finishing the first, which involved a demonic creature who takes its revenge on its creator.
Of course, Virginia realizes her dumb mistake too late and runs after Mr.
I was hesitant to watch this movie based solely on the first ten minutes because it was so cheesy, but after a while I eased into it and found that this movie was so bad and so cheesy, it was good.
Virginia(Wright)finds that Brand has somehow manifested into modern Los Angeles and is murdering people she knows, grafting a part from each victim's face after slicing them away with a razor.
Virginia is often visited by the maniac before and after he kills his victims.
The gore factor is adroitly used and convincing, the removed lips and nose effects on the killer and victims are shockingly effective and the suspense never lets up after it's initial tedious 30 minutes.
Mind you, after reading the rave reviews from other fellow IMDb viewers, I don't find this one the "cream of the crop" of B-Horror films, it has the same standard elements of B-Horror films such as graphic gore, OK Acting, and contrived (although still fun) occurrences throughout the movie.
I first saw this movie a year after it came out, it was 1989, i was 14, and i have never been so scared in my life, I've just watched it again, and while its still scary i am now 32.
The next day Virginia sees a report in a local newspaper which tells of the murder of an actress & one of Virginia's friends named Colette Berkowitz (Michelle Jordan), after this event & a face to face meeting with Kessler before he kills & slices the ears off a pianist (Bruce Wagner) who lives near her, Virginia is convinced that the character of Dr. Kessler is responsible & comes to life when she reads I, Madman.
On the downside, the film runs out of steam after the first two thirds, delivering a disappointing final act that does not live up to everything that came before it.
Of course, after the lights went out, we'd sneak into the loges.
One thing in particular that has always stuck with me after viewing this was when SPOILER: Alan Ladd's character finally starts to shoot the Japanese soldiers.
Having long forsaken his Quaker upbringing he is thus completely blindsided when after reporting for duty on a destroyer he finds himself seriously conflicted regarding the taking of life.
I would be surprised that after watching this movie, many wouldn't change their viewpoint and be more tolerant of homosexuality.
The fact that some families become activists for their children, even after they have committed suicide, is amazing.
The nudity and sexual content is exploitative and unredeemed by anything that comes after it, the decapitations are actually very well handled, and I liked the polyester pant suited mid 1970's look, right down to the mod designs on the upholstery.
With dreadful production values, acting to match, several interminably dull scenes of inane dialogue between the law and a variety of viable suspects, some equally inane chit-chat from the stupid couples who visit the drive-in (they keep on coming, despite the presence of a maniac), a totally incongruous scene where a machete wielding loon is pursued through a warehouse by the cops, an ending that fails to resolve matters (preferring instead to rely on the old 'the killer might be amongst you' gimmick), and very little in the way of gore after the first few minutes, Drive In Massacre will test the patience of even the most avid fan of grade-Z horror.
The plot stumbles in circles like a drunk on a tilt-a-whirl with one meaningless scene after the other.
There's a bizarre red herring set-up featuring the great Buck Flower chasing after a female victim(..actually played by his real daughter Verkina!)
As engaging as always, Mark actually seems to have lost his drive after this previous film Coven in the late 90's and we get to watch him regain it with his first feature Scare Me.
Do yourself a favour and get hold of a copy if you can; it took me close to 7 years to track down a copy after seeing the trailer on a bootleg VHS of "Cheech & Chong's - Up in smoke".
I will now list reasons for your time & effort to source this feature: 1.THE most ludicrous dialogue ever committed to film 2.Hopeless action/fight scenes that don't even look rehearsed(Comic genius) 3.The cop who's story is being filmed acts in a supporting role 4.No films like this will ever be made again(Un-PC) 5.Duvall has THE worst undercover costume ever(Wig & tashe) 6.The main villain is called "Sweet William" 7.It has possibly the most ridiculous chase scene ever with a bus-load of innocent civilians dragged into one mans vendetta & after all the effort to chase him, in order to kill him, they just thump him in the gut and leave him alone!...I could go on forever..."the learning to shoot with his left hand" scenes are pure gold, as is the "Until they kill me" line delivered with possibly the worst Brooklyn/Irish hybrid accent you ever heard.
Watch this after going down the pub for a few beers & you will laugh yourself silly...I know we did!
Robert Duvall gives a convincing performance as Eddie Ryan, who suspended from the force after killing a drug runner.
When I became aware of her it was late in her career after she had developed into a boozy, smoke belching, caricature of her on screen persona's.
It happens in the scene where Henry Fonda escorts Jezebel home after the ball and breaks off their engagement.
Unlike a cobra however, which recoils after it strikes, she lurches slightly closer and you think she might just rip his throat out.
Mr. Lew plays Buford Lee, an unsuccessful actor who is trying to finally make it big with a top notch film but Buford runs into one obstacle after another keeping him from completing his movie.
Gene Siskel put it as his #1 picture for the year (having said in his original review "I doubt I'll see a better movie this year"), and Roger Ebert put it as his #2 only after _Leaving Las Vegas_ (the only 1990s film I'd put above it myself, too).
So enjoy - and buck up young camper, you're not so odd after all.
The answer is hard to determine but, after seeing this movie, I think that its both.
An outbreak of the dreaded yellow fever hits the city, and Davis, finally realising the damage she has caused after she has lost her lover and caused the death of old friend Buck Cantrell (George Brent), has a chance to atone and try to save the life of a stricken Fonda.
That may be because Shearer retired soon after her husband died; her final film was 1942's forgettable "Her Cardboard Lover."
I will say seeing it again after all those decades, the movie had lost none of its beauty.
Shearer is an actress of limited range and after watching her for almost three hours, her limited range became increasingly obvious with each passing minute.
Joseph Schildkraut is marvelous as the snake-like intriguing Philippe Joseph II, Duke of OrlÃ©ans who had changed his name to Citoyen Philippe ÃgalitÃ©, supported the French Revolution, voted on the National Assembly for the death of the king but was nonetheless guillotined during the Reign of Terror very soon after Louis XVI.
A few years after the marriage both Louis and Marie Antoinette would be taken care by the popular justice of the French Revolution.
Norma Shearer, who returned to MGM after her husband's death, made a good impression as Marie Antoinette.
What this film does not cover is what happens to Dubarry after Louis XV dies and Louis XVI takes the throne.
Forget Shearer's uneven acting, which as in all her films veers from the truly affecting to the annoyingly melodramatic (e.g., her stagey, even hokey body language in the night meeting with Tyrone Power in the garden just after she becomes queen, when he makes her understand they must not see each other again).
In fact, Fersen was at Versailles on and off throughout Louis XVI's reign; it was rumored that he fathered the queen's second son, born in 1785 exactly 9 months after one of Fersen's visits.
The royal family's return to Paris after their foiled escape attempt is here followed immediately by Mme de Lamballe's murder.
Shearer's triumphant return to the screen after a two-hear absence.
Years in planning and preproduction, "Marie Antoinette" was Norma Shearer's first film after Irving Thalberg's death: little expense was spared in making the "First Lady of MGM"'s return to the screen a royal one in every sense.
But after viewing a film such as "Marie Antoinette," it can with utmost conviction be stated, "They DON'T make them that way anymore."
For about two decades after early retiring in 1942, she was fondly remembered by fans and critics, but slowly she was forgotten.
Just as the character he plays caught on with the media in the film, Bronson's star rose significantly after this film, which was a runaway hit (whose prestige was diminished a tad by a later quartet of horrendous sequels.)
Above all else, DEATH WISH is a highly effective mood piece, the kind of film that goes down well after a hard day, as a reminder that somebody is always worse off than yourself, or as an escape valve for all your guilty fantasies about slaughtering whichever inconsiderate lout stole your parking space or your seat on the bus.
In the early scenes, before and after the attack, we see a crime-infested New York where violence is casual, everyday, all over - and a police force that is powerless.
At first he just puts some rolled-up quarters in a sock and carries it with him as insurance, at one point fighting off an attempted mugging - but after a lengthy trip to Tucson where he makes friends with a client who turns out to be a gun collector, he decides to arm himself seriously, and a one man (and five movie) war on crime begins...
This got lambasted by liberal film critics when it came out, of course, just as Dirty Harry had three years previously, but what's interesting about it today is how low-key the attacks on liberal values are, and in fact the film really doesn't go after anything except on-the-street violence.
Bronson feels hopeless for a time after dealing with the system.
The Chief tries to scare him off, but only makes his point after Bronson has been shot and has no other choice.
Charles Bronson stars as Paul Kersey a mild mannered businessman who turns vigilante after a brutal attack on his wife and daughter in this thought provoking, well made and humorous box office smash.
Both sides of the issue are presented but not dealt with in much depth--this IS a Charles Bronson movie after all!
This is short-lived after a visit to the south-west, where he gets slipped a gun in his suitcase.
This is one of those films that has had a lasting effect on me, and I remember being quite shaken after watching it.
One could point out that the film is manipulative and heavy-handed (the attack on Kersey's family comes right after his co-worker tells him he's a "bleeding-heart liberal").
It is not an easy transition to make by any means--after his first kill, he breaks down and vomits the moment he reaches home.
She plays a spoiled Southern belle whose fiancÃ© (Henry Fonda) leaves her after a socially embarrassing event.
This development was so modern and original, after a while it changed the outlook of the Crime genre.
Bronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in "Death Wish" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after.
This movie rediscovers the beauty of LOVE, long after the success of DDLJ, when creativity started dwindling with more and more movies trying to replicate it rather than coming up with something altogether different or FRESH.
For Barath's lovers and fans, you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story (just like ME!!!).
Naomi is a spoiled brat and send by her father to the countryside, after her mother runs away.
And after his transportation money literally goes out the window, so do Paul's chance of getting home.
He encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours.
He encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours.
I don't want to give too much away because this is a movie where surprise after surprise.
The slow moving story starts with an average Joe (played by Griffin Dunne who is tired of his boring routine and decides to meet a blind date(Rossana Arquette) after a brief encounter on the telephone.
Nevertheless, he hails a cab and begins the "after hours" journey of a lifetime.
Yes, we can't say that after hours is the best of Scorsese because, well Scorsese has a lot of classics, but still After hours is a masterpiece, and a must see for all and not only for Scorsese's fans.
It's surprising to see that Scorsese took on another comedy so shortly after his major flop, The King of Comedy (1983), starring Robert De Niro.
Paul meets a girl after a hard day at work (Rosanna Arquette) and they arrange to meet later that evening.
The original ending (storyboarded but never filmed) involved Paul being reborn after crawling through a random woman's legs Â that's how bizarre, and creative, this film actually is.
One thing after another begins to go wrong and Dunne decides to ditch his date and go home.
If you weren't paranoid before, seeing this film will convince you go straight home after work, lock the doors, lock the windows, don't answer the phone, and just stay there with your teeth chattering until morning.
My English teacher used to describe stories like that as picaresque - the whole series of disconnected events - all so warm and real, ending, like waking up after a weird dream, back where you started.
Perfect flawless black comedy with humor as dark as the night that caught Paul Hacket (Griffin Dunne), a nice guy, an everyman, an ordinary computer operator in its darkness and surrounded him by all kinds of weird strangers who very well could be the deadly creatures of night that inhabited SOHO of early 1980s every night after hours... or perhaps they are still there?
It takes place in NYC, and its dark scary streets come directly from Scorsese's earlier masterpieces, "Mean Streets" (the streets after hours are even meaner, are they not?)
This poor guy just wants to get home, but problem after problem pops up and destroys his plans.
I loved Catherine O'Hara as the paranoid vigilante who drove the ice cream truck chasing after Dunne.
Saw this film again last night after watching the original in the cinema 23 years ago, as an 18 year old!
So begin's his crazy adventure, meeting peculiar character after peculiar character.
The theme of the movie is that the whole world is different after midnight, from the people who inhabit it, to the rules which govern it.
All the rules go out the window for Dunne's character, because after all it is after hours.
In fact, it is so dull that after about ten minutes its dullness overpowers the giggle factor and you are left to sit in slack-jawed exhaustion.
What she didn't anticipate was that after Fonda was called away, that Brent would continue this argument with Fonda's wife until eventually Fonda's younger brother challenges Brent to a duel.
So after that summary, let's talk about the good and bad of the movie.
But, after seeing her plans go out of control, she repents and is willing to give her life to save Fonda!?
"Blackenstein" is original and funny because of its ineptness, but after a while it nearly becomes unendurable to sit through.
Winifred is devoted to her boyfriend, Eddie, who has lost all of his limbs (and apparently his personality) after stepping on a land mine in 'Nam.
Since the makers of the film seem to feel as if a "Frankenstein" flick needs a dungeon, Winifred & Dr. Stein inexplicably banish Eddie to a basement cell after his results start turning out badly.
She was even able to sprint, without favoring her bad leg, minutes after being shot in the thigh.
In the end he finds not only who killed Harry but a new place to stay, Margo's place, after his landlady kicked him out of her house for giving her more headaches and excitement then his rent could compensate her for: $42,50 a month.
Supporting girl, even more shallow than main girl who goes after said girl's guy because girls like that just love to be treated like sh*t (DANICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MOVIE???
Fonda goes north and returns after a while to New Orleans with Margaret Lindsay who he is now married to.
This was an utter disappointment and I don't think that I will be alone after the release of the movie.
My guess was, after the American destruction of Godzilla a couple of years ago, the boys over in Japan would take up the reigns and crank out a Godzilla movie unlike any other seen before.
I recently saw this magnificent film after not having seen it in quite a number of years.
It's always hard to figure out where the movie exists in the Godzilla canon (there are basically four eras: The first two movies, the movies after that up until the initial series ended in 1975, then the revivial in the eighties that began with Godzilla 1985 and ended with Godzilla Vs. Destroyah, and now this film), but it seems to begin another era of G-films, with no apparent links to any of the other ones, other than the original movie Gojira.
As for the human characters, after 1975 (and probably 1984), we FINALLY get characters from all walks of life!
Robinson actually rearranges Ifukube music with two tracks, the best in the scene where Orga makes his appearance, the worst being the scene in the end (after which, said token stock Ifukube track is repeated before cuing the complete original ending credits track).
If you stop the frame where the killer is standing outside the building after doing the deed you can clearly see the man is definitely older and shorter than Sean Connery is and he is not dressed as well, he also is not carrying the cane that Connery was holding earlier in the tavern scene.
It isn't clear whether `Jezebel' was offered to her before or after the negotiations for GWTW.
Bleak settings help to give atmosphere to the film and Olivia is maturing as a tv actress with this film being made not long after her successful battle with breast cancer.Not a glamorous role for Olivia but one with real grit and determination.
A very amusing, enjoyable and mercifully uninsulting spoof (unlike the atrocious "Scream" stinkers, this film never seems either archly ironic or smugly patronizing in its pointed satiric potshots at corny stock characters and tried'n'true standard situations), blessed with witty dialog (Mike has the feature's single most sidesplitting line, tersely commenting after seeing one victim's face melt: "Now, that's disgusting"), personable acting from a cast of deliberately overage thesps who trying unsuccessfully to palm themselves off as twentysomethish young adults (one dude even has thinning hair!
We walked out after 30 minutes and got our money back.
"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is an incredible pile of garbage.The script is not only awful,but extremely predictable with a totally pathetic ending(I won't go into it,but you might kick in your TV set after viewing it).The acting is really pitiful,with dialogue to match.OK,there are some nice splatter scenes(I like especially the sequence in the car when one guy is slowly gutted),but the rest of the film absolutely sucks.To sum up,"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is one of the worst horror movies ever made-bland,boring and mind numbingly stupid and gets 3 only because of some pretty good gore.I really like bad horror movies,but this is an insult.Avoid it at all costs.Not recommended.
I was interested in seeing him after watching him with a group discussing horror movies the other day.
There's also one scene during the festival when a cop is running after Donna, it seems reminiscent of another movie....oh yeah Double Jeapordy!!
Why the Daniel Craig character would want to marry her after she's so unsympathetic about his mental problems caused by the hot air balloon mayhem at the start of the film is a mystery.
My boyfriend will sit through nearly anything... he gave up after 20 minutes.
To put Tresdodge's mind at rest, I read the book after seeing the film and didn't find much in the way of explanation there, either, except more elaboration on Joe's rigid belief there is a rational explanation for everything.
I read the novel when it came out, and remember thinking after reading the last page, 'So what?'
I liked the film and more than anything it was an enjoyable experience which is what after all we watch films for.
Is it Jed whose love for Joe is unrequited, or is it perhaps Claire, who sees her life shattered after an innocent day when her life with Joe was at one of its best moments?
The first scene is very promising, after that is one mistake after another.
He never sees Jed (the stalker) after the accident until Jed telephones him.
Despite a successful depiction of the shocking balloon accident that sets the story in motion, director Roger Michell fails after this stylish opening to generate any of the psychological tension that made the novel such a page-turner.
Joe keeps running into him in odd places, day after day, but Jed won't just speak straight with him.
It was one of errol flynn's better films after his career had started to go down.
He didn't make that many more good ones after this one.
Ida Lupino as 'Gemma' is cast adrift after a short union in marriage which produced a son, but she must fend for herself when tragedy ends the union.
An ex-con (Gene Nelson) with a beautiful wife and a good job sees his future prospects threatened when his old-time criminal partners call on him for help after a botched hold up.
I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD after the screening, and have enjoyed repeated viewings.
How wonderful to see Dave Prowse again after all these years (and without his Darth Vader costume), and able to poke fun at himself and the Star Wars legacy.
Later Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organize the woman's movement, so that after they both die in the early 1900s it grows until it achieves suffrage by Federal Constitutional Amendment in 1919.
However, Anthony and Stanton were convinced by Frederick Douglass to work for abolition, because if slavery was abolished (Douglas argued) woman's servitude would have to follow soon after.
The plot followed a much-used noir formula: the man whose past comes back to haunt him â as an ex-con (Gene Nelson) is forced by three fugitives (including Bronson and Ted de Corsia), after deliberately compromising his parole and threatening his wife, into first harboring them and then take part in their proposed bank robbery (by which time theyâve enrolled other dangerous elements to their fold, notably a typically-nutty Timothy Carey).
Rarely do films stick in one's mind a few minutes after seeing them.
I have read the comic book after watching the movie.
It does work as a resolution in an understated way, showing us how, after waiting for something to happen from outside, she finally decided it was up to her to start taking control of her life.
This is the story of Enid (Tora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) after they finish the high school.
Even in the end, Enid has caught that same bus which represents after all the things Enid has put herself through she is finally accepting to grow up and start her life.
Two female high school grads plan to get jobs and hang together, but bonds become frayed and paths separate after one of the girls ends up on an unintended journey of self-discovery.
The caustic and mature adolescent-coming-to-age story is centered in the weird and rebel Enid facing and overcoming the need to join the real world after the high-school period, and is brilliantly directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also writes the wonderful screenplay with Daniel Clowes.
Sterling Hayden, Gene Nelson, Phyllis Kirk and Charles Buchinsky (Bronson) stars in this relatively forgotten but excellent film that centers on the life of an ex-con (Nelson) who's trying to go straight after mixing with the wrong crowd.
This movie doesn't believe high school is the root of youth complications; it knows that school isn't where the confusion lies-it's after graduation when the complexities begin.
Rebecca is eager to get an apartment and get on with her life, while Enid lives by the day, following one infatuation after another.
It was, after all, intended for the younger set.
However, after seeing poor Charlton Heston doing Holmes, I won't squawk too loudly.
Now here's an original idea-- Sherlock Holmes after a modern-style serial killer!
Rupert Everett, excellent at playing dilettantes and spoiled playboys, fails to convince us that he has the brainpower to be the great detective (and his voice is oddly tentative, especially after Jeremy Brett's barking-- why won't someone cast Richard E. Grant as Holmes?
I gave up after 25 minutes.
About the story: after a bit of a slow start it became very suspenseful.
During the last days of World War II, as the soviets' bombs explode closer and closer as the days go by, the routine of concentration camp Awschwitz follows its course and represents the focus of this picture: the atmosphere of dread and death inhabiting the heavy air, the work inside the crematorium, the random executions of men, women and children,and the drama of the Jewish sonderkommando, a group formed by prisoners who, in exchange of better food and clothes, helped their tormentors in the systematic of death inside the camps, guiding the new arrived prisoners through the corridors that lead to the gas chambers, and the disposal of the bodies after wards, just to be killed some time latter.
The photography and art department deserve praise: Awschwitz was worse than hell and people who visit these old concentration camps tend to say that after wards they fell this aura of pain and sadness.
It would be tempting to slam "Schindler's List" after seeing this,but I won't.
Known for his leading role in O Brother Where Art Thou, he also wrote and directed O, which was shelved after the Columbine massacre.
The first leader replies, something to the effect that, after what he has seen and done, he does not want to live!
Last night, after seeing a Holocaust documentary on Kurt Gerron ("Prisoner of Paradise") a friend of mine asked me what I would have done?
There are many plot holes, but the biggest one I can't stand is that after Salinger is given the Super-Soldier Serum (At the beginning) transforming into Captain America, he becomes a lousy superhero up until the end for no reason.
They end up kidnapping wunderkind Tadzio de Santis, after wasting his entire family.
Many things happen that make little sense- for example, upon being revived in the nineties after being frozen in ice for fifty years, Captain America is found by a conspiracy theorist who has been piecing together his story for years.
OVERALL: One of the best comic films out there, even after seeing some of today's, it's the perfect adventure for the whole family!
In hindsight it is a major miracle that any studio would have touched any Marvel franchise with a ten foot pole after this stinker.
Captain America is a great character, and I'd love to see him done right, but after two poor TV movies and this wasted effort, I just don't think there's anyone in Hollywood who's willing to take the chance and make movie about a straight arrow superhero.
The problem is they apparently ran out of money after the first scene.
Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull, but it is still creepy.
Praise God Captain America managed to shut Red Skull's mouth after that and started to kick Red skull's worthless ass.
It's the Red Skull after plastic surgery to make him look human.
The culture shock he has returning home after too many years is done fairly well, and the Red Skull seen at the top of the movie reminds me of a cross between Freddie Kruger and Jason Voorhees.
Keaton did other solid work before and after ''The General.''
The movie was a labor of love from Keaton and crew and deserves to find a place in movie history long after other silents of the era have disintegrated.
Gray pursues the train by handcar, bicycle, and engine car, then after rescuing his girlfriend, who was on the train, the tables are reversed as the spies chase him Gray, on the General.
Yes I am a huge Keaton fan, but no one can doubt his influence after watching Harpo Marx, Jackie Chan or Jim Carrie.
well, Johnny wants his beloved train going in to enemy hands to he sets off after it.
Set in the American civil war, Johnny Gray goes on a one man mission to get his beloved train and girlfriend back after both are stolen at a routine stop.
And he absolutely floored me when he said after he watched the whole thing he thought it was great "but I prefer Chaplin".
And he absolutely floored me when he said after he watched the whole thing he thought it was great "but I prefer Chaplin".
There were quite a few gags that I'd forgotten about, mostly stuff after the bridge collapses, like the gag with the faulty sword.
Keaton's character is based partly on a real Southern railroad conductor who chased after the raiders.
The Yankees try all manner of tricks to get away, and Keaton stays after them bumbling along.
It so happens that one day soon after, the northern union spies steal his train.....with Annabele on board and it's up to Johnnie to go deep into the enemy territory to recapture the engine and the girl.
The scene were the train fell into the river after the bridge collapsed, was perhaps the most expensive and difficult part of the movie to film.
Liv worked in a diner for 2 month, and Kim gave himself so much, that he became Leo; after the filming stopped he commited himself to a hospital for psychiatric treatment.
It's sad really, as just after these two triumphs came the sound era--and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career, as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material--pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante.
Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial.
The damage (after all) could be repaired.
Despite it being a brief incident of the war, the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten.
It's about personal decisions and living after with the consequences.
This film has all the elements of a good psychological thriller: someone coming back from the dead, a past that comes to haunt you after 20 years, exile in your own land, fighting the Nazis, and finally, leaving the past behind to join the living in the present.
No flashing steel-armored knights and dazzling pageantry, this is a telling of the Arthur tale as he probably was - a British warlord struggling to maintain order and civilization after the withdrawal of the Roman legions in the fifth century.
It is hours and hours of footage, and even after you have gorged yourself on it, there is still more!
I have three used T Shirts, a little small for me now, that came in sealed bags and two mint Programmes and a mint Live Aid: The Concert book that came out very shortly after the gig.
With this film coming out several years after Pusher, giving Nicolas Winding Refn plenty of time to work on it, with basically the same cast as Pusher and apparently a bigger budget, I guess I expected more than this.
There's no need to emphasize that LIVE AID (and everything else connected to it) is the singular event of the rock'n'roll history, greater then anything seen before or after.
He starred in 20th's biggest production of 1954, "The Egyptian" -- after Marlon Brando turned down the part -- and then starred in this, MGM's biggest production of 1955, and yet this almost unprecedented, one-two whammy of multimillion dollar spectacles failed to ignite his acting career.
Days after seeing it, I can't shake it -- and I don't want to.
Sure it has a few clichÃ©d set pieces and a few moments of wooden acting, but after the first 30 minutes or so it pans out to be a nicely put together movie.
At this point we are led to think that the movie might turn out to be a romantic comedy after all, events however take a different turn as love is replaced by manipulation, betrayal and greed and we are back into black comedy territory again.
When the girl loses her unborn baby after a beatin' things get VERY ugly!
The year after his sensational smash "Gremlins", Joe Dante brought us yet another fantasy about creatures unknown, and this time, places unseen as well.
I first saw Explorers when I was 6, not long after the movie came out and still remains a film that can be watched again.
And now after seeing it again (it's been YEARS since I last saw it) I can understand why Leonard Maltin and his cronies would say it "takes a wrong turn in space".
Explorers was the first film he made after Gremlins, but it failed to strike a chord with audiences.
Damn right it was, this is Nicholas Winding RefnÂ´s second feature, and after his masterful debut: Pusher I really had my hopes up.
The idea of watching this movie came after seeing "Stand By Me" and learning more about River Phoenix' accomplishments.
I think this is mainly because the movie ended right after that part.
When meeting the aliens, one learns to not take so much for granted, one has an unexpected adventure and flirtation with a troublesome girl alien, and one learns to believe more in himself and also learns a bit more empathy for his dad after meeting the father of their alien friends.
Explorers tell the story of three friends (Ben, Wolfgang, and Darren) who stumble upon a way to make a spacecraft after Ben sketches a diagram from a weird dream he has one night, As the spacecraft gets nearer to completion it becomes obvious that Ben's dream may not of simply been a stroke of luck.
It never quite regains its footing after that, though the final dream sequence is nicely uplifting.
Just the way you feel after seeing the film.
Just the way you feel after seeing the film.
I feel a lot of horror fans expect too much from Tobe Hooper after Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Once proclaimed as a horror film messiah, the creator of the masterfully creepy 1974 classic "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (and the two mainstream delights "Salem's Lot" and "Poltergeist"), keeps making one bad movie after another.
It seems after recent-renovations to the structure of the building there have been some strange-occurrences: a workman hurt in an unexplained-blast, and strange electrical-surges.
Most films that have somebody killed in the beginning have the next scene take place somewhere else or on the next day, the scene after it takes place the second after it!
Sometime after his career redefining joint venture with Steven Spielberg (Poltergeist), Hooper fell into an awful run of consistently poor form.
But after hearing the dieing screams of her neighbour, she begins to realise that the complex has more to its history than first meets the eye.
Jane recovers from a wound after a spear went into her and everyone is OK at the end and Boy stays with Tarzan and Jane.
Cheetah finds the wailing bundle of joy and whisks him off to Tarzan and Jane, who decide to adopt the lad, naming him Boy (Tarzan's second choice, after having Elephant rejected by Jane).
I was lucky to be spared the embarrassment of walking into a cinema, paying the exorbitant price for a seat there, only to walk out again after 10 - 15 minutes of sheer and utter boredom.
My wife - who had entered the wrong cinema in another town and already struggled through it - gracefully left the group after dinner, and went to do something useful elsewhere.
To cut a long story and an even longer stretch of boredom short: those of us who did not fall asleep (it was after a 5-course meal) or made frequent trips to the "bathroom", or went out for a quick, quiet smoke on the balcony, valiantly sat through it - all trying to stay awake during an hour where time really dragged its leaden feet through the mires of an amateur production that ideally belongs to, and should never have left, the wastepaper-basket where it should have been thrown together with the parts and scenes which were (one hopes!)
The cinema audience just HAVE to start laughing after being so bored!
They split up after the filming!!
Anyway, the lead finds out her husband (Dennis Quaid) is cheating, and this comes as a surprise to her even after it was pointed out that his nickname in college was 'Hound Dog'.
Also, some of the camera angles were interesting at first, but as the plot and the overall content of the film left much to be desired, the angles began to really get on my nerves after a while.
Anyways, pop this this one in at 2am after you've missed several buses to dreamland.
Average family comedy/drama movie that had a great cast but average story/screenplay.The script was above average though and the performances was also good.The cinematography was bad and so was the lighting.Story deals with adultery and the trials of fixing a marriage after the affair.Nothing spectacular.Only for family soap comedy/drama fans and big fans of the lead actors.....
My favorite Scene: Emma Rae kicking her brother -in -law after she helped him to come in the second floor of the house through the window.
He decides he doesn't want her back after all and goes ahead and gets a nasty lawyer.
Kyra Sedgwick is going for over the top sassy here...We get the point after she knees Quaid in the jewels early on..yes yes she is a tough cookie.
I am her target demographic after all.
I would highly recommend Under The Same Moon aka La Misma Luna, at first I was not sure whether this movie would be a movie I would watch but after watching it, I had a different perspective.
While Kate del Castillo is the major star of the film, it is the performance by Adrian Alonso that remains in the mind long after the credits are shown.
This is one of Orson Welles' finest portrayals, better than Citizen Kane, I believe (Kane's role, after all, was more bluster than acting, no matter how fine the movie is).
When the woman's mother dies, "Carlito's" grandmother who had been looking after the young boy, the kid decides his options aren't good at that point and he needs to take a big chance to see if he can find his way to Los Angeles.
While the main focus surrounds precocious Carlito (Adrian Alonso) as he crosses the US/Mexican border to find his mother after a family death leaves him alone, his journey draws attention to the plight of a people who want only to pursue a better future for their families.
Four years after she left, his faith is finally faltering.
This simplistic view of two "mental illnesses" gets dressed up with 1) obsessed chick arranging to meet (and sleep with, equally of course) wheelchair bound guy via the plot device of anonymously informing him of a human interest story (he is an NPR-radio-station-type reporter) 2) utterly stupid 'human interest story' (an urban legend style boffo about a bunch of people who "wannabe" paralyzed for no particular reason whatsoever) 3) "magic fred astaire shoes" (of course, again, the shoes are nothing more than a mental "crutch" the guy is subconsciously using to give himself a reason to walk... that enable wheelchair guy to walk...after falling down a lot, only very slowly, with crutches or a cane...sort of like you'd expect someone who has been working out to retard muscular atrophy but who hasn't stood or walked for years to behave when finally standing and walking... 3) a few couldabeengreat lines that came off as too silly to be taken half-seriously because of the trying-to-be-an-allegory but frankly rather silly plot.
!-- after they discover his paralysis is actually hysterical: "Why would anyone wannabe paralyzed?")
The really bad aftertaste I was left with after watching this moronic movie was that the people who produced, directed and wrote the script for this movie are probably too vapid and dumb to realize how insulting it is to those who are actually disabled.
Carlos Brooks makes an impressive debut as both writer and director of this little independent film QUID PRO QUO, a story that may make some viewers uncomfortable because of the subject matter, but an intelligent investigation of a subculture unknown to most and a script that leads to a surprising ending - if the viewer keeps thinking after the rolling credits are over!
Parodies of Wise's got tired after Brando which essentially was some kind of parody on it's own.
You will want to learn how to do the merengue and salsa after watching Barney get an education from Vinnie and girls in New York.
The script is superbly written in terms of hilarious dialogue and one quotable line after another.
The Broadway musical that most people associate with Jerome Kern after Showboat is Roberta.
I saw this movie not long after its release in August,1990.
Allan Felix (Woody Allen) is a quirky film critic who has very minimal success with the ladies after being dumped by his wife.
Meanwhile, Allen has his sort of guardian angel/devil in one at his ear, Humphrey Bogart, pecking away at him to be more than what he is, as he's ultimately the most impressive man in Allen's life, particularly after seeing Casablanca.
I think the mood of the film is not so good, the pacing tends to drag after half an hour and the climactic scene with "Bogey", Woody and Keaton I think didn't emphasize all the potential of the script.
If you love old movies, or great comedy, or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in their early prime, then PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM will still deliver the goods 30+ years after its first release.
Woody wrote this brilliant comedy, based on his own stage play, and starred as Allan Felix, a (neurotic, of course) film critic that, after being dumped by his wife, is constantly visited by the ghost of his idol, Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy).
Directed not by Allen but by Herbert Ross, it represents the noteworthy first pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton, and the combination of their unerring chemistry and Allen's clever, often hilarious script makes for great viewing after all these years.
Woody is absolutely lovable, I almost choked when watching this movie while I was eating because of uncontrolled laughters, especially the scenes of his first date after the divorce.
His nervousness will stay in your mind long after the movie is over.
He is aided by his best friend Dick and his wife Linda (Woody regulars Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton), who assist him in setting up one disastrous date after another.
It is best seen right after Casablanca; I like to watch the two back-to-back to get the full effect.
)He gives a terrible performance like everyone else,but then he was probably having his daydreams of staring in epic tales of epic frontiers and district attorneys who root out presidential assassins,unlike the other stars who just faded into oblivion after this film was made (there seem to be a few who think Costner should have done the same,but,there you go...) The film was made in 1986,but looks more like it was made in 1976.The dodgy lighting and wooden sets are here in all their glory,obviously a very low-budget effort all round.Yep,this is definitely another one of those 'before-they-were-famous' efforts that linger at the back of the CVs of stars like Costner like flies on sh*t.*
I didn't even recognize Kevin Costner in this, and I didn't even realize he was in it until after the fact.
Just one year later in 'Follow the Fleet (1936)' Â after 'Top Hat (1935)' had made box-office gold of Fred and Ginger Â Scott is similarly relegated to a romantic supporting role, having to settle for Ginger's nondescript sister (Harriet Hilliard).
I'm still thinking about this movie, 15 years later, after seeing it at a local art film movie house in Ann Arbor.
Overall the show is a must watch for everyone and despite the fact the idiots a Fox canceled it after 72 episodes.
is that because i'm bored after all that hours watching the first and the second season?
But I like (or used to like) The Simpsons more and arguably the reason it went downhill after the end of the 90's was because FOX moved the good writers to Futurama, and therefore killing The Simpsons in the process.
They sure owe it to us fans after those four terrible movies.
The first episode deals with his being frozen in a cryogenic capsule for a thousand years, in the background through the window we see the changing of New York, which has become New New York, and remains the central setting for the series after this episode.
(we later find out she is in fact a mutant and her parents live underground) Fry runs from Leela after being assigned work as a delivery boy (for he wished for a fresh start) and meets Bender the robot, who is programmed to bend, and has a selfish and indulgent persona, enjoying cigars and alcohol (incidentally the fuel of all robots).
I tried to burn the videotape after watching it, but it rejected fire.
and he went in after her to find her with his magic remote and they traveled through the channels and battled the villain, who turned out to be the creepy guy from the video store.
I have since forgotten everything after Andy goes into the television, except for a few fuzzy details.
Lugosi, conversely, left Universal after this film and began appearing in even crappier films for smaller studios--the so-called "Poverty Row" studios such as Monogram.
It seems really bizarre that after starring in "The Gay DivorcÃ©e," Rodgers and Astaire went back to playing supporting roles in this one.
It seems farfetched because many people were still struggling after the depression.
Harlow is involved with James Stewart, and he doesn't want her to work after they get married.
So sad that she died only a year after this film was made.
Those in the picture are responsible, but he wants to go after those higher up, who ordered the interrogation techniques and knew what was going on.
When it is revealed that during an amnesty period after the Abu G scandal was revealed many photos and other documents were handed in a shredded, we get, not just a slow mo of shredded paper falling through the air, we get also get an entire cell block filled with bits of paper.
It is run by a lovable dowager referred to as Aunt Minnie, whose nephew Jack Kent ends up in Paris after his band gets fired right after they disembark from their transatlantic voyage.
The plot threads start to feel unwieldy after a while, but journeyman director William A. Seiter is smart enough to know when to include the musical interludes.
Astaire-Rogers fans may be disappointed to find them dance only twice in the film together, the first well after the half-hour mark in an informal but energetic tap routine and the second near the end in their standard formal wear.
Astaire has only one solo to "I Won't Dance"; and perhaps to pacify fans, there is a brief reprisal dance inserted after the story's actual ending though dramatically it makes little sense.
He was provided the shawl since it was cold and shortly after the photos were taken the wires, which were never connected to any power source, were removed.
He introduces fake basement-tape video reenactments (a device he has used before) to augment the visuals of the Abu Ghraib abuses--close-ups of "prisoners'" bodies, blood dripping on a uniform, keys going into a lock--so that after a while you aren't sure what is real and what is fake.
Even four years after they dominated every front page and bulletin, they have lost none of their power to appal and disgust.
If you make it all the way through, follow the crew's example, and break out the brandy; after that, you deserve one.
Some twenty-three years after the end of the Second World War, Submarine X-1 is still ludicrously and woodenly propagandist.
Fortunately for the viewing public, James Caan, who is a really excellent actor, went on to much bigger and better things straight after Submarine X-1.
The film becomes a heartbreak after this.
In actuality there are actually two B movies in one here: A pretty taught little SNEAKERS/WARGAMES ripoff about a nuclear war triggered by "accident" after Lybians hijack a shipment of cruise missiles and shoot one into Russia.
Bleak sci-fi begins with three astronauts who are forced to crashland on post-nuke earth after a nuclear holocaust.
This is what the back of the DVD-cover says: Three astronauts return to Earth two months after a nuclear holocaust and find disease-crazed humans wandering through shanty towns constructed from the refuse of the previous civilization.
A noteworthy member of the post-nuclear apocalypse genre of film that adds admirably to the body of opinion of what the world would be like after an all out nuclear war.
More sensible than the fantasy treatment of movies such as "Road Warrior" or "A Boy and His Dog", but not so dismal as "The Day After", this movie gives a bit more feel of what really might happen after a Nuclear confrontation, but has enough action and adventure to make for a good film.
The story line starts off well but begins to worsen not too soon after the start, and gets worse and worse and then plateaus and then gets worse again.
I like to think that after shooting this drek Hitchcock left for the USA one jump ahead of a mob of discerning movie-goers handicapped by the huge amounts of tar and feathers they were carrying.
The main character is Mary Yellan, the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience, who comes to stay with her aunt and uncle after the deaths of her parents, but who flees from the inn after discovering her uncle's criminal activities.
Laughton was also responsible for the casting of O'Hara, even though Hitchcock had not wanted to use her after a poor screen test.
It is hardly surprising that Du Maurier disliked the adaptation and that Hitchcock left Britain for Hollywood as soon as possible after completing it.
Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable -- Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the "gentleman" who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty.
Touchingly, Sir Humphrey bids another servant to watch over Chadwick after he leaves because he's worried about the other man's mental health!
I liked what O'Hara was able to do with her eyes after Laughton tied her mouth up; she was clearly naturally talented as a screen actress.
Robert Newton appears as the anti-pirate in this one, and after narrowly escaping death at the hands of Joss Merlyn's (Leslie Banks) rowdy bunch, he takes charge to bring Pengallan to his ultimate demise.
I think studio heads really saw Rogers' amazing abilities through the end of World War II (after which she was shamefully abandoned) - she seldom played the "classy woman" and we instead find her as a shop girl, prisoner on furlough, society wannabe, entertainer.
He brought her to America right after this and had RKO sign her to play Esmerelda in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
It was after a night of drinking and fighting with his best friend Bob Herrick, William Bishop, and while barley sober marrying a complete stranger Lorry Reed, Gloria McGhehee, that Brady finally came to his senses.
It was also after being dumped by his girlfriend, who would later marry his best friend Bob, Elsie Reyonolds-Doe Avedow- and his brother Tim suddenly dropping dead, after having a violent argument with him, that changed Brady's way of thinking.
One little known historical fact that was left out is that Truman's first official act upon becoming President after F.D.R.
We were just a little too young to have been affected by "Casablanca", "The Maltese Falcon" or "The Big Sleep" and "Citizen Kane" did not really become known in this country until way after it was made.
But then there is an even greater irony inasmuch as Holly too is drawn to Harry; after all they have friends since boyhood.
Pop it in the VCR sometime after midnight and soak it in baby.
The Third Man is a noir thriller set in postwar Vienna which tells the story of a couple of Americans trying to renew a childhood friendship in a foreign country after growing up to be very different people.
Valli gives you that hopeless feeling that many people felt after the war.
Soon after his arrival he learns that Lime has been killed in an accident and after attending his funeral, intends to return home as soon as possible.
Shortly after this, Martins discovers that Lime is actually still alive and meets with him at a local amusement park.
Not surprisingly, The Third Man works incredibly well not only as a non-stop adventure film, but also as a realistic depiction of a world struggling to recuperate after an enormous tragedy.
In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles).
He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed.
Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.
It is interesting to note that BBC Radio resurrected the character for the series 'The Lives of Harry Lime' very shortly after the film's release.
It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.
On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war.
In fact, after asking my wife why this and why that and getting extremely good answers, I ultimately was left with a desire to have modified only a couple very minor things.
But, after I thought of it as the same theme with a similar story, I started liking it more.
Moreover, she and Karaman clearly developed a sense of mutual trust, so she logically would show Karaman the missing key and let him do the investigation (after all he's a police).
I sought out this movie after reading many glowing reviews on IMDb.
He pays 100 grand and tells David he will pay another 400 grand after the job is done.
The central set piece is well executed, and the build up to it is well done also; but it has to be said that the film starts to fall apart a little after that.
But if he was a screwup at the rank of major he would have had his twenty years in and been discharged after being passed over for Lieutenant Colonel.
The fact that "Go Tell the Spartans" was made-three years after the war ended-when the wounds of the Vietnam War were barley healed had the movie going Amercan public in no mood to go see it.
Before and after the Vietnam War ended!
$250K had to be lent to director Ted Post by Burt Lancaster to get the film completed after the producer seems to have had trouble accounting for it.
Then just after the NY Film Critics gave the film their coveted award for the year, its distributer went bankrupt, killing the tiny promotion budget, and the film was pulled.
In fact his last line about just wanting "to go home now" (spoken to the spectral Viet Cong in the mist after the battle) shows his disillusion with the war.
The scene in which Lancaster explains to Singer why, after three wars and a bucket full of medals, he (Lancaster) is still only a major, is priceless.
London After Midnight is without a doubt the most sought after lost film in history.So badly do we want to see The Man in the Beaver Hat have motion that TCM made this reconstruction that gives a loose idea of what the plot was like.
Not many people like the plot after reading it and seeing this reconstruction, I do.
"London After Midnight" is perhaps the most sought after movie, that is presumed lost.
Just like watching a letterbox film on television, after the first five minutes, my mind settled into the tempo and pacing and I really did enjoy the story.
And the camera movements were excellent and after a slow opening they seemed to have more stills to work with and made good use of them too.
Leonore accepts her fate to follow the family curse, yet Daniel won't allow her and reiterates his oath to protect her, in this life and the life after.
Soon after the Battle of New Orleans, in the early 1800's, a Kentucky rifleman(Wayne)and his fighting buddy(Oliver Hardy)linger in a settlement of French, homesteading in Alabama.
John Wayne's second effort as star/producer (after "Angel and the Badman", in 1947), "The Fighting Kentuckian" is a VERY enjoyable tale, set in 1818 Alabama, of coonskin-capped Wayne, part of the Kentucky militia, falling for French immigrant Vera Ralston (in her second film with Duke), and discovering a plot to swindle the French community (composed of ex-officers of Napoleon, and their families) out of their land, by aristocrat John Howard and ruthless river boss Grant Withers.
However other French veterans did come here after the war - the restored Bourbon monarchy was not welcoming to soldiers who fought for Napoleon in the "100 days" of 1815.
My favorite one liner in The Fighting Kentuckian is the one where John Breen (John Wayne), after being shot while surveying, comes to a cabin of French settlers, and is discovered by the men who shoot him.
(Those lucky ladies reeled for hours after.)
It's such a shame that Woo's American career got off to such a dodgy start (this is the second US film he made, after the Van Damme film "Hard Target").
However, she finds a man, Lawrence Hamilton, (George Brent) who loves her very much because she works for his father's firm and he asks her to marry him after many years.
Perhaps there is hope for us after all.
Directed by John Woo Broken Arrow was his second American action film after the fabulous Hard Target (1993), I personally rate Broken Arrow, & Hard Target for that matter, as one of my favourite over-the-top action flicks from the 90's & for that I apologise to no-one.
The only scene which really made me cringe was when Hale falls off the back of the truck & he then picks himself up, runs after it, catches it up & jumps on the back!
I don't think so, the truck itself had at least a 10 second head start before we even discuss how slow it would have to have been going for Hale to physically run after it & catch it up.
Turns out, the true reason is Maj. Deakins (Travolta), who is still in a grudge after being passed from promotion for a long time, is out to steal the two bombs and hold the for ransom.
John Travolta and Christian Slater are great in their roles as Deakins and Hale two friends turned adversaries after a training exercise goes awry.
John Woo, after his many Hong Kong efforts, came to America and made Hard Target (1993), which due to studio interference and bad taking of direction by Jean Claude Van Damme, wasn't as good as it could have been.
Action sequence after the other, no let-down in between.
John Travolta did perhaps after "Face Off" one of the best jobs in his career.
The other brother, Uwe, ends up going along after drowning his sorrows when his wife leaves him.
Check out the shoulder pads on the main character, and the shadow of the sound boom visible after the "yakuza" is given a necklace by his sister.
Hoping, after that he can start a new life.
When there is a competition 5 years after the Promise, there's a competition for doubles on television and the best claude franÃ§ois wins 100000 euro (125000 dollar) Bernard wants to compete and starts his old routine but he thinks he IS the star and starts acting on it.
No one has yet been able to identify which story that is, indicating the film either was going the Blair Witch route in trying to lend itself credibility, or else was conceived after hearing something about some man who tried to kill some naked girl somewhere.
That is of course, after he rapes them.
She is stripped naked and forced to run from the crazy hunter who goes after her with a crossbow until she actually proves too resilient, and he switches to a long range hunting rifle.
As many of these type films are this is based on a true story, this one's based on an Alaska serial killer named Robert Hansen who after sexually abusing and raping his prostitute victims released them in a remote area of Alaska to stalk and kill them with his rifle.
Those were in less thrilling troubles, and ultimately went down in bliss - Diane here takes her summary revenge, becoming a terminatress, and seems to live on quite happily (ever after?)
She turns the tables on them by, yes, getting really angry and then going after them with hand-made weapons.
When she attempts to escape from his jeep, he cold-cocks her, not long after, she finds herself in the middle of a wilderness buck naked.
I found this refreshing after watching Eli Roth delighting in the torture of women in the risible 'Hostel II' & Danielle De Luca is very good in a demanding physical role which must have taken a lot of bravery to do.
Also, the actions of the local townspeople from Dwight to Diana's flatmate Rita (Lisa Hill) never seem unrealistic (though the ending did seem a little out of place after everything which had gone before it).
As the reviewer on IMDb says it confounds your expectations by allowing things and people to survive and for events to unfold differently then you thought... (Read The IMDb comments after you see the film since they give too much away) Basically this is about an old guy who was going to give his fortune away to friends and relatives because his grand daughter can't be found.
The snappy patter, split-second timing and overlapping dialogue is enough to make you want the script for re-reading after the credits have run.
If BRINGING UP BABY has rapid-fire dialogue and one crazy scene after the other, HIS GIRL Friday goes even faster and is 10 minutes shorter.
And that's just for starters: The timing of the thing is still awe- inspiring after sixty-odd years; the supporting actors, down to the bit-players, are all memorable, convincing and hilarious; the camera work (this IS the forties, though) is inventive and the editing superb.
The big scene comes just after his friend has been killed in a mining accident.
I bought this movie after enjoying the first two, and knowing that the movies would have nothing in common.
If you *do* appreciate films like this, you'll feel refreshed after watching it and you'll feel like you'd like to meet Mike and maybe buy him a coke... just don't try to shake his hand.
Both top men could have left their "Crow" to go back to the dead after he believes he has avenged his girl and himself, but decide to kidnap the one living person who has a tie to the "Crow".
He returns to discover that a corrupt police force is behind her murder and for him to go after the killers, he must find out the mystery behind everything that happened.
I did get a bit sick of it after watching it about 30 times or so, but very few movies keep my attention that long.
Everyone keeps saying they learned their lesson after City of Angels.
They're what convinced me to see the two sequels, after all.
The actual nice things in the movie are small details like the secret eating of the walnut by the elder sister,like the scene of epilepsy attack of Deli Omer...- In the beginning of the movie,there was a scene o a cat moving around a man crying which is shot totally incidentally,is making you feel good ,happy but not...and immediately after the dead man comes alive and you feel peculiar... During all the time,during all that childish love stories you actually expect the explanation of that coming back to life scene and it is explained actually in the end when Recep promises Deli Omer to bring alive his dead wife.
The excitement of watching and listening to those legends is still with me and I especially remember the amazement that registered on Chubby Checker's face when he saw the enthusiastic response he was getting from the crowd so many years after his hit version of Hank Ballard's Twist.
I got a hold of a VHS copy of this movie recently after watching it as a child over and over again.
I watched if after 'Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason' because I reckoned I needed something serious after that fairy-tale, but I was not prepared to see what it was coming.
It was after seeing this that I bought a load of the Hardy Boys kids novels to read.
Frank and Joe are assisted by Joe's girlfriend Iola (Carole Ann Campbell) and hindered by their Aunt Gertrude who is looking after them while their father is out of town.
But we were hooked and faithfully tuned in day after day.
Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear.
The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a filler arc when something finally happens after 6 episodes.
You should watch the whole show, though, if you expect to understand any of it (even twice won't hurt, if you'll like it as much as I do), but only after seeing the sequel "Higurashi no naku koro ni kai" (which is not half as good, and can't really be called "horror") you'll really understand more then a few pieces.
All episodes tells the story of main characters(some side characters) encountering different/same/similar events in small countryside village called 'Hinamizawa' (This feels like parallel universe setting, after each story ends, good or bad they go back in time and start again but this time something else happens with new characters, and more mysteries are created or answered).
First few episode of each arc are done average to near horrible (Personal Experience: I almost decided to stop watching the series after half way through the first episode,,,thank god I didn't!).
Full of twists, turns, and unpleasant surprises, after watching this, you won't be able to close an eyelid for some time.
It has nothing to do with characters , plot or even his album (which the movie is titled after) , instead it is about Cam'ron.
Tony in order to satisfy his sick sexual urges also rapes and violates the womens after he murders them having him dubbed by the local newspapers and police as the "New York Necrophilia Rapist/Killer".
Unfortunately Tony didn't seek help and it was after he crossed that point of no return when he went from watching to murdering the women that turned him on that there was no help that society, other then long stretch behind bars or a cops bullet in his chest, could offer him.
There's nothing wrong with showing women dressing and undressing--this is an adult film after all and it has its audience.
Richner worked in Kampuchea before, during and after Pol Pot, and his coal-face assessment agrees with most historians.
Even after all these years, after all that's happened, these men had no qualms about showing the world their routines, making it obvious that they don't equate their actions directly to the effects it had on their fellow country men and women.
However, the patient viewer will soon find him or herself immersed in the horrors of the Khmer Rouge as detail after detail of the atrocities committed in the prison emerge.
There's some nice drag racing sequences as well, especially the one at the climax of the film that has a 1955 Chevy flip-flopping after losing control.
The early 1970s were not "happy days" after the devaluation of the dollar.
With the money he made from this he made, after a brief 3 year holiday to Jamaica, the greatest film trilogy of all time- Star Warp!
Curt starts cruising with Steve and Laurie (Curt's sister, Steve's girlfriend)he sees a blonde in a white T-Bird, who becomes his obsession for the night after she mouths "I love you" to him.
John ends up having to drive around with Carol (who is probably about 13) after some girls who are cruising play a trick on him.
Now Curt is on the hunt to find this blonde woman as he encounters a gang called The Pharaohs who want to pound him after he scratches the gang's car.
Yet, as he tries to impress people, he meets one girl Debbie (Candy Clark) who decides to go with Terry after she hears about him talking about his "new" car.
A very intelligent and believable film that only seems to get better with repeated viewings, and after seeing it for the first time, you will want to see it again.
After cruising with Milner all night, teenage Carol hates to say goodbye but does, waving from her porch with the light on; Toad survives one bad accident after another, but his real moment is in hearing praise from his date (fantastic, husky-voiced Candy Clark, dolled up like a speeding Sandra Dee) just before she says good night; after chasing his dream date all night, Kurt (Richard Dreyfuss, green and anxious, and appealingly bemused) finally gets to talk to the stunning blonde wonder on the telephone, where she whispers a wrenching goodbye.
The Gestapo blackmail Hess' right-hand man (after bugging his apartment and threatening him with the kidnapping of his son) into organizing a party which would gather together the leading figures of the uprising.
Then, after seeing it a couple of times, I had to admit that the RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO was one of the best films of the genre.
The actors did a great job; Hans Weingartner demonstrates again after 'Die Fetten Jahre Sind Vorbei', that he is one of the best German-speaking directors of today's industry.
Going back to reincarnation theme, after looking at the movie from a psychological perspective, a firm believer in reincarnation could attest that the young boy was the dead husband understanding the value and depth of his wife's love only after his death.
(This review was written after I saw the film at the Toronto film Festival in September '07)  For anyone struggling to find an artistic direction, a new voice, or inspiration, this is a must.
It tells the story of Reiner, a TV executive specialising in Reality TV - his latest project involves a sperm race between three contestants to win the opportunity to impregnate a woman - who experiences a Damascene conversion following an encounter with a woman whose grandfather committed suicide after being falsely indicted in one of Reiner's news shows.
I watched this miniseries after seeing the documentary, The Boys from Baraka.
Each event in the mini-series seems timeless and not easily forgotten, as I write this now, five months after I last saw THE CORNER, all I can think of is a shoot-out in the latter half of the story.
But there is no more highs after death, there is only a gap.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
Maybe it was laziness, maybe part of me was interested, maybe I felt bad about considering Shyamalan a hack after only watching and not enjoying one and a half movies of his (Sixth Sense and the end of the Village), but I watched it and it was great.
Then after "The Happening" I decided I had to see ALL of his Movies in the last couple of weeks.
I go to Walton Academy, Catholic school for boys ... don't laugh' (played with great feeling and sensitivity by Joseph Kross), and his quest to find meaning after the death of his beloved grandfather.
This film tells about a 10 year old boy Joshua A Beal's (Joseph Cross) quest for God after his grandfather's death.
The story involves a child's quest to find God after his beloved grandfather dies.
Little attention was given a film about a kid searching for God after his grandpa dies.
after viewing just the trailer, my sister and i looked at each other and said, "we have to see that..." so, when i found it at blockbuster a few months later, i jumped to rent it.
At first she is very skeptical like every normal human being would be about a silly claim like that but after the boy begins to mention some things that only the real husband of the woman would know she begins to believe him and fall in love with him which causes problems for everyone around her   -the first time I saw this I really hated it.
but I think after you watch the movie again expecting the crappy ending you really begin to see the movie as what it is which is a look at how one little event can destroy someone's life if they're not careful.
It's just a simple story of a young boy searching for God after his Grandfather dies and in the process finding himself awakening to what's going on in life as well as restoring his faith.
Further, even if there was information in the box about the prior marriage, it would never have reached the detail that the boy later disclosed to the widow, and since the boy confronted the widow very shortly after the box was buried, he would not have had time to have read and memorized all the information contained therein.
All the viewers know about the boy is what they see after he begins following the woman so viewers know nothing of his character or his prior life.
Buying The Cow is a tale of David Collins (Jerry O'Connell) who freaks after his girlfriend begins hinting for a proposal which results in him dating strange women.
A woman has lost her husband and somehow after a ten year period, a small boy appears proclaiming he is the reincarnated soul of her deceased husband.
4 years after the movie was made, I stumbled upon a gem.
I was sucked in 15 minutes after it started and couldn't leave my couch even to hardly run to the bathroom.
Seen with the benefit of hindsight, the story is rather far-fetched, since there really was no serious threat of a German invasion after 1940, but of course those making the movie (and those watching it) didn't have the benefit of hindsight, and so it has to be seen for what it is: a well done bit of movie-making encouraging the English to fight back in case it did happen.
R. Lee Ermey is always a good addition; couldn't help but wonder how much he was being paid for this, and how did he end up doing this after doing the great Kubrick film "Full Metal Jacket".
Even though film is picks up well from beginning and doesn't allow spectaculars to move from the seat, after some time you can easily predict what will happen next.
Also all 4 friends looks energetic throughout the life of their characters even though they do not eat or drink anything after their accident...It is one more goof in the film.
It showed how the family came to be and how some of them got their wounds in the last movie which is set after this one.
The problem I've always had with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies is this idea that the state police never seem to come knocking after these gruesome deaths occur and the victims go missing.
Shortly after the terrifying, recognizable psycho Leatherface commits his first murders, a cross story involving an encounter with some nasty bikers throws the doomed teenagers flipping across the road in a surprisingly brutal accident.
Also the last sequence when we watch her at the beach, after she has married Joseph and is seen wandering in the water crying is another clue we get from her.
It takes place in 1969 and has two brothers (Taylor Handley and Matthew Bomer) going to enlist (after being drafted).
Pacino is in good form after a long break in the 1980's.
I just felt like the director took an easy way out after entertaining me the entire film.
Keller, after going through several dates with many women who answer the ad(..which came from a poem Frank's mom wrote), begins a steamy love-affair with a sexy divorcÃ©e into kink.
I did not realize who the director of this film was until after I finished it.
A record "Sea of Love" is played in all the crime scenes.. All the victims were killed after sex...
We are introduced to a character, Frank Keller, that just achieved 20 years in service, that can't see really something after the retirement (that is what he hears of a lot, about the retirement) and that not long before he had a divorce (one the guys from his job is now with his ex-wife.
And is typical stuff with the woman disappointed after finding out that Frank lied, and is predictable since you always know Pacino and Barkin's character will end happily together (and well the detectives found out who the murderer was just out of luck).
Keller's life that was driving him to a mental and emotional breakdown after his wife left him.
Al Pacino returns to the big screen after a four year hiatus in "Sea Of Love".
She responds to his ad and, after an initial rebuff, an increasing attraction between them begins to take shape.
In next to no time, Keller is in too deep Â he finds himself falling in love with a suspect, playing a dangerous game with his own life, so obsessed with the thought that he may have found love after his marital failure that he cannot face the possibility his new lover might be the very murderer he is out to catchÂ.
Some of my friends thought this is one of those films that is great the first time you see it, but diminishes after that because the heavy suspense questions have been answered.
Some of it seemed slightly heavy handed,but after thinking about it,I realized Ahmed's intention was to challenge one's views about these subjects.
With all the stupid,silly movies I see on cable night after night,I rented a copy of God has a rap sheet,and man was I happy to see a movie that told the truth about things Hollywood is too scared to talk about.
I initially left with a sour taste in my mouth after viewing the ending.
Overall, what remains after the end is a feeling of disappointment.
In fact, there was nothing at all in Colbert's performance to indicate she was maintaining secret knowledge after their conversation.
For anyone living in the lower East Side (one of the worst drug problems in the world) it's great to play recognize the location after watching "Rumble in the Bronx" one too many times.
They agree but only after substantial financial rewards are promised.
After I saw this I imagined how the audience back in 1900 were like after they saw this.
And the night after you saw the movie, you're still in it.
after that, this movie has a deep meaning, philosophical, and totally haunting (yet beautiful).
I don't even understand it fully after having watched it, but if you can't suspend your disbelief, why the hell are you watching a horror movie?
I was so excited to finally watch "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed.
They are good movies, but those scares wear off after awhile.
With over 100 hours of gameplay through beautifully crafted levels this game fails to strike boredom, even after completion.
As a convalescing detective & stern head nurse with romantic difficulties in their recent past, they keep the plot racing - especially after murder rears its ugly head.
("You took care of me, you took care of Sammy...") And that was also just hours after the events of "Devil's Trap," where John heard Dean begging Sam to not shoot John, stopping Sam from killing the YED once and for all.
We are then are able to feel for Sam and understand his reaction after the secret is revealed.
We are able to understand her confusion and shock after realizing she is not alone.
I've seen someone pull a gun out from under the couch and start screaming that someone was after him.
When I was at school in my early teens, never a film was so much talked about after a weekend.
He did sleep with a pistol under his pillow every night of his life, and he carried a loaded gun on his person everywhere he went, every day of his life (I do the same thing btw...and the VA treated me for PTSD after 'Nam).
after being talked into it, seems he didn't want to play himself, he thought it would degrade the Medal of Honor.
Most of the other actors fit blandly into their goofy patterned innocent/naive American farmboy roles, and it wears thin after a while.
In some ways, after the crusade in Europe, that attitude was justified.
While it's amazing that the baby faced Murphy still looks young enough in 1955 for the story to work 15 years after the fact, the truly amazing thing is that from most accounts, Murphy understates his own role in many of the events described in the movie.
Like many great soldiers, however, he had trouble adjusting to life after the war even with a semi-successful acting career aided by James Cagney after the war.
In my opinion this is Fellini's no 2 picture(after Satyricon).
Although I have recently watched some of Fellini's most famous films, after seeing this one, I drew a conclusion that CITY OF WOMEN can hardly be compared to any other movie from the Italian director.
Probably there is no Fellini's film, after Amarcord (1973), with such a high level of mastery as "Otto e mezzo", "La Dulce Vita", and Amarcord.
another good thing is that the tangos are always in different locations so you can't run through it after playing the level a few times.
It is clumsily cross cut with Guevera's speech at the UN after Fidel takes power (thankfully color coded in B&W to tell us where we are) and the jarring transitions further impede the films flow save for Che re-phrasing his humanist viewpoint ad nauseum.
This is interspersed with excerpts from an interview Che gives while visiting the the UN after the revolution and from his speech to the UN general assembly.
"I was trying to find the scenes that would happen before or after the scene you would typically see in a movie like this," says Soderbergh.
Nonetheless, this movie does not focus into great detail the hundreds of executions that took place after Fidel's rise to power.
Events occur and we are shown flashes, learning details after the fact or never at all.
Again, those looking for a character piece similar to Stone's portrayal of George W. Bush last year would be wise to reevaluate their will to see Che; although titled after the man himself, and a biopic on a purely ostensible level, Che is more about his fight than the man himself.
Curly follows them after he sees them talking to Kowalski.
Two years after their success with Django, director Sergio Corbucci and lead actor Franco Nero teamed up again for this western which, to the best of my knowledge (and surprise) was never released with an alternate title including the word 'Django'.
Also after the opening credits the film actually went black and dead quiet for 3 minutes or so, and I was thinking maybe I wasn't meant to see it, but that was short-lived and I was back right into it.
The second collaboration of Sergio Corbucci, the Italian Western's most important director besides Sergio Leone, and Franco Nero, one of the genre's greatest actors, after the ingenious "Django" from 1966, "Il Mercenario", a movie set in the time of the Mexican revolution, and therefore late for a Western, is a must-see for every fan of the genre.
While Paco is a crook, but also an idealist, becoming more and more idealistic after his troop is joined by beautiful and idealistic Columba, a woman whose father was a revolutionary , the Polish is a typical anti-hero, witty and cool and somehow sympathetic, but mainly concerned on his own benefit.
This film is about the family interaction after a boy is found to have leukaemia.
Another good scene is the dance after Squall passes his final exam to get into SEED.
I had never even heard of this film before Mondo Macabro announced their upcoming DVD release of it, so I was surprised to find - after I had already ordered it online - that Leonard Maltin had in fact reviewed it in his Guide and gave it his proverbial *1/2 rating usually allotted to such sensationalist fare.
Another good scene is the dance after Squall passes his final exam to get into SEED.
Morrow to his son the pitcher after he strikes his son to the ground, Don't lie to me.
Joyce Van Patten tries to kick Haley's motor bike after he throws a lit cigarette at her after she tells him to get off an unused part of the ball field.
What's amazing was that after the game's release was a sudden fad when people went crazy over the Rinoa angel wings, Squall's Lion symbols, and the beautiful song: Eyes on Me.
Chief rebel but much more coordinated is one small, hell-raising fireball, Jackie Earl Haley, who shows more grit than his sneakers after the bottom of the ninth.
The movie is about an alcoholic low key unfriendly pool cleaner named Morris Buttermaker who is payed to coach a team of little leaguers after one of the kid's Dad sued the league for the right to play, the team is of course a team of underdogs, the kind of kids who you wouldn't want playing on your team in gym class; with Toby: The Nice guy who's gonna finish last Lupous, the shy one Tanner, the short- tempered, overbearing, runt Ahmad, the token black kid Engleberg, the fat kid Rudi Stein, the uncoordinated awkward guy Ogilvy, the smart one Jimmy, the curly top Jose and Miguel, the foreigners and Regi, the redhead with an overbearing sports Dad One thing I liked the best is that they give each kid a reasonable amount of screen time, some (Amanda, Kelly, Tanner,)more than others, but each a good amount, so you can know each member all pretty well, unlike most sports movies, where you only get to know a couple players, while the rest are pretty much extra's.
together, they do not make a good team, but after Buttermaker's ex- girlfriend's daughter, Amanda joins the team to prove to Buttermaker she can still pitch and the local bully "lone shark" (as Ahmad said), Kelly Leak joins the team to tick off the A$$hat Yankee's coach, Roy Turner, the Bear's eventually get their act together and become a great team, going to the championship (and losing), still think it's sounds boring?
Buttermaker just wants his check, but he finds himself regaining a fighting spirit as others shove their arrogance down his throat and those of the boys he is charged to look after.
When the team tries to quit after getting pasted by the Yankees in their first game, 26-0, Buttermaker delivers a line that resonates, like so much in this movie, down through the years: "This quitting thing, it's a hard habit to break once you start."
Director Michael Ritchie and screenwriter Bill Lancaster knew what they were after and deliver it, a pitch-perfect social satire dressed as a sports film with a cast of mostly unknown kids who lack for professional finesse but seem to lay their souls bare to the camera.
Both are now deceased and I finally took a view at the DVD this week after not having seen it in more than 2 decades.
Another highlight is a kid deliberately letting the opposing team get a home run after his father/coach loses it and hits him on the field.
Now watching it again after twenty-some years I see my tastes in movies has changed but it was still surprisingly good.
Then he goes after his one great discovery.
I remember first seeing it at a drive-in when I was ten, shortly after my own little league season had finished.
Walter Matthau is excellent as Buttermaker, the beer-soaked coach who takes on the unwanted task of coaching a team of misfit kids who were allowed to play in the league only after a civil action law suit was won in their favor.
The hero gets put in jail after the leader of the ring, Mr. Murray(who also happens to be a customer of his girlfriend), plants marked money on him and sends the cops in to arrest him.
This documentary should also be a must-see for any straight married couple - it may make them stop taking their union and each other for granted - after all, it's a right that is not afforded to all.
I was amazed how my friend talked about it for days after and may even accompany me to the next fund raiser event.
Yes, the movie comes off as pro gay rights, but as the filmmaker stated after the viewing, the other side was approached, but for the most part, they refused to respond on camera.
-sigh- Well, after the first disk, you're left with a cheap plot.
In fact, the Junction system is so time-consuming that you resort to actually turning off this game after this process is completed.
I have always thought of myself as doing my part for LGBT causes but after seeing this and how people dedicate there LIFE to it and how even straight people are dedicating there precious time away from family to do give us what we deserve, I gotta say I felt guilty.
I have always considered myself an activist, especially since I moved to Arkansas but after seeing "Saving Marriage", I see how little I have done.
At first, I was interested in seeing this film since it was named after a series of prints by Hogarth.
Firstly I'm a fan of this saga,and played it from the fifth installment,and I'll buy a ps3 just for this saga(and for metal gear solid too)Many people says that FF VIII is the weakest of the series.Why?Is it because it tells a perfect love story?Or is it because it hasn't got a perfect villain like Sephiroth?I love this game so much,cause Squall is a lot like me,and he gives me more courage to open up people after I've finished the game,and after that;life become more beautiful than ever for me.Just this enough for me to say,that's the best game I've ever played,but other characters,their relationships,graphics,astonishing and flawless FMV's(best opening and ending movies for a game by so far),musics("eyes on me"rocks!
Her portrayal of an expert markswoman / assassin is picture-perfect, and she delivers with conviction such lines as (after shooting two guys point-blank) "Hell yeah I think you're afraid of me!".
The rest of the film, however, is one disappointment after another: Roddy Piper is an ex-wrestler.
The twist that was the most interesting was that the floral delivery guy (John Payne) actually becomes the "hero" of the film as he becomes an amateur sleuth and hunts down the men who framed him, eventually winding up in a Mexican resort with the group and pretending to be one of them after witnessing the hood come to an unlucky end at the hands of Mexican police.
A tense, compact crime picture (not really a noir, but they're calling everything noir these days) about a man framed for a robbery he didn't commit, and how he goes after the bad guys at a Mexican resort.
Even pretty girl Colleen Gray's part is nicely woven in at the end, after I thought she was just a romantic interest.
In Kansas City, the criminals Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand) and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef) are individually hired by a stranger (Preston Foster) that plots the robbery of an armored car after receiving the money from a bank in the next door of a flower shop.
John Payne has an excellent performance in the role of a former war hero that tries to have a straight life after some gambling problems, but is framed, loses his job and the rest of his honor and sees his picture in the front page of the news, becoming impossible to find a new job.
Her character did one implausible thing after another, things NO woman would do and softened the rough edges of this movie, which was a mistake.
They are given half a playing card as a key of mutual recognition when they are to reunite for the splitting of the money (some six months after the robbery, in a resort in Mexico).
I was dragged along to a film festival to see this by a mate after he convinced me based solely on a picture of a fat metalhead playing an inflatable pink guitar at an unnamed concert.
And just days after viewing the disappointingly cursory "American Hardcore", "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" throws down a challenge in its first scenes when a frazzled youth with a microphone makes sure to add that "punkÂdoes not belong in this world".
I also had visions of Gilligan's Island dancing in my head when (according to the story) the rag-tag group managed to build very livable huts (with doors and beds no less) after just 3 weeks on the island!
Atrocities, executions, war, accidents, murders, dead kids, and suicides leave their imprint in your mind after you watch it.
I opened this write up with a funny line spoken by Robert Redford because having just finished the film I feel all jolly, and that is a priceless thing after watching one of the most suspenseful films ever!
Additionally, had it appeared a few years later, after the sci-fi craze began following STAR WARS, it probably would have fared better.
The characters were all a pretty grim lot, but after 24 episodes you start to warm to them, feeling for their predicament.
But this was the first show I ever followed, in my memory, week after week without fail, and so I love it to bits, even with all of its faults.
She's just great--but she's killed off after one scene!
The idiotic and constantly angry chief of police, the wise-cracking cop who learned his trade 'on the street', the portrayal of a strong female character as 'that big bitch over there' and the solving of the case after finding a match book (surely that has been used in Scooby Doo before!).
Later in the film after disposing of a key criminal who just happens to be a woman Taggart tuts "Women".
Mazhar Alanson of famous band MFO which I am a fan of, is quite good together with Selim Nasit who died shortly after this film.
A weakness in the film that challenges us is that John's features were not altered so very much in the movie after his war injuries and the required facial surgery.
But now, after nineteen years of their estrangement, reality has set in for both: Elizabeth has a family to care for, a present obligation which takes precedence, and John too has the responsibility of a young adopted daughter, Margaret (Natalie Wood).
To say that it was so bad that even monkeys would have brain damage after watching it is an understatement.
Holloway's talent was wasted here, and the useless frame after frame after frame after FRAME of the no talent Sarah Caldwell made it VERY clear that the dog had more talent.
I was able to figure it out after a while, but it jumped from scene to scene without smooth transitions of ideas.
Leave it to Bruno Mattei to hit the cannibal subgenre 20 years after its highpoint.
Flynn was a tragic figure, a larger then life adventurer and lover who 's reputation, after death, naturally, was smeared by a several books, now proved to be false.
The reporter leaves after that tidbit.
There was no happily ever after endings for young Tudor.
It's Flynn's third appearance with sword in hand for Warner Brothers after Captain Blood and Charge of the Light Brigade.
Now, after his downfall, he works as a security guard in a garage, and is still a junkie.
He lives as a security guard in a abandoned machine shop after losing his cushy day job to drugs, when his best friend OD's and dies on the street in a bad part of town.
And, for some reason, when he is injected with what looks like radioactive waste, it actually gives him superpowers, and he regains all his stamina and is able to jump onto rooftops from the ground (after falling off of them).
I rented Jackhammer Massacre, after hearing the first half was good.
But after that its all downhill from there.
So basically everyone gets killed except the girl of the group, and Jacks lesbian sister, who came to help jack, but got locked up in a closet after the ghost told Jack she was really "one of them".
The ghost tells Jack to get up after falling off a 3 story building.
This one sees Axel head back to Beverly Hills after a 3-year gap to solve the Alphabet crimes.
I remember being moved after watching Leonardo DiCaprio in "Basketball Diaries" and I can honestly say this movie did the same.
And the word after Jackhammer...?
His supplier is after him for money, his boss fires him, his only pal dies in his arms of an overdose; what's left of his world is crashing down and what's a drug addled loser to do?
It turnsout in the end, after all of Duke Togo's near misses and narrow escapes, "a brain" housed in a control center is responsible for stealing the Cassandra-G virus, and you must destroy the sensors guarding the brain, and destroy the brain itself, before it is too late...
The oil billonaire has different goverment agency`s and even the US Army on his payrole so he sends them after Golgo 13.
Dawson vows revenge as he hires assassins and the FBI to go after Golgo 13 but can the unstoppable assassin live through all this ordeal?
By the end of the second act (after the film's most neck-hair-raising moment, when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing), it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind, and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.
Normally I don't respond well to movies who lie to the audience, who show a whole story and suddenly, in the end, without warning just say "oh well, after all it was nothing like that at all, the guy was just asleep!".
The Twilight Zone aspect makes itself most obvious beginning with the scene where the convict, Robert Maine (Jake Busey), tries to flee, but discovers that he's still at the motel, after all.
It's a bit like giving a lecture on a joke right after one gives the punch line.
The action here is a lot wilder too, but after a while it starts to get pointless, especially in the ending shoot-out.
SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.
Meanwhile the russian secret police sends a female spy (Louise Rainer) after him.
Danila doesn't kill that American businessman,after having managed to convince him that money doesn't make a man stronger than those who are with truth.
Also keep in mind it was time just after aggression of US against Yugoslavia and time of victories of federal forces in the second Chechen war - everyone still remembered the humiliation of the first war as well as all previous decade .
Brigette Nielsen really hit it off after "Cobra", she was a very intimidating character in the movie.
Basically, the plot is as simple and formulaic as it gets - an unlikely Russian Duke Nukem Danila Bagrov goes after the killers of his war-time friend.
Danila and his friends have returned to civilian life after a tour of duty in Chechnya.
Danila, after an excursion in Saint Petersburg (watch the original film "Brat" for more info), travels to Moscow, where this movie begins.
I just watched Brat 2 after ordering a copy from a Russian video store in New York and I was not disappointed.
An also excellent sequel was made a year or so after this one,aptly titled, Taboo II.
The film plots around the fact of new criminal's in Beverly hills and that after every crime they do they leave an envelope marked with a letter of the alphabet leaving the Beverly Hills Police department with giving them the name of "The Alphabet Crimes" the criminals start there crime by robbing a jewellery shop and leaving an envelope marked with "A" then secondly they shoot Capt.
***SPOILER ALERT*** True story of a shipwreck, due in the film to a WWII German naval mine, that had the ship's-The Crescent Star- second mate Executive Officer Alec Holmes, Tyrone Power, take command after the fatality injured ship's Captain Paul Darrow Laurence Nismith, put him in charge of it's survivors.
That's even after he ends up almost getting killed by one of the lifeboat's passengers who threw a knife in his chest.
Who in real life was made a scapegoat for the maritime deserter and made to spend six months behind bars after being convicted for involuntary manslaughter!
Seven Waves Away is the story of ship's officer played by Tyrone Power who to save the people in his charge after a shipwreck has to cast several of them adrift so the bulk can be saved.
Lloyd Nolan is another officer who sacrifices himself after telling Power what his duty is.
Set approximately two years after the original film, Captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox), Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), and John Taggart (John Ashton) are trying to figure out who is behind the "Alphabet Crimes", a series of mostly high end store robberies (and one shooting) distinctive by their monogrammed envelopes with an alphabetical sequence the assailants leave behind.
This is a conversation that I could have with anyone after viewing this film, and it is conversation that launches this film into my immediate favorites.
In the 1950s (after his contract with Fox was completed) Power made more varied films, that showcased the good actor he had become.
Seven Waves Away was made with impressive conviction and passion by writer-director Richard Sale, who was very active in the 1950s but didn't get another opportunity to direct a feature after this one, despite living 36 more years (what's up with that?).
This was NOT funny, just one stupid gag after another.
Beverly Hills Cop 2 was released in May of 1987, and so came just after things like Top Gun, Police Academy 3, The Color of Money, To Live and Die in L.A. (which was sort of an anti-buddy cop movie with a mean streak that is clearly reflected in Cop 2), Eddie Murphy's own The Golden Child, and the original Lethal Weapon, which was released just a few months earlier and may have been sharing theaters with it.
Everyone is friends now after the events of the first movie.
SO bad is this film, in fact, that 10 years after having seen it it remains like the North Star in my discussions on films with my best mate - i.e., well at least it was better than The Killing Edge  So go on, watch it.
The basic premise was reasonably interesting, being set in Britain and about a normal guy, after some sort of nuclear war.
We sat there staring in disbelief like rabbits staring into an oncoming cars headlights, instead trusting our instincts and turning it off after the first 5 minutes.
Now they are after the alphabet crimes, a group of thieves led by the 7 foot tall Bridget Neilson.
In 1932, a year after Dashiel Hammett had introduced the "hard boiled" detective to novels and films with his Sam Spade in THE MALTESE FALCON (a decade before the Oscar winning remake we all know today!
While Miss Oliver chose not to be pinned down to the continuing Withers role after only three films (THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER - '32, MURDER AT THE BLACKBOARD - '34 and MURDER ON A HONEYMOON - '35), passing on the part to solid comedienne Helen Broderick for the less well written but enjoyable and frequently aired MURDER ON THE BRIDAL PATH - '36 and (with less effect) fine supporting comedienne Zasu Pitts for a final two (THE PLOT THICKENS - '36, and FORTY NAUGHTY GIRLS - '37), all the Withers' films are fun - but the Olivers are the best of the bunch.
"I have never known Yellow Hand to lie or go back on his word," says Cody at one point and it is not without good reason that he shows some remorse after he is forced to kill him.
A spoiled feline who pushes his butler, Meadows, too far and then finds himself with no-one to look after him, Pussy makes the most of his short time in the spotlight (he was usurped by the similarly jittery Claude Cat) by having one of the all time great mental collapses in cartoon history.
Well, after reading a couple of the other reviews here, I feel a little better.
Forced to fend for himself after "Meadows" the butler quits after being abused by the cat, Claude finds himself clueless.
She only got the part after Sylvester Stallone invited Eddie Murphy over for dinner (Sly apparently fell under the table laughing at Eddie's Rocky impression).
Then the end comes and it doesn't match up to the beginning and it is just a real letdown after the brisk pace that it started out with.
The second installment has Axel Foley trying to solve a case involving a criminal who goes by the name "The Alphabet Killer"(played by Jurgen Prochnow) after LT. Bogomil is shot by the Alphabet Killer's hench woman Sally, played by Brigitte Nielson.
And the killers cant have a witness running loose, so they decide to go after her at all cost!
Girl survives the killers attacks, so what does she do after 11 of her best friends are murdered?
Though after the first 20 minutes of the film the pace really slows down.
The ravishing Nathalie (Sarelle - she'll later star alongside Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct) is the sole survivor of one of the maniacs' nightly attacks and now they're after her.
David Dhawan in 1999 after the superhit BIWI NO.1 with Salman repeated Salman and Karisma for the 4th time in his film with this film which released 2 months after the not so successful DHLJ  The movie is the same formula Salman, Karisma and Dutt have done for ages Similar to SAAJAN minus there Sanjay was the lead and he had a great role here he is just the typical no nonsense kinda boss who falls in love Even the music is ordinary here and also the romance  It's like 9 years after SAAJAN you make a diluted version which looks like a rehash of several other films   The film is nothing different and is actually boring to watch Remember DILLAGI, Remember SAAJAN.etc  Direction by DD is bad Music is nothing special  Amongst actors Salman does his usual stuff he did mostly those days though he was more lively and natural compared to today's comedies of his where he is bad Sanju seems bored Karisma does her part very well Dalip Tahil is okay Shakti Kapoor, Himani are routine Sushma Seth is good
this was an awesome movie the chemistry between Karishma Kapoor and Salman Khan is always amazing...hope to see them two again...the story starts with Karishma being the ditsy girl who does everything wrong the two brothers Sanjay and Salman of course start to hate her but after a few mistakes Karishma saves Sanjay's life and slowly the two brothers begin to fall in love with her but Karishma only falls back in love with Salman but keep their relationship a secret things turn when Sanjay's grandma and dad want to marry him with Karishma after hearing this Salman and Karishma break up and Karishma agrees to marry Sanjay but at the night of the engagement Sanjay reveals the one night when Salman was drunk and started to sleep-talks spilled about him and Kairshma and Sanjay says that Salman and Krishma should be together so Karishma and Salman marry instead
WE suppose that we could brand the Superman Cartoons as being formula and even clichÃ©d, but that may not be fair, either; for after all, the Fleischer/Famous Studios' productions were essentially blazing new trails in the field of the animated movie.
In an obvious goof, "5" turns into "13" after he robs the jewels.
It is a wonderful film, with fine acting by the leads Herbert Gronemeyer and Natassia Kinksi, who had been a model and would enjoy further success after this movie.
The film doesn't go into the fact that Clara Schumann did have a career after marriage, however, and a good part of her relationship with her husband revolved around their mutual passion for music.
Some of the jokes I am still figuring out or hearing after seeing it multiple times (I bet she'll invite us in for some tea and strumpets (prostitutes).
A comedy is valued on the laughs it produces and this movie delivers funny scene after funny scene.
I laughed the entire movie and after 4 times of seeing it i keep laughing.
Little do they know that kidnappers and the FBI are after them.
And Lloyd(Carrey), has fallen madly in love with Mary after driving her to the airport.
He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport.
Lloyd falls in love with a young lady named Mary after driving her to the airport.
They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.
"), mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.
Gilbert died shortly thereafter, and his wife, who was from Germany, took the only copy home with her after his death.
Although nothing new in the movie from what had already been shown in thousands of other movies - this movie is not a markedly "oversweetened" work and the true play of a child is something very refreshing to watch after all those "circus clown like" kids from Hollywood in most other movies about "genious" kids.
But to return to the movie , Vitus loves life and his parents , even if is hard for him to express that , he is a wunderkind after all, even when he names his educator at kindergarten Obelix he does not do that out of being rude.
In order to fit in, Vitus fakes a diminution of ability after an attempt to put on wings and jump from the second story of his house results in a concussion.
Eventually he contrives to stage an accident after which he seems to have lost his special talent and his high IQ.
Written by Fredi M. Murer, Peter Luisi, and Lukas B. Suter and directed by Murer, VITUS explores the life of a child genius, a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable.
Got a chance to talk to the director after the screening, such a nice man, too...
I had a negative bias towards this movie because of the description that I had read about it, but soon after it started I was impressed by the camera work and technical quality (including the special effects) of this movie.
And after the couple's unfortunate separation, their chance reunion seemed highly improbable.
Here, it's more than clear from the death of the Asian girl at the start like a martyr to the Asian evil guy who turns out to be an honest friend after all, and a criminal yet with a heart of gold (suits perfectly a 1995 movie !).
Sadly it does not last long as the movie apparently ran out of budget after that scene was shot and everything went down hill from then on.
My friends and I quoted the movie for months after seeing it.
Why do we suffer?Do we need to?Cant we just pray to god and try to be a good person?Takva is looking for the answer of those questions.Muharrem is a very loyalty man to all.He immigrated from Algeria but after his parents death,he started to live alone.He works for the man which his father also used to.He prays a lot and he just tries to be a good people.He is one of the members of a well known sect.He always attends to the ceremony of the sect and one day the leader of the sect asks him if he can work for sect.Muharrem accepts it and starts to do material businesses of the sect.After that his life turns to a tragedy.Because he is not good at accounting and starts to have sin which he hadn't before.He also sees some unwanted dreams which are sexual.he thinks thats the punishment of life to him.The leader doesn't does not understand his situation and muharrem gets lost in the darkness of his soul.All the things are meaningless for him anymore.At the last sequence of the movie,he follows the hero of his dreams under the rain and he faces with the fact.The hero of his nightmare is his leader's daughter..
The director was present at the screening, and he was asked this question in the Q&A after the movie.
Religious brotherhoods surely provide unity among Muslims but most of these brotherhoods seek after only their interests.
Not so many of them really seek after total obedience to God or something.
Different than being nun or monk which requires leaving mainstream society and living in the monastery with prayers, last step of this difficult and lengthy process of purifying one's soul from earthly desires, is to be able to return to the real world after so many years lived in contemplation and yet not being disturbed with its appeal to commit sin.
The opening shows a road in Alyosha's home town, and the last scene shows him walking down the road after seeing his mother.
Antonio recounts the story of his colleague, a professor, who during a lecture looks out the window and starts humming a tune from his native country and his youth after which he suffers a heart attack.
It reflects the situation that a man faces when he comes back to his homeland after living abroad many years.
A lot of what one sees after that as this "thing" moves about the countryside are nothing more than color reversals and nothing great, though.
I kept wishing that he and Sandra Dee could just live happily ever after in their little gothic mansion on the hill...sipping their tea and being stoned together forever.
My favorite shot has a camera looking out from a burial plot after the death of a specific character as Stockwell attempts to perform a ritualistic ceremony.
Filmed shortly after this film, also has a warlock, and a lot of trippy psychedelic visual effects.
It proves that he can pull off a lead role, and it is too bad that even after this movie's release fourteen years ago, he is still just moving through movies as part of a film's additional cast.
Nor is it about having enough film savvy or cleverness to figure out obscure themes and subplots in films, after all, some of us are David LYNCH fans and enjoy decoding and detangling films as though they are mazes.
I mean after all, both Theoretical Mathmaticians and Avant-Garde Poets find what they do equally interesting, neither is more valid than the other.
However, I lost interest in this movie after a while and was just waiting for it to end, and did not really care how it ended.
Ray Liotta plays in Chazz Palminteri with the exception that here, this particular character is more extensively developed ; he is the central one after all.
Set in the twilight hours in a no-names urbane city an ambitious DA named Ford Cole (Liotta, who is also a producer on this dreadful film) who is summoned to the police station when one of his younger protÃ©gÃ©es (and current lover), Nora Timmer (mannequin Blalock) has been involved in a lethal shooting after her claims of being raped by her assailant, Isaac Duperde.
I was still putting the pieces together hours after the movie had ended.
But after that the movie picks up and the twists keep on coming.
This wore out its welcome about 40 minutes into the movie and after the halfway point, about 10 minutes later, I totally didn't care if our girl here was innocent or guilty.
It was that fuel, made from liquefied coal, that had Germany hold off defeat while inflicting millions of allied casualties for some two years after it's supply of oil, mostly from the Romanian Ploesti Oil Field, was obliterated by allied daylight bombings in 1943.
There used to be a formula created during the Third Reichregime that creates synthetic oil and cos that's quite nasty for those who gain their money with oil, everyone must be eliminated who comes in touch with the formula...that's it...and the big problem is that after 10 minutes you know who did it (you probably already know it yourself, not?)
Even so, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER is a beautifully made film with winning performances from its youthful leads: a 19-year old boy who wins a much-coveted 6-day leave from the front after blowing up two enemy tanks single-handedly and the suspicious waif he befriends (and subsequently falls in love with) on his clandestine train journey.
Events beyond his control contrive to make his visit to his farm-laborer mother a pitifully short one after which, the unidentified narrator tells us, he is once again drafted off to the front to his eventual death (which we never actually see); his misadventures during that train journey and visit to his village take up the bulk of the film as he meets a one-legged soldier coming reluctantly back home to his wife, a greedy train guard who is constantly demanding food from the soldier as a bribe against his telling his superiors that they are stowaways, the duplicitous wife of a comrade of his and his bed-ridden, ever optimistic father, etc.
But after all, those elements formed a heterogeneous mix promoting tolerance and gave the show its uniqueness.
The show was very popular(which is why George Lucas and Co. went after it)It is NOTHING like the new show.
THE MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS: The team has to go down to a planet to barter for some food seeds after two of the agro-ships are destroyed by a Cylon attack.
The Ugly:  * the original show was cancelled after one season  * Galactica 1980, the follow-on show in which the battlestar finds earth, was pretty horrible  All in all, I am willing to forgive Battlestar Galactica's flaws and remember with fondness its strengths.
What could have been one of the great sci-fi TV series of all time was done after 24 episodes.
Labelled a shameless Star Wars rip-off, the show exploded on to TV screens in the late 70s, only to peter out in its first season after audiences tired of increasingly lame scripts apparently built around the re-use of expensive effects footage.
Even though the nudes in this movie are tame, they are nudes after all and I don't think a girl that age feels comfortable being nude in a cinema production set with 20-30 people around looking at her, not to mention the things she has to say or to do with men in the movie.
Ultimately this is the powerful message from Pretty Baby that makes it such an exceptional film; but because the Director decided to employ a totally non-judgmental documentary type presentation and to minimise any direct emotional appeal, most viewers probably only recognize it when scenes returned to their memory during the hours and days after they left the cinema, and I do not believe its rare combination of beautiful imagery and haunting power has so far been brought out adequately by the comments on this database.
The Saints just won the SuperBowl after 43 years of failure.
We can't escape the fact that our first playoff game was in 1990, 23 years after the team manifested.
So, really, I should probably be disgusted with Carradine, but why do I feel so sad when Sarandon shows up at the end, after he and Shields have been married, to take her away?
It's a very smart way to begin to the picture, but little else occupied my mind after it got going.
Pretty Baby, by Louis Malle raises a myriad of questions when viewed almost thirty years after its creation.
However, despite a notable cast (Keith Carradine, Susan Sarandon, Barbara Steele and Gerrit Graham), the film only really comes to life - after a rather wandering first half - when the Lolita-esquire elements of the Brooke Shields character take center stage.
The nudity, by the way, does not take place during any love scenes, though at one point there is nudity after one.
There's a heap load of nudity overall, including a hot bit with Sarandon and Carradine, but really Malle is after the whole insulated world of this whorehouse, and how being true to oneself ends up clashing with the un-yielding mind-set of those coming in with a wad of bills and a set goal.
This trend continues to the end, which is like a cruel mirror image of the typical happily ever after Hollywood ending.
Although ragtime and jazz are touched on in the movie, Storyville was directly responsible for the likes of young Louis Armstrong--who ran coal from House to House--picking up the street melodies he heard and playing them on a cornet furnished to him--providentially--by the local orphanage, and for Ferdinand "Jelly Roll" Morton, pianist...and pimp...who played in only the best houses and claimed he invented the term "jazz" as applied to music after witnessing first hand all that "jassing-around" he saw in the bordellos of Storyville!
Remi (played magnificently by Blier favorite Patrick Dewaere), not unlike Humbert in Nabokov's "Lolita" tells us of his tragic plight; after his wife dies tragically, he is left with his stepdaughter, Marion (Ariel Besse).
The atmosphere created by this movie is quite unique, rarely before or after achieved on the film.
A supposed war victim and gone for years after his marriage to her, Wells - despite now having a beard and aging a bit - would still be recognizable (at the least, audibly) to his former wife.
Patrick Dewaere is great as well and it was quite a shock to discover he committed suicide shortly after the release of this film.
Entertainment is, after all, what we're after here, isn't it?
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was a classic sitcom about single 30s something Mary Richards,moving to new town Minneapolis,when her relationship breaks down,she gets an apartment through old friend Phyllis(Chloris Leachman)at the start,causing friction with Rhoda(Valerie Harper)from upstairs,the friendship of Mary and Rhoda becoming one of the backbones of the series until Valerie Harper spun off to her own spin off success "Rhoda",after four seasons.
Betty White was a welcome addition in season 4 as man hungry "Happy Homemaker",Sue-Ann Nivens,the episode when she has an affair with Phyllis'unseen husband Lars in "The Lars Affair" was a classic,Sue Anne helping fill the void as "the blond darling" when Phyllis left after season 5 for her own spin off series "Phyllis".
The show ended after a seven year run with the news gang all being sacked apart from Ted,ironically the one worst at the job,Rhoda and Phyllis returned to support Mary and Lou Grant was launched as a dramatic spin off and was another big success.
Then, after it was cancelled, a local TV station started showing two shows a night, back to back, and I started watching.
Mary, Valerie Harper and Chloris Leachman top them all....week after week, consistently superlative (credit to the writing staff as well as the actors who embody the scrips.)
He could also identify the coin's value from the sound after they used to cover his eyes and toss the coin for him to guess.
Some of the best moments in this series happens after Nick enters the Keatons lives and his relationship with them.
The mystery holds for a while, then this viewer became a bit tired of scene after scene of talky explanations, and not much cinematic action.
Investigating Cravat leads him to murder, stolen money, and some unsavory characters who are after him.
The Ambiguous Dame is split into her two constituents -- the louche broad who slings around French clichÃ©s and the honest, brave Nancy Guild who falls in love with Hodiak (and vice versa) two minutes after they meet.
And who doesn't want to believe in happily ever after, especially when you become so emotionally invested?
In some ways it feels like something Terry Gilliam might have made in his absolute nadir after downing bottles of fluoxetine.
August is a musical genius who would easily put Mozart to shame: he becomes a skilled guitarist within the first hour of exposure to a guitar; he starts composing and notating a symphony immediately after being shown the basic scales; he can play an organ, complete with pedals and stops, on a first try; he is skilled enough to conduct the New York Philharmonic; in the final scene we come to understand he has a certain level of extrasensory perception.
I really feel a bit ill after watching this drivel.
He just starts composing after a little girl gives him a one minute piano lesson??
This is the equivalent of speaking perfect French after someone said bonjour to you for the first time.
One of them takes the woman with him and after a while she kills him for what he had done to her.
The girl begins training to be able to get revenge and after 20 years she sets out to find and kill the 3 remaining people that wronged her mother.
So they find the first of the three and after Lady Snowblood saves his life she kills him herself.
So it seems revenge has been exacted but soon after we find out that the second villain who was supposed to be dead is actually alive.
Here's hoping studio support for the film will see screens increase after opening to take advantage of what should be great word of mouth.
A day after seeing it, I find that specific shots of their faces still glow in mind like pieces of a mosaic.
Also, canned laughter should have been abolished after the demise of the '80s sitcom.
The film details the questions, mysteries and miseries of Welles and Colbert as they encounter each other again after two decades.
Izzie opens up more than she thought possible at first==Parker's knock at the gym door at the end, and Izzie's opening that door is the closest the movie comes to a conventional romance, but is just as much a metaphor for moving on after finally accepting what she's lost.
The beginning of the film, where the young man walks away from the Anthony character's bed exists purely to show the character would be petulant because guys walk out on him after sleeping with him -- so when the Henry Kray character does it, of course, he needs revenge by messing up the Henry's entire life.
Only in the morning, after Henry has left him alone on the floor, does Anthony find out Henry's full identity.
Instead of a man-child, Yuki was born, but her mother died shortly after giving birth(..the birth was an extremely difficult one).
There's a really nifty sequence where one of her targets commits suicide with Yuki slicing the dead body in half with blood showering shortly after.
Sex scene after *explicit* sex scene makes it more like porn that art.
Only after someone reminded me that it was being re-shown on WYES in New Orleans UNCUT I eagerly tuned in!
Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood (1943)' opens in the usual fashion, but, after that, any resemblance to any known fairy-tale character, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.
He tries to escape but the lovelorn granny chases after him, and every door Wolf opens Grandma is there waiting with puckered lips.
But there's one question unanswered, and that's: Did this formula begun with this cartoon and continuing (with Avery, at least) to the end of the 1940's play a role, however indirectly, in the future development of Benny Hill's show after, say, 1980?
Got to be the funniest and fastest Avery cartoon there is, the best "modern" slant on the red riding hood story, with the wolf lusting after Red Hot at every opportunity.
One was the walks and talks of Lizzie and Mr Darcy after their engagement and second, the reaction of Mrs Bennet after Elizabeth told her about it.
I originally saw this film shortly after the release of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and while I was impressed by the amount of bloodshed, I didn't hold the film in particularly high regard.
The home interiors were also more elaborate and fantastic and more in keeping with my imagination of what I thought they looked like after reading Jane Austens book.
I knew that after I had seen this, I had to own it!!!!!
Colin Firth gained me as a loyal fan after seeing him in this movie as well as Jennifer Ehle.
I have yet to meet anyone of either sex who hasn't become a fan of the movie after watching it, and even my cousin Guy, who's a bit of a modern-day Neanderthal, throws out a Lady Catherine quote now and again.
I also realized after watching the series over and over again the little things in between the characters stand out more and more clearly.
At 300 minutes, it might seem a bit steep to sit through -- after all, the novel is barely under 400 pages and its plot is concise enough to garner a shorter transition from book form to images.
But fate has her meet him again when Jane falls ill after she gets called to spend an evening with Bingley and his sisters.
While Darcy seems to be taking a repressed liking to Elizabeth, she is unaware of it, and grows increasingly hostile towards him, particularly after learning from George Wickham that he behaved quite badly towards him.
I began to re-read the novel after finishing the miniseries due to difficulty of understanding some dialogues.
But the ending does sneak up on one rather fast and the pieces of the puzzle are too simple, but this is a 20's film parody, after all.
I am not ashamed to admit I got interested in it after it being linked to Kill Bill, but then again, I hadn't heard of it until a while after the Kill Bill movies came out, and I thought it sounded like something I'd be interested in, my kind of movie.
Yesterday, after hearing of Bobby Short's death, I wandered into a local video/music store and perused the DVDs and there it was, up front and I purchased it.
Also, if you get the DVD, be sure and check out the reference section and scene set-up after the film is over.
There is little known part 2 of this movie released in 1974 which picks up after this one with Kaji reprising her role as Yuki.
For a long time, I wanted a stronger proponent from the left, but after considering all of them, the left's best attack is attacking the person rather than the thought, and there is no one capable of entering the realm of ideas from the left, and presenting a cogent argument of fact.
This isn't a royal PBS debate show, this is political entertainment, which gets to me after a bit.
It always makes me wonder how actors end up working for such crummy fare after working with, not just working, but being one of the main stars of a Steven Spielberg picture!
EAT in blur, first EATING chomp spurts blood, run after hapless victims to EAT--There's no rudimentary problem solving, no cleverly out-thinking prey!
They must use the worse CGI, as their monsters are looking worse movie after movie.
Gators are not on the move right after a meal and since gators are from the dingo age.
I'd say whatever dinosaur they mixed in would be relaxed right after killing and eating as well.
The highlight is a bikini-clad model spending most of the first hour running away after her fellow model got chomped up by Supergator.
Those who haven't seen 'Kill Bill' should see this first, and then 'Kill Bill' after.
For an animal that size, after chomping down four or five people, it would hole up in its lair to digest for quite a while.
There's one Jessica Simpson look alike who is casually jogging around (looking like she's doing an episode of Bay Watch) through the forest after seeing two gruesome deaths.
But (after another lousy half hour) I turned it off.
the cops continually foul up one job after another with their trigger-happy attitudes, their racist and sexist unprofessionalism, and their reckless disregard for true law and order.
Christopher Knopf's screenplay offers no glimmer of salvation for the gallery of slimeball characters, so that as the film comes to an end after its interminable two hours the viewer is left with a nasty taste in the mouth and an empty feeling in the stomach.
one day after awakening form a nightmare in a mall she is confronted by a detective who asks her odd questions about her childhood and after losing him she finds that that strange things begin to manifest such as the mall turning into a rusty ugly place filled with demons and what not and after escaping she bumps into a crazy lady that claims that she has being looking for her for a long time.
This one has a good story of a girl who while at the mall starts to see weird things, then of course monsters show up and our gal named Heather must navigate the demented mall, which gets even more demented after a ride in an elevator.
the only flaw was indeed the sound, but ive seen a lot worse  i indeed watched this movie twice in the same day after buying it, it was very enthralling.
I laughed so hard at everything after watching this my face hurt.
Also the reason the 2 firemen are supposed to dig up what they thought was a body-as there were a number of unaccounted for disappearances-again not needed as part of the plot-was really where it began after all the faffing about with another sub plot connected with the fireman's wife who objects to his drinking-yet it never showed him sloppy drunk he'd just had a few drinks.So what everybody drinks.
I think the cast knew what they had gotten themselves into and stopped trying after the read through.
You may just feel like Robin Hood after viewing this.
The 'Hammer House Of Mystery And Suspense', which followed some years after, suffered from demands for less horror and a longer running time from U.S. TV apparently!
Curiously enough, this is only Hammer's second foray into Wolf Man lore after THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (1961); intriguingly, it's mixed here with a VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960)-like brood of evil children Â while the sinister procreation plot is a clear nod to ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968).
The bewildered hero is played by Christopher Cazenove, his business partner by Hammer veteran Robert Urquhart, while Diana Dors is the deceptively genial housekeeper of the eerie mansion Â who, apart from looking after the children by day, has the task of initiating the werewolf's female victims (the latest being Cazenove's wife) into their new 'role'.
Lets see the most notable of all rip offs is Oren Ishii who is no doubt molded after Lady Snowblood herself.
Watch this and I promise you will be dumber after having seen it.
But the story is breathtaking, you will understand very well why the Italian history after World War 2 is so fascinating, with aspect of the actions of the Red Brigade (Brigate Rosse), the fight for human justice (in asylums and hospitals for the mentally diseased).
It's 1AM on a weekday, and more than a year after watching this movie for the third time, I'm still haunted by it, like an overwhelming memory that won't fade.
Not like Hollywood film, this scene doesn't come with any sentimental big music or emotional speech (actually its speechless), its very subtle, still so strongly moving... Giulia met Sarah at church after she released, and Sarah asked Giulia to play church's organ...   (Spoiler end)  Actually, if you don't want show your friends/family your crying/sobbing face, you should avoid this film all the cost, its that moving, so powerful.
Then there are innumerable other memorable portraits, all introducing a social theme (such as Nicola's factory-worker friend, made redundant during Fiat's crisis at the start of the 80s, or Matteo's colleague, the working-class policeman, who ends up on a wheelchair after a beating at a political demonstration in the 70s).
This documentary is after all less about the genocide and more about Dallaire and his confrontation with what he calls "evil".
High-level military commanders joined forces with the "Hutu power" extremists and quickly killed all the moderate leaders in the first few hours after the assassination, so there was no one left to oppose them as they set in motion a carefully planned genocide.
Finally after 3 months of unrestrained killing, the rebel troops were able to move in and halt the genocide.
At the beginning of the movie the Jew husband (the always excellent William Fichtner) doesn't believe in miracles, but after his son gets better from a "miracle man", he changes his mind and begs that same miracle man --who has also slept with his wife in the meantime-- to come and help his son.
Danes and Crudup played against each other beautifully on the screen and in real life since they teamed up in real life after this film was finished.
)...is it any wonder that they ended up together in real life after rehearsals and several takes of that?!
But there are also points which are more general - like s*x in pre-Victorian London (high) society, which was more relaxed than during and long after, and I thought that was represented very faithfully in the movie.
This is, after all, a review.
As a silent made after the talkies swept entertainment, this film features a recorded soundtrack with sung music and sound effects.
It's amazing to me how natural and contemporary this film seems after 72 years.
It just about breaks one's heart to realize that Renee Adoree died at the age of 35, about 3 years after the release of this film.
I loved the film so I bought the DVD from Hallmark...minus commercials...what a treat...the film doesn't play like usual TV movies...with a 'hanger' right before the commercial to hold your interest and get one to return to the film after the commercial.
I was shocked at first how Alexei just disappeared at the hospital after discovering his powers were gone.
He was human after all, facing and giving in to human nature temptations of lust and desire for romance and relationship.
That is what was so thought-provoking after the movie ended.
I was appalled after watching this.
You'll marvel at witless dialogue that could have been written by a pre-schooler and basically laugh your socks off at scene after scene of (endearing) stupidity.
But after killing it, he does what every hunter would do, drinks it's blood, but as he so wisely puts it, "drinking the blood of your enemy makes you stronger".
The approach is not Val Lewton, but a skewered distortion of reality that burrows deep into the psyche and festers there long after the credits have rolled and the movie has officially ended.
I love how it shows fashions, autos and scenery of the real L.A. right after the war.
I got kind of bored by the speeches myself, but after THREE EXTREMES was over, I realized that I liked Cut the best out of the three.
Sadly most American horror films are commercial throw aways that nobody will give a crap about after a few months have passed by.
Overall, don't expect to eat comfortably after viewing this film.
Mrs. Li is very pleased with the results at first, but then gets sick after finishing a 'meal' made of the leftovers of an incest baby.
People are crazy, evil bastards that only look after themselves and that's the ONLY message to communicate here.
I had to watch several parts of each movie over again after I finished the first viewing, because it's pretty hard to figure out what the hell's going on with one viewing.
A clumsily sincere attempt at a perversely humorous, darkly tongue-in-cheek backroads psycho picture parody, this film's extremely forced, spiritless, grinding-its-wheels-in-the-mud slack execution completely ruins its chances at being a reasonably on-target and effective send-up: Richard Casey's wan, idle direction, mostly flat acting from a generally insipid cast (only legendary gonzo rock critic Richard Meltzer manages to deliver a lively, up to par performance as a cranky, ill-fated drunken motorist), lethargic pacing, weak stabs at grotesque warped humor (e.g., one victim steps on a rake right after having his throat cut), and a plodding, disjointed narrative all prevent this potentially fun flick from ever kicking into high gear.
Basically 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) foils a liquor store robbery after driving a car the robbers wanted through the front and killing them, causing thousands in damage.
Harry after saving the Mayor's life,by blasting his kidnapper Bobby Maxwell, walked away from the grateful Mayor in disgust; he spends his remaining moments in the movie standing alone and grieving over his dead partners, Inpt.
This time he goes after radical Vietnam Veterans who want to take over.
The sequence, right after Harry has dinner with Carol McCoy and her kids, has Harry entering the back of the store, where Early Smith is posing as a cashier.
After the shootout, where Will Hutchins' character bungles part of it because he hesitates, he actually has a line where he shakes his head after looking at the carnage Harry has wrought and says, "I've never shot a man", whereby Harry looks at him in disgust and says something to the effect of "Help out with the customers, will ya?"
Luckily this transfer doesn't last too long, after the arms robbery he is back in Homicide with a new partner, the recently promoted Inspector Kate Moore, played by Tyne Daly before she found fame in "Cagney and Lacey".
and Harry after stopping a robbery is assigned to Personel.
In this third chapter from the Book of Dirty Harry Callahan, there's plenty of action as Harry breaks in a new partner and goes after a ruthless bunch, some self-proclaimed revolutionaries who are nothing more than common criminals, in `The Enforcer,' directed by James Fargo, and starring Clint Eastwood and Tyne Daly.
In the early 1960's this one was remade with Doris Day & James Garner (after Marilyn Monroe died tragically during her filming of it).
(pause) Don't let ME get after you."
Lawyer husband has wife declared dead after 7 years lost at sea and remarrys the day she returns after her rescue.
Here Dunne plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island.
Apparently, after so many years he is ready to have her declared legally dead and proceed with his new fiancÃ©e.
I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.
Bigamy is after all a crime.
Grant and Dunne are re-teamed here after their massive success with the quite marvellous The Awful Truth in 1937, and tho the role of Ellen was touted to Jean Arthur, it was Dunne who grasped the role and created sizzling comedy once again with the fabulous Grant.
It involves Cary Grant finding his wife, whom he thought was dead after a shipwreck, seven years after the incident alive and well.
What would you do if you declared your wife legally dead after seven years in order to marry another woman, and she came back?
Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Irene Dunne) has just returned after seven years to find that her husband Nick has married Bianca Bates (Gail Patrick).
He and Irene Dunne are superb in this film about a wife who "comes back from the dead" after seven years.
Ellen, lost at sea and presumed dead, returns after 7 years to find her husband Nick has remarried.
As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity.
Interestingly enough, Kanin took over the directing duties from Leo McCarey (an Oscar winner as Best Director for 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH, which also starred Grant and Dunne) after McCarey was injured in an automobile accident (McCarey also co-wrote the screenplay with Kanin and Sam and Bella Spewack).
After his shipwrecked wife is declared dead and he takes on a new wife, Grant's first wife resurfaces, rescued after seven years on an island.
This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island.
So he goes to court with Gail Patrick who he now intends to marry after getting the judge to declare Irene Dunne legally dead.
The Doris Day/James Garner remake "Move Over, Darling" is memorable in its own right and viewed right after this would make for a good video double-bill.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
In their heyday, Bud Abbot and Lou Costello were so often sought after for personal appearances by adoring fans, studio executives and a host of worthwhile organizations.
This was actually based on a old play written by two unknown playwrights Fred Speilman and Janice Toore, however they closed the play after one night.
If Hollywood violence and sexy performances are what you're after then possibly this film isn't for you.
The final straw comes at almost exactly the same time, when he is made redundant only days after his dad has died.
But if the violence is primarily what people talk about after seeing the film then that would be a real crime because the film is packed full of wonderful moments of real human emotion.
To leave the audience with such a lasting impression of your main character that they remember your villain after the movie ends is a great feat... to make such an impression that the audience breathes life into that character every Halloween and costumed convention is amazing.
It was constant killing after killing.
There is, like, no sound, the wife reacts to everything, like, five or ten seconds after it happens, and there's this really gross scene where she falls on this glass table and her whole wrist is shredded up and off.
Now, in defense of the film, it set out its goal of being deliciously trashy (at least I hope that was the goal), but I found that after about 20 minutes, the poor acting stopped being funny, the porno-grade directing was beyond laughable, and the movie was not in the slightest bit interesting.
Shortly after picking up Baby, their car blows a tire.
It just happens, one after another.
You'll probably be so bored after awhile you'll be begging for the psycho hick family to start the killing already.
It is about four friends who are driving cross country and are returning home after a long trip.
I felt dirty after watching this movie.
Initially I had little or no interest in this film but after hearing good things about it from a lot of sources I decided to check it out.
When I first watched TCM I really was unnerved by it, and I found myself thinking about for weeks after.
But it was October, 1954, just one year after Ian Fleming's first novel was published.
To see the man, okay, played by Norwegian-American Barry Nelson, offer a casual quip after a brush with death, tuxedo unruffled, will stir the heart of any true Bondophile.
I went home and really appreciated the time I could spend with my young son after watching this.
But how do you live after something like this?
Well, some biker dudes go after the daughter of the owner of this "old west" Ghost Town, called Hellgate, and they accidentally kill her.
The references to the shooting/execution by the police of the innocent Brazilian in the subway after 7/7 are clear and intentional.
It's a pity it has'nt gained the popularity it deserves now being released to TV only a year after production.
The one fault i'd say is that the passage of time is not particularly well expressed particularly right at the end of the film when what seems to be a present day Ewan is wearing the exact same outfit as in the next scene which must be set sometime after.
Even for a semi-estranged husband this sounds a little harsh - she did worry about him, after all, so she must have felt something.
Her son has a stuffed bunny animal that he always carries, and after he's dead of course this becomes the representation of her son.
She predictably bonds with the son out of nowhere (I literally leaned over and said "She's going to buy him a cricket bat" to a friend after the boy mentioned his dad was supposed to buy him one for his birthday...and lo and behold, she did) and then suddenly there's a standoff at the train station where she gets apparently shot in the head and has not a scratch to show for it.
Instead of getting caught in a love triangle between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant she gets caught in a love triangle with two equally wet englishmen, uncomfortably played by Ewan MacGregor and Matthew Macfadayen, and all this, after her poor husband and son have been blown to bits in an unconvincing attack on Arsenal football stadium whilst she was shagging the local taloid newspaper reporter!
An employee for Lucus Carlyle finds a glowing crystal with strange and dangerous power..it can send beams which explode buildings and turn animal life into mutated forms which implode after enlarging.
Made right after the splendidly schlocky "Galaxy of Terror," this choice cheesy chunk of early 80's sci-fi/horror drive-in exploitation junk rates as yet another lovably low-rent two-cent Roger Corman gem.
Late, great eccentric character actor Fox Harris (the brain-fried lobotomized scientist who drives the car with the radioactive alien corpses in the trunk in the fantastic sci-fi cult black comedy blast "Repo Man") has a scenery-gulping hammy field day as a twitchy flipped-out physician whose cancerous liver is fed to the monster at the picture's incredible conclusion (the grody thing literally pukes its guts out after eating the lethal organ!).
Better still, this fine freaky flick certainly doesn't skimp on the copious gratuitous nudity: adorable baby doll beauty Dawn Dunlap bares her whole bod while bagging a few rays in a sauna, stupendously slinky British blonde bombshell June Chadwick (Lydie on the short-lived "V" TV series) happily hops in the sack with Colby a mere five or six hours after making his acquaintance, and both Dawn and June even take a shower together.
Soon after a guy named Jonas (Victor Melleney) is attacked by a bat in a mine which he kills, he then notices a strange blue crystal which shoots a blue laser-beam at the bat which returns to life.
So,why after 40 years is this landmark series "Julia" not even mention or not even rated as one of television's greats?
This film could be a real gem if it would not be a fake; it is largely sustained by the great performance of the 2 actors, also there is a pleasant and fortunate choice of characters around them, the screen play has wonderful passages but ... the whole is incredibly wasted under a ton of moralistic non sense mainly anti sexual: the lovers go around spending their passion in thousands of kisses but never are able to complete it with what you are expecting they must do; instead here is the punishment; after the last stupid, unbelievable and meaningless misunderstanding the girl run away and is knocked down by a car; he visits her at the hospital all seems OK but when he comes again the doctor says she is dead; what do you expect him to do, perhaps bursting into tears?
But after 50 years and a couple of infinitely more superior movies I feel this topic has had its day and should, like the negative of this movie, be buried deep, deep underground.
(There May be Spoilers)Freed after doing a six-month stretch in a federal prison for contempt of congress Hollywood writer/directer Herbert Biberman, Jeff Goldblum, as well as his actress wife Gale Sondergaard, Greta Scacchi,future in the world of the movies and theater in America is all but over.
Dusting themselves off, the lads listen to grocer Guy Kibbee (as Silas Hobbs) rail against "British aristocracy," after learning of their arrival in town.
Bartholomew was riding high after supporting Greta Garbo in Selznick's masterfully realized "Anna Karenina" (1935).
A preview of what a lot of Brits & Americans did in WWII a few years after this film!!!)
Paula and Sergio are married and own the small house in the mountains where they only travel to at weekends and Lillian is Paula's sister,who just happens to be having an affair with Sergio.Sergio is going hunting,Paula is going shopping and Lillian is staying home to sunbathe naked.Lillian puts on the radio and we hear a news report a thief and murderer who has escaped from jail and is on the loose after murdering farmer with a pitchfork.The criminal named Joe Brezy has stolen the car and is hiding near the house.He has buried 300million lira in the house(from the previous robbery).Joe takes the three of them hostage whilst he digs for his loot.When he finally gets his loot he plays Paula,Lillian and Sergio against each other telling Paula about the affair her husband and sister are having.
As a teacher, it really made me think about what the purpose of beauty contests are in this day and age... and after having seen the film and the girls involved, i believe that is nothing more than just a beauty pageant.
It's pretty bland & forgettable stuff while the gore is also disappointing, someone is impaled, someone has a garden trowel stuck in them in a direct rip-off, sorry homage to Night of the Living Dead (1968), a few after the fact slit throats, & in the films best moment a guy is hit by a speeding truck & he just explodes everywhere, excellent.
Even this was more graphic in its depiction of the continuous violence that it becomes a real unsettling mix, especially on how we see these two men act with joy and lightness after and sometimes during their actions.
And there's a motorcycle gang in the 'fifties who kidnap a girl from Hellgate, take her up there, and end up killing her after her dad(?
Until, after the trial of Burke and Hare, he stoops down in a city square when a tattered little girl asks him for alms.
The Flesh and the Fiends is nothing-less than a fairly truthful accounting of the original 'bodysnatchers,' Burke and Hare who resorted-to-murder after running-out of 'fresh' corpses for a Dr. Thomas Knox, of Edinburgh, Scotland.
There are many moments to cherish in this rough jewel: Field standing outside the school where the little boy she gave up for adoption attends, running into his angry mother; Field writing a letter to the same child, telling him how sorry she is; Jones and Field getting off their bus after a fight and going their separate ways, each trudging down two dusty streets.
; But after the opening 15 minutes of the film and breakfast seen.
Kathleen Turner plays a sweet and perfect suburbia mom who suddenly decides to kill the people who don't do the right thing (just like bother her kids, not rewinding the rented videos or wearing white shoes after Labour Day).
This is one crazy house wife that you don't want to be a rude kid or adult because she will find you and hunt you down till you are dead.Man this was the best movie that I have seen that is based on true events that is horror that I know and love.This b****Y mom was finally on the louse and insane to kill people that are rude,dressed badly,and anyone that messes with her family,any jokes.And when she went to court was really when she became wild and made each eyewitness into trouble.She is using facts about them and her body to make them crack.And very funny when the judge was flirting with Suzanne Somers when she came in the Court.And lastly,great ending when she kill a woman for wearing   white after Labor Day.And that jury woman taught she was innocent right from the beginning,can you believe this damn woman.And she kills when she was just set free and kill,very stupid thing to do and stupider was the jury setting her free.Now she will continue her work,make a part two Mr.
She soon becomes a murderer after Chip's teacher criticizes about the way she raises Chip.
Now the cops are prepared to arrest her and after that happens, she will appear in court and manipulate people into declaring her innocent.
Her first victim is Paul Stubbins, a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting, and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend, a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes (the film predates the coming of DVD), failing to recycle their garbage, and wearing white shoes after Labor day.
Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before.
Some parts of the movie might make you turn your away in disgust and after the dentist scene I will see to it that I never have to go to the dentists again However some parts of the film are absolutely hysterical and during the masturbation scene I had to stop myself having a serious accident i was laughing so hard.
When this suburban mom goes off - she goes off.... From minor annoyances (white shoes after labor day!)
It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.
You never know maybe some of the movie has some truths in it... Maybe you'll get it after you see it a few more times..  Syncerely, 18th angel Antichrist
That's why Rachael was the only reason I wanted to see "The Eighteenth Angel" (well, that and the fact it was shown just after The X-Files).
Even Norah may have been involved in the "plot", or may have ended up involved after meeting with Father Simeon (Maximilian Schell).
The movie deals with the hard situation that popular lawyer Abe Ringle is going through after losing several cases in a row and not being able to recover from that situation.
Ringel and his super hot assistant, and other team member figure out and win the case although they know that Mr. Campbell is in fact a disturbed person that gets excited after insulting and raping women.
Campbell manages to get her on a hotel room and tries to rape her after telling horrible things about her dead mother.
One of those lucky ladies Jennifer Dawling, Jessica Tuck, gets that wish and after having a quite and delightful dinner with Joe goes up to his hotel room to spend the night with him.
Joe Campbell figures he is above the law and can do whatever he thinks he can get away with, even after a tragedy occurs, for which he is not even blamed.
The Movie is however much different from the book but this was for me a very enjoyable find, especially after a near 30 year search.
Ann's brother, George, (Howard Duff) came back home too, but he was angry after visiting his father, Herb, in prison.
The story takes place after World War II, which by all accounts, was a just war, as America had been attacked.
Viewed today, 74 years after the film came out Sanders Of The River is a paradoxical film with the good and bad of British colonial attitudes of the 19th century.
Serb soldiers have fled Kosovo one week after KFOR troops marched.
I think that fortunately spanish cinema is evolving from the obscure era of the "destape" (the first movies that were made after the death of Franco were known like this because most of them were light porn films) and from Almodovar's large shadow.
Vidal, the daring soldier, is instrumental for getting them back in track after the Lt. Alonso suffers what appears to be a shock.
It's only Vidal who at the start appears to be the one that wants to be sent home in order to avoid any confrontation; this young man proves to be a natural born leader who finds a way to get back after experiencing some tense moments in that forbidden zone.
This show has no integrity, either, as its values are corrupt and poor, and after watching an episode, what has one actually learned from this, or what purpose has this show made?
I used to watch this show when I was 12, but after a few years, I suddenly gave up on it.
& Stiggs at a question and answer session after the play.
I watched the 1985 film Krush Groove yesterday, I must say I really enjoyed it.Now here's the thing about this movie.If you do not like rap, you will probably not enjoy this movie.If you hate very old-school rap(any rap song that came out before 1988), you probably will not like this movie.However, if you like the genre of music, you will probably enjoy this film.I really like this kind of rap.I also like old gangsta rap from the late 80's to late 90's.I also like other types of music such as rock, metal etc.Therefore, I liked Krush Groove.The plot of the film involves a man who is trying to start his own record label, his brother's a member of rap group Run DMC.He starts it after a loan, and it does work, however there is another big record producer who is stealing his artists.He also owes money to the man who originally gave it to him.Meanwhile, a rap group called "The Disco Three"(The Fat Boys), are trying to make it big in the rap game.The movie features music from artists such as Shiela E, Run DMC, The Beastie Boys, Fat Boys, LL Cool J etc.If you like old-school hip hop/rap, then Krush Groove is the movie you should see.
I would eventually turn into a life-long Hip-Hop producer after that.
No girls and so boring and like them I'm passing the final year in my high school and after that I'm going to university.
It is my first comment on this page and this movie is actually the reason why i am registered...You will for sure question your life after u watch it.
So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide.
He has the talents and the optimistic point of view but soon after he makes his debut in a play, his father punishes him the hardest way a father can do.
I've seen this movie a lot of times,in fact,I bought it after I saw it the first time and I'm still always looking for time to watch it again.
Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies.
Unfortunately, several plot points introduced prior to the suicide are simply dropped after it, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the budding romance of one of the students and a town girl, as well as a few other things that just get left rather than addressed.
At least for half an hour after I watched this movie, I managed to drive mans favorite clichÃ© "Life Sucks!"
At the end of the film, after Zorro's greatest triumph, his identity is revealed.
He's just annoying and we don't even get the satisfaction of watching him die in an amusingly ironic manner after being inflicted with his presence for an hour plus.
First and coolest vignette - A diminutive albino Bigfoot creature stalks a teenage couple who find themselves stuck in the middle of nowhere after their car runs out of gas.
"Screams of a Winter Night" was made with student actors attending Northwestern State University in Natchitoches,Louisiana,a college that has since been abandoned,the neglected campus becoming a popular teen hang-out.It consists three genuinely spooky stories told by a young campers in an old cabin.The first one is about 'The Moss Point Man',a Yeti-like creature encountered by a local girl and her boyfriend deep in the woods.The second one is about a mute psychopath in an allegedly haunted hotel with the climax somewhat reminding me "The Blair Witch Project".The third story is about a sexually repressed girl turning psycho after an attempted rape.The strange,howling wind is becoming stronger and stronger...Creepy low-budget gem from late 70's without gore and nudity.It has some great scares and surprising twists.8 out of 10.
I recently attained a copy of this and watched it again after all these years, and I still think it is quite effective.
Good enough for me to look it up after all these years.
The Plot: A group of college students about to graduate travel to a woodland cabin for some R and R. Once there, many of the girls start to feel uncomfortable (something which I'll come back to) after which the guys start telling "true" horror stories they heard from someone who heard them from someone else.
Bogart strong as a stubborn DA going after Murder Inc., not knowing such a thing exists, offers credibility.
One remembers him long after the movie is over.
Finally after lots of hard work, Assistant D.A.
-he had, after all, been playing them since Marked Woman, Knock On Any Door, etc - but even the multi flashbacks can't really spoil this good old-fashioned 'thick ear' entry.
The ending is a bit anti-climatic only because it wraps up so quickly after all the tension and flashbacks have reached the anticipated moment of the "pay-off", so I rate it a 9 out of 10.
The chief witness is Ted DeCorsia who after an attempt on his life, falls to his death while trying to escape from a window.
That became pretty clear after a few minutes into the movie.
Sex is implied after a sunset hug.
But the authorities at home are still after him.
Woman after woman appeared in the film naked or semi-naked and drenched in blood while being brutalized.
While this COULD have been a very good film (after all, it's a very important part of British history that's been mostly ignored in movies), it isn't.
The long opening adequately introduces the character of Judge Jeffries, but the actual plot only unfolds after this.
and everyone lives happily ever after.
I watched this in my American History 2 class and I fell asleep after the first ten minutes.
Most of the rest of the story consists of Barton teaching the women a lesson after catching them with some gasoline taken from a government fuel shed.
People crash on an island after their planes explodes into two pieces.
And, after all, what is sci-fi fantasy really all about?
This one was another in long line of those movies I should stop after the first five minutes.
So after reading all this and you still want to watch it go ahead but prepare to be disappointed to the max.
I was quite surprised that this movie was released in 2005; I would have assumed that it had been produced in the early 1990s and shown on the SCI-FI channel after midnight for the last 15 years.
The stewardess was very disappointed when it was pointed out that it wasn't their plane, after all.
It turned out that the movie was dirty, and stopped playing after about 45 minutes.
This movie is supposed to take place 8 years after Jaws .
Their quest is also interesting, as they keep finding more and more planes that crashed on the island, which sets up a nice mystery, and then they're captured by the tribe of natives and we're pretty much in the B-movie fun zone after that.
It holds up pretty good after all those years.
Mr. Holden was much in demand after winning the Oscar for Stalag 17.
The following day, Roper and a small patrol light out after the Confederates.
Eventually they do make good their escape and the remainder of the picture has Roper and his troop in hot pursuit after them through dangerous Mescalero Apache territory culminating in a a very exciting sequence towards the end of the picture - when after a terrific chase by the Apaches - captor and captured are pinned down by the indians in a desert gully.
The film was not even mentioned in Chaplin's autobiography, nor was it screened in the years after its release, until, in 1970, Chaplin rereleased it with a new score that he composed.
PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies.
How can you watch the closing scenes of this film and, even after all of the laughter, NOT sense a bit of melancholia welling up in your heart?
Should have just stopped right after the trial, followed by a narrated epilogue giving some plausible explanation as to how the guns got switched and informing us that Ryan Gosling and Rosamund Pike live happily ever after.
Facilitating the plot mangle are such miserable devices as these: when the wife is shot in the face with a Glock .45, she doesn't die; the homicide detective and Gosling happen to use the same model cell phone (which triggers the lamest Eureka moment in the history of cinema); Gosling spills coffee on his suit right after his tux is delivered for the party he's suddenly invited to that happens to be at the Disney Center and this all allows Hopkins to suddenly divine Gosling's "point of fracture," from which the movie takes its name (and makes no sense), like the "tell" scenes in Rounders and Casino Royale; and finally Hopkins, devilishly clever and brutal, happens to need to talk a lot for some reason.
An officer can not fire his gun without accounting for each and every bullet, he also writes a report after every event that would have shown he had put his gun down while he turned his back, which he wouldn't have done to start with.
It seemed obvious to me where the gun was (although my friends told me after the film they had no idea).
Fracture is the story of Ted Crawford (Hopkins), a rich engineer who shoots his wife after discovering she is having an affair.
Willy is brought into a case where a man named Ted Crawford attempted to murder his wife(Embeth Davidtz) after discovering that she had been cheating on him with the cop that had actually arrested Crawford for the attempt.
The late, great, sorely missed tough guy supreme Steve McQueen gives a typically cool, laconic and utterly engaging performance as rugged, but weary modern-day bounty hunter Ralph "Papa" Thorson, who goes after dangerous criminals who have skipped bail and has trouble adjusting to an ever-changing world he feels increasingly out of place in.
The way he interacts with Kathryn Harold, and the thugs he goes after.
You will know all you need to know after that.
This movie shows him go after various people and also shows his home life...which is a bit unique too.
He goes after super big rednecks, small time crooks, crazy guys who blow things up, and one rather dangerous individual.
The theme song "Lilium", sung in Latin still sends chills down my spine, even after hearing it so many times.
This show is just one clichÃ© after another.
The characters are so complex and so powerful, that after a few episodes, you abandon your true persona and start living as they do, start feeling as they do, and their burdens and joys make your heart pulse.
The day after her escape the story turns to a boy named Kohta, who arrives at Kamakura to meet his cousin Yuka.
However, regarding music there's an off kilter over-happy pop song that plays over the credits after each episode.
However, after the first episode, I found myself captivated to go on.
Even after (I think the eighth episode) where a puppy is mercilessly beaten to death, I kept being drawn in by the spiraling storyline, and found myself spending another thirty dollars on the final DVD.
My sister at age thirteen (I'm fourteen) was absolutely terrified after watching the first episode.
Not just the anger and the suffer, what Lucy/Nyuu has feeld when she was just a child and then from that moment maybe always, but as she has start to live as Nyuu after the accident at the middle of the first episode, she has became close to a real character.
She has to protect Kohta, and in the last episode she finally after eight years have meet with him as Lucy herself and not as Nyuu.
Its all about how a girl named Lucy escapes from a facility and starts her adventure from the time she becomes her spilt personality/alter ego after a shot to the head Nyu on a rollercoster ride of love, sadness, death, hatred, love and laughs.
It would be fine to watch it either after you've seen the whole series or after episode 10.
However, after watching this series, I must say that it is the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed.
It has a very deep story, along with the best anime song I have ever heard... after watching the anime I got into reading the manga and all, it is a very rich story and it is very beautifully directed.
This does not mean that the movie is distasteful, on the contrary, there is some kind of strange beauty associated with the violence which results in a mix of sadness and melancholy that stays with one long after watching the movie.
Only the ending is quite usual and poor - but the second part, after the first boring 30-40 minutes, worths the time wasted.
La Llorona is said to be a spirit of a woman who, after her lover jilted her, drowned her child in retaliation, then weeps for him, and she wants company so she convinces mothers to drown her children so she has someone to cry with.
The acting was horrible, I'm surprised Dennis could even get a career after this.
Why the former Wall Street broker Scott has become a New York detective after losing his son?
For some reason I still haven't figured out but already deeply regret, I decided to watch it after all even though I'd knew it would have the same painful effect as poking my own eyes out with a rusty spoon and pour sour vinegar in the badly infected eye-sockets.
Cheryl Hall left after the second series, so Shirley was written out.
Was the word Katanga ever used by Wolfie after "Power to the people" quote?
I bet you will forget the songs of recent times.... both son and father namely RD Burman and SD burman and the excellent sharmila Tagore will make you cry in the song............. Well you will take a long time to recover from the movie after watching it .... but if you don't watch it interestingly you will not like it much....
It is said, that this human race is always progressing but after a point all is destroyed and God will again create it from the very beginning.
Add the fact that it is society after all that created the brothel, where unquenched desires can be fulfilled, and what you have is a representation that makes Pushpa's relationship with Nandu and Anand all the more 'holy'.
Anyway, after all the nerve biting tension and thrills, the shark is destroyed and they all live happily ever after in 3D.
These oil fires the result of the scorched earth policy of Iraqi military forces retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by Coalition military forces.
Reciting short passages from the book of the Apocalypse as sweeping aerial shot after sweeping aerial shot expose a land ravaged by war, the earth tarred far as the eye can see, a vast steppe of black tending to the rim of the world, the skies charred by enormous fires and billows of smoke.
But there's an abstract quality to all of this after a while that makes it all the more real in nature, while still keeping to a control of the subject matter into something that looks out of this world, ethereal, and somehow unnatural while still being about nature all the same (hence science-reality).
The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D.
And don't get me started on the raw cheesiness of the props such as those stupid tiki torches lighting up every part of the building/arena/outside that the bad guy owns, or the main character driving a construction machine to the fight because the car door is locked, or why the bad Asian dude does a Michael Jackson dance after he wins a fight (which I'm sorry for, but it definitely detracts from one's alleged toughness).
After Fox's expensive disasters AT LONG LAST LOVE and LUCKY LADY of the previous two years the studio management must have been chewing the palm trees on the lot down to the roots after previewing this.
We youngsters longed for more comedies with him after having seen him in the outrageous (is it still seen this way today?)
This was made in the eighty's a few years after the second one (not as good as the first, but pretty good), the first two were made in the seventy's and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this.
By this time, the world realized they had a comedic genius on their hands and after this work Wilder pretty much had the Midas Touch for a while.
In time, she too would become self conscious about her comic abilities (especially after "Taxi"), but here she gives a tender, endearing performance with occasional touches of genuine comedic spark which would be even better if only the material would give her more.
I'm really surprised they didn't become an item after the movie.
What a shame to have tanked so bad after such an enjoyable original film.
I saw the first High School Musical just after it came out hearing rave reviews and i thought it might be at least interesting.
I was wrong, after about 40 mins of watching I would have rather ripped off my own ears and set them on fire than watch for another minute.
Finally the funniest scene that was supposed to be dramatic was one right after Troy found out that Sharpay was screwing with him.
Oh, and he dabbles in flirtation with from-the-streets Nina, through her finding perhaps a reason to stay alive after all...
Though the judge is a gambling philanderer, he's in nobody's pocket, and thus, after taking the bribe, votes his conscience on the case in question, and then opts out after sending his girlfriend (Gia Carides) to the Bahamas with the money.
I was yawning after two minutes of seeing seals wash up on rocks and having inane dialog try and justify its presence.
Alas, soon after a slow and sluggish start, we are forced to sit through at least twenty minutes of crudely interpolated, ancient stock footage before we get back to the main story.
And then, after the not unpleasing island sequence (the whole idea of the shipwrecked sailor not wanting to be rescued is a reasonably appealing one), we have to put up with a mind-numbingly miscalculated twist in the plot when morose Jose suddenly reverses character and turns himself into a daringly enthusiastic Captain Ahab, battling a primitively superimposed stock shot of a giant manta ray.
And it is the talented Miss Owalee who contributes the movie's one successfully pregnant moment when she collapses on the beach after Jose deserts her.
But it gets tiring after several minutes of the same stupid footage of the same stupid men catching the same stupid fish.
Soon Anna wonders if helping Jim was worth it after all.
After initial resistance, Bickford agrees but Irene, even after being publicly ridiculed (everyone knows about the affair it seems) refuses to grant him a divorce because she "loves" him to much to let him go.
Irene Dunne marries Charles Bickford soon after the movie begins.
Then, after fetching Alex and dragging him back to the car, the gang gets stopped by a policeman who gives the chauffeur a ticket.
The tiny flub is Ginger Rogers's character's name is spelled "Lily" in the film -- on the marquee outside the theater where she's performing and in the newspaper headline after she's been killed.
I like Gail Porter, she is cute and perky, even after losing her hair I think she is awesome, but they show just doesn't deliver the goods.
This movie "after the sunset" is one of my favourite films.
Actually its like a beloved uncle who comes to cheer you up after a horrible disfiguring car crash but all he manages to do is depress you even more.
He ignores his vows that he should be writing for the love of his partner; he becomes confused over his sexuality once his marriage threatens to fall apart and then sleeps with Harrelson's character in one of a few homoerotic scenes after this.
It's full of atmosphere, like if you know John Carpenters "Thing", but there's no Monster or Alien which kill one after another, the horror is more like "real life".
"After the Sunset" is about ex-jewel thief Max (Brosnan) and his lover, Lola (Hayek) who retire to the Bahamas after being unbeaten in all of their heists.
The bold thief Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) retires with his girlfriend Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) in a paradisiacal island after stealing an expensive diamond.
Don Cheadle doesn't have much to do, as his character looks as though he was an after thought.
It's an outlandish story but don't analyze it for credibility or you'd be turned off and quit after 10 minutes.
The Cons  Gets boring after the first half and the premise doesn't add up to much.
You'll be hooked after the first two minutes of this very original film.
Then, after making light of some serious history, the ending takes a dark, ironic turn to drive home its message that whatever political system you choose, the worst elements in human nature are here to stay...
You might have expected Ms. Turner instead to have done a movie akin to THE SINGING NUN after the much publicized trial, but instead chose this tell-all tale.
The setting is 1940s before and after World War II, but it's most definitely 1957, via the costumes and hairstyles.
Many conflicts are resolved and seemingly there is potential for living happily ever after, at least that is, until Return To Peyton Place...
Constance MacKenzie settled in this town after her husband allegedly died and is raising a daughter, Alison, while the proprietor of a dress shop.
In the end, he gets his way, but not until after several struggles with the community, his love interest and himself.
It was terribly disappointing, after really loving the book.
A shame the career of Diane Varsi stalled so quickly after three more films.
He does after all perform admirably and manages to convey the anxiety any teenage boy in his position would feel.
However, there were some things I wanted to see after watching the previews and seeing the poster.
Boudin was released after serving 22 years of her 20 to life sentence.
Well - at least I remembered the title after 15 years...
I found myself, after nearly two hours, wondering, if I had any self respect, "would I still be watching this awful film?"
I went to see this in the theatres after hearing about how many oscar nominations it was up for.
I don't go a lot of movies in the theatres, but when this one came back out after being nominated for a pile of oscars, I made the mistake of assuming that it would be a great movie.
Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now... Half my theatre left after the 2 hour mark, some before, and that was on opening night.
Set directly in New York's Five Points District, on a micro scale the film tells the vengeful story of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio), a young man who returns 16 years after being banished from Five Points after witnessing his father's defeat at the hands of a vicious rival known as Bill The Butcher; infamous for his fixation with the meats and his innate sense of slaughterous murder.
Despite their differences and years after Priest's death, The Butcher still honored and celebrated his life.
While the violence will surely turn off Academy Members, Daniel Day Lewis' performance will not and this film will stand the true test of time as a story so unequivocally told it will remain indelibly etched in viewers minds long after the final sequence.
The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end (because, after all, it is a movie based on a true-ish story), it was incredible to watch how it got that end.
Also, after hearing reports of Daniel Day Lewis' REALLY getting into his character, I admit that it was completely worth it.
I decided to watch the movie with English subtitles after I read the other comment, and I disagree with the claim that the movie is not well translated into English.
I was not excited when I learned of the show coming to television, but after they closed off the initial story arc and continued with new material, it took off and had the potential to be a great series.
Not the worst, but I didn't have a good feeling about myself after watching this movie in it's entirety.
Today I watched it for the second time after picking up the DVD at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors in Chicago 2007 from the director himself, Lloyd Kaufman.
Though after seeing "Puma Man" pretty much all flying scenes are tolerable.
I bought this flick after hearing, good, bad, and something in the middle.
To make matters worse, what transpires during and after the climax can be accurately guessed about twenty minutes before the film's conclusion.
Better off Dead was my favorite movie that would come on Saturday after cartoons as I was growing up.
I even like the movies he did after this.
Its shown repeatedly on Comedy Central, so I guess it was, but it was more along the lines of a doctor leaving a scaple inside you after an operation and laughing about it while you bleed to death internally.
I had to leave the theatre after about an hour and 10 min.
At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave").
The Road to Wellville doesn't make any sort of sense -- it flits back and forth between three equally nonsensical plotlines, and, after about six hours, ends.
The movie is set just after the turn of the 20th century, when the town of Battle Creek was host to dozens of wannabees who attempted to develop and market their own vegetarian breakfast foods.
I remember anticipating a really entertaining, fun movie after I read the VHS box describing the story and then read the list of actors in here.
A mid-level star of the kind of medium grade movie that was going out of fashion, he was on the verge of becoming an anachronism; and had he not died a couple of years after this film one wonders what would have happened to him and his career.
Reassuring, as we can see the crew reacting together as one social unit, even after the inevitable trials of months in space; disturbing because it is all so emotionless and controlled.
I was rather disappointed with this film, after the high voter rating.
He redeemed himself when, after one bit of shaggy-dog dialog, he looks askance at the perpetrator of the utterance with a disgust filled sneer.
The first couple breaks off after and second one seems to remain together but he film is with open final.
It was the first starring role for Lon McCallister, a young man who made 42 films but only nine after this one, retiring from the screen at 30.
Another movie called April Love, with Pat Boone and Shirley Jones , came out about 20 years after Home in Indiana and copied the premise of the movie.
At one point after a barrage of firing and shouting, Nene and Angel are on the floor, (dead silence) their heads together laying flat, and Angel says,'I don't hear them,' Nene asks 'hear what' and Angel says, 'the voices, there gone !
All the stereotypes one expects are on hand: the avaricious executive producers; the harried director; the screenwriters, pained by the incremental decimation of their work; the aging stars in decline; the young up and comings; the vain chase after that holiest of grails: an Oscar, the hangers on Â the parasitic, disingenuous talent agent, talk show hosts, film critics and entertainment reporters.
Harry Shearer is better as a long-suffering actor who is glad enough just to star in a feature film after years of making commercials, Oscar or no Oscar.
I mean after all.
His walk, supposedly naked after a shower, across the circus grounds - hidden behind people carrying items, or elephants and other animals, until a lady screams and faints (and Fields is finally physically revealed to the audience) is a gem.
Very well done, and just after filming the skinheads shown here were arrested on weapons violation charges, which is another method the law has of getting rid of "undesirables" who otherwise may not be committing any known crimes.
Scene after scene, the incredible excruciation of being in love is honorably, even horrifically evident, such as in the scene where Nene tenderly takes to the bullet in his lover, Angel's side; whose agonized screams are shrill as well as painful.
It's inconceivable to think of a love surviving amidst chaos, yet explicitly evident by the film's conclusion are two characters gleefully and explicitly demonstrating their devotion; a scene where the two burn the money that they stole, and that which their pursuers are after.
Hendrix, Ten Years after, Free are great!
Still, almost every musical act is worth checking out in their limited time frame, and a little extra sadness comes along in seeing that a few of these people didn't live long after the concert ended.
Incredible concert footage of Hendrix and Jim Morrison (both of whom died just after the festival) as well as numerous other pop, folk, and rock artists make this film wonderful just as a concert video.
I figured after having already seen it once, it would be safe to try again as I was waiting on a bus, but the same unrestrained hysterics ensued.
That I just found out doing an "after viewing" search on Matthew Settle; betting I saw him in "I know what you did last summer" originally renting the movie because I am a "Samatha Mathis" fan.
Unfortunately after this promising start the film fell apart in the last section as soon as one of the characters put on a dress and we entered 'La Cage Aux Folles' territory.
I heard Tom Six is planning a sequel (this time with lesbians), but after seeing his first, getting the feeling of crawling back into the closet, I hope he reconsiders before he damages gay acceptation even more.
I felt really disappointed after watching this one.
Even when two frogmen slip into the water to plant a mine it cuts away to Â you guessed itÂ  When, after 40 minutes, Bellucci reveals she's planning to quit the French secret service, you think: her legs must have got tired of all the walking.
Luckily Vincent Cassel is able to walk past them by putting on glasses, a scarf and a bit of cardboard in his mouth, but he's really cut up about it: he goes for a walk to his old girlfriend, them, after feeding her cat and trying to write, goes for a walk to see another friend...
Also used in 20, 30 other movies: the main character gets kidnapped by the "opposition", but somehow miraculously manages to cause a traffic accident, after which of course he's the only survivorÂ I'm not even mentioning the somewhat unbelievable sideplot of Brisseau finding extremely quickly the professional (???)
On reflection, however, it was appropriate, if a bit flat Â especially after all that blazing action.
Fine, after half an hour we get the joke.
Then it's repeated week after week.
It thinks by re-hashing old comedy concepts such as "My Family" and "Broken News" it will count on getting viewers who have put much better equivalent shows out of their memories and it is fiercely loyal to character based sketch shows which can spin out episode after episode of 8 characters and their stock catchphrases.
If you were wondering what happens next after Terms ended, the answer is that the characters continued living.
It has so many false endings, that I gave up shortly after Nicholsons odd, special-guest-star appearance.
However, after ten minutes watching this became an ordeal.
In the first he seemed to be there a lot but, how can he just never see them again after his wife dies how does that happen.
But 6 years after "The Evening Star"'s release, my curiosity got the best of me, besides I got it for free from the library.
Romantic fantasies are supposed to have the couple living happily ever after.
Based on Larry McMurtry's sequel novel, the story picks up Aurora's story fifteen years after Emma's death as we see true to her daughter's final wishes, that the grandiose older woman has raised Emma's three children.
This is 13 years after the first and the storyline is pretty much that amount of time later, maybe a little more because Melanie is pretty much grown up as well.
Right after I saw this movie, I was thinking "NOW WHAT IN  DARNATION DID THIS HAVE TO DO WITH TARZAN?????"
But apperantly it was made after  an original Tarzan-book.
It was just one clichÃ© after another, after another, after another.
Burroughs, after all, was primarily a fantasy writer and there is no point in holding his fiction to any "realistic" standard.
In fact, Van Dien may be my second favorite Tarzan, after Gordon Scott.
Casper is an intelligent, grunt-free version of Tarzan who returns to the jungle after getting a psychic call "home" from his shaman friend.
Instead Robert goes after the psychos with an ax and has a fight and they leave, and Michael tells him they won't be back.
to characters and royally confuse my family because I watch movies with headphones after midnight and we live in a one story house.
Shouldn't someone report the rape and get after those guys.
The boyfriend goes for a walk the next day and runs into the two dummys bickering amongst themselves and he goes after them with a small tomahawk but no blood is shed and the rednecks run off and everybody lives happily ever after.
I guess that, after starring in this completely pointless movie, Englund decided to exclusively play villains and evil monsters.
Well, after Jon Stewart last year, I guess that anyone might seem a little weak, but I liked how she did (particularly that trick with Scorsese).
The ceremony felt like one big whole this year and was more personal and natural, with presenter Ellen DeGeneres actually walking between- and talking to the stars and taking part of the show elements, without feeling the constant obligation to constantly talk after, between and before the handing out of every single award.
I mean after all, this is THE evening of the nominees, not of the presenters.
Another highlight was Scorsese getting a standing ovation, not necessarily for his win for "The Departed" but more for his career and the fact that he finally won an Oscar, after being nominated 7 times already.
Really the most pleasing moment of all was Martin Scorsese's win for best director after five previous nominations, finally Martin you won!
The setting also changed as the women moved from their homey/funky Village digs into some sterile skyscraper, and the show only lasted one season after Ari's departure.
Jane Curtin and Susan St. James play divorced best friends who live together after their divorces with their children in a Greenwich Village apartment.
It lives through me to this day - my daughter (born long after my experience on this film) is very interested in the Holocaust because of my experience on this film.
After Atomik Circus, the hyperactive Belgian BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is yet again jumping with young directors and writers in a crazy movie with lots of pace, plenty of ideas and references, a lot of humor (JC Van Damme laughing at the image of himself that was built and then that has spread to all french-speakers in the world after several interviews and comments he made when on drugs again and again, several crazy TV appearances saying stupid things absurd semi-philosophical metaphorical sentences in a very pedantic tone while they meant nothing because he was stoned etc...) and some critics made about current society with wit, discretely etc...He succeeds at making his crazily pathetic character very touching and above all hilarious as always...
I watched this 30-minute documentary of one of many battles in Italy shortly after having viewed "All Quiet on the Western Front" for the first time.
Soon after his lawyers threatened to sue if they didn't remove him.
Any chance to believe anything in this movie vanished when the 911 operator hung-up on the bartender after calling him a drunk.
My family visited the fort the day after Gary Cooper was at this fort.
Did you ever notice how the Seminoles are always running after the expedition, which is walking, but never seem to quite catch up?
It's very easy to criticise a film like "for the boys", after all it is sentimental and there is singing, a sure fire vote killer.
Bette Midler proves that she can single-handedly make a film worth watching in FOR THE BOYS, an overlong but rewarding comedy-drama with music which chronicles the relationship between singer Dixie Leonard and comic Eddie Sparks (James Caan), a character clearly patterned after Bob Hope, which begins during a WWII USO tour and concludes in the present where the glamorously aging couple are being reunited for a television special.
During the first UFO tour he arranges Dixie to see her husband again after nearly two years.
Will she go to confront Eddie after all these years?
George Segals speech at the Christmas Party after he was fired could have been stronger, but it was good.
She layers her performance with emotion after emotion and has the gift of bringing out that quality in her fellow actors.
She ends up confessing her secretive life style after being charged with attempted murder.
So he ends up in the army but after a spell in the cooler for insubordination he escapes by nicking the car and coat of an army scientist along with, inadvertently, secret tank drawings.
There is a really good chase scene when the baddies are after Lucky in the gardens.
The villains in THIS GUN FOR HIRE (Tully Marshall, Laird Cregar, and Marc Lawrence) are going to sell poison gas to Japan after Pearl Harbor, so they are traitors (well paid ones too - Marshall has some secret Japanese medal for his services to Hirohito).
Since I'm not from the USA I didn't notice some historical mistakes -mainly the use of guns and rifles not yet invented by the time of the action- I learned about after reading some reviews here; I think those are major flaws in a movie.
I was so crushed when they removed it, and anytime they had it on TV after that I was over the moon!
They put it on On Demand one summer (only the first eight episodes or so) and I'd spend whole afternoons watching them one after the other... but the worst part?
I saw up till 2002 and i don't remember any new episodes after that.
She proceeds to do something stupid again after that, completely ignoring what she has learned.
I have 6 of the episodes on DVD, and all of them are really funny, and I also remember catching it everyday after school.
But, after all it's a movie.
My first thoughts that came to mine after I saw The Ultimate Gift; were great movie.
In both stories, he is chasing his father, and although he only catches him in the flashback, the outcomes of both stories are similar in that Jack doesn't get what he's after.
There are some murders going on in Brooklyn, the last one being that of a police detective and after each one someone sends the Brooklyn Standard (Eagle) a note as to where the body is and signs it 'Constant Reader'.
Skelton disguised himself as the Beavers pitcher and took his place on the mound against these guys and retired the side after hitting the first three batters.
The acting is solid, but after all u don't need Oscar type of acting in these kind of film.
The movie is like a warped after school special.
but after your stomach stops turning, you are left with a film that has pushed past the regular or expected, into a space of unique social and political commentary.
Well well after the 2 first Ringu's that i enjoyed soooo much because of the scary screenplays, Ringu 0 brings us a very different prequel with this on, if you expect seeing as much scary scenes as in Ringu 1 and 2, then i hope you will read this first so at least you know that it won't, it is explains about all what you needed to know, with a end you already know but hehe it is a prequel so what else could it have been.
And what's even worse: Roddy Mcdowall's character gets introduced during the first scenes (apparantly he's a wealthy tourist on a fishing holiday), and after that, he never re-appears in the movie!
For example, L'il C says such dancing is "in our blood" -- but is that after LaChapelle showed them the footage of African ritual dancing that they had never seen before -- and it is a bit disconcerting that of all the footage he could have selected he uses material from the Leni Riefenstahl archives.
While the story line wanders a bit after the climactic Battle Zone, LaChappelle forcefully links the the dancing to Pentecostal and Baptist gospel traditions for the life affirming conclusion.
needless to say, police got involved because it was after curfew and i had my little sis w/us.. so we went home w/those feelings and 'clowned' and 'krumped'... it was "ahh" ::sighs.w/relief::
(even after being robbed, he still stuck it through).
The DVD extras contains footage of the dancers speaking to an audience after a preview of the film at the Tribeca Film Festival, and they make clear in their own words what LaChapelle would not let them say directly in his film.
I watched the movie many, many times after buying the DVD.
I can tell I'm in the minority here, but I was really aggravated after seeing Rize.
I was very excited to see the film after hearing so much about the dancing itself and the social impact of clowning and krumping on kids' lives in L.A.
The most recent game I got was Evil Dead Regeneration which was about a week ago.This is the newest game in the Evil Dead series of games which were based on the films.I have never seen the films.This game is not bad.Its pretty fun especially when you have the little midget sidekick named Ssam who you can kick around.He also makes funny comments.At first the game is pretty hard especially when you have hoards of zombies coming at you but after you get Sam it gets easier.This game is a horror/action game with comedy.Bruce Campbell who was ash in the movies is the voice of ash in the game and he has really funny one-liners.So does Sam Ash's half deadite sidekick.The game is about a man who must kill all the zombies.Evil Dead Regeneration is an alright game but I suggest buying it at a cheap price.
I get a gross feeling inside me after playing it.
I found the beginning of this Harold Lloyd vehicle a bit weak (the first person to watch the tape, not a silent film regular, later told me he had given up after ten minutes, and I can understand why), and compared to later films it seems very heavy on the intertitles.
The women have unrealistic expectations and dreams, that they would become disappointed after finding out the truth.
I had tried to watch it a few weeks earlier, but gave up after the scene where the beds can be hidden in the wall or floors.
It's only when they go after ethnic groups that they lose me.
Groucho, Chico and Harpo continued to work at the Studio; but there seemed to be a steady decline after the second MGM picture, 1937's A DAY AT THE RACES.
But, when after reading the credits in back of the case I realized it had been written by the same author of the first film (Ringu).
In this series which was prematurely shortened, she and William Gaunt plays parents and grandparents who must raise their three orphaned grandchildren after their son and daughter-in-law have died in a car accident.
Like 2 Point 4 Children it was based around a family, 2 grandparents (Penelope Keith and William Gaunt) Maggie and Andrew Prentice who after their estranged Son Graham and his Wife (They call her 'Bootface') are killed in a car crash, are left with their grandchildren, Georgia (Ann Gosling), Philip (Matthew Clarke) and Jake (Jamie Lucraft) not to mention their collection of animals.
Series 1 sees the initial fallout after the death of the children's parents and Maggie & Andrews realisation that they will not be retiring to France.
Robinson (although he did use some stereotyping) created a character who was not only mysterious, but both an anti-hero as well as deep & complex the likes of which would not be seen for a great long time after.
While everything seems just fine after they marry 20 years later, eventually this lady (Young) is seduced away from Robinson--not a smart move considering Robinson is a skilled assassin with a hatchet!!
I auditioned for Mr. Holden in 1999 for the lead female role (Jenna) in "My Father's House," and remember him saying then - after I asked him what he was looking for in regards to the scene I was about to do - "Make me love and hate you at the same time.
I didn't get it then, but after reading some of these posts about this film, as well as a recent online interview at Rogue Cinema, I do now.
Anyway, I came here today to find out what he's up to now (after running into one of his producers, Kerry Johnston, recently at a restaurant here in Hollywood on La Cienega - who said he was about to begin filming his seventh film at the end of this month in Wyoming - though I suspected she was purposely throwing me off his trail, as she looked at me like I was a stalker), and, remarkably, IMDb only has this, his first time behind the lens, listed.
Well, anyway, I think it's simply amazing when a film can stick with you long after you watch it (especially nowadays with all the disposable / forgettable crap that's out there); and, sometimes, like with this film, for reasons you're not really sure of.
The story circles around a lifelike doll that previously happened to be the girlfriend of a paranoid doll-maker, who killed her after she threatened to leave him.
I get the feeling that when they were making this film they had planned to make a serious horror, and after watching it, they knew, to save face, they would have to promote it as a dark comedy.
I usually try to bring a little more creativity in the titles for my reviews but I'm still to speechless after seeing this "Dead Doll".
And the action scenes are breathless, non-stop and come at you one after another.
They all survive and live happily ever after.
After reading the reviews for this film, most of which were, to put it nicely, largely negative, I came under the impression that this movie was going to be the cinematic equivalent of being forced to watch someone kill your dog right after they were done eating your firstborn child.
But after looking at the cover of the DVD package and seeing the films two leading ladies (one of whom is one of my favorite actresses) smiling and looking heart-breakingly radiant, I thought to myself, could the film really be THAT bad?
The fact is, the writing and performances in this film are simply not strong enough for anyone to take the film's periodic attempts at being earnest seriously, especially after considering how over-the-top the actions of the two main characters are.
Both scenes were well-conceived but ultimately came up short in terms of just how fun they wound up being, especially after considering the comedic talents of both Hudson and Hathaway.
Despite being stuck with a tiresomely familiar role (the overly caring woman who forgets to look after her own needs), Hathaway refuses to succumb entirely to convention, and instead infuses her character with a spark of gutsy enthusiasm and her seemingly unquenchable trademark charisma and quirky charm - the only mercifully palatable element in the film, and clearly a far better piece of acting than such a film deserves.
well, i personally found the ending rather unsatisfying... it 'shocked' me out of my "suspension of disbelief"... i didn't see how things could be so 'resolved' after 10 years of courtship, to dump it all out in a few minutes.
I saw this movie yesterday,even after reading some comments on this site.
Yet had Winick went with this theme for the majority of his film, rather than save it for after all the silly, perfunctory cat fight scenes that in turn just about destroy all human shades within his characters, Bride Wars could have been a much more flowing, and relevant feature.
It could have been enough if it had been worked out some better, but quite sadly this comedy fails to be funny and that is IMO one of the prime requisites of a comedy - making the audience laugh out loud a good number of times and keep them amused until after the ending credits.
Shooting The Devil Wears Prada after Brokeback Mountain is one thing, tainting your Oscar-nominated legacy with this bunch of nonsense is another.
In fairness, no one ever expected any true brilliance from Hudson, given the last really good movie she appeared in was Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous in 2000, but surely someone could have told Hathaway you just don't choose something this bland after working with Jonathan Demme (or Ang Lee, for that matter).
A week of passive aggressive hostility passes before the two women make it clear that neither will compromise, especially after Liv tries to take advantage of Emma's passive nature and outrages Emma in the process.
I sighed immensely after this second viewing...
They do make horror movies in Italy that not appeal to me, after all!
Several of the story lines are underdeveloped, the film wastes far too much time on irrelevant sub plots and insignificant supportive characters, the evil's true nature remains a mystery even after the film has finished, the lead roles aren't convincing and the production incomprehensibly doesn't take full usage of the marvelous filming locations and scenery!
The discovery might not be such a triumph after all, as the occupant of the sarcophagus Â a bizarre type of feline monster Â is awakened and promptly goes on a rampage.
The plot: Two sisters, Lynn (a tremendously sexy Shu Qi) and Sue (Zhao Wei) turn assassins after their parents get gunned down by gangsters seeking the girls' father's invention - technology that can infiltrate every closed-circuit monitoring system in the world.
Tracking them after their latest hit is female cop Hong Yat Hong (Karen Mok).
How could a man survive after being crushed by a trash compactor?
The whole episode is reasonably well-paced after it carefully sets up the necessary plot information/murder scenario as Columbo tries to unravel the real truth whilst at the same time undermine a very self-confident murderer.
There's a general feeling of 'life happens" pervading the film - as was also the case for the noir films toward the end of that genre as it faded after WWII.
When the boys do find Gianni it is after he has taken a 6 story fall.
Witnesses describe a woman who sounds a lot like Bain leaving the area just after her now ex's failed flight.
for an example they start of by showing the "El Classico" from 2006 then they jump straight to the summer (El Classico was in march or april) then they have the bar called Miguel Angel in madrid and Angel is a Barca Icon so the idea of having a bar in Madrid named after one of their arch rivals is not possible.
I was expecting to be grossly disappointed by this sequel, after the first offering which blew me away ((being a Newcastle fan and all)) I was pleasantly surprised however at the ease at which the story flowed between Santiago's time at Newcastle, to his blossoming career at Real Madrid.
I was not expecting more out of this after Goal and it does not even meet my humble expectations.
For me, it certainly does for European Footballers what 'Top Gun' did for Naval Aviators and I wouldn't have minded being either after seeing the films.
I love football(soccer) and after having to watch so many baseball movies I am happy to finally have a movie series about the sport that I like and play.
2 after Goal !
I mean, it's the most important soccer event in the world after the FIFA WORLD CUP.
For example, whenever there was a shoot-out, even when all the person had was a pistol, they NEVER reload their guns after firing like mad for five minutes.
Another example would be when a lady attempted to kill a group of people(with a knife an inch long) was shot repeativly as she ran what looked like 30 feet, you think she'd die after getting hit by a combination of bullets of an Uzi and two 9mm pistols.
I got off work at 5 pm, walked home (i didn't even have a car at the time), watched the first 20 minutes, ejected the DVD and walked right back to the rental store after walking all the way home, and put it in the drop box.
But after that another terrible scene, like the ending SPOILER SHE HUMPS THE WORM!!.
It reeks of pretentiousness, is chock full of bad acting (and after watching it I really don't know or care if the acting was intentionally bad or just naturally so), terrible writing and a completely lame and pointless plot.
Well this is not a kind of a movie where u can shout its amazing after watching but in very subtle ways it does leave its mark..
Ben plans on leaving town as soon as possible, but has second thoughts after meeting feisty and fetching ambulance driver Lou (a delightfully spunky portrayal by the deliciously lissome Julie Warner).
Early on in the movie, Ben Stone stumbles out of his cabin after dreaming of a beautiful woman bathing in water, and lo - there's a nude Lu surfacing and making 'first contact' with him.
To me that one small town street is the place where my husband and I used to day dreaming about buying antique furniture after he would finish graduate school at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida.
Coming from one of the largest cities in the world, I just wondered what I was going to do after I finished my classes as a Visiting Student at the UF.
Well after living there for about four years, I learned much more than what graduate school could ever teach.
Fox) who, after a minor car crash, finds himself trapped in the "twilight zone" of backwater USA, only to make a series of amazing discoveries about life off the beaten path.
First off, just to let you know, Queen Latifah cannot act, she has about as much acting ability as my left nut, just because someone can go on-screen and play themselves, over and over again, does not mean they can act, second off, I wouldn't even have had to watched this movie to tell you it's a piece of crap, the only reason I watched it's 'cause I work at a video store and it was playing on the tele, even then I stopped looking up after five minutes and tried to block out as much of the useless chit chat they were spitting out, and I can tell I'm not the only one who didn't like it 'cause people where walking out faster then they were coming in.
The film is not a shame when it comes to direction; but I just can't understand why Tim Story, after doing a respectable comedy like "Barbershop", got into this.
But then after all, we end up wanting a little bit more from this piece that doesn't provide us as it should.
The best way for you to see this it's to see the french TAXI(1998), TAXI2(2000) and TAXI3 (2003) and after than watch the American made TAXI.
Samy Naceri and Frederic Diefenthal made a good team: one a speed-maniac taxi driver, the other, an incompetent policeman who, after eight tries, still couldn't get his driver's licence.
I quote:  German (bad guy) #1 (after the car sped by Daniel, in a sense of ecstasy): "We've won!!!"
And of course, who could forget the immortal line, when trying to comfort Emilien after failing his attempt to get a driver's licence for the 8th time:  Camille: "Don't worry, Emilien.
What a surprise it was when the airbags, that deploy instantly in the event of a crash, deployed several seconds after the crash!
I remember being a bit annoyed as certain episodes resembled after school specials, rather than the medical/ crime drama I became addicted too.
Heck, after a while, you even grew to like Asten--especially since he mellowed and was less of a paper-pushing bureaucrat in later episodes.
If it's a bad film you're after, then I recommend seeing anything from the abysmal Nazisploitation sub-genre, as unless I'm missing something; they're all terrible!
Shortly after the war they rendezvous at the dilapidated remains of the concentration camp they met.
As much as I enjoyed Minority Report, the film left me bruised with a few bumps on the head after my theater chair also served as an ejection seat which, at times, launched me out of the movie to the roof, then back again.
Twenty years after he first started out as a totally unknown figure, Spielberg entered the new millennium as one of the most influential figures in history, and continues to make top-notch movies with his winning formula Â Minority Report continues this streak.
Spielberg returns to the genre of science-fiction (after the 1990's saw no films of the like coming from him) with Minority Report.
How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.
This associate's coming around to that knowledge will make him become a criminal and thus he will be neutralized and put away but after the crime is committed for reasons that are not clear.
At least after a while you feel the same agony about the hero.
I saw this a couple years ago and was unimpressed, however after upon 2nd viewing, I must say It deserves it's praise, so if you didn't care for it the 1st time, give it a second viewing, you may change your opinion.This should honestly be in the top 250 in my opinion, and there are some fantastic creepy moment as well, plus I loved the depressing atmosphere it had at times, and This is almost like The Fugitive except it's set in the future, plus It also has some very funny scenes in it as well.
His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad ("Amistad"), the second bad but not anonymous ("Saving Private Ryan"), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after "Schindler's List" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with "A.I."
The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell.
The ending with Mr. Paige finding his former love, Miss Allbritton, literally buried within the childhood detritus of her own attic, to which, after placing his ring on her finger, he sets afire, provides a fitting finale.
Watching this soon after THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE (1943), it is easy to discern the difference a talented film-maker can do (as Robert Siodmak certainly was) as opposed to a journeyman director like Lew Landers.
I felt sorry for Sadako after watching this film, it was really amazing to find out what really happened to her and what led her to become what she became.
You couldn't help but sympathize for Sadako after seeing how much hatred she had recieved for being different.
She rings the police but after visiting the man they can't find any semblance of trouble or threat from the man accused.
Nobody believes her and she refuse to give up on bringing out the truth, but the suave killer starts to turn the tables on her and sets about having her committed for being insane, the cat is well and truly after the mouse.
But will she be able to convince Detective Gary Merrill (who by now has fallen in love with her) that her assertions are, after all, true?
The apartment belongs to an author, Albert Richter, who emigrated to America after the war.
To end on a good note, I like your effort now; I'll love your film after a tighter edit.
What is the difference between a movie that is "okay" and a movie that stays with you long after you have seen it?
The film finally comes alive near the end and gets more interesting after Joan gets more crazy.
I am not a big fan of Joan Crawford, but found myself hooked watching this film after about 20 minutes.
Soon after, a series of misfortunes befall the family, and Dr. Brewster decides to call in Professor Lazio, (J. Edward Bromberg) an expert on superstitious matters.
She continues to pine away for him even after being rebuffed over and over.
The story is told in flashback after she goes into a "hysterical" trance on the streets of downtown Los Angeles.
Above all, women could not be told the truth about their condition after World War Two, when they had to be driven out of the factories where they had worked beside men and back into the home to be consumer housewives.
It's the story of what happens after a woman suffers from psychosis.
Things get pretty dicey after that and this is when Miss Crawford's performance goes from good to brilliant.
Graham' after the first Mrs. Graham commits suicide.
While Van Heflin gives an applaudably callous performance as the insensitive focus of obsession, partially because I cannot understand why such an incredibly ugly man like him so often plays roles of confidently unavailable loners after whom beautiful women obsess, Joan Crawford gives one of those tremendous performances that is almost like a throwback to ancient Greek theater when the protagonist was such an abundant function of the story to the extent that he had to portray every other character and even sometimes the props as well.
Joan Crawford plays an unstable woman who slowly slips into madness after being rejected by Van Heflin.
This decision on David's part has Louise go off her nut to the point of almost losing both her composer, when David was around, and her ability to look after her and Davids employers Dean Graham's, Raymond Massey, very ill wife Pauline whom Louise, a licensed nurse, was taking care off.
Possessed is post-war, and after the war, the new rage was psychology.
Dean Graham, the rich widower, asks Louise to stay after his wife's death.
The chic blonde beauty, here in a dark wig to contrast her sister, played by lovely Evelyn Ankers, is superb, especially after being transformed into the undead, and disclosing her true plans to Paige, also fine in his tormented portrayal.
The plot is that of a treasure in a museum sought after by two different characters.
Julie Delpy is really a very good actress and I have new respect for her after seeing this--I thought she would be forever typecast as the blonde nymphet.
Count Dracula hides under pseudonym and emigrates to America, where a young belle heiress with a fascination for occultism is subdued under his powers and even marries him after leaving her beau behind.
An aging physician and an Hungarian scholar are soon after him, though.
Often, after a while, they share their thoughts with her and with us.
The film is called "Son of Dracula," after all, and J. Edward Bromberg identifies Alucard as a "descendant" of Dracula.
The scene where the New Orleans ladies take Marlene aside to give her a little lecture on the "burden of womanhood she'll have to endure" after her marriage is priceless, with the tiny smirk that plays across Marlene's face (given her well-known history, it makes it doubly funny).
I was on the edge of my seat, close to tears, and that was after only catching the last half of this movie.
As a James Marsters fan he was the reason I bought this film but after realising he's not in it that much I really got into the actual story and really enjoyed it.
I don't understand why the mother does not cancel going to Hong Kong and choose yet another life, to live with her family with less income, after reconciliation with her daughter.
The acting in this movie is magnificent, I had never heard of Vilma Santos until I watched Anak, however after seeing it I had to rent out some of her other movies, the emotion shown by Vilma, and the other actors is amazing and at times you really can find yourself believing that this family is real.
My son asked me, after I told him I had walked out of this movie, if I had checked the rating.
One thing's for sure, you can easily see the guilt in their eyes after they fight!
We appreciate each other more (at least for a little while) after watching this movie.
He would become the fourth legendary horror king in American cinema after his father, Bela Lugosi, and Boris Karloff!
The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while.
So there my partner and I were after 16 years together truly touched by all that we saw, nodded our heads to, laughed at and balled our eyes out over and, in the end, really uplifted by in this gem of a film.
"Son of Dracula" takes place decades after the first film, when the Dracula's story is now considered a mere myth.
Although I do like NIGHT VISION, it is very much a 'B' movie and after Forster appeared in Quentin Tarantino's JACKIE BROWN a lot of people, me included, thought QT would resurrect Forster's career the same way he had done for John Travolta and Bruce Willis when they appeared in PULP FICTION.
The way the plot develops is suspenseful, and the finale, which ends cold right after the climax, is powerful.
And, as I chuckled after viewing it, some of the gunshots by Zach(Bizzy Bone) are unintentionally hilarious.
The fact that it wasn't a totally happy ending and that the main character paid for his crimes, even after trying to make everything right was poignant and well said.
In the lesbian wedding segment we see the preacher from the Joy MCC church conducting the ceremony, after himself admitting that he too is gay.
THEN - Those pun-filled Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields or Laurel & Hardy classics, the sappy-but-Innocent "screwball comedies," and the slapstick of Abbott & Costello, The Three Stooges, the subtlety of Cary Grant or Irene Dunne, etc  NOW - Nothing but crudeness and an obsession with bodily functions and sex.....film after film.
However; some of the off-the-wall jokes will have you laughing your face off, and will keep returning to your mind, making you laugh days after you watched the film.
And the execution of these so-called gags is almost consistently accompanied by Myers with the same sort of mugging grin to the camera that he perfected with Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers Â the difference here being that those other characters had moments where they really were humorous, but seeing Myers try it with Pitka is akin to watching an inept magician fail every trick, but still take a rehearsed bow after each one, oblivious to the negative reaction he's getting from his audience.
Good luck to Mike Myers, he'll need it big time after more critics review this bad movie.
You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given.
I knew this would not be a Great Movie, but I expected it to be at least somewhat funny -- it is, after all, a comedy.
The entire movie was basically sexual innuendo after innuendo after innuendo after humping elephants.
The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of "TM" after one of his catchphrases.
It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing.
This is information we learn early on in the film (after Pitka serenades us with a Bollywood-style musical number of Dolly Parton's Nine to Five during the opening credits), and I pretty much knew right there that The Love Guru was going to be a very long 90 minutes.
"Then seeing it again for the first time in years some time in 1986.This time that I'd first seen it it was also after school & when it was too snowy out to go to my C.C.D.Class.Curly's Skunkskin cap is another interesting & hysterical aspect to give good color to this picture.
In most cartoons starring Sylvester the Cat that are directed by Friz Freling or Robert McKimson, the pussycat is usually the aggressor who's after either Tweety or Hippity Hopper, the baby kangaroo mistaken for a giant mouse either by the red-nosed feline or his son, Sylvester, Jr.
The bank rip-off seems pretty well thought through but everything after that just seems like crap, plotwise.
Having watched this film, I became bored after about 30 minutes and as it was only just over 90 minutes long I persevered in the hope it would improve!!
And add to these people a   couple that had a dream of living happily ever after.
I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but after all, beauty is in the eye of the movie critic.
During an after school exam, Misa and twelve students get locked in for the night and their teacher has disappeared.
While the majority of the pacing in the opening half slowly kicks off in first gear, it's not until just after the halfway mark where the tempo gets frenetic and the blood splatter hits the fans.
Merchandise poured out, the DVD sold like hotcakes, and it seemed like "Little Britain" had firmly sealed its place up there as a classic TV series; it probably won't be something like "Herman's Head" or "A Sharp Intake of Breath" that fades into obscurity after it gets shown first time round (as a matter of fact, how many know what actually happened in these things?
In these, a geeky carer named Lou looks after a fat person with special needs named Andy.
Most of it gives me a laugh although it gets repetitive and predictable after a while and it's not so funny.
it was okay, there were a few laughs here and there, but after a couple of episodes it got boring, it's just recycled gags and basic toilet humour and David Walliams in a dress!
The characters are grotesque versions of real people, which seems a good idea for comedy but after a while the level of comedy is so basic that i forget to laugh because you've seen it all before.
This all seemed painfully ironic when after five minutes of the first episode I saw the same sketch, in a marginally different location, then another, and another.
I watched these episodes on NetFlix and there are moments that are funny, but the comedy gets a little old after a while because of the limited number of characters.
While it's undeniably entertaining, it has all the same problems that most sketch comedy has: some characters start becoming more annoying than funny after a while, especially if they were a little annoying to begin with.
Lou and Andy are also funny at first, but after a while I get tired of the 3 minute set-up for him to predictably change his mind about what he wants.
Just a few recurring characters: Lou selflessly dedicates his life to looking after wheelchair-bound Andy and Andy selfishly dedicates his life to making things as difficult as possible for Lou.
Most are of the characters are very funny, but even some of the funny ones lose their punch when you see the same characters episode after episode.
Some, though funny, just seem to lose steam after a while (such as the guy who breast feeds).
And the fact that she doesn't even recognize the guy whom she thinks has killed a beloved pooch and yet trusts and sends him to look after her fish, so that he can conveniently discover their childhood connection that lasted, what, maybe a week, which is more than enough time for an enraged father to locate his errant son in a small Chinese village?
The main character is introduced at the beginning of the film after a paper boy runs into a stack of bricks in an alley and is assaulted by the girl for some reason.
Her mom wanted to be a movie star or singer but after bearing a child(the main character) out of wedlock is shunned by the locals and her dreams disappear.
Amongst those that I've seen, I was blown away by the quality of storytelling and craft, and had wondered how soon after would I have the chance to watch something from China again, since our local cinemas don't really bring them in for mass consumption.
Persuaded to help her look after her fish while she has to inevitably get detained by the authorities, Dabing thought that he had reached seventh heaven when her apartment turned out to be one huge home theatre.
Shortly after reading the book, we were shown the 1992 film adaptation in that class.
Lennie is big and strong, but he is also mentally handicapped, and George has to look after him.
Dabing enters the story, at first a bully for Ling Ling but after a while they become best friends.
In the midst of everything, George has to look after Lennie, who proves very dangerous to himself and others.
And all of these is being revealed right into it's true, fully mad picture by Jack Nicholson, a person whom I reckon the second most deprogrammed actor in the world, after the great Anthony Hopkins.
So, in conclusion, I don't feel angry at all after watching this.
Dave Buznick is played by Adam Sandler, a calm, relaxed, cool man (despite his "troublesome" childhood) who is, after a roll-on-aisles hilarious scene, given "Anger Managemnt" therapy for 20 hours, with none other than "the" Buddy Rydell.
ok, iÂ´m not saying that this was the best film ever, but given the circumstances, saturday night out after a week of work (including all saturday), this was just the film that made us happy.
As the therapy progresses things seem to get worse and after another huge slice of misfortune, Dr. Rydell is forced to move in with Dave and conduct 30 days of intensive Anger Management.
Now I know it doesn't take much of a stretch to go from pacifist to hell bent avenger after seeing your family wiped out, but how about some discretion.
There's something else about Kilpatrick - did you notice that after every one of his bloody encounters (that first one with Schoolboy was the worst), he appears in the next scene with a clean set of duds.
Al Lettieri plays Gutierrez, who is also after Taylor.
The Mexican sheriff is insistent on letting justice prevail, always  looking for witnesses, and never just going after and killing the  bloodthirsty gang.
Kilpatrick relentlessly tracks them down, even as they cross the border into Mexico, where Kilpatrick's progress is both helped and hindered by Mexican policeman Gutierrez (Al Lettieri), who is also after Brand but wants to do things the legal way.
While this Western (from a story by Samuel Fuller, also the original director but fired after disputes with star Harris) won't be for everybody because of its grim and sometimes ugly nature, there's no doubt that it hits a real nerve.
Also on any list of brutal '70s revenge-westerns would be The Deadly Trackers, originally planned as a Samuel Fuller movie but completed by Barry Shear after Fuller quit the project.
Irish sheriff Sean Kilpatrick (Richard Harris) looks after the Texas town of Santa Rosa and has made a point of solving crimes and capturing criminals without resorting to violence.
But, after a little while it gets a little tiresome.
Did you catch the neat way he mounted his horse right after first meeting George and Lennie?
Pet Detective (Jim Carrey) ventures out to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot after it is kidnapped from team headquarters just a week before the Super Bowl, to worsen matters dolphin quarterback Dan Marino is abducted.
Ray Finkle), when Ace takes a trip to nearby Collier County to meet with Finkle's parents he discovers the revenge and hate Finkle had for Marino and the dolphins after missing that critical field goal in the Super Bowl.
I saw "Shaun of the Dead" 10 years after Carrey's vehicle; that was another time when I laughed myself silly.
But that's part of Carrey's act, as the colorful gumshoe of the title, who takes on the case of retrieving the Miami Dolphins' prized mascot, Snowflake, after it's stolen from its tank one night.
We saw "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" right after "The Mask" came out.
Well anyway, Ace Ventura really is a master of disguise, and it's almost hard to believe that after almost ten years of stagnation in comedy, this movie came and changed the way that we think about humor.
Jim Carrey, in his first film starring role after achieving genuine stardom being the "token white guy" on TV's 'In Living Colour', plays the title character, who is hired by employees of the Miami Dolphins football team to locate and retrieve Snowflake the dolphin, the beloved mascot of the team.
He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed.
The main storyline is the touching relationship of the retarded giant Lennie, played by Lon Chaney, Junior, and his friend who travels and works with him, and looks after him like a zealously protective brother, played by the young Burgess Meredith.
Technical: The first time I realized that this was a low budget film was after I had watched it and heard the news from someone else.
The first couple times I saw them I wasn't sure exactly what was going on (Particularly the fight at the food line) but after I saw it a few more times, I finally figured it out.
So when Lennie throttles the trollopy Mae after caressing her hair, events play out in tragic fashion.
Of Mice And Men after the novel was adapted by Steinbeck into a play ran for 207 performances on Broadway in the 1936-37 season.
Kiefer also had that same quality after he came to his senses.
It's powerful because it's realistic; no stereotyped good guys or bad guys here (it's based on a true story, after all), and yet plenty of cruelty and some kindness, which leads to an exploration of themes such as justice and mercy in a way that (at last) doesn't lead to boredom or cynicism.
Anyways, after watching this sequel, I can happily tell everyone to steer right clear of it, because all it will do is depress you.
Not long after the TV series, they decided to make a straight to video sequel to the film, and they shouldn't have.
This is the ultimate story with the return of a button down spy like psycho stalking room to room armed with an armour lite semi welded staff pumping spell after spell into colleague and co-worker.
'Specially after the first one where he despised 'kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter' which is what he ends up doing.
And so, after that, all went back to normal.
This movie is nothing but a pilot for the cartoon that debuted shortly after the release of this video.
Agrabah is safe once again, with Abis Mal hanging on a tree after the end credits, saying, "Does this mean I don't get my third wish?"
There are much worst Disney sequels than this, made after this.
Less than five years after the English patient (though four, after speed 2) it is so sad to see a good actor acting badly in such a ridiculous film.
How come he didn't die after jumping off a building at least 5 stories high into an alley?
This movie is so flawed, so cheesy, and so boring I was shocked after I watched it.
As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts.
They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed.
Dafoe's character is Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent specializing in organized crime...Rocco plays an Italian Mafia package boy who is a close friend to the Irish brothers...the central theme of the film is the indifference of good men...Connor and Murphy are not indifferent, and after helping their friend, Doc, the two embark on a crusade to rid the streets of Boston of criminals...with the assistance of their comical and zany friend, Rocco...This film had positive elements on all sides...humor...a moral message...and incredible actors...you will no doubt find yourself repeating the many memorable quotes from the film...I am a woman, and not at all into your typical "shoot 'em up" guy films...this is not another one of those films...it has become an underground "cult" sensation...See it...you will not be disappointed!
This is a part that could have been played up, maybe even as an exploitation flick, but Freeman takes hold of it and creates his breakthrough film performance (it was shortly after this he got Lean on Me and Driving Miss Daisy).
Despite being a vicious and murderous pimp which is the exact opposite part, as the perpetual good guy, he's been playing since then Morgan Freeman's film career took off and never looked back after his chilling performance, as Leo Small/Fast Black, in "Street Smarts".
The only thing that didn't make any sense is why Fisher was still able to keep his job, after being exposed as a complete fraud, as a top news reporter on his top rated news show "Street Smart".
Freeman hasn't played a role like this before or since, and his best known roles to come after this (including Oscar nominated roles) have consisted of more positive characters with effective leadership skills.
Since we never see him in the inner city until after he submitted the story proposal, that occurrence remains unexplained also.
Reeve's image as a nice guy makes the character even creepier -- after all, he sleeps with a prostitute and exposes his wife to danger at a predominantly black bar.
Ringo Lam"s first Hong Kong film after his try in Hollywood is an impressive one.The plot itself has so many unexpected twists that you can watch it easily twice and still discover things you didn't see the first time.The good camerawork gives the movies atmosphere of tension,fear and the supernatural an extra boost.The cast has proven itself already in several other Hong Kong films and also here they deliver an excellent performance.This movie is a good start if you're not into Hong Kong films but want to give it a try,for the real fans it's a must see!
His lack of screen presence really started to tax my nerves after awhile.
In Mohab, after the execution, a store clerk gets killed and a young child is kidnapped.
So anyway, the dog face that 70's boy keeps flirting with has some psychic visions, the fat dude drinks some beer after the RV stops, then they all go wandering in the woods for some reason unbeknownst to me.
I've seen it cause even hardened veterans of the Bad Movie Wars to hit the Eject button screaming after the first twenty minutes.
You'd be a fool to go into a cheapo seventies Italian thriller expecting a thoroughly well thought out plot; but this one veers off course a bit too often, and it can become distracting after a while.
This contemporary Italian produced revenge thriller chronicles the last days of Ricco Aversi (Christopher Mitchum-the son of the legendary Robert Mitchum) after he gets out of prison where he served two years.
The uncut version shows a mafia soldier getting dumped naked into a tub of acid after the villains have cut off his genitals--yes, you see a super hairy cock & balls slashed off and then shoved in his mouth before they tumble him into the acid bath.
A young man named Ricco(Chris Mitchum)gets a year off his sentence after serving two years in prison, and quietly sets out to even a score against mafioso king Don Vito(Arthur Kennedy), the man responsible for murdering his mob boss father so that he could have control over the entire city.
The animation good, the music is great, the choice fo the story appropriate for a Christmas release (after all, Christmas is a CHRISTIAN holiday).
In one particular sequence, which clearly got edited back into the film after an initial censorship, we explicitly witness how a poor guy gets castrated for messing around with Don Vito's woman and subsequently gets thrown into the acid.
She's an arrogant waitress who yells at customers and he's a shy and introvert cook who's reluctant to drive her home after work.
Two restaurant employees - one an inadequate male and the other a vexed female - accidentally kill a flaky hitch-hiker after she, quite sexfully, smears cake on her naked breasts and self-mutilates in their backseat.
There is plenty of what the 'pinky violence' fans are after: cruel death scenes and constant sleaze.
Everyone with an eye to see this film will no doubt have heard about how brutal, violent and shocking it is; and after seeing it, I've got to say that Assault!
And I guess, that gets them hot, and an evening of sex ensues, after which there's some great desire to do all this again, with a different victim.
"Assault!Jack the Ripper" is certainly one of the nastiest pink films I have ever came across.It tells the story of a young waitress and a cook,who after incidentally killing a young woman on a street ends up sadistically raping and murdering women via stabbing them in the crotch.The scenes of rape and sexual violence are truly unsettling,but the film is well-made and acted.Yasuharu Hasebe directed a series of very extreme Nikkatsu pink movies including brutal "Rape!"
The twist on this one is that the oversexed gal is the one who encourages the limp-dicked guy's spree of pastry-knife-in-vagina stabbings after an accidental killing gets him excited enough in the sack to please her.
went straight for the jugular, or more appropriately, crotch...  Two restaurant co-workers realize their penchant for brutal rape and murder after a mishap with a whacked-out hitch-hiker.
Pinchot conveys how slimy he is so well that you want to shower after his scenes.
The Hitchcock also has a surprise ending concerning the star and his shower stabbing isn't so new, after all.
This is a notch or two above the usual "good guys vs bad guys" Western movie,being at its core about the need to bring about reconciliation after conflict ,in this instance the American Civil war .
Major Drango is appointed US military governor to a small Georgia community where tensions are running high after the defeat of the Confederacy .Drango himself participated in Sherman's march through the state and saw the devastation at first hand .Neither Drango or his men are welcomed in the community except by the small coterie of Union sympathisers  Opposition is lead by Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard ,in his first US Movie) the son of the local judge(Donald Crisp).The father -while in sympathy with the aims of his son -is less than impressed by the violent methods he employs.A confederate sympathiser is lynched and arson is also deployed as a terrorist weapon by the unregenerate Southerners.Drango -in addition to his professional problems -finds himself drawn to the daughter of the lynched sympathiser -winningly played by Joanne Dru  Chandler is a bit wooden in the title role -perhaps worn down by his production duties as his company produced the picture-but the rest of the acting is fine especially from John Lupton as an embittered Confederate Captain .The direction ,jointly undertaken by Hall Bartlett and Jules Bricken (who also scripted)is lumpen but the fluid and inventive monochrome photography by James Wong Howe is superb The movie is more intriguing than exciting but it is a striking and worthwhile movie with something interesting to say
The setting is Kinnesaw, Georgia, not long after the Civil War as malevolent feelings remain towards the North, with Major Clint Drango(Chandler)placed over the town, a type of military governing the citizens, but he desires for the people to start over, re-building their lives.
Anchored by the strong central performance of Jeff Chandler(..who I'm not familiar with, which is a shame really), I really liked the thought-provoking script from Hall Bartlett, and while it does seem a bit one-sided at times, I think the themes of bringing divided groups together after a war left scars never to be fully healed and the attempt to reconcile with those you have hurt by helping the community start over are powerful enough.
This film reveals a lot about the reconstruction era in the U. S. after the Civil War.
If you LIKE pain and want to see other Jerry Lewis monstrosities, see most of his flicks after his breakup with Dean Martin (particularly Slapstick of Another Kind) and avoid The King of Comedy (where Lewis did an excellent job playing it straight).
Cute at the beginning, but after the eleventh or twelfth time, it gets kind of annoying.
The movie fails to include one of the most important parts of the story, which is included in the Seder service for Passover, which Jews celebrate every year: after the Hebrew people were freed, and they are in the midst of their rejoicing, God basically yells at them and says "How can you be joyous when my children have died?"
Did any other wonder, after Connie drove to Michelle's home in the NM van she had stolen, why Michelle didn't (a) get the license plate number and (b) call the investigator who had been working her case????
In the early 1960's this one was remade with Doris Day & James Garner (after Marilyn Monroe died tragically during her filming of it).
(pause) Don't let ME get after you."
The animation is impeccable and the music (after a few listens/viewings) will stick with you for days on end.
Lawyer husband has wife declared dead after 7 years lost at sea and remarrys the day she returns after her rescue.
Here Dunne plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island.
Apparently, after so many years he is ready to have her declared legally dead and proceed with his new fiancÃ©e.
I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.
Bigamy is after all a crime.
Grant and Dunne are re-teamed here after their massive success with the quite marvellous The Awful Truth in 1937, and tho the role of Ellen was touted to Jean Arthur, it was Dunne who grasped the role and created sizzling comedy once again with the fabulous Grant.
It involves Cary Grant finding his wife, whom he thought was dead after a shipwreck, seven years after the incident alive and well.
What would you do if you declared your wife legally dead after seven years in order to marry another woman, and she came back?
Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Irene Dunne) has just returned after seven years to find that her husband Nick has married Bianca Bates (Gail Patrick).
He and Irene Dunne are superb in this film about a wife who "comes back from the dead" after seven years.
Ellen, lost at sea and presumed dead, returns after 7 years to find her husband Nick has remarried.
As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity.
Interestingly enough, Kanin took over the directing duties from Leo McCarey (an Oscar winner as Best Director for 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH, which also starred Grant and Dunne) after McCarey was injured in an automobile accident (McCarey also co-wrote the screenplay with Kanin and Sam and Bella Spewack).
After his shipwrecked wife is declared dead and he takes on a new wife, Grant's first wife resurfaces, rescued after seven years on an island.
This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island.
So he goes to court with Gail Patrick who he now intends to marry after getting the judge to declare Irene Dunne legally dead.
The Doris Day/James Garner remake "Move Over, Darling" is memorable in its own right and viewed right after this would make for a good video double-bill.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
Highlights include the character Jeremy, some drunken teenagers, Carl Schoenborn, and especially Hethe Henrickson as Beloch, a rival archaeologist (whose last name happens to be Henrickson), who is also the ultimate in ham villainy, who is after the Infinte Power, which will make him shoot rays like Emperor Palpatine.
What is not really understandable is why an action thriller has only sporadic, stilted action, a cliffhanger has no real cliffhangers and something designed to bring you back to the theater week after week only makes you want to hurry ahead to the comedy.
The classic era of porn came to an end sometime in the late 80s, and everything after was just crap.
Fortunately, one of the female leads, Kenia Brown, is stunning and athletic; unfortunately, she only appeared in one more film after this and then disappeared.
There are three main female characters in the film (Cinnamon, Felicia and Traci) who all get involved in bad situations but through innocent circumstances come together after they are sent to prison.
Darryl Zanuck's first release after the merging of his 20th Century co. and Fox studio, this features the boyish baritone, Lawrence Tibbett, in his prime.
First, it's Barber of Seville so we can hear Tibbett do "Largo al Factotum" - and Tibbett's is the version I was raised on; then after an angry fit, she decides to do Carmen - thus, we hear Tibbett do "The Toreador Song."
Finally, after hearing Virginia Bruce sing "Micaela's Aria," she decides to banish the company.
Gazes are what occurs with Nick and Betty that slowly leads to the affair that lifts Betty spirits after Nick coerces Joe into selling the business for a fishing business venture.
This movie had me thinking well after viewing it.
But strangely enough, I can only remember Joan Crawford after the end.
I don't think she ever played such a cruel character before or after this one.
Sadly, she was never again to be so sublimely bitchy and was ultimately fated to throwing rubber lizards at a monkey-man in "Trog" only fifteen years after "Queen Bee", in a drunken last performance.
This was after Joan did POSSESSED and proved she could both underplay and play full tilt.
I fell out laughing looking at the trailer after watching the movie.
But after seeing this otherwise well produced movie,I am determined to live as good a life as I can, if this is what Hell is like!
I've never known what it was like to be so attached to another world through a television show, much less what it was like to feel so empty after it was all said and done.
It is now Tuesday, roughly 36 hours after the show ended.
His career slowed down after WW II and he's best remembered now for his co-starring role in Some Like It Hot.
Family life is put to question and the problems that the children face after their parents split up.
We pick up Ryan a couple of years after "Patriot Games" where he is living happily after with his wife Cathy (Anne Archer) a successful doctor, and his two kids, Sally (Thora Birch) and a new son Jack Jr. (Alexander Lester).
Ryan thinks he's still after Colombian connections to the dead man's money.
Also to the character Jack Ryan getting thrown / Betrayed into a conspiracy to send troops to stop the drug trafficking and cartel, and then uncovers the truth, and wants nothing more then to get those troops out after they were sold out.
This movie is so boring that I turned it of after watching it for 45 minutes.
The movie couldn't get my attention so I turned it of after 45 minutes and that's sad because it has some fine actors in it Like: Ford, Dafoe, Anne Archer, Thora Birch and Hope Lange.
But when Moises is so arrogant as his brother Ramses,but one night, when he was walking alone at night after searching for a woman(Tzipporah) Miriam and Aaron met with him and are surprised to see their little brother so close.
Moises cannot believe that he is not royal and stays angry with Miriam, but stays in doubt after some while, and reading the walls of the pyramid, he discovers the true: that he has Jew blood and was adopted.
I've read many of Clancy's books, and many are very good (well, the early Ryan series are great but after Debt of Honor they went downhill!
There was a time, after the excellent opening, that I was leaning more towards putting this film in the interesting, but deeply flawed category Rottweiler and Faust are in, but ultimately for me the good far outweighed the bad.
40 years later, after the mayor's death, Mordecai threatens a grand return.
Mordecai needs Clara's submission while also awaiting the collapse of the poorly structured dam, built hastily 40 years prior, giving way to a massive crack running down it.Standing in Mordecai's way are Clara's mother, Teresa(Raquel MeroÃ±o), a would-be reporter returning home after a stint in London, and a recently arrived photo-journalist, Dan Quarry(Michael McKell) who is haunted by the death of his son.
I think a history lesson told to Teresa and Dan by a survivor from the past, Luis(Manuel ManquiÃ±a)who saw his childhood pal Teo murdered after releasing Mordecai from his roped hands, helps the viewer out somewhat, but Yuzna's been around long enough that he ought to be able to use such an interesting premise(..an underwater village housing an evil presence which rises to terrorize)and make a better film than what we wind up getting on screen.
Well, after watching it.
Has Yuzna hit rock bottom after the dreadful "Rottweiler" and incredibly bland "Beneath Still Waters"?
but after watching 'Beneath Still Waters', all was quickly forgiven!
They find some strange goings-on at a church building, and -- spoiler-- one of them gets killed after freeing someone who's been bound.
The mayor of the town wants to use the 40th anniversary as a means to attract tourists, and sets a celebratory party for a few days after the action opens.
There after it gets worse for every minute.
well i just end up seeing this 3 part of the eye franchise.i start liking this pang brothers and i get some of theme earlier movies,the eye was really surprising me for the power of scaring you and after giving you chill-out feeling.but the eye 10 make me disappointed but be cause of the willing to get scared.it was making sense until it start turning to looks like scary movie ,so if you like parodies this is your movie and if you wanna scare your self try french HIGH TENSION.i hope so they will go back to were they start , with the next movie.but don't call it the eye don't know witch number.give it other name so don't make the first eye be refused by those who never seen it.i give 3 of 10 for the break dance and for the good looking girls.make me remind me of the 80'is.
The book mentions that there are 10 ways too see ghosts so the 5 people venture off to see these ghosts then one day after they played about 3-4 of them there friend disappears when playing one of the games.
I was unsure about whether it would be any good after reading some of the negative reviews, but ended up disagreeing with them.
I have witnessed the genius of Lawrence of Arabia, the majesty of Star Wars, the pupil-dilating battles of Braveheart, but after all that war, I realize that The Prince of Egypt is a little more special than all of them.
I did love this one developed sub-plot regarding a dead girl who had no idea she was deceased, discovering this only after finding her corpse video-recorded at a crime scene thanks to Teddy's morbid voyeurism;she even tries to stop the camcorder with her hand going through the object.
It's set in Thailand after the foursome went for a holiday trip to Genting Highlands.
Overall this movie was a complete toss fest and should be watched by anyone who loves action movies that are never suppose to have been made..................................I needed an exorcism after this movie
Review after review will tell you this guy is a great performer.
But this little gem is one that has stayed with me after all these years.
Yet after watchng this film I'm now absolutely convinced that even "formulaic" and "predictable" films can be great, provided that they're executed properly and with heart, as it was with this film.
(After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.)
A sound effects engineer, Hiroshi TÃ´yama(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances.
The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing Sadako, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer's snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images).
We see how the reporter finds Sadako, understanding her past(..including Sadako's relationship to a psychiatrist named Ikuma, portrayed by Daisuke Ban, who had disappeared after being excommunicated by his colleagues and peers), with designs on destroying her life.
The casting was well done, and the scenes, especially that after the death of his grandfather, brought even the hardest audience member to an emotional breaking point.
I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.
Another part of the movie made me realize that we (the not normal people), are braver than those who have it all because we have to face adversity ("Superman is not brave because he is invincible... you're not...")  The music is excellent (most of it by Green Day), especially after his grand-father's death in the park.
conveniently) acquires psychic powers and ensues to spend most of the film chasing after Yochi for no apparent reason.
We find out what happens to Asakawa after Ryuji's death, we find out what happens to Yoichi, etbloodycetera.
Reiko Asawaka has taken her son Yoichi into hiding after saving herself and her son from the videotape and Sadako's curse.
"Ring 2" is high quality horror filmmaking, including excellent music, a couple of nasty shocks (used sparingly, making them all the more effective) and some really frightening images which stay in your mind long after the film is over.
Another thing that disappoints, after the masterpiece that was "Ring", is that it lacks any one big scare or standout sequence to match the first film's finale or most memorable moments.
The fear and utter dread continues with part 2 of the Ringu trilogy, set 1 week after the events of the first film.
kills his wife on a cemetery, in his real live (just a few years after the movie) he was stabbed to death by his second wife, on Christmas' Eve.
An adaptation of a KÃ´ji Suzuki novel, 'Ring' had a breakneck pace because of its "race-against-time" plotting, and 'Ring 2' picks up from this by beginning just days after the events of the first film, allowing the audience to observe the aftermath of the terror that Sadako and her tape wreaked on so many people.
The movie opens a week after the first one ends.
In fact, the filmmakers have realized that Sadako has become so commonplace (a Sadako doppleganger appears in almost every Japanese horror movie made after the first Ring) that they need only show her trademark hair to invoke fear.
Taking place immediately after the events of Ringu (1998), Ringu 2 features Mai Takano (Miki Nakatani) continuing the investigation into the events of Ringu.
At the beginning of the film, Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) and Yoichi Asakawa (Katsumi Muramatsu) are still in "hiding"/"on the run" after their ordeals in Ringu.
You may also wish to watch Ringu 0: Basudei (2000) before Ringu, and for fun, the original "Ring 2", Rasen/Spiral (1998) before or after this "replacement sequel" (this one was produced when audiences were dissatisfied with the very differently toned Rasen/Spiral).
The counselor shows them this device, something about psychological distance, that I still can't understand after watching it twice.
Luckily I am a huge fan of Altman as somehow his film 'Short Cuts' 1993, is mentioned in the promo for this film and my immediate thought after seeing the film was 'can I ever watch Short Cuts again without thinking of this crappy film.'
My girlfriend and I decided to see $9.99 after reading a large write up in the NY Times.
In fact, it was so good that I began watching it after 1am and had planned on only seeing the first 10-15 minutes before bed.
As a spoiler, I think it would have been a riot if, after what we see in the film, Walter ended up with the widow next door.
TCM showed this movie immediately after Craig's Wife (this movie is a remake of that one) and I loved comparing the two versions of the same story.
It was exactly a quarter of a century after George Kelly's Craig's Wife opened on Broadway that Joan Crawford followed Rosalind Russell - who had starred in the first film version - into the role of the eponymous Mrs Craig.
), the housekeeper, for not remembering to close the drapes after 11:00 every morning.
But, in the closing shot, when Crawford regally ascends her curved staircase alone among the splendor of her possessions, you wonder who's really won after all.
And after that, the actual killer: just didn't fit in the rest of the scenario of this Johnny, nor did it fit in the entire film.
Anyway, years after watching that...movie, I began to wonder how Ferarra is so known among film fans.
I've heard some people to call 80s 'The Golden Era' and now after I saw this again after so many years I realized why.
I saw it so many times after that and I was enjoying it each time while I was watching it.
Normally I find comedies not worth watching twice, but Innerspace still made me laugh - even after all this time!!
Comic genius Martin Short really makes this movie his own with some outrageous antics (not unlike Jerry Lewis) that carry scene after scene, hilariously.
So the rest of the film is the group that attacked the scientist coming after Short while Quaid tries to figure out a way to get big again.
But just after Tuck has been shrunk, a group of Silicon Valley industrial spies break into the lab, and steal one of the microchips necessary to reverse the miniaturisation process.
But terrorists are after this scientific breakthrough and by various hijinks he winds up being injected into the butt of a nervous grocery clerk, played by Martin Short.
One of them has buried a bunch of diamonds in the swamps, so they go after it.
The woman in this film (after having cut the legs off their jeans) roll around in mud, water, and dirt, often times going from one to the other in the same scene.
I'm not racist, but why the hell are blacks and whites mixing with each other in a bar in 1866, in Texas, a year after the civil war!?!
Though after the one girl was killed by an alligator her boyfriend didn't seem all that upset.
I couldn't go any further after seeing the "wooden" teller counter in the bank bow under the weight of "Linc".
I couldn't stop laughing after that.
And airing the show after Desperate Housewives was smart; while I am sure that some DH fans will not like Cashmere Mafia, I would imagine that fans of Cashmere Mafia will be viewers of DH.
after the airing of only the pilot), I think the show has the potential to capture the chick-flick audience- provided the plots of future episodes are original rather than predictable rewrites of other women-taking-charge shows.
By the early 60s, the Mexican film industry was beginning its slow but constant decline after the Golden Age ended.
The local workers start bricking themselves & refuse to enter the mine due to ancient legends about the 'Devil's Hand', soon after while in the mine together on they're own Mark & Jennifer stumble across a room with the glove shaped casket in it & Mark decides to take it.
A very good film for Warren William to end his Lone Wolf career on; after a break Eric Blore soldiered on as valet for a few more films.
William only made a few more films after this before he died of cancer in 1948, which makes Blore's hopeless look at the camera at the end with "Here we go again!"
Subjected to physical torture and abuse, Shu is forced to become a soldier and observe one horrifying atrocity of war after another.
The melancholy musical score is very fitting, although not necessarily one that will be remembered long after the show's over.
Similarly, the baddies can fire machine gun rounds after rounds at the good guys without a single hit while the good guys need one single shot to dispose of entire armies.
In the end, after a lot of dim-witted, extremely unbelievable action scenes and other crap, you see Hulk Hogan and his moron crew (one character is called Andy Powers btw, djeezes), walking side by side, way too cool, with in the background a big explosion.
There is some satire of bourgeois values; Milt, after telling Harry how happy he is and how he has it all, takes Harry to his home for dinner--the home is in some hellish suburban subdivision and upon seeing what 'having it all' means, Harry promptly tries to kill himself again.
It looked like this film was made and released way too late long after the genre's heydays.
This movie was so awful that it inspired me to sign into IMDb after not doing so for a couple of years.
This time Long John sets out to save young Jim Hawkins (played by Kit Taylor who sadly doesn't possess the memorable screen presence that his predecessor Bobby Driscoll put into the role) from a cutthroat pirate named "El Toro" Mendoza (Lloyd Berrell) but also added into the mix are a slightly more memorable crew of pirates following after Long John's lead and Long John's frequently comedic interactions with his main squeeze Purity Pinker (Connie Gilchrist), who has her eyes firmly set on marriage and settling down the old sea Captain.
My favorite is one guy who thought that after he started attacking religion that his routine went down hill and why?
The majority of the material seems to be centered around subjects like death, dying, suicide, murder, and other cheery topics, yet, as always when watching George, I found myself laughing my ass off and agreeing with everything he says because after all these years of pushing the comedic envelope, one constant that has never changed with George is that everything he says is absolutely correct.
Not one to be particularly impressed by the vast majority of so-called "great" things, it took me a while after my first viewing of Life Is Worth Losing to absorb what I had seen and several repeated viewings shortly thereafter to understand I was witnessing a truly great comedian, a genius, THE master of his craft.
It is a masterpiece of comic genius that you will want to add to your library and watch again and again; especially after one of those too frequently increasing moments of realizing the dumbing-down of your fellow countrymen and women is an alarming reality.
I'm just not sure after seeing this right off the bat that it's him at his total best, it's almost as if he's in a transition now into a totally new part of his career.
I was moved to tears more than once and after viewing it you can say that she lived so many lives, and empowered people of all races and creeds to do the same.
While there are a few misfires (such as the patriotic image of the British flag after an Englishman's heroic death), it is all-in-all a fabulous picture, a rugged tale of friendship, durability, disappointment and resignation.
I don't want to give away too much, but you will never want to drink a beer again after the terrifying bee-in-the-beer segment that kills off a farmer!
This movie came out one year after Stagecoach, which made Wayne a star but he didn't become a big star until Red River eight years later.
He was falsely accused after Drisk reads the letters he received and realizes he was wrong the entire time.
Soon after a storm hits and kills Yank, an air attack takes the life of Smitty.
His drunk shipmates pulled him off the ship before it left, but again one man was left out of their crew after he was knocked unconscious.
In The Grapes of Wrath the story is much more coherent, having been made after a novel not after a series of plays (even if splendidly adapted by Dudley Nichols).
Straightforward acting by John Wayne as a Swedish sailor named Ole , he was to star habitually for Ford after the director rose his career from B Western in Poverty Row productions, with his greatest hit, 'Stagecoach'.
Wayne, however, is effective despite his dodgy accent, and it's interesting to see him in a film, just a year after his breakthrough in "Stagecoach," where he is presented to us as one of the gang, something of a follower and not a lone-wolf leader.
Though after 20 years much was wrong, some thing did come true.
If the court ruling is in favor of the guilty party, he goes after them individually.
Cynthia Rothrock plays a cop who's after him for the murder of one of the guilty parties that was let go by the courts.
She's off to see her father get married and after doing so, sets off on her own way; much to the dismay of her father.
In dire need of a more serious tone after the humorous but somewhat inconsistent Shore Leave, Star Trek returns to its tradition of tackling deeper themes from a sci-fi point of view, focusing in particular on Spock's interactions with the rest of the Enterprise crew.
Soon after, the small ship is pulled off course and forced to land on a rocky, barren world inhabited by giant, aggressive humanoids.
But the denouement is even worse: after a tension-filled, engrossing near-hour of drama, they wrap it up with a lame humor scene where the ship's captain publicly embarrasses the guy who just pulled his comrades through a horrible experience.
In this film, a town is attacked by deadly killer bees after a truck accident caused them to be released.
I'd be surprised if Spock didn't bring up charges back on the Enterprise - after he explained his lapse into illogic towards the end of the mission (cue: bridge crew laughing away all the built-up tension during this episode; above all, Starfleet needs happy bridge crews).
It had completely what made it the standard to measure any other similar work : good characters, fresh atmosphere, touching moments, big production, great writing, sensitive cinematography, genius music, top notch acting, cinematic direction, and memorable 164 episodes that were never bad and just perfect all the way.. (Maybe one concerning Higgins's twin, and few else but HEY, they're humans after all).
The second one was after I've studied cinema and writing scripts, that when I discovered how this show had it all, so every episode of the reruns was such a lesson about how to make a classic work and a great amount of entertainment too.
If only every show has something from it, we would have better ones that can last after watching in our sentiment as well as our brain.
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
Anyway, after Magnum P.I.
ended after season eight, I did not faithfully follow any TV show every week until "The Shield" premiered on FX!
The shows hold up pretty well even after all these years.
This guy Selleck was too good looking in an old Hollywood way (Clark Gable), his voice seemed an octave too high for a man of his size and looks, so damn many women were positively orgasmic when they talked about him and women are notorious for going after some really shallow males, and the few times I caught a scene or two flipping through channels, he seemed smug, or at least that's how I perceived him.
Not long after moving in some of the local village people fall victims to her, the film includes quite a bit of female nudity, lesbianisam, and lesbian sex.
He lent them a Cheyenne-style war shirt for the film, and other small items and gave some suggestions - we never heard back from the film people after they returned the shirt, so we always wondered what had happened to it.
To me they should be regarded as the "super-race" for the sheer fact that they, along with the Buffalo, after being not only marginalized, tokenized, robbed, and yes, decimated almost to literal extinction (remember, even the kids and babies were shot by the U.S. army), they, into the new millennium are still here and their numbers have increased (as of the year 2000 there are about 2 and 1/2 million Native Americans alive today).
It certainly made me laugh, as well as cry, especially the end after Shane arrives at the Pow-Wow in Alberqueque & sees in the people there, some of the elements of the people in the stories that he was told by his grandfather before he died on the way, then watching him beat the drum to start the storytelling and remembering what he was like at the beginning rebelling against everyone & everything.
The car breaks down after only 4 miles and he wants his money back.
I bought it straight away after renting and have watched it at least 5 times all with different people to show them one of the best films EVER MADE.
Her portrayal of the autistic Charlie is not only imaginatively accurate but catches your sympathy and imbeds itself into your very own psyche, making it more harder to forget even after the film.
And after watching this movie it does make me see what my cousin is going through.
Which means Charlie is called on to help Dad around the house a bit more and with looking after Thomas.
Tough army NCO Dad holds conversations with his teddy bear and the two brothers wind up on stage together as dancing monkeys after Charlie's original partner throws a tantrum.
With a title like 13 EROTIC GHOSTS I was under no illusion what sort of film I'd be watching - A rather threadbare plot revolves around a bunch of supernatural investigators finding out about ghostly happenings after a girls school is struck by lightening and burns down in a special effects sequence that wouldn't look out of place in the cheapest DOCTOR WHO production   As you can imagine this threadbare plot is just an excuse to show some lesbian love action and despite the sex scenes not being up to the erotic standard of ALLYSON IS WATCHING the sex scenes are fairly good for this type of genre though to be overly critical there's maybe not enough boy on girl action   13 EROTIC GHOSTS doesn't take itself too seriously and does contain this memorable exchange :   " You know she reminds me of my old Co in 'Nam .
Set against the backdrop of preset-day India, three brothers try to piece their lives back together after the shocking death of their father.
Their human costars were at their best after they were dead.
The direction and editing make you feel like you're on the trip with the brothers Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) Whitman, who, in their own clumsy way, try to find some meaning in their lives after the death of their father.
The Whitman brothers reunite after a year of estrangement on a train in India of all places.
on the trip and intent on staying on schedule, all the while it's all a plan for the three of them to reunite with their mother who abandoned them after their father died (not even attending the funeral) to be some nun in a quasi church/ashram/temple/somethingorother.
Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7 Â½ months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train).
Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an "Indian giver" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier.
'Hotel Chevalier' is a bridge into the full-length film, and was also a way for Schwartzman to readjust to working with Anderson as an actor after the long interlude since 'Rushmore.'
The movie begins with Bill Murray (Steve Zissou in Anderson's last outing) who runs after the train and misses it.
It wasn't until after watching this that I suddenly realised something - That movies featuring bees on the rampage are totally self limiting in concept and structure .
The audience are always one step ahead of the authority figure so know fine well how the victim died ( Usually by a camera being thrown in their face or something resembling bees superimposed over the camera lens ) so in order for the plot to go somewhere the running time is taken up with the authority figure meeting a beautiful doctor/scientist/vet so we get a romantic subplot , then about 2/3rds of the way through the movie after the authority figure has consumated the relationship it's then he realises people have been getting killed by cameras being thrust in their face/ rather poor animation and then races to save the local population against superimposed bees   There you go , another by the numbers thriller with deadly bees .
All in all, the acting is terrible, the plot is awful and the best special effect in the whole movie is the farmer's decomposing body after he swallows a bee in his beer.
The classic screwball comedy of a type never seen before in French cinema (and, possibly, never after).
This is, after all, a review.
Even after getting it still leads to one vary stereo typical ending for a stereo typical horror movie.
[This was the] "first time I thought editing could be a fun part of the whole process," he remarked after the screening, and it shows.
The fact that this director was given several movies to direct after this, each more offensive than the next, is disturbing.
I really hated the ending of this movie and thought it was complete B.S  That and if Dracula's face changes after every regeneration (im guessing every time he's roasted,toasted, and burnt to a crisp .. then WHERE the heck did this guy come from?
I spent an hour or two, after finishing the movie, going through the awesome bonus features included on the DVD version like their Trivia Intelligence Test (TIT) where they flash you clips of boobies every time you answer a question correctly!
I haven't seen any other movies made by Troma, but after seeing this one (as well as the clips included in the bonus material) I will more than likely rent/buy more of them.
This series should have ended after the second movie, it did not bring any closure for me.
Oh my god... And how did Dracula suddenly get so old after a couple of years?
Then I rented the DVD moments after my store removed it from the distrubtor's packing.
I asked Joe Bologna after a recent stage performance why this film was not on video and his response was, "You'll have to ask 20th Century F0X."
My companion and I agreed that there was no reason to stay after Made For Each Other.
Words can't describe my feelings after I saw the story of Elephant Man - I cried almost the whole movie.
Finally after watching Marauding Mothers, Diabolical Daddies, Wicked Sisters, Jonesin' Uncles and Perverted Twins, I arrived at Rabid Grannies.
The film depicts Victorian society as a benevolent sanctuary for a man, who while given the props to model himself after the normality he aspires to, is never deceived into thinking he can achieve it beyond his imagination.
I just watched this movie last night and i must say... it touched me in a way no other movie has... some of the scenes even brought me to tears, which has never happened to me before.... John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....  but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time "I pray to god that he's an idiot", sadly, he is everything but that...  10/10, no question
An incident involving a black man who is holed up in a shack with his native American woman escalates after the man is killed by the town constable, a Mexican who had served in the US Cavalry chasing Apaches.
Thus opens the film and sets the stage for the story of Valdez, the constable, who after killing the innocent man tries to set up a collection for his woman and runs into violent reaction from the wealthy, racist white rancher who wanted the man killed in the first place, and who runs roughshod over his own men, the Mexicans who hired out to him.
At first, this made me groan, but after a short time I realized that he did a pretty good job with the accent and there are many light-skinned Mexicans, so it wasn't too hard to believe this.
RL, in his only moment of kindness in the film, releases Valdez from his ropes after an incident when Bob tried to break the wood roped to his arms.
Also of special note is Barton Heyman, who plays the world-wise Segundo, who quickly realizes that they are not after any ordinary man, and provides a great surprise ending.
The ways in which the film deals with the thought-provoking concept of changing the past, while certainly blasphemous to the field of physics, sparks some interesting conversation after the credits.
I must admit that I am not particularly drawn to action movies, but after seeing Frequency I have tried to change my attitude.
This is Quaid's best after his early bloom and nothing he's done since can compare with it.
It teaches love and does so without relying on the tension of plot because as I discovered, it still works after ten viewings when the end is not in doubt and "what happens next" isn't why your eyes are fixed on the screen.
it shows the life after two spoiled sisters are forced to work at their dad's dairy after Courtney throws a towel on a flame and starts a fire.
This movie is cute!It can also teach other rich spoilt children a lesson!Much thought was put in this movie!The movie started by showing the Callum sisters' lavish and luxurious lifestyle,how they only are concerned about their health,their appearance and mostly about what they can do to make themselves happy.Their father,the owner of a very successful dairy operation,was very disappointed with his daughters but decided to let it go.However,after Taylor and Courtney ruined their house kitchen the father decided to teach them a lesson,they got to work at his factory!When their father goes for a vacation,the company was in big trouble.THe company account was empty,not even a single cent!So,it is up to the Callum sisters to set things right but Courtney has a party to prepare and the sisters have to give up their lavish lifestyles to save the company.The Callum sisters face many problems in the process,like conflicts between themselves and Taylor had to sell her classic stickshift!How do they resolve this problem??
i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely wasn't it.
I was hoping for a lot better after seeing "High School Musical".
everyone was talking about the fact that it was a simple life rip off and i didn't really know if i should side with that or not, but after seeing it i have found its nothing at all like the t.v.
The fact that I didn't fall a sleep watching this movie after a hard days work, proofs it's not that bad at all & it's really worth watching.
Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when in pursuit of someone we lust after.
Eddie Albert's, Jeannie Berlin's and Cybill Shepherd's facial expressions are priceless as they listen to Lenny's plans to claim Kelly after remedying his current "complication".
I've never been quite sure about the final scene of this movie: Lenny on the couch, quietly humming to himself, seemingly at a loss as the camera lingers on him for a thoughtful moment, is he already on his way to becoming dissatisfied again now that he has attained his desire or has he finally found some peace after his battle for Kelly?
Supposedly the 1980's ushered in the "me" generation, but after watching this film, one has to wonder if it didn't begin earlier.
Lenny, the character played by Grodin, is the almost stereo-typical young angst-filled Jewish male, desperate to break out from the box of tradition which was preordained for him, and who rubbishes his very Jewish bride on their honeymoon to lust after a very Gentile blond, Cybil Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran, all as a part of that angst condition.
Shortly after an oddly quiet young woman, Sadako Yamamura (Yukie Nakama), joins a drama troupe, strange events, including deaths with suspicious circumstances, start occurring.
We finally unravel much of the mystery behind Sadako (although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered), and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film, which otherwise can seem cryptic (it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over--I enjoyed it more the second time).
Watching it, I did get a little bored after about 30 minutes, but then I did a gear change and accepted it for what it was - a low budget, romp through Auckland, with some cheesy action and acting.
Just too bad he didn't come up with anything like this after.
The jolly romp is all made up on the spur of the moment and after an hour or so, they're so darn tuckered out from all the tussling and screaming and pointlessness of it all, so they simply...stop.
The movie has it's moments but all and all, after I watched it I could understand why it was only released in DVD.
It really made me go through so many emotions while watching, I laughed, I almost cried (which is a hard feat to conquer in and of itself), and I left with that warm and fuzzy feeling, and wanting to see it again right after.
The film wraps up in that typical Hollywood way, in terms of most everyone seeming to live happily ever after.
I do have to wonder, though, if Priestly has lived happily ever after...
The dialogs that should be spoken by young people today sound like my grandmother wrote them after reading a girl magazine.
after 90 minutes of bugging the viewer how unimportant looks are the only slightly likable character changes his whole dressing and hair style to get the "hot chick" of the store, that seemed to be his friend already for years!
I would have switched this movie off after 10 mins and clocked it up to mass market rubbish, but I persisted with this one in an effort to see what all the hype was about.
It's basically a nice sweet movie and you won't feel you've wasted an hour or two but the scenery of the Emerald Isle will linger on long after seeing this movie.
This film held my interest from beginning to the very end with Joseph Fiennes, (Stephen) leaving a prison after serving a sentence of murdering a man and has been given a job at a dinner with some very strange people running the establishment.
He's just about to enjoy his first sip of a Paradise Cocktail when he spills most of it -- after being bumped by Kay Francis, who smiles brightly despite having an incurable disease.
While Aline MacMahon and Warren Hymer are strong, 'One Way Passage' truly belongs to Powell and Francis, and to a love than persists long after its participants have moved on to other worlds.
Often, only three to five years after the original film was made, the same studio would remake the film--and rarely were the two versions that different--just the cast.
Right after meeting the lovely Joan Ames in a bar, escaped murderer Dan Hardesty is caught by Sgt.
William Powell would hit his stride a few years after this film in The Thin Man.
Sadly, after this and "Jewel Robbery", Powell and Francis were never paired again; Powell went onto MGM where better things awaited him, while Francis remained at Warners for many similar films, none of which could surpass the charm of this film.
On one level Satryicon comments on the youth of the late 1960s, the unanchored hippies wondering from place to place without a "moral compass" -- one hedonistic adventure after another in a satiated and decadent world.
If, while watching Satyricon you find yourself wandering whether it is going to wrap up finally into an understandable conclusion after which you can satisfactorily murmur `ahh yes, now I got it'.
Sextus Petronius, by all accounts the Emperor's minister of good taste, or arbiter elegantium, not only wrote a number of short poems and epigrams, but also committed suicide after being implicated in a plot against Nero.
If, while watching Satyricon you find yourself wandering whether it is going to wrap up finally into an understandable conclusion after which you can satisfactorily murmur `ahh yes, now I got it'.
In fact you are so intent on the back drop, it only hits you after the film is over that it was about (mostly) homosexuality.
Fellini notoriously called Giulietta Masina's titular character in Notti di Cabiria after the 1913 movie "Cabiria" by Giovanni Pastrone, a grand production with a visual flair not so dissimilar to Satyricon.
Later when Eumolpo and Encolpio recline in the open field encased in an early morning mist, the elderly poet bequeaths to Encolpio a series of "natural" phenomena; among them mountains, rivers, clouds, love, tears, joy, sound, song and the voices of man...  During the "Matron of Ephesus" scene, a young woman mourning her deceased husband by starving to death in a cave has her chalk white face returned to its natural radiance after accepting the embrace of a handsome soldier.
Later, Encolpio and Ascilto arrive at the couple's elegant home and enjoy a night of revelry during which Encolpio quotes the "poet" as having said "...as for me I have always lived to enjoy the present moment as if it were the last sunrise..."  The tale of the beautiful Enotea and her subsequent punishment after she tricked the wizard who had professed his love for her seems to be a warning to remain "true" to expressions of affection.
Following what appears to be his final corruption after having abandoned his idealistic philosophy, Eumolpo proposes an interesting last will and testament.
In addition, a momentary glimpse of supernatural visionary lights appear during the abduction of the "mystical" hermaphrodite who subsequently dies after having been exposed to the "light" of day.
My brother called my right after the game hysterical and mumbled something about making 'THE BIG TALL WISH'.
Beginning with Button's friendship early on when he befriends a little female Daisy(wonderful performance from Cate Blanchett)and many years later as Benjamin starts to gain his youth he once again meets up with Daisy along the way after she's became a successful ballet dancer and the two will develop a passionate romance and love story that anyone would dream of it was just so true and simple.
Sure, these two have probably given better performances elsewhere, but here they have been given roles for which they might be best remembered long after their star-power has dimmed.
The premise of the film is so provocative, that I had real hope after the first hour that we were going into uncharted narrative waters.
Although it borrows memorable elements from Titanic (narration by an older character reminiscing on the past) and Forrest Gump (a hummingbird replaces the CG feather, and Cate Blanchett's Daisy mirrors Robin Wright's Jenny, most noticeably in her acceptance of Button only after numerous experimentations in love), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button doesn't suffer from unoriginality.
Now throw in clichÃ© after clichÃ© (crazy sea captain, dancer struck down ridiculously in her prime, lovers buying a love nest and painting the walls...) and you end up feeling like you have gone on a ride, but it didn't make you feel any differently than when you got on.
And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.
I had high expectations for it, and they were way surpassed (fact: after "Se7en", "Fight Club" and this, nobody will deny David Fincher and Brad Pitt make great films together).
When he re-unites with childhood friend "Daisy" (Cate Blanchett) and becomes her lover, the film bogs down in a few spots but few people are going to stop watching after investing two hours.
When trying to find the point to this whole story, all it comes down to is that we should look after those close to us and take more care of them.
Especially that of Cate Blanchett who seems to be turning out one great performance after another.
The episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to remember whether Tilda Swinton's character showed up before or after Benjamin went to war, but it doesn't even matter.
There is almost no conflict, just boring scene after boring scene.
If this movie made any effort to be realistic at all, Mr. Button would have feigned joy at the baby's birth and then dumped the baby after everyone had left.
What ensues after developing his bizarre nature, however, is the true core of this absolutely spellbinding masterpiece.
Do not, I repeat, do not tolerate the comparisons to Forrest Gump - a film filled with history, humor!, star-studded cast, a solid script, jam packed with history, one clever gimmick after the other and brilliant effects.
Y'just don't care about him at all... to be honest, the whole film struck me as a giant, drawn-out metaphor for a midlife crisis: a man pines after a girl who's not ready for him for years and years, then when she finally takes him into her bed, they spend a glorious year between the sheets, and as soon as responsibility shows up in the form of a child, he runs away from commitment, blaming his condition.
In such a situation, when you have to wait for someone, the last thing you want to do is fool around after waiting.
I felt very tired after watching this picture.
some comments were that it started a little slow but after a third of the movie you got hooked and it only got better!
The decide to follow through a secondary road, and while fueling their car in "Sam's Last Chance" gas station, they are advised by the owner and attendant Sam (Richard Farnsworth) to not sleep after the second tree in the road.
What kind of sense of humor doesn't think "Take no prisoners" wasn't funny when the gals are "going after It."
Tim gets invited to Jenifer's room and after hellos she, lying on the bed in a loose robe says, "Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?"
So after you get over how massively influential and incredibly cool this movie was and is, you might feel a little hollow from the relentless nature of the violence.
It wasn't quite as bad as Natural Born Killers in this respect, but I still felt slightly queasy after two hours.
I'm alone, 1000's of miles from home, very tired after the long flight.
When Leung is forced to kill his surrogate father after Chow's spectacular warehouse ambush, we can only marvel at Leung's performance as he conveys his inner turmoil.
The sheer volume of gunfire does become wallpaper after a while, but fans of hardcore action will not be disappointed.
Excellent actor Chow Yun-Fat plays Tequila, a cop who is determined to crush the biggest syndicate in Hong-Kong, after his partner and friend was killed in a shoot-out at a teahouse.
It's a fine line that Woo treads successfully time after time in an arena in which many other `action' directors have foundered.
Director John Woo has a powerful and explosive style that will leave you breathless after watching this extremely violent action flick.The camera is everywhere flying from place to place.And there are people everywhere.All of them firing a gun or two.I have never seen such energy before.The violence in "Hardboiled" is very brutal and well directed.The last half hour of this film,which take place in the hospital is full of inventive action sequences.Chow Yun-Fat is really good as a tough policeman and it's also very nice to see Anthony Wong("Bunman:Human Meat Pies","Dr Lamb","Bullet in the Head")-what a great performance!I like Hong Kong-action films by John Woo.Anyway, if you're tired of Hollywood's action trash,then this one is a must-see.Recommended!
Those familiar with the Ring films will know that Sadako 'killed' a mocking reporter at her mother's para-psychological demonstration after he accused the psychic of being a fraud.
This has been the third best cast I have heard in a game after Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father and The Curse of Monkey Island, two of the greatest games ever made.
Release was withdrawn from circulation for the Dallas magnicide(1963) because the events are pretty similar.Frank Sinatra(JFK's friend) as producer ordered the retaining copies and the movie was forgotten,however long time after was issued in video market and obtained many success.
Fortunately, a big twist occurs late in the movie which saves Buster from going into the ring, although the little man does save his honor after he fights the real "Battling Butler."
This sequence in the wilds contains all of the best gags: wildfowl all around but unobserved by our hero; the duck who keeps ducking under the boat when Buster is trying to get organized to shoot it; the dinner table slowly sinking in the mud; the heroine walking a lost Buster back to his camp after he has gallantly walked her home.
I've changed my mind: I'll give it a 9 after all, and say I'm dropping a mark down instead from a 10!
Then he encounters the real "Battling" Butler, and after a misunderstanding involving the boxer's wife, "Battling" tells Alfred that HE can fight the title bout with the "Alabama Murderer"Âor he'll blow his cover.
The Stones, after an incredible run of great albums, Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Streeet, tour America in 1972.
It did seem heavy handed and forced after a while, and I remember how a 1957 TV Western broached the subject much more effectively without getting in your face.
Right after Carney and the Sheriff were shot, the Benson's and Shaw were left unsupervised in another room just a bit too long to be credible.
The topper for me though was when Pidge fired the errant shot and threw the gun across the room, and Johnny Baron didn't bother to worry about who might go after it.
I noticed one reviewer questioned why Sinatra made this film after his success (and an Oscar) in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, but I thought it was a wonderful showcase for his talents--giving him a chance to act without all the props and distractions you'd find in most films.
Instead of smoothly starting a line after someone is done the actors just stand there and wait for about 3 seconds before speaking.
Robert Mitchum is pursued by one tragedy after another, and he seems to be hopeless and cannot understand the reason of it all.
Yet as years go by, Jed's restlessness and constant sense that the shadowy figures from the recesses of his mind are doggedly reaching after him slowly begin to consume their relationship.
Mitchum's character is raised from a child by Judith Anderson after a night of murder and mayhem at his shotgun shack, leaving him an orphan.
There's a touch of quasi-incest when a deeply disturbed Teresa Wright and an equally deranged Robert Mitchum pledge their love only to have it turned on its head when Mitchum shoots her brother in self defense after he returns from active duty, having lost the toss of a coin, an earlier version of the draft ballot.
The story is sporadic and doesn't have any drive -- it didn't make me want to keep watching after I was well into it.
I was truly disappointed after reading so many good reviews on this web page.
Moody film noir from director Raoul Walsh has young boy left orphaned by a bloodthirsty band of killers, who dog the boy's trail even after he grows up into Robert Mitchum (seems to me that's the point where they might have given up stalking him).
Carey plays a luckless storekeeper influenced by the cunning Jagger to go after Mitchum and does well with the part.
Don't forget that this was made shortly after WWII ended, so that the theme of men returning from combat, and the constant threat of death, was something everyone was conscious of; it's almost as if Jeb has PTSD (the 'black dog riding his back'), and death follows him, through no fault of his own, throughout the movie.
It's almost frustrating, seeing everyone chase after Robert Mitchum even though the man has nothing wrong!
This is where the movie starts to strain credibility, especially when both Ma and Thorley turn implacably against Jeb after he kills Adam in self-defense.
'backwards' is again a brilliant idea, they finally arrive on Earth, after going through a 'time hole', to find time's running backwards, also a new version of Holly is introduced when he performs a head swap operation on himself to become a woman, and a new character joins the crew, a service mechanoid: Kryten and a new mini craft called 'Starbug'   Series IV: This is one of the somewhat weaker series but doesn't mean that it's not a good one.
Series VIII: This is the final series when 'Starbug' is finally destroyed after a series of crashes in it's previous series and the crew is resurrected by nanobots (small robots) along with Red Dwarf and the dwarfers are placed in Jail along with the resurrected Rimmer as Chris Barrie Returns.
Set in the future, on a space mining ship, the Red Dwarf, the show follows the zany lives of its remaining crew, 3 million years after a massive radiation leak from an improperly repaired drive plate wiped out virtually all life on-board the ship.
**SPOILERS*** Hired assassin John Baron, Frank Sinatra, saw just how futile the "hit-Job", that he and his fellow hired killers who were paid up to $500,000.00 each, was to assassinate the President of the United States;"A second after he's shot he'll be replaced by someone else so what's the purpose of killing the President anyway"?
It unknowingly and unconsciously foretells a real presidential assassination, JFK, by some nine years after it's release.
Only the psycho and insecure Barnon thinks that he can pull this off, even after Benny is shot dead by the Suddenly police, as he cased out the train station less then an hour before the president's train was to arrive.
Sterling Hayden is a bit stiff as the towns Sheriff Tod Shaw and has a hard time convincing the audience, as well as those on the screen, that he's in danger of losing his life even after he was shot.
I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show.
And since sci-fi comedy series has not been done a lot, I guess there is something new here after all - so I give it a 3.
Rimmer (played by the ace Chris Barrie) attempts a ridiculous explanation to how they've ended up with unusual predicaments after a late night party (for example broken legs) and tries to ease everyone's worries by suggesting it was alien communication.
Then after series 6 (one of the best series') Rob Grant left the show, the production budget increased, and series 7 was given that stupid 'film look'.
For example, after a black guy was killed.
I think Miss Stanwyck was a great actress, but when I look at the version of STELLA DALLAS that King Vidor directed her in twelve years after this silent version..... well, something always bothered me about it.
But Mother, after being hypnotized, recognizes these tell-tale signs in her daughter, including puncture marks that looked like they were inflicted by a tri-fanged vampire, that remind her of her own alien abductions.
Time after, he falls in love with her, he becomes part of the village and earn the King's trust, and thats why he fight for their protection.
), and , believe it or not , a story that IS quite original : a space craft crashes on Earth ,and only one survives , well, two , but the other thing is nonhuman , very nasty and rather horrifying- H.R.Giger would be proud - and , yes , has a huge appetite for humans, but even that is brilliantly explained , as the human race in its quest for resources obliterates anything that lives on any planet,and not asking any questions , but simply sending the fleets of colonizers after the campaign 's been done !
The main reason is that as long as a movie delivers something that I really enjoy, then I don't rank after critical review, but through share enjoyment.
There is the must-have love story as well, between the outlander and the daughter of the king of the tribe, who eventually took over his throne after the monster, killed him mercilessly.
I had never seen the trailer of this movie nor any much publicity whatsoever,but it came as a clear surprise for me after getting to watch it,i liked it very much.So sad that i ended up watching in a DVD.
The Movie has got breathtaking locations,viking costumes,"the shields" game,all was just entertaining.It has abundant gore too,of course its a viking movie after all!
Soon, when the villagers start vanishing and turning up as mutilated corpses, the vikings realize that Kainen might be telling the truth after all...
This is written right after Brando died and all the obituaries said he changed acting with his facial expressions and emotions right out there for the world to see, but it seems to me Old Blue Eyes deserves some of the same credit.
For the time this film is set, which is 1528, that's a very early era of western exploration (only 36 years after Columbus).
This is a really interesting 1991 Mexican drama concerning the eight-year long journey (1528 - 1536) of Alvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked in Florida and enslaved by Indians, but who found a career as an itinerant Indian shaman, and eventually, after an endless journey through swamp and desert, ultimately found his way back to Spanish civilization.
Among the goofs: the wrong cue music (his most-used TV theme was also a hit single for him in 1953, "Melancholy Serenade"; after introducing his variety shows, Jackie'd leave the stage to the strains of "That's A-Plenty", etc.)
So how does this 3rd installment, 5 years after the original fares up.
I am a big fan of the first movie - "Zenon girl of the 21-st century", and after watching the first sequel I thought to myself that they ruined the whole story and the illusion, I saw this movie because there was nothing else to see on TV, and I'm glad I did, because this movie brought back my admiration to this story.
Within nine years, after he made his best film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (also dealing with political assassination), Sinatra saw his former friend President John Kennedy murdered.
While dozens of poor little Cambodian children are chasing after anyone with a $1 NOTE to sell dozens of postcards to so they can afford another day of school, these unlicensed brats are whinging about the brand new "SUV" they received.
MTV may be trying to get this across: Parents, it's up to you to teach your children that this kinda thing is easily forgotten even after you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make your sweetie "Queen" or "King" for a few hours, and they aren't really "entitled" to a thing at 16.
Antonio Margheriti's KILLER FISH (1979; which is one I'd also love to get a second opinion of after all these years).
Clearly the best of all the movies about sharks which came after Jaws.
As a matter of fact, it copied Jaws so closely that Universal Pictures filed a successful lawsuit against the producers and Great White was yanked out of American theaters shortly after its release.
But after that, it really bogged down, overstayed its welcome, and lowered the standards.
i was also surprised when i read that it was released as Jaws 3 in some countries when it hit the theaters, well it is better than Jaws pt 3 and 4. one thing that i like with this movie (spoiler warning) is the ending - right about after the sharks death - when they all get safety on land just before the end text is coming and the sad music is appears - it reflects sorrow, evil and even madness, and the survivors gets into the car - it is a great scene probably the best in the entire movie (according to me).
Italian exploitation riff on "Jaws" was notorious for being yanked from theaters after the producers mounted a multimillion dollar ad campaign (that looks like it cost a lot more than anything in the actual film) that attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg and Universal Pictures.
There's a notorious scene where a helicopter crashes into the water after the shark gets ahold of it, and it's a bizarre clash of toy models.
I saw this movie years ago at a film festival, and ended up looking it up here after it came up in conversation with friends last night, partly to prove to them that I was not making it up, and partly to see for myself if there was actually any record of the film's existence, or if it had sunk into some kind of merciful oblivion after doing the festival circuit.
And 15 years after seeing it, I still have no answer to that.
An interesting contrast of two extremes with the pacifist minded Ellen Benson (played here by Nancy Gates), her becoming a widow after her husband got killed in the war, finally forced to take a stand at the film's climax.
To think I didn't plan to watch this for several weeks after getting the DVD.
Maybe if Billy Wilder were to remake Preminger's Laura as an exploitation movie after dropping six tabs of acid and watching Eat The Schoolgirl, Arsenic & Old Lace, and a Joe D'Amato flick... and doing it in a mix of English, Greek, and French.
Then, after some weird dialog/interactions between the mother and daughter, the wounded detective shows up at their door.
Singapore Sling is drawn into their deadly web after knocking on their door, a bullet wound in his shoulder.
Anyhoo, after he has the fortunate opportunity of falling into the aforementioned duo's clutches, the real action begins.
Singapore Sling is about a mother and daughter duo who have gone completely nuts after father died.
Central Park West is quite simply one of the best soaps ever and it was really cheap of CBS to cancel it after only 21 episodes.
The absolute low point was when the camera zoomed in on the girls as they were washing their vagina after being raped several times.
For instance, one (named "Crabs" I think) keeps scratching his groin, then complains to another that he got that itch after he let the other guy "suck" him.
It all ends soon after in a quick "resolution" to the "plot."
The film is about two girls who are on their way home but after taking a shortcut their car brakes down.
I'd say it is not such a bad thing that this film has faded into obscurity right after its release.
Again, in Part II, after the heroes have tackled the evil forces of the Eastern Chamber (a never-explained reference to some part of the Imperial Palace, I suppose), Scholar Ku wanders around the battle site laughing humorlessly over his own cleverness in the ways he spooked the Imperial guard force that came to attack.
No thanks, then by magic it came up on digital TV in the UK, 3 months after I had started to look for it!
I intend to see this movie again in a near future and reevaluate it, trying to see if it becomes clearer after a second time.
Three hours later I was exhilarated after stumbling across of the greatest films made in the 20th century - and it wasn't a moment too long.
This is some school kids attempt at a "cabinet of dr caligari" type movie,without the abstract sets - about 50 words are spoke in the whole film & repeated "visions" replayed over & over again from the main character, shot on video, the film makes less sense than a Jess Franco movie (that's saying something) there is one scene that's clever (the eat me scene) but really, i had to fast forward through chunks of it after 20 mins.
The difference is that those kids's movie, after being viewed by friends and family, went into a trunk with the Boy Scout pictures and old report cards.
Lucia and he become lovers after Lucia meets him at a coffeeshop and tells him she is in love with him and wants to live with him.
In time, in his second novel, Lorenzo will have to face his child, named Luna after the full moon.
In my opinion it still holds up today 8 years after it's creation.
Fantastic graphics and are put to scale; not like other try-hard games like Tiberian Sun (which I might add was released one year after yet it was worse!)
The day after, I ran out and bought it.
A group of spoiled success types(..rock singer, newspaper columnist, television exec, celebrity cook, entertainment lawyer, high-maintenance slut)find themselves trapped in the isolated wings of the abandoned building after following a riddle to a properly prepared party by a psycho.
This was just one of many dinosaur movies made right after Jurassic Park, and of them it's the least remembered (Which is what it deserves).
What a waste of time, this film is so boring I walked out after an hour.
Then the movie takes a disasterous turn after the opening 15 minutes by turning into a sci-fi/horror/comedy with no wit and no imagination.
Richards tries very hard and looks beautiful through one preposterous scene after another.
It shows a T-rex make a phone call, then check the pay phone for change after he's done, then it shows him crying with tears pouring from his eyes.
The plot reminds of certain films by AlmodovÃ r, but unfortunately Julio Medem is not AlmodovÃ r.  The sex disappears after one third of the story.
The story seemed pretty basic after the first 30 minutes, however upon the 45th minute passing I realized I was wrong.
I guess the writer wanted to make a statement on human interaction, so he decided at the expense of the audience to keep the film going much after one would have assumed this disaster would have finished.
Of course I don't have to provide a spoiler to tell you what happens after that, unless you've never seen a movie before.
When summoned to ghetto headquarters for being out after curfew, he hears a radio report about Russian troop movements.
When he is sent to a German officer's office for being out after curfew he hears a report that the Russians are heading in his towns direction and thinks they may free him and his town from the Germans.
But after seeing the movie, I can't understand why the critics didn't like it.
This movie was so bad that even after watching XXX immediately before Sex and Lucia; it was still painful to witness.
Long after the movie is over, she is asleep on Michael's shoulder, and he is gazing upon her.
Contrast that with the sexually confident Justin, who has to deal with one of those "criers after sex" on a one-night-stand and contemplate alone in a car later just what he lost with his current girlfriend.
That's no accident, as Eric was our #1 pitcher and we may have made it to the world series if he had not broken his finger in practice after we won the VA state title.
But after breathless coupling Justin falls asleep and where does Lori go?
Lori and Justin's relationship is based almost entirely on sex, so after their frequent coital encounters, Lori finds herself knocking on Michael's door in search of emotional intimacy.
I fell in love with Sally Ann Howes after seeing that movie.
As I said to my boyfriend after the credits rolled, I hear that sharing a traumatic experience with someone can make the relationship even stronger.
Anyway, after the PAINFUL 2 hours I can honestly say I feel dumber.
Oliver Hudson and Ryan Browning don't do a lot better, although one of them (who cares) gets to get shot by Miss Victim -- accidentally, of course -- after getting totally turned on by her secret identity as one of the three female rapists.
Recap: 30 years after a top secret research project was shut down, a team of the Special Investigation tries to deal with the aftermath.
Stiles and Mochrie were obviously the stars of the show, but others such as Greg Proops, Josie Lawrence and my personal favourite Tony Slattery all managed to put on strong performances time after time.
I had the unexpected pleasure of seeing this soon after Ruiz's Proust.
I became aware of it after seeing The Comedy Store Players, a group of comedians which includes Josie Lawrence.
Lets hope Pollio shuts up after this and never shoots another movie.
There are some artists who are so original, fearless and groundbreaking that they inspire and influence almost every other artist in their field who comes after them.
Someone said Richard Pryor was the Charlie Parker of Comedy in that everything changed after he arrived.
I rented it this week after he died and watched it twice more (up to around 6 or 7 viewings by now).
That all came after this.
And after just seeing "RENT" which I did NOT like, I was a little worried about what I was about to endure.
A central idea is that of finding a hole (symbolically on the sandy beach) where, after reaching the end of the story, you can jump back into the middle.
I was truly mesmerized after watching this film last night, though many of my friends warned me not to and i can understand why.
You feel a bit of a void after it is over - my wife thought it was depressing at first - but once you discuss the characters' motivations and the ending, it all seems justified.
And then leave with Salman after he returns.
The sets are beautiful, but it's so dark and gloomy, and after a while you start missing daylight.
Rani Mukherji is the one whom i admired the most in the movie.She plays a kind hearted prostitute.Her appearance really rocked the scene.i have started liking her more after this film.Salman khan had a small role but he portrayed his character well.
If you have been in love then after watching this movie you will easily say that this movie is a "Fairy Love Tale".
Its sheer delight listening such a soothing music after very-very long time and my favorites are 'Jab se tere naina', 'Yun shabnami' and of course, the title track-'Saawariya'.
First of all after watching saawariya i still have not been able to understand why people did not like it.
We need to think after seeing it.
They are brought together by Tok's envy of O and Tok's desire to replace him as the most sought after assassin in Asia.
Simon Yam is Inspector Lee of Interpol who leads a team going after both of the killers and who (literally in one case) are always just a step behind them.
As a result of O's more low-key approach he is the highest ranked and most sought after professional much to the dismay of Tok.
Some of the most disturbing footage was of violence by regional troops aligned with the government, which Director/Producer Phillipe Diaz revealed (during the Q & A after the screening at Slamdance Film Festival) had been given to him by a Sierra Leonian government official who wanted the truth revealed, although it clearly meant he had to flee his country forever.
Soon after he underwent guerrilla training under Muammar Qaddafi in Liberia as did Sankoh in the mid 1980's.
I was about 7 years old at the time, I remember it was right after Disney Channel had aired "Barcelona '92: 16 Days of Glory", meaning I had Olympics on the brain when I first saw it, a bit of a bias.
And seeing on 2005, after how comics and cartoons have evolved it is a pleasure.
Speaking of idiots, Guybrush Threepwood is back and after a brief skirmish out on the high seas he and his wife return home to find out someone has taken over as governor of the island.
It wouldn't be simple to change right into a human and do human things after you've been living in the woods with wolves for 28 years.
The CIA is after Ms. Porcupine and her pals because she and her two friends broke into some Roswell type of secret lab where the Spider was gestating inside a dying Astronaut.
The non-existent plot in this tripe is paper thin and looks like it was scrapped together after its creators watched a few episodes of 'THE X-FILES' and 'ALIENS'.
When it 'mutates' after it comes out of that man's mouth and runs around the walls, my stomach muscles nearly split from laughter!!
Personally, I have arachnophobia, but after watching this film, I think spiders are one of the most friendliest creatures on this planet!
My girlfriend was snoring in my arms after 5 minutes but I laughed a lot that night.
- Especially the damsel in distress who turn into a Rambo after losing all her friends), bad effects (!
Seventy years after the young Wendy Hiller starred as Eliza Doolittle in "Pygmalion," it is stunning to see her act the part of an old woman in "All Passion Spent," a three-episode version of a Vita Sackville-West novel.
An X-Files-style conspiracy creates and unleashes murderous mutant spiders feeding on their victims and growing in size after each kill.
(By the way, this was shortly after the spider had rampaged through down town LA growing bigger with every person it ate).
A girl who might be a truly hot babe and has a thing for UFO's drags her two boy-toys to a secret government lab where she gets her glasses knocked off by a mutant spider and becomes a truly hot babe after which she waists no time getting the spider to off her two boy-toys then she does a wet t-shirt dance and wins the heart of a hunka hunka burning MIB(Man In Black).
I hate spiders naturally, and I was scared in the movie for the people the spider was going after.
There is one part where our heroine wakes up after being rendered unconscious to find the situation has changed in a way that doesn't make in sense in terms of plot logic or pacing.
Amick (of Twin Peaks domestic violence 'Shelley' fame), in a standout performance is the lowly collegiate struggling to juggle her studies with the demands of caring for both her home and her decrepit grandmother, whilst her Aunt and cousin live it up night after night.
I bought the audio "tape" of the film years ago after I had seen it and wore the poor thing to death.
I loved this movie and obviously it had an impact on so many of us if after all these years we all still remember it and are still searching for it.
I think but am not sure..I was only eight years old after all.
I can see it now in my mind after all these years.
My sister and I recorded ourselves singing 'Sunshine' and 'Lady' for fun after seeing the movie only to discover just weeks later that she too had a terminal illness and died very soon after.
The beautiful songs 'Sunshine on my Shoulders' and 'My Sweet Lady' (sung by John Denver) stayed with me long after the film vanished off circuit.
I wish they would have made a sequel to sunshine Christmas which was done after sunshine and told the story about SAM and Jill.
I saw this movie when it first aired on television many years ago.I was around fourteen years old.My sister was sick with breast cancer,and it made a huge impact on me.I read the book later, after I had seen the movie.This movie was beautifully filmed, and I thought that it stayed close to the original book.The script was very intelligent, and the actors portrayed their roles perfectly.I love the sets.To see the beautiful countryside in some of the scenes was fantastic.The music in this movie was one of the wonderful attributes to the story.I find myself humming the songs all of the time, after all of these years.I found the soundtrack, and I listen to it all of the time.Cliff De Young, Christina Raines,Meg Foster,Billy Mumy and Brenda Vaccaro were excellent.The other cast members were great too.I always cry when I watch this movie.I recommend this movie highly to people that have never seen it,I have this movie.
The story begins at the funeral of her husband and her consequent decision to live out the rest of her days according to her own wishes after a long life as the wife of a very successful politician.
I saw the movie right after its release, in Europe.
I bought the novel soon after and read it until the pages fell out.
he's taken "verite" to a whole new level, and all the founding fathers of cinema would, after a series of gag reflexes, applaud him enthusiastically (except Orson Welles, cause he lacked a sense of humor....), but that's just one man's opinion.
It's the story of a young man named Ian (McCarthy) whose brother Danny (Jeffrey Nordling) marries a flighty young woman named Lucy (Parker) very shortly after meeting her at his post office window, when she wants to mail a bowling ball.
Lucy has two children by a previous marriage, and 7 months after marrying Danny, has a third.
His brother is very upset and, after dropping off Ian at home, crashes into a tree and dies.
Its really sad even after having some good actors like Paresh Rawal, Irfan Khan, the movie failed to make an impact.
You will not like to discuss it after you watch it.
Mr. Naseeruddin Shah, the master of realistic acting and the God of theater after a long yearning to direct, finally had an opportunity to don the director's hat with this film.

Its very entertaining and keeps you stuck to your chair, even after watching it about 50 times, i cant get enough Freddie.
Truth be said, Queen weren't popular after their 'disasterous' "Hot Space" album.
This is the first movie which is Rayesque to the core.One of his most obvious permanent feature really appears for the first time: the search for a father.The relationship Bogart/Derek is intense (after the death of the biological one)and predates those of "Run for cover" (John Derek again playing opposite Cagney) and "Rebel without a cause " (Remember Plato to Jim and Judy: "I wish you could be my parents" )But I could also mention the Mitchum/Kennedy relationship in " lusty men" or even Heston and the Chinese girl in "55 days at Peking" .Or James Mason and his (biological this time) in "bigger than life".Emma's character predates The Rayesque young girl ,the one you meet again in "they live by night" (note how Allene Roberts resembles Cathy O'Donnell).Allene Roberts' beaming face and her hope against hope are the only ray of light in a dark tragical story.
It stars Humphrey Bogart in his first film after leaving Warner Brothers, though it comes off like a Warner Brothers film made in the 1930s - it has a real "Dead End Kids" feel to it, particularly in the beginning.
Morton was too busy to defend Nick's immigrant dad on a charge for which he was not guilty, and Nick's father died in prison after some bad lawyering.
* So-called 'hilarious' buddy talk between The Jerk and his mates that reads like it was written by a 18 year old college dropout while sitting on the toilet (example: after the above stuntman emerges from the lake, The Jerk comments "Well, guess his ass is toast!!"
I believe that films should stand on their own two feet and not be compared to previous works, but since Nicholas Ray was so clearly trying to recapture the magic of his astonishing debut THEY LIVE BY NIGHT, it's hard not to compare the two; after all the love story between Pretty Boy and Pretty Girl directly parallels Bowie and Keechie's relationship.
When his father dies in prison, after being sent there due to shoddy work by his attorney, Derek becomes embittered and turns to crime.
Bogart's independent production company made the film shortly after he broke away from Warner Brothers.

Ahhhhh, if you thought The Incredible Hulk Returns was a bit on the silly side, you won't think that so much after watching this.
Soon after Nate rides off, the 3 convicts crest the hill to find Sarah's three daughters bathing nude in the creek.
I was so surprised that it wasn't in American cinemas soon after.
Although Serling himself didn't write this particular episode (E. Jack Neuman did), this is one after his own heart, as they say.
Of course, everyone is a ghost and after a brief stay in this netherworld, Templeton finds that he is unwanted.
Within a few years after the Twilight Zone series ended, Pollack became one of Hollywood's great directors and it's quite ironic that in this episode he actually portrays one.
One day, after witnessing his trophy wife flagrantly galavanting with an attractive lodger half Templeton's age, he beings lamenting about his lost past, and soon finds himself transported back to it.
I have never worked as an office temp before, but after seeing this movie, I have a very clear image as to what it must be like.
", after a while, you'll love it.
I felt the need to defend this programme after reading the first review written by someone who has never been a fan.
However, even in the controlled environments - interviews after the fact - the camera shakes, moves in & out unnecessarily, and gives ridiculous close-ups.
Tom's portrayal of the plight of animals after Katrina was bare-boned and showed us the painful reality of how things really were.
It never preached to you, it simply showed you what happened after Katrina and leaves you to decide how to feel.
I only watched the movie after reading someone else's comments which were really good so I guess were all different and the film may appeal to some viewers but certainly did nothing for me.
I thought this film would be good but after seeing it i was disappointed.
"3 Needles" will have you thinking about the issues it raises - and does not resolve - long after it is over.
The audience was privileged to have the director, Thom Fitzgerald, make an unannounced visit and stay for questions after wards.
The cinematography is amazing at times - and there are certain images that will stick with you long after you leave the movie.
On the box Gary Daniels has a katana sword,I didn't see him use it in the film,where in the heck was it and according to the box his family is in a house and he wanted to get them out because bad guys were going to blow the home up and after all of the fighting you never saw him get them out or at the end or at any time at all.
This movie had some "style" in the direction I thought, but all the slo-mo just got boring after a while, and the action sequences were the flattest in the movie.
Ruth surprises Will with his grandfather's diary, which she only discovered after his death.
Perhaps it is a bit overly sentimental, but after all it is a Christmas story.
It seems that Molly's ex-husband (James Keach) thinks that she is neglecting the kids, mainly because he stumbled into a party given by Molly to the football players after a victory and to top it off the oldest daughter gets drunk.
At first, the guys take a disliking to her, but soon afterwards, her efforts pay off as they win match after match.
There are some silly moments, but hey this was the 80s after all!
Errol Flynn was rarely more appealing, or de Havilland more luminous, and after sixty years, this remains a classic.
When I see a film by Christopher Munch, I think (as I also do after movies by Abel Ferrara or Claire Denis), "This is what celluloid is for."
This movie too contains frame after frame of richly textured compositions that never devolve into prettiness.
How the word has evolved, especially after the World Wars and has interjected itself into every aspect of culture was fascinating.
senses that they're trying to escape, and goes after them.
Forest Whitaker is always good and the director was steady and precise, the director talked after the movie and he said he had unique problems on this film as it was a much bigger budget than his previous film, but I still think he did a good job.
Soon after dreams start becoming more real and soon she must confront the nightmares that have been scratching at her brain for years.
4- The woman (the girl that was with the 3 boys) after all that she sees goes and stays in the house to live?
He did seem like he'd had budget and studio constraints as evidenced by the fact that when I asked him the likely rating of the film in the Q&A after the screening he replied, "y'know... PG-13... gotta keep it marketable".
She is befriended by the local publisher and historian Noah Pitney (Justin Louis) but after a sequence of disturbing visions, she decides to contact the paranormal consultant Geoffry Hunt (Forest Whitaker).
But this carefully constructed image gradually unfolds: Stacy visits the cosmetic surgeon more often than I see my dentist, and she occasionally comes off as incredibly callous, such as when she prostitutes herself to a wealthy fan (not too long after gushing about how frightened she is of losing her boyfriend because he might find someone better), or when she gets very cross at her boyfriend because he can't handle doing a double-teamed scene with her (she actually services the other guy first -- that's showbusiness).
Not only did Ms. Valentine and Ms. Fugate field an open and honest Q & A session after the 82-minute movie, but my viewing partner won a movie poster (for being a bleached blonde!)
I didn't like the latter, and after seeing the former, I like the latter even less.
(even after the reduction to the DD from an E), and in all honesty, I couldn't tell the difference after she had liposuction done on her thighs.
In another, she's shooting some scenes for a movie with her boyfriend, and you can see the hurt on both their faces as he starts to slowly pull farther and farther away -especially after he's 3 feet away from watching the woman he loves perform oral sex on another man, even if it's "just acting".
I doubt that any woman, after seeing the movie, would trade places with SV for any amount of money.
One side note:not a good date movie if you are hoping to, er, get lucky afterwards, because after watching it, having sex will be the last thing you feel like doing.
Posted this one about a week ago, but it still has not appeared, so I will try once again...  Pornography is big business: while Amazon.com continues to hemorrhage red ink after four years, the average internet porn site is profitable within six months, and the industry as a whole raked in over a billion dollars last year alone.
Years later, after seeing it countless times on video, I saw it on the big screen when it was shown locally, and it was a whole new experience of the film.
Anyway, shortly after McGonigle's revenge, Mrs Pepperday persuades him to attend an unforgettable ("unforgettable" being emphasized) singing performance of her's; it gets me in stitches every time how Fields repeatedly fails to subtly put an end to the horrible experience.
Even after a couple of decades of drink, he still does a creditable job, to say the least.
This extended sequence feels like an authentic recreation of just what an evening at a small-town theater of the period would have been like, from the cheap-looking sets and declamatory acting styles to the heavy curtain that hits the stage with a crash after each scene.
With latest changes after globalization, it is transforming into something else Â for better or worse.
I think after watching this movie it is required viewing to go watch "Walmart- the high cost of low prices" and the documentary "Corporation" to help balance the viewpoints.
after screening this wonderful up-to-date movie, i wish the filmmakers the best for the release all over the world.
Lastly, in case you decide to visit India after watching this movie, plan your travel well and just like any other part of the world, stay alert.
From the opening scene in the Mumbai airport with its marble floors and dirty white walls... to the teeming crowds waiting outside (I had one white face meeting me at 4:00 a.m. after flying from Orlando to Detroit to Amsterdam to Mumbai to Hyderabad, amidst the hundreds of brown faces clamoring for your attention)... to the little three-wheeled jeeps careening through the streets... the marvelous shots of Victoria Station and the Gateway of India... to the merriment of Holi.
Movie earned warm heavy applause after its screening in the Dubai International Film Festival yesterday evening: the audience, a mix of Europeans, Middle Easterns, and Indians, showered the director and author and lead actress with questions after the show.
I particularly admired the ending (spoiler ahead): sticking the "bindi" on George Washington's forehead - an excellent subtle invitation for a critical look on what drives work (and inevitably life) that the movie did not pretend to tackle head-on yet illustrated throughout: after all, placing the missing piece isn't foreign to Seattle.
Robin Hood (played by Errol Flynn) fights against the villainous Prince John (Claude Rains), who took control of the kingdom as regent when King Richard (Ian Hunter) was captured in Austria during his return from the Holly Lands after Third Crusade's end .
One of those kids is Larry Nunn, a kid crippled after he killed a guard in a reformatory he was in.
Nunn is far more cynical and bitter after seeing and experiencing what he has in that other institution.
Three years after the enormous success of 'Boy Town', director Norman Taurog and his brilliant cast is at it again, reforming young sinners and fighting their battle against the inhuman ways children were treated in reform schools.
The special effects weren't as outstanding as they should've been; most times after the first season, we barely see Superman take off, he just waves his cape at the camera and literelly jumps two feet left or right side of the camera out of frame.
I'm surprised that he wasn't used more often after that because he was in jail, not dead.
"Lois and Clark" was more or less a replacement for me, after "Charmed" stopped coming on TV here.
This is a wonderful fantasy-romance-action series that still holds its own 10 years after it left the network.
Herbert Mundin was the first one in this cast to die, he was killed in an automobile accident just two years after this film was finished.
Immediately after a grueling Elimination Chamber match at New Years Revolution that left champ Cena victorious but bloodied and bruised, Edge seized his chance and swiftly beat an already half-dead Cena within a minute.
Like I said earlier, an entertaining affair with Mysterio coming out on top after coming in at number 2 and going all the way.
Gregory Helms wins after pinning Funaki to capture his first WWE Cruiserweight Championship.
Mickie James wins after getting Ashley in a roll-up & using the ropes for leverage.
Boogeyman wins after a Pump-Handle like slam finisher.
Mysterio wins after eliminating Orton last.
WWE Championship Edge vs. John Cena 7/10: Good match, probably the second best match of the night, great to see John Cena win after making Edge tap out to the STFU to capture his WWE Championship back.
Angle wins after a chairshot on the head of Mark Henry then an Angle Slam.
REF - Trish 3/10 It started well for these two, Ashley looked better in ring but after 5 minutes it turned into a horror show, they got sloppy, Trish got bored, Ashley started getting booed because all she was doing was fake, and i mean FAKE!
Still, anyone who considers themselves a fan (or was interested after seeing the new Tarantino / Rodreiguez film "Grindhouse") of this kind of trash, the "42nd Street Forever" series comes highly recommended.
Synapse films has compiled a bunch of grindhouse-style exploit trailers in 42ND STREET FOREVER - named after the area in New York City that was considered the "hub" of the grindhouse movement.
Discovering after the fact that Duvall wrote the screenplay, all became clear.
The film's one redeeming grace are the artful dance sequences, but then you can just watch a song & dance film if that's what you're after.
Diane and I watched this engrossing film last night after she had purchased it because of her recent trip to Buenos Aries and both of us loved what we saw.
As opposed to many that post their reviews of movies on this site, I use IMDb as a diary of personal impressions about films I have just seen: not necessarily thoughts about the script of a movie' just my immediate ideas that flow into my thoughts after a movie's conclusion.
Definitely check it out after reading other comments if only to see what you think.
If Robin Hood ever existed, he would have lived about 150 years after the period in which the film is set.
So here I am after seeing again after some years the very first South Park episode...
And is all certainly related: this show begins with Cartman after having a bad night, nightmares about visitors that abduct people and mutilate cows.
The plot focuses on the Roth family, Burt (Lee Van Cleef) and his sons Jim, Clay, and Tommy (David Carradine, David Goss, and Brent Huff), who become targets of mob boss, Akira Tenaka (Mako) after coming into possession of a stolen jade statue.
The family edition three seasons ago and the one after that with the hippies were awesome.
But last season I stopped watching after the 4th or 5th episode.
Sure "Survivor" had it's moments, but it got tiresome after awhile.
The story also is usually confirmed on the very last minute after searching for optimal tasks and routes by the producers.
Flo is a horrible person who I hope Zach seriously distanced himself from after the race.
This unflinching look at the former Soviet Union just after WWII should be seen by all those who might still harbor some romantic feelings for the communist past.
It is not entirely surprising that her husband turns to another women after a while.
A compellingly told story of Russian emigres who return to the USSR at Stalin's invitation after WWII.
The same model was followed by the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states once these countries were occupied by the Soviet army after World War two.
However, this woman and her family are allowed to stay--after she is savagely beaten by the secret police for being "an imperialist spy".
Plus it's made worse after she helps another Russian escape.
The main actors -- Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menshikov, and Sergei Bodrov, Jr. -- acquit themselves quite well in this tale about a Soviet emigre (Menshikov) who commits  the terrible error of returning to the Soviet Union after World War II, bringing his French wife (Bonnaire) and their young son.
The rest of the movie is largely about their difficult life and her all-consuming desire to return to France after they quickly discover that life in the Soviet Union is grim and that they are suspect.
Deneuve appears as a fellow-traveling French actress who eventually makes it possible for Bonnaire to return home after she's spent six years in prison for helping a young man she befriended to escape the country.
Not including the 20 million Soviet World War II dead (for which Stalin, as Hitler's ally the first few years, must take much responsiblity), another estimated 10 to 20 million "subversive" citizens were murdered or died after extreme torture and slave labor in camps.
Alexei, the young doctor who decides to go back to the Soviet Union after a generous invitation of Josef Satlin, should have had his head examined!
I sat in the cinema after the credits had rolled almost unable to bring myself to leave, get in my car and drive home.
after their mom died, they kind of grew apart.
This was most unoriginal as right away the girl falls for the guy after knowing him for 5 seconds, and what brought them together?
You know, after 90 minutes (oh, if it only lasted 1 minute!)
You would think that after 18 years of acting they would be able to handle it but I guess not.
Back when they were students, they were best friends, but after several years, the relation between these men went down hill.
Unfortunately, the movie suffers when it takes a melodramatic turn in the last 10 minutes but the ending is happy (it's a comedy after all!)
Charming gem of a film has been unfairly lost to the world a mere year after its release, which is a real shame.
Especially after helping overcome a quite terrifying wild boar...this sequence was stunning, yet simplistic and I realised I was watching a master film maker open mouthed in near wonderment.
However, after a few events, including the food storehouse blowing up and defeating a wild boar, the five Koreans, along with an American pilot named Kent Smith whose plane crashed at the very beginning of the film, are able to come to terms with each other temporarily, but with the threat of other outsiders looming on the horizon can this fragile friendship be maintained?
Finally, after hours of coaxing from my sister, I finally went to see the movie.
While "Tale of a Dog" was the last short produced, "Dancing Romeo," the film made before this one, was the last "Our Gang" comedy to be released (apparently the MGM brass wanted everyone to believe Froggy and Marilyn lived happily ever after).
Also according to Maltin and Bann's book, MGM was planning another "Our Gang" short to have been called "Homefront Commandos," but decided to cancel production midway through filming (most likely after discovering how much money "Dancing Romeo" lost).
It also seems tantalizing to imagine if MGM decided to stick out "Our Gang" for one more year, until after World War II ended, I'll bet there would have been a patriotic-themed musical episode, like "Calling All Kids!"
Nevertheless, it's much more than entertainment: you'll be amused and will think about its subject after leaving the cinema.
Things do not work out as planned and slowly Paul becomes more and more upset with his son, especially after Tanguy has tried living on his own for a couple of days.
Everything is taken care of by somebody else (cleaning up after him in the bathroom, laundry & ironing, bills, shopping, preparing dinner etc), he does not have to buy a car since he can use his parents' cars, he does not have to spend his money on everyday's life necessities and he can concentrate without a single worry in his mind on whatever pleases him (e.g.
In the scene when Will returns to his wife after the stakeout smelling of the prostitute's perfume, we have Liv smelling it, and then when he opts for a shower, she pulls him close for immediate sex.
Thus, it was fresh and new to see her playing a Bosnian immigrant, after she plays a French chocolate maker in Lasse Hallstrom's Chocolat, a US/UK production.
The film wraps up beautifully in the credits with Sigur Ros's Se Lest, which was a small treat for the audience after the story comes to an end.
It soothes the ears, and the heart after the tension.
I was lucky enough to attend a screening with a Q&A with Minghella after the film.
Now based in London and straddling the line between lower middle class and poverty, he is cared for by his Muslim mother Amira who provides for both by working as a seamstress after his Serb father got murdered during the war.
There's a robbery in the film and Will chases the aggressor, a kid, and after a series of events ends up involved with his mom Amira, played by Juliette Binoche...Yes, involved like the "Closer" type of involvement.
She has to look after her 10 year old daughter suffering from ADD while struggling to feel appreciated and loved by the vacuous Law.
I sat in silence after the film was over.
I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival after watching a bunch of Hollywood galas all week, and "Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish" was by far the best of the bunch.
Goat takes up with a sultry animal-wrangler with an annoying European accent; he dumps her when he thinks that the ex-girlfriend's kid is his, but, after the old black man dies, a tape is played at the funeral that gets Goat and the wrangler back together.
I look forward to this film coming to town again so I can see it a second time after post-production.
By the last 5 minutes I was longing to fast forward this particular turkey when out of the blue the film gave us a few minutes of vintage Jack, in a brief song and dance number after all the plot points were been resolved.
I can't imagine any realistic ending could have been pulled off after the lame start.
It should be effective enough to wipe out the headache and the sour taste a lot of people will have, after the 'twist' ending offered by HIGH (HAUTE) TENSION.
And he's been finding a pretty good collection, one at a time, stuffing them into his trusty duffel bag after a quick removal with a wicked-looking sickle.
Unfortunately for them, he was...and now he's after them, determined to give them all his undivided attention...one victim at a time.
Don't go in expecting a backstory on the killer, or why he's out stalking gay men, or too much depth overall - it is, after all, just a quintessential, formulaic slasher flick, just with a queer twist.
Those looking for substance over style should look elsewhere, but if a homo roller-coaster ride to fright-land is what your after, this flick is it.
The fact that the central characters are gay quits being a gimmick after the opening scene.
I knew soon after that it was time to turn the channel.
BUT...there are some good kills and if it's splatter you're after, you might actually like this.
The sheriff's son, after a bad false start, turns out to have major cojones.
But after 20 minutes, I couldn't believe how bad it was.
I came upon 1 Giant Leap after looking up what films that Ram Dass has appeared in.
Making matters worse is that the sheriff's son(Chad Collins), and his love-interest Kerri(Alice Ziegler)are fending for their lives after a couple of the crocs devoured their high school pals.
Schnieder looking in surprise at his poking stick after its been bitten off...
Right after a 40 foot croc eats the pig on the other end of it?
The Sheriff's co-worker is brutally eaten by the croc and he's laughing and and hitting on the woman shortly after.
But after seeing the Ahmad guy tell his boss that he's finish doing deeds for him and then minutes later he tries to save his life, I just couldn't sit there anymore, I turned the damn thing off before my exhaustion drive me to aggravation and might just break the damn DVD which I didn't want to end up paying for.
One in particular shows Deputy Davis blow up one of the gators with a 'super gun' after which he and his son return to the ranger station.
Who could eat after watching this?
The director came to his senses and called it day and we all will live happily ever after.
When the crocidile attacks, most of the characters seem so calm about it, even making jokes after one of their own has just been killed.
Even after the sheriff is nearly swallowed alive by the creature, he's joking and laughing just seconds later.
I am usually VERY generous toward so-good-they're-bad movies, but in this case, if someone who has seen "House of the Dead" and "Bloodrayne" from start-to-finish actually turns off the TV after watching an hour of "Lake Placid 2", you know you have a problem.
apparently set a few years after the original, there are suddenly more deaths, and, guess what?
The four words: Your injury is permanent' slam into Jill Kinmont's consciousness like a bullet... She was a ski champion, full of life, action and beauty... Now, almost totally paralyzed after a bad fall...
I am a man, after all.
I recall being confused the first time I saw this film, not long after it was first released, probably due to being young and naive at the time.
And it was pretty funny seeing Rudolf playing Dracula again after his famous apperence on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as Dracula as well.
When Bram Stoker decided to name his famous vampire after a legendary Romanian prince, it had very very little to do with vampires at all.
The men, after a few drinks, are told the real reason Vlad has called them there; the are captured at swordpoint, soon to be impaled.
His wife stays with him, but, after Vlad seemingly comes back to life after his soldiers were convinced that he was killed in battle, she becomes convinced that her husband is a damned soul; that is to say, that his spirit is doomed to remain in limbo on earth forever because neither Heaven nor Hell will receive him.
Perhaps the animals would have looked fake in Technicolor, but they are quite impressive in black and white, especially the predatory allosauruses (although they are rather cute in close up when they fastidiously lick their digits after a particularly juicy chunk of flesh or snarl like Elvis Presley.)
Other than these two, the movie delivers one disappointment after another.
The novel massively boosted my opinion of the great author Â even after having read his entire collection of fascinating Sherlock Holmes stories (which took me a good six months) Â and 'The Lost World' now ranks among my all-time favourites.
The story revolves around a group of adventurer-scientists who go on a mission to rescue a fellow scientist and prove that there are still dinosaurs living in the Amazon long after they are thought to have been extinct.
First, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appears in the film and, since he died five years after it was released, it may be the only chance you have to see the creator of Sherlock Holmes.
I've seen worse stop-motion animation on movies made 30 years or more after this one ("The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" and "Jason & the Argonauts" come to mind).
More than 80 years after its release, the first adaptation of "The Lost World" remains as one of the most influential silent films ever, due to Willis O'Brien pioneer advances in the field of special effects, as it showcases the first time stop motion animation was used to create creatures on a feature length film.
However, the film's best remembered characteristic is the incredible special effects by Willis O'Brien, who after mastering his craft in short films got his first work in "The Lost World" and changed special effects forever.
The Rooftop scene with Oldman, and Terry seeing Kathleen for the first time really communicated the feeling of Terry being home after a long time, and truly being HOME.
ABOUT THE FILM: Sean Penn is Terry Noonan a guy involved with some obscure business and people who after an incident with drugs, returns to New York where he join his old gang of Irish in New York after ten years, he met with his old great friend Jackie Flannery (Gary Oldman) and his ex girlfriend Kathleen Flannery (Robin Wright), the Flannery brothers are a Irish family that dominate the mafia business in the area and are leaded by Frankie Flannery (Ed Harris).
In this one Reggie continues after Mike as Mike learns about The Tall Man's history.
She also underestimated what being with Terry would mean, especially after learning Terry's true identity.
(This number doesn't count the times I've watched it after having missed some portion of the film.)
Boasting a strong cast, director Phil Joanou's film follows Irish-American Terry Noonan as he returns home after an absence of ten years.
Italian neo-realist icon Roberto Rossellini changed gears, to a point, after bringing forth his 'post-war' trilogy of films (Roma Citta Aperta, Paisa, Germany Year Zero) that would catapult him into worldwide recognition.
But the fact that Fellini and Rossellini are stirring up such thoughts among such touching and near-perfect acting and stylizing (there's even a slight touch of humor in the early scenes with Fellini) and not forcing them on the viewer, not to sound catchy about it, is a miracle in and of itself, and one of the director's best films taking into account the two as L'Amore... Be advised though- as of now this film is EXTREMELY hard to find, and only after many months and more money than I'd care to say I discovered a copy on video, so only if you feel a strong urge to see the film (likely, as with myself, from having seen the clips from My Voyage to Italy) would I recommend it.
The only interesting thing about this movie is seeing the original cast members after all these years.
In the year 1995 at 5pm in the afternoon on ABC TV, I settled down after school to watch this show religiously.
I have the DVD and I have lent it out to friends dozens of times and the before and after is always the same: before "never heard of it" - after "loved it" --- and it doesn't matter the age or gender or politics of the viewer.
And, after all is said and done, it's not always about climbing a bridge.
And don't worry, we have even more action from the spheres of doom along with plenty of interesting musings on inter-dimensional travelling and how to really create that shrunken little slave you've always hankered after.
Alonzo, of course, is the armless performer who actually has arms, and after killing Nanon's father (she sees his deformed hand), he decides to have them removed so he can be with her.
Though one might not agree with Alonzo's attempts to kill Malabar, the viewer can at least sympathize with his motive after all that he has gone through to win Nanon's affection.
When the fickle Nanon's man-hands-phobia evaporates after spending several weeks with the anxious and ever-patient Malabar, she announces their engagement to Alonzo and his psychotic behavior explodes.
This will see a more amazing fruition five years alter in Freaks, shortly after his very successful Dracula (with its self-sustaining sideshow of bizarre, legendary types).
The fact that his character is obsessed with Crawford's we might understand, but it's a love that we don't sympathize with after awhile.
We get a glimpse of the pain that Chaney must have felt with his arms strapped to his chest day after day on the set.
That seems pretty hard to believe, considering the result, and I don't see how a product like this could emerge after five years of thinking and planning.
Already in the beginning of the film, when the all-powerful Czar Nicholas I is talking to Princess Maria about her mission, it's all too clear that he's under her spell and Princess Maria charmingly takes advantage of his infatuation for her own means (after this scene I was hooked).
There simply is not a single sign of action in the first 20 minutes after the title credits.
I am honest to say that I saw the rest (after the first 20 min of pure boredom) accelerated, in 4 time - 8 times DVD speed.
The majority of the scenes were improvised, but I honestly didn't notice--I found out after, watching the DVD extras.
This gay "romantic tragic-comedy" was not made, I think, to be watched by oneself after renting it from a mainstream video store.
I started watching the documentary expecting something nice, but what I got was something beyond that: I found the documentary VERY good, and I felt happiness and joy after watching it, like a sensation of inner peace.
In this process, first I watched Page 3 (by Madhur Bhandarkar), and then Satta (again by Bhandarkar) and after viewing these movies, I realised that I indeed was missing some thing in life.
Temperatures rise, people are fried after hearing some"whizzing" sound, and finally the much anticipated, very disappointing fried egg looking aliens appear.
Initially seeming like a predatory vamp, her strength seems to be drained after Callum eventually comes clean to his wife about their affair and she assumes a far less threatening role, her vengeance becoming further distilled through interactions that could never have been predicted when she originally formatted what could have been either a revenge scenario or a straightforward attempt to usurp Frankie.
Mike, after the events in "Part III", finds himself in a strange limbo of dimensions in the Tall Man's world, trying to save his own life and stop the evil villain.
'Go Toward the Light' has many emotive scenes: notably, Ben's funeral where his mother recounts how her son's life may have been short but he had made his mark on the world, when Ben's father explains to his three young sons about what happens to the soul after death, and the final scene where Ben dies in his parents' arms.
Every time they go after him, they keep on finding things that weakens him.
Time after time Reggie finds something, so did Mike.
Mads had waited year after year for a sign of life from his father, a visit, or just a letter, but nothing, till he is summoned to take care of his father's remains.
7/10  The combat system it fairly good, but it does get a bit repetitive after a while.
10/10  Single Player-The game is pretty fun alone, but the bad AI path-finding might get fairly annoying after a while.
No other video game before it (or after it) has compelled me to play so much.
The only scene that was an original was Apu washing his hair instead of his mouth after throwing up in front of the girl he was trying to charm and that too, right before they started having that mouth-to- mouth kiss.
I'd heard good things about it, but that was decreased a bit after seeing this film.
It was made worse after I saw the first three because they're all so good by comparison.
It's still my least favorite of the series, but I've realized that after all is said and done it's really not a bad film.
Never watched the Horrorfest DVD; saw Lake Dead after Saw wanna-be See No Evil on the Sci-fi Channel.
"Lake Dead" is about three sisters who inherit an isolated motel on the edge of a lake after an unknown grandfather of theirs dies.
At first it appears to be a throw-back to cheap '80s slasher movies, but after you watch a good twenty minutes of it it's apparent that it is nothing more than a failed attempt that pulls tricks and scenarios from every other slasher movie of its type.
The script itself appears to contain hints of originality in the beginning, but as it progresses it hits clichÃ© after clichÃ© after clichÃ©.
Right after that, we go to a charming funeral scene where a daughter slaps her father and that is hilarious, really the only entertaining second of the film.
Right after the 1st kill, we get to the requisite unnecessary sex & nudity, but during sex scene this ridiclious music with over the top soaring strings is playing, its stupid.
A girl that hot is going to have sex with a guy in the woods an hour after meeting him and say that????
And after tangling with some deformed looking locals they're picked up by the nice sheriff, who really isn't so nice.
But you do get to find out what happened to some of the characters after WWII.
Well, yes, this movie is literary(after all, Flora aspires to be a writer), but never in a condescending or precious way.
Flora is the kind of upbeat heroine who would take a hot cup of cocoa to Dracula "because he is probably cold after all that time in the tomb."
And as for gore, there's more yellow custard flying around here than an Oscar losers after dinner party.
Beckansale played a girl in 1930s England who went to the rural farm property after the death of her father.
Inside the Starkadder fold Flora encounters a resistance to dish washing modernity (the twig versus the hand mop); the rumor of an unmentionable misdeed once perpetrated against her father; the oft-cited permanence of the Starkadders on their environs; and the matriarch's frequently mentioned trauma after having witnessed a particularly odious occurrence inside the outdoor log pile storage facility ("...something nasty in the woodshed").
"Cold Comfort Farm" is one of those movies that, as others have said, grows on you each time you watch it, and after it has done so, you want to pass it around to all your friends.
Apparently he was notable for winning a costume contest after spending ten years in prison and that warrants a movie about him?
Considering the fact it is made after a true story it makes it even more special.
Joao feels the attraction and after losing Renatinho, he asks the friendly Amador, who owns a bar in the Lapa district to give him a chance to perform in the style of the great divas of the era.
As you should remember, at the end of Phantasm III Mike disappeared into the darkness after the Tall Man did some kind of unnecessary brain surgery on him and Reggie was literally left hanging after being pinned to the wall by a dozen killer spheres.
The non-closure of Phantasm IV keeps the story alive after the credits roll instead of finishing it for good.
Especially right after calling on every ounce of her physical and emotional being to save herself from his terror.
And especially not long after the vicious sexual murder of a dear employee---for whom she shows less emotion, but more than what she showed for the original very local victim, which was none at all.
Still, the film does have a strange charm and there are some excellent character ideas regarding the schoolteacher (content with her celibacy long after a bad relationship) being seduced?
But after getting off to a great start, once the real plot kicks in, Policewomen loses steam.
I am happy, however, to see that after Policewomen she went on to have a good career.
Stumped Police Inspector Grumbach(Roger Rudel)questions Helen after a second murder of a local girl married to a teacher she knows, Leon(Mario Beccara),bleeds upon the head of a student after a field trip into a cavern looking at prehistoric paintings.
This adds to the sudden shock, then, after the music stops and finally the reveal happens via blood dripping on the kid's sandwich.
The film is carried along by an eerie, quasi-apocalyptic score by Pierre Janse and Domonique Zardi, which haunts long after the film has ended.
He goes back to mom, after a while the gangsters shoot into the house and the boy tells his mom everything and says that he is sorry.
As for the film itself, many will find themselves laughing at the plot--after all, just about every boxing film clichÃ© is present.
Male lead Hugh Trevor, who plays wayward boxer Bobby Martin, died in 1933 at only the age of 30 due to complications after an appendectomy.
Mal St. Clair, after working with Chaplin, developed a reputation as a great director with a light touch -- certainly his Rin-Tin-Tin features are good.
It's a shame she didn't go on to do more after this movie.
One wonders whether Charles 'Lucky' Luciano ever saw this movie and used this element of it's plot as his blueprint for the 'syndicate' which he adopted after the murder of crime boss Salvatore Maranzano a year later.
It's not long after louie's departure that old gang fueds come to the fore once more and gangland killings escalate.
Mobster Louie Ricarno, after uniting all the gangs in Chicago under one organization, tries to quit crime.
Because it was made only a few years after talking pictures debuted, it suffers from a few defects that were related to the technology--such as an over-reliance on long shots--making the film look a bit "stagy".
I would like to have seen a better resolution of the Ricarno/Mileaway relationship, particularly since Cagney's character just disappears after his 'confession', and even more so because of his heavily implicated fling with Ricarno's wife - very risquÃ© stuff for the 1930's.
Well,not in my Dad's instance,because when my Dad saw the film on the Screen, it was shortly after Bogart's death and Cagney was already a long since established star.But still a treat nonetheless.
In fact so carried away do they get that they are soon chasing after the little chap in various stages of undress eager to get him stripped off, God or no God!
Radio Days presents a time when America was dealing with the Great Depression and its after effects and the horrible event that was World War II.
The second comment after about an hour was that this movie is scarier than any slasher flick that we've seen.
I couldn't take it after around 25 minutes.
But I wanted to warn those after me to not waste their time.
While the plot structure and most of the characterization weren't fantastic, the comedy was after all fairly effective most of the time, and the movie also managed to maintain the serious story quite well.
It's a very good and rare old style kungfu movie with a slightly slow start after the first fight scene with Lau, but gets a lot better very quickly.
Wu Jing should be getting more roles after last years Sha Po Lang, and his skills do not disappoint here either.
Its great to see that Lau can still hold a kung fu fight sequence after around 40 years in the business.
Why didn't this movie get released properly, after watching all the extras on the DVD, this is exactly what you feel.
He's trying to sell the gland to an American company, and the Chinese have hired a mildly amusing redneck assassin to go after him.
I have never seen martial arts action as good as this before - move over Jackie Chan - Dacascos is after your crown if this is anything to go by.
Wonderful stuff, MUCH better than the hundreds of films etc jumping on the HK bandwagon after the success of The Matrix.
Mark Dacascos became one of my favourite action stars after I watched this movie, but then unfortunately no other film with him in was any good (much like Rutger Hauer - see Bladerunner and Split Second).
I saw drive after a friend recommended it to me.
I thought that this movie was excellent, I watched it after a recommendation from a friend.
The plot simple: Willis's character, Jack Mosley, the tired cop even more tired after a night's work sitting in an apartment where some drug dealers have been killed and waiting with the stiffs until the medical examiner can get there, has one more chore to take care of before he can knock off and go home--most likely to drink himself to sleep.
The scriptwriter, Richard Wenk, really knows how to structure an effective film as, once the chase begins, the film doesn't let up until nearly the end: time after time, you wonder: how's he going to get out of this?
Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious that you could see it coming 10 minutes in front, so after a while everything that happened started to annoy me.
I quit the movie after 36 minutes so one might think it is unfair to judge.
As it turned out the final results in Ohio mirrored the elections total 50 state results with Bush besting Kerry, after being behind in the early voting by as much as 28%, 50.7% to 48.3%.
I left feeling that the filmmakers had to turn a blind eye to those questions in order to get the story they were after.
Stallone is a strong man who can run after bears and shoot with bazookas, but he is absolutely not apt to play a normal human being with feelings.
But the film loses its steam after the opening credits.
In the new version you also got to see where Richie's wife and daughter were coming from when Jack shows up after years.
Bruce Willis was great as an overweight, alcohol-addicted, cop named Jack Mosley who is transporting witness Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) 16 blocks to testify against Jack's precinct after seeing them doing some nasty things.
This trend started, I believe, sometime during the early 90s, probably after his last big hit, "Cliffhanger."
I really noticed the way the film's editing and photography changed towards the end of the film, after beating up McCarty (McGinley) in the elevator.
Yes, this is old fashioned about a girl spending a night with a man, a married man, but after all, the film was made in 1935.
But at about two-thirds into the movie and after she has read his manuscript, she has a strong and wonderful scene with Sten where she discusses the hypothetical endings for the novel.
And then finally after she runs off -- she and the audience get to hear the sound effect of pigs squealing as they're being butchered.
Did she leave him after all?
Just don't make them close friends because after they see this on your shelf, they'll never look at you the same way again.
Even after Mosley wedges the hi-jacked bus into an alleyway with no outlets they manage to elude their pursuers.
Notice the images Hitch places on the screen after an angry mob hunts down the handcuffed Lodger.
All the players are fine with no real standouts except for Novello, who had a very successful career in silents (16 films) but retired from talking films after only 6 to become one of England's most influential composers until his death in 1951.
I saw this silent Hitchcock after seeing about twenty other Hitchcock, all the famous ones from the forties, fifties and sixties.
At Age 27 after three films (two of which are lost, the other, witch was "The Pleasure Garden") Hitchcock Culminated his first seminal quintessential film ,it was raised in the schools or Berlin and Was hailed as the Greatest British Picture Ever Made at the time, Its A theme He would Return to many years later in Frenzy made outside the golden age of his successes in Hollywood.
The other scenario I had some problem with involves the mob chase after the lodger and Daisy leave the pub - just where did ALL those people come from?
Presumably it was late evening with most people staying safe at home, but it looked like a hundred plus people were after the innocent victim.
Ivor Novello, as the title character, is a quiet and mysterious man who appears at a boarding house soon after the seventh murder is committed.
I wasn't as angry after watching a film as I was after watching '16 Blocks' for a long long time.
Yes it takes place ten years after the last one and yes it has a new guy.
The L.P got lost in 1975 when I got married and moved but I have just bought the new D.V.D which is really great to see again, after all the years.
So have I, and after watching it, I realized that people just didn't get it.
I was initially drawn to it because of the involvement of one of my heroes, Marlon Brando, and after seeing it the first time, I thought, "What were they thinking?".
I think if you still want to see it after hearing how bad the acting is, then it's your time and your money to wasted.
The thick military man and the unimaginative mother wake up to the truth when they see the creature and everyone lives happily ever after.
His father, a veteran of the War, hasn't seen home in years, and is presumed dead after his ship was sunk.
He cares for it, looks after it, and calls it his greatest friend.
A spot of overacting, but he just looks plain weird in this role after that disaster of a sequel to Basic Instinct.
Definitely worth a watch after all the mess they've made with movies based on the Loch Ness Monster.
It hatches into a creature that he's never seen before, but as a doting father he takes in the creature as his own, calling it Crusoe after Robinson Crusoe.
This boy finds a small shining stone and brings it to his house and in the morning after the stone was brought, the stone is not there, instead there are pieces of it, and there in that room a small creature is present.
It's a film that asks you to slow down and inhale the best scents of life's memories quoting Cicero's line about actors leaving the stage quietly after achieving their best!
Also, Richard is known to have had great religious zeal, vowing to take up the cross after hearing of the aftermath of the Battle of Hattin and even using his own riches to finance the crusade.
One scene is especially interesting in how the film presents Christianity and the crusaders: after the battle for Acre, a soldier who is weak and dying in King Richard's arms says, is in a blissful state, that he is dying but he "touched the 'True Cross.'"
Made after the dreaded (and stifling) Hays Code came into force, it's not as bloodthirsty as the afore-mentioned THE SIGN OF THE CROSS Â even so, the battle scenes are quite realistic (with the clanging of heavy steel being heard as the opposing armies clash in a confusion of warriors and horses) and may well have influenced Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander NEVSKY (1938).
Boasting superlative photography (Victor Milner's work in this capacity presented the film with its sole Oscar nomination) and massive crowd scenes, the film survives as tremendous entertainment even after all these years.
England was in medieval chapter 11 after he was done.
And after that it's one blunder after another.
After the release of Ridley Scott's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and 70 years after the premiere of DeMille's CRUSADES, I found it interesting to see the film.
However, after the two great epics of the early 1930s, he made a movie about a different historical period, the infamous crusades that aimed at protecting the Holy Land from the Muslim "infidels".
Bruce Willis portrays Jack Mosley, a alcoholic cop who, after a long day of work, has to escort a prisoner to a trial for a testimony.
Mysteriously, this film started filming shortly after Chuck Palahniuk's Haunted was released.
Now after her life turns around for the positive she soon realizes that her breast are vampire boobies feeding on human blood which doesn't go to well for her lovers.
I used to enjoy watching her, but after this torture, not any more.
However, watching this movie after catching the director's excellent "To Live" again, "Shanghai Triad" does not strike one as a lesser movie.
This occurs when she is forced to go with the Boss to the country after a rival has attempted to kill him.
However, after "Miss" delights in calling him a country bumpkin, and chews him out a couple of times, (And why not, Shuisheng can't tell a red dress from a green one.)
Soon after he arrives, the boy is witness to a power play in the underworld that results in the uncovering of lots of treachery and quite a bit of violence.
Therefore, the black servants have nothing to do with scaring them away, because they just hide behind curtains, get covered in flour after jumping in the flour, or hide in a huge pair of trousers, or caught the Uncle in disguise as a ghost!
Hmmm, after reading the others' comments on "Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie", I am wondering if they really watched the same movie.
And if the painfully clear moral of the film wasn't drop-dead obvious enough, after the out-of-no-where fourth act comes an epilogue.
The person just keeps on talking, snickering at himself from time to time, and after a while, you just start to think, "it's funny, but who really cares?"
By far the best is when Darth Vader calls the Emperor after the Death Star has just been destroyed - "what's an aluminum falcon?!"
It was rather inspiring to me after I had watched it all the way through.
Time after time, I wonder how Robot Chicken will top itself and always it does.
All I know is that after seeing "The Phantom" and then "Nola", I was just so let down:-( She seemed almost "average", which she is anything but!!
Plus, the screening that I went to was the Arizona premiere, so writer/director Alan Hruska and story consultant/assistant producer Patina Cole were there to do a Q&A after the screening.
The story about a young man, Peter Vadassy (Mason), being framed for espionage seemed to me a bit weak, at the outset: the local gendarmerie allow him to go free so that he can help trap the real spy, after he proves, sort of, that he is not the guilty party.
Hey, it was wartime, so it was good propaganda, I guess...  At 85 minutes, it was a nice break after a busy day and the office...my PC!
But after a while, you kind of start liking it!
It's a sanitarium she was put in after a breakdown she was told happened to her but she can't remember.
Moore and Willis (who went on to marry after reportedly meeting on this film) are particularly effective.
Harrison Muller and Woody Strode are reunited after their triumphant 1982 classic "The Final Executioner" for this completely idiotic Italo action non-epic from certified hack Fernando di Leo.
Nothing makes sense: Silva recites his lines like he's talking to a 3-year-old, Muller is glib at all the wrong times (he's strung up and about to be killed by Strode, and he keeps asking for a beer), weeks seem to go by, yet Silva (who, despite his top billing, has hardly any screen time after the opening sequence) and the people at the CIA always seem to be wearing the same wardrobe, and Muller & Silva even kiss at one point.
The action takes place in a small, enclosed camp, with Muller and the girl running from building to building, yet Strode and the most poorly-trained, inefficient platoon this side of "Gomer Pyle USMC" can't seem to see them, and even when they do, they all run after them one at a time, enabling Muller to easily dispose of them.
Film, after all, is a visual medium.
I couldn't figure out if he had a good speaking voice or I was just so used to hearing it after growing up with "Superman."
But he's very effective, and it's sad that after serving in the war, he couldn't get his career back on track.
However, she does a good job as a tough but motherly woman, protective of her nurses and quite the rule-breaker herself after she meets John.
I have read about SHADOWZONE's comparison to ALIEN, but the only similarity I noticed was the plot regarding characters roaming the halls and rooms of the facility as the being is somewhere in the vicinity..some attempting to put food together for the long haul with Hickock & Wiley attempting to repair the damaged transformer after the mishap regarding the being's entry into our universe.
I came to this film after having watched Wajda's "Ashes and Diamonds," which I consider to be one of the finest films I have seen.
The story must be autobiographical to some extent, since we see Agnieszka encountering political opposition to her digging too deeply into the past trying to reconstruct Birkut's life and figure out why he essentially dropped from the scene after having been so highly visible; there is also a famous film director in the movie whom we get to know well.
Finally, after exhaustive work and putting herself out on a limb politically, she finds out how the repressive government worked during the Stalin years--taking a hero and eventually jailing him as a political prisoner and then erasing memories of his existence.
I felt the story was very predictable, no surprise what happens after Debby and Rick sleep together.
Meanwhile, Ben Gazarra, still suave after all these years, is romancing Uma's mom, Gina Rowlands.
For this movie is about the devastating effects of social isolation on people who don't want to be alone and after a lot of struggle finally realize that all they have are each other.
Tragically flawed with low self-esteem, she covers it up with fantasies of happily ever after, even fooling herself, while the more level-headed, but also flawed Beth tries to do her best to stay happy with her absent-fathered daughter and inject a little reality into Deb's world.
Thats what happened to me after seeing this film!
It's sad how she goes after the one man she should have avoided in the worst way.
The director could have lost him after using him for the comedy factor.
Three men, Aditya Shrivastav, Manav Shrivastav and Deshbandhu Roy are thrown out of their rented house after failing to pay rent for several months and find themselves homeless as they are not employed.
The twist to the situation , when they have to part with their prized booty , after going through so much of agony and calamities , is a real feather in the cap of the script writer .
Normally , the money either goes down the drain , or flies in the air , or the characters are after each other with fatal gun shots .
I have stopped expecting originality after the 'jaane bhi do yaaro' days and am being probably a bit too harsh in saying that but I cannot help it as the Hollywood movie scripts copied shamelessly over (well the ones that can be, that is) are usually the movies that i have already seen.
Ruth (Doris) is alone, elderly, and all her days basically the same after she lost her husband.
She sent me her autographed photo last year after I wrote her to compliment her biography and ask for confirmation for a recipe in her book.
How could someone sit back after making it and think 'Yeah, this is a good movie, I'm pleased with it'?
Unfortunately, what I found after sitting through it was nothing but a bunch of clichÃ©s and stereotypes, and very little real understanding of the issues facing a gay teen.
The positive message: It's okay to be gay (if that's what you want to be after watching all of poor Bobby's trails and tribulations).
I remember talking about this movie right after it played on t.v.
The only thing that stood out as a positive was the scene where Bobby's teacher talks with him after school and writes "I am gay" on the board (I think it was the guy who played Tyne Daly's husband in "Cagney and Lacey") and tells him he'll be okay.
In 2018, after an unsuccessful attack to a Skynet facility, only John Connor (Christian Bale) survives, but he discovers that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800.
It was dumped on TV over the summer after the movie came out, I guess after the Powers that Be decided not to make the series.
Ricardo Tubbs(..the ever smooth and cool Philip Michael Thomas), a cop in New York, traces a Colombian crimelord to Miami(..his brother was murdered by this man's gun-toting henchmen after a transfer of dope money, interfering with their drug sting)where the city's undercover detective Crockett(Don Johnson) has been attempting to catch him as well.
Neither know the other is after the same man, both seeking revenge for the murder of a partner(..Crocket's partner was collateral damage when a drug dealer they were playing, having decided to go out on his own, was blown up with a bomb strapped under his truck).
No doubt this show not influenced television but movies after it's debut on network television.
But this film didn't do anything for me and I totally forgot about it after I left the theater.
People get hurt or killed in painful, stomach-churning ways (I had trouble sleeping for a few days after seeing the movie), and some victims are unexpected, too.
I had some reservations about this movie after seeing the initial IMDb ratings and director McG's efforts on Charlie's Angels, admittedly an altogether different movie, but it left me with the impression McG was a bit of a goofy idiot.
I finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel, "X2", but I have now seen it more than once, and it is good.
For some reason, one unbeknownst to anyone in the X-Mansion, Magneto and his evil mutants are after either Logan or Rogue, two recent arrivals at the mansion!
Cyclops, Jean Grey, Ororo a.k.a Storm), who help them after an accident.
Its understandable to see why Christian bale did his rant, after caring about a script and doing so well in his own performance, and being let down by the director and some dodgy lighting ;)  4 the next one i suggest any talented story director, Michael bay and jerry bruckheimer maybe?
The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise.
Still Hugh Jackman was awesome and it managed to entertain me, and that's all I was after.
Furthermore the movie seems like 20 minutes too long, the part after Manu's death doesn't fit in at all.
The day after Mrs. Ashboro's funeral her 15 year-old pet cat Margaret suddenly passes away from a broken heart.
Margaret not only saving the lives of Natalie Kurt as well as the animal's in Brenda's animal shelter but taking off after the fleeing arsonists and giving them the shock to end all shocks that they'll never forget for the rest of their lives.
4.Encounter of ayesha with her brother where she asks her that after killing girls to save their HONOUR what was he seeking now?.This scene is superb.
Excellent camera work, fluent and appropriate use of Punjabi script and great top notch acting by Kiron Kher along with many veteran Pakistani actors will leave you full of emotion after you see the film.
The subtitles could be a bit better for the Non-Punjabi viewer, and i think a little more spotlight should have been put on how and why the religious fundamentalist gathered such momentum in a nation leaning more towards Moderate rule after Bhutto's regime.
I am at a loss of words after watching this one which is more than a film, it is an experience therefore, the only words in which this masterpiece can be described are adjectives-mind blowing, shocking, great in narrative and style, simple and subtle, poignant, brilliant exposition.
Bad title, good movie, and I am torn, after seeing it between joining the NRA, the next anti gun violence rally on the south side, Googling wet nurses, or renting The Best of Bugs.
Owen does his usual suave-with-grease-on-his-face action, and Giamatti is wonderful - after he hits 10, he goes on to 11, 12 and 13, threatening to burst several blood vessels at any moment.
I've been looking forward to this film for about 4 months after I saw the description.
As I said, the plot doesn't make much sense, but it basically follows Clive Owen trying to save the baby he rescues after its mother dies giving birth in the middle of a shoot out, while protecting it from the evil Paul Giamatti and his henchmen.
I enjoyed the rest of the movie after it, but that part kind of killed the buzz for me.
He handles the special and visual effects very well, as the only sequence that requires a lot of effects is directed and run-through so quickly you don't have time to criticize and laugh at the effects (especially after seeing Transformers and At World's End).
The main problem of Shoot em' Up is that it had to follow after similar yet amazing powerhouse action flicks like Kill Bill, Sin City, and Grindhouse.
Key roles from Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti were very much so treasured by the film, Owen who finds himself chucked into a very forceful memorable scene with him taking on a gang of street goons after the life of a pregnant woman, and Giamatti playing a very imposing laughable 'Pussy with a gun' see's the film make great use of CGI, great acting, comedy, action and a odd bit of story to make a sight for sore eyes.
What does the baby have to do with this crazed hit-man (play by Paul Giamatti) who's after him?
Writer/director Michael Davis has loaded the film with one unforgettably imaginative image after another: spent shell casings bouncing off a pregnant woman's stomach, a gun dropping in an unflushed toilet, a hand with bullets between the fingers shoved into a fireplace as an improvised weapon.
Heck, a hail of gunfire follows shortly after EVERYTHING in this movie, usually including other hails of gunfire!
For no reason Smith takes the baby of a dead woman (whom he helped deliver...in a frenetic shootout nonetheless) and decides to protect the infant from Paul Giamatti (dropping his nice-guy smugness, and superbly playing his diabolical villain with maniacal glee) and his army of goonish gunmen (why are they even after it?).
Its both funny and exceptionally filmed; the dialogue another homage to the stupidity of action films (among Smith's witty remarks: "Eat your vegetables" he laments after impaling a man with a carrot).
And it succeeds; staging endless fight after fight in every way imaginable, never repeating itself and quite literally ending with a bang.
Specially so soon after the events themselves.
Ex-commander Steiger and three of his army buddies go to Canada for a little duck hunting.Steiger,grieving for his son lost in the Vietnam War, gets ballistic when he finds out that Huffman,who's running the camp,is a deserter.A violent shootout occurs as Steiger and his friends go after Huffman and his girlfriend Mattson with tragic results.
"Wolf Lake" plays like an exciting mix of "Deliverance","Straw Dogs" and "Open Season".It's a tense and extremely well-acted survival thriller with some great scenes of violence.The shootout begins after the rape of Huffman's girlfriend.So if you are a fan of survival cinema you can't miss "Wolf Lake".It's a crying shame that such obscure Canadian movies are still unavailable on DVD.9 out of 10.
A group of war veterans turn up for a week of shooting, drinking etc, but find the cabin being looked after by a young man named David and his girlfriend.
I understand when it ran originally, and that it was in rerun mode for sometime after that.
It was a grand series that lasted for more than three seasons,ending on Independence Day of 1961 after more than 96 episodes.
So much so, I slept with my parents after watching a few episodes.
As "worked up" as Bale must have had to have been in order to pull off these angst-filled scenes (one after the other after the next), he exhibited amazing control in not HITTING the guy who blew the scene for him.
Bryan Cranston, kept me laughing all night long, and Judge Reinhold right after him.
They both dislike each other and are always fighting and at war with each other and after watching several or more episodes of the series this becomes really irritating and just makes you want to jump into your TV set and strangle them both.
I'm shocked its still on TV after three or four years now.
First I watched this cartoon 2 years ago, after three episodes I understood that this is stupid cartoon about stupid unreal people.
Never explaining the origins of the tragedy, the after effects of the tragedy, nor the eventual lessons learned and the healing of the tragedy.
I thought it was simply some PR joke have black actors reading the stories of former slaves, but after watching it and seeing the pictures and hearing the sounds I understood.
The scene Nadia (Gina McKee) went back home after she had sex with Tim (Stuart Townsend).
), Rise of the Machines- 2003, not bad, especially considering that after T-2, that was it for Cameron, he was done, moving on to new things, new writers, new director, great rewritten history of Skynet reemerging after we all thought it was TERMINATED.
So...after about a year of hype (for myself especially, I am as the equivalent of a Trekkie in the Terminator universe), 2009, Terminator Salvation...Not groundbreaking, but with Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, McG, Seems like a damn good collection of actors and up and coming director right??
But after being a member of Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half the people on there were 10 to 13.
I guess Inuyasha is a little kid anime after all.
Nonetheless, the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series.
When I first began watching it I loved it and tried to watch every episode, but after a while my interest in Inuyasha began to fade and I found myself tuning out around the time the episode count rounded 80, the problem was that the show began to progress at a snail's pace and we were all left with these story plots repeated over and over again in a slightly altered fashion each turn: 1.
(It was good the first three times, after that it got boring.)
Mainly, Inuyasha is a very good series up until the midway point, don't get me wrong, there are still several episodes that are good after episode 100 but later on in the series most of the characters you have come to love begin to have nothing to do except for stand on the sidelines while Inuyasha fights and they occasionally interfere.
But I guess they just had no ideas of what to do after?
I agree with the people who say to only watch about half of them, they just get a bit annoying after a while.
I use to think Tenchi is the best Anime show well Inuyasha beats him up Inuyasha is the best anime title I ever saw it has everything good storyline Authentic characters emotions love a bit fantasy and suspense the series is a masterpiece you get drawn in after two eps I was sceptical until I realised i found mt self looking for new epson the web   The Authors and the series directors deserve all their credits I feel bad That Kanna will die but I cant wait till they continue with the series !
Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films, I can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime.
But after that, it simply becomes dull and tedious.
The big bad of the show, Naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost his touch after a while.
After a series of events after the tales and a pair of wet underpants it shows their version of what happened during one of the deadliest prison riots in history killing 111 prisoners.
By the end of that day, 111 prisoners lay dead, the victims of the riot police who stormed the facility and brutally massacred them - even after they'd surrendered their weapons.
But all that changes in the last half hour of the film after the riot has begun and we see the prisoners gunned down in cold blood, many of them while cowering in their cells.
This film opened in this country recently, right after another prison massacre in Brazil, where inmates were killed after they rioted.
Sociopolitical context: This movie is perfect if you want to understand why the PCC (Primeiro Commando da Capital) was founded after the Carandiru Massacre of '92.
I saw Carandiru after seeing Takeshi Kitanos "Zatoichi" at the Toronto Film  Festival.
It's a true victory, but after seeing this movie (in the Haifa film festival), I know there's something better.
The brutal massacre in the end kills almost everybody, after building in us pure hope, not through melodramatics (no rape scenes or male nudity for example), but through hard realism.
In December of 2002, after all the inmates were tranfered, Carandiru was demolished.
One story after the other, well paced and well Told.
My sister did not turn vigilante (even tho she would have liked to) but we did not have an arrest until 5 1/2 years later.He confessed after being arrested for the kidnapping and rape of a 9 year old neighbor girl who thankfully escaped.
inmate search page http://165.201.143.205/kasper2/offender.asp?id=25440  My sister, Belinda, and Kim divorced several years after Amanda was murdered.
The movie title, and one of its main axis, comes after a fragment of a poem written by Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, called 'Llanto por la muerte de Ignacio SÃ¡nchez MejÃ­as', dedicated to the death in 1934 of a Spanish Torero.
It's a 10 out of 10, poetically revealing modern life in a city relegated to Neanderthal living conditions after the Taliban was sent packing.
The country's problems (among them: live buried mines, religious extremism, the absence of basic social commodities - water / education - after several wars) serve as the antagonist as Noqreh's father carts her and her extended family across the Afghan dustbowl in search of her brother, The film moves slowly and deliberately, but I guarantee you'll be paid for your time investment with a once in a lifetime education about Afghanistan.
This movie will be very moving, if you can sit still and take the opportunity to be drawn into the disturbing situation of a destroyed Kabul after 25 years of war.
My only quibble concerns the decision to pattern Lewis Stadlen's Banjo after Jimmy Durante's version in the film, rather than Harpo Marx (upon whom the character was originally modelled), but that's a matter of personal taste.
I just got back from seeing a midnight screening of the newest installment in The Terminator franchise, going into it with an open mind after witnessing the debacle that was T3 several years ago.
I actually did spend two days in Paris, back in August 2004, and did all the touristy things one could do in those short 48 hours, like visit the unmissable landmarks such as Le Tour Eiffel, visited babes Mona Lisa and Venus at the Louvre, tried to look for the hunchback at Notre Dame, paid my respects at Napoleon's casket, and ended the night partying after a dinner watching a French revue.
This is a wonderful movie that leads straight into a finale with falling curtains and standing ovations ... finally after so many movies who let you down in the end.
Brian Lackey is a boy who, also at the age of eight, experiences a traumatic event after blacking out for several hours and waking up to a bloody nose.
His performance deserved more attention than it was given, but Gordon-Levitt is clearly on the verge of breaking out after roles in the outstanding 'Brick' and this year's 'The Lookout'.
It also has bizarre parallels and clues that didn't occur to me until hours after I'd seen it.
To the point where, after this scene, I realized I wasn't just watching a "cool" Sundance Indie...I wasn't just watching a Gregg Araki film...
The film is jarringly penetrative and pervasive: the visuals in your mind play over repeatedly and the disconcerting but intellectually uplifting feeling "Mysterious Skin" infuses lies active long after you leave the theater.
Brian that same year describes how his perpetual and mysterious string of blackouts and bloody noses began one rainy night after a baseball game.
Many will cast it aside as tripe and trash (along with other morally relative films), but those fortunate enough to engage themselves in the movie's discussion will revel in it long after the credits' close.
The other students start mysteriously disappearing, and when LeStrange gets on board the school, he and another teacher, Janet Playfair, (Suzanna Leigh) take the case to the police, who round up the town and charge after the Karnstein family help up in their castle.
Out of sheer luck, I happened to find a screening in Las Vegas, almost a year after the initial release, having finished the book only one day before.
While Brian is seeking him out, Neil earns enough money to travel to New York, where he continues his lifestyle until, in a scene I found difficult to watch, he is drugged, beaten and raped by one of his clients, after which he goes back home to his mother (played by Elisabeth Shue).
It's difficult to get "Mysterious Skin" out of your head after you see it, and part of its strength comes from the two leads: Brady Corbet as Brian, and especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Neil.
She sounds to him a world-weary adult, after all that has happened she tells Barksdale to basically, move on.
Glynnis O'Connor and Robby Benson, are re-teamed after their excellent debut in JEREMY.
Her acting skills are quite, quite bad and she doesn't have much in the way of actual personality but, good grief, Yutte remains one of the loveliest women I have ever lusted after in movie form and is absolutely the right choice for a film with this very title.
But after one moron breaks the husband murdering previous owner's tombstone in half, she comes back to life and starts killing them.
Villon went so far into obscurity that we do not know when he died after leaving Paris.
The monarchy after leading France to an ultimate victory in the Hundred Years War against the English, was leader of a shattered land with many of the lesser lords quite a bit more powerful than the king.
It's like watching a production of Pygmalion after seeing My Fair Lady.
The premise is simple: A group of young film makers (think hot, scantilly clad babes) break into a dilapidated movie studio hours from the wrecking ball (the studio was closed years before after the tragic accidental death of a teen idol)to make the last movie ever there.
Strange things begin to happen and they wonder if the place was cursed after the event that led to it's closure 20 years before: the death of a young star while shooting a scene.
I stumbled in to "The Mind of the Married Man" after HBO had the unmitigated audacity to cancel it, so critiquing the show is pointless post-mortum.
Racketeer on the run Mike Bardoni (Noel Madison of "G-Men") arrives after Whitey Cole.
Another ambitious gangster, Tim Winfield (Robert Middlemass of "Cain and Mabel"), has forced Bardoni out of the rackets after Bardoni built them up, and the authorities want to arrest Bardoni.
His understated and nuanced interpretation of this complex character contributes a level of patois to the scene that is memorable long after the credits roll.
Maya's conduct was similar, especially when she was William's assistant, and even after she was rightly fired.
She also wanted to make Darnell miserable after they broke up, calling him over to pick fights with him Wasn't she the one who cheated?
Did Lynn say she wanted to burn down Joan's house after she was kicked out?
Did she also want to do the same after Toni fired her as her assistant at her new real estate office?
Richard Lestrange (Michael Johnson) ventures up to the Karnstein castle after hearing that the Karnstein's are vampires and that a young girl from the village is now missing.
This film might be a comedy after all.
Like I said, they aren't bad, but it gets to be a bit much after a while.
The only reason I didn't rate this amazing film higher is that after a while it all becomes a tad tedious, as this is NOT a film with a lot of commercial appeal.
Two years after they had solemnly admitted their feelings for one another, they meet again.
At this critical juncture it becomes manifestly clear that God, after all, is indeed a damnable thing.
I rated it quite highly for many reasons including Judy Davis' acting, the strength with which the director was able to convey its message, the strong supporting cast, the exquisite shots (particularly in their composition) often lengthy in duration that so wonderfully show what action/adventure films cannot including again subtlety, nuance and the ability to make the viewer actually think-both during and for long after the film is viewed
This notion of space, inadequate enclosure, book and heroine conflated into them and weaving through them was copied after a fashion in the opening for the 2005 "Pride and Prejudice."
Judy Davis and Sam Neill were incredible together, and I'm happy to say they would be in two other films together after this one.
Even twenty odd years after I first saw it, this film makes me want to cheer.
Another one of the funniest parts is when Tom is trying to locate the ball far off into the distance and Jerry whistles to him after a while only to reveal he had the ball the whole time.
The acting was first-rate, controlled and very realistic - the scene in which the widowed woman reaches the end of her tether after maintaining steely control of herself for so long, and bursts into unstoppable tears, had my wife and I weeping in sympathy.
This is another one of these incredible animated shorts that was done with painstaking patience, taking a lot of time to do just one frame, and then doing thousands after it to make an eight-minute movie.
All these nasty relatives want Granny dead and want all her money and fortune, after the dinner, granny decides to drink the potion but it ends up killing her......
Best seen with the guys, after having a few beers.
I saw this film on cable not long after its release and remember enjoying it.
For some reason I have had a DVD copy of the film in my collection for some time now, probably a b-day gift or some such, and I never watch itÂLast night, sixteen years after it first appeared, I watched it again.
I really wish Mike Myers can go back to doing comedies like this because after seeing The Love Guru, I lost all hope in Mike Myers.
This episode marks the re-disappearance of Mulder after David Duchovny decided to take his toys and go home.
However, after seeing these installments over and over again in reruns, they've found a soft spot in my heart.
But when little black girl Carolyn Crawford falls down a well, she's feared to have been kidnapped, and this after having last being seen with a white man in town.
There is after all a little girl missing here.
The Count also disappears after this murder.
Almost a decade on, after the success of Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, he released his final two gialli, namely Five Dolls For An August Moon and Bay of Blood.
As the credits roll after the final act of homicide, the viewer is left in little doubt that the film they have just witnessed has a very black humour at its core.
This is Bavaâs third âbody countâ movie after BLOOD AND BLACK LACE (1964) and FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON (1970); however, given that teenagers are also involved here, this is the one which became the virtual template for all the teen slashers which stormed Hollywood in the late 1970s/early 1980s.
Tim Lucasâ audio commentary on the new Anchor Bay disc imparts a lot of information despite having the occasional silent passage: most interesting was the filmâs genesis as Dino De Laurentiisâ initial foray into the giallo genre (he eventually backed out of the project) and as a collaboration between prolific genre screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti and Mario Bava (after the former had had a falling out with Dario Argento) - but Lucas informing us about the sad fate of some of the participants (heroin addiction, hardcore pornography, murder and incarceration, suicide) makes for a rather gloomy track.
Her killer is then murdered right after - putting the wheels in motion for 11 more grisly deaths.
The murderous husband is then killed immediately after, by an unseen assailant.
One killer uses a spade to tear open a beautiful Scandinavian woman's throat, shortly after burying that blade into a young man's face(..and subsequently pulling it out;a very impressive gruesome sequence that puts a lot of slashers to shame).
A prime piece of bayside real estate is being coveted by some ruthless and sadistic individuals; one body after another drops, hence the title "Reazione a catena", translated as "chain reaction" in English.
Back to the dialogue, this is one of those films that has you repeating the dialogue to your friends' days after and stealing the words for yourself.
I'm definitely going to be watching out for more Vince Rocca films, just as I kept the name Kevin Smith in my head after seeing Clerks.
The story takes place after the threesome at the Billiads store where they all work.
been watching the progress of this movie since i first found out about it on the view askew web board and knew i needed to see it.... after watching the trailer i knew it was going to be one of the greatest movies id be allowed to see by the evil gnomes who choose my movies very carefully.. the type of movie this is really isn't done enough and the quality of the writing will amaze you... its tough writing a review for something while not saying too much about it but i really hate to spoil movies for other people, as i hate having them spoiled for me... let me just say to you.... awesome frickin' awesome   check out Kisses and Caroms, you surely will not be disappointed...
It amazes me how even after you've completed a pretty darn good movie, you have to wait and wait for it to see any kind of release.
This film is modeled after the film Clerks but takes place on a billiards shop.
Lannie's dress get wet and she teases Jeff after getting naked.
Some anticlimactic artistry by director Richard Mailer: The debut sex scene of the highly sought after Kirstie Elizabeth "Traci Lords" Knussman is during a dream sequence.
Lannie has other plans after finding out what gets her hot.
To the guy from netherlands , first of all , she was arrested the day after her 18th birthday , would have been 8th may , thats late 87 is it ?
At first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, catches one's interest, but, after 15 minutes or so, you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.
There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted.
I know that the movie isn't "realistic," but it's fiction after all.
One goes to the video store and has to comb through aisle after aisle of violent, gory, immodest, indecent trash... and then you find a movie like this.
I'm still unclear on whether the sheriff was one of the seven mummies, whether he wanted the gold for himself or to protect it, or why he was after the amulet at all.
It's later that the Baron after confessing his love for Grusinskaya, and returning her stolen pearl necklace, decides to use the naive Otto in a card game of baccarat he set up.
***SPOILERS***It's then that Baron Felix finally sees the light and gives up his life of a cat burglar and con-artist but only after one last fling, in robbing Preysing room, which turned out to be fatal for him.
Watching it again, after so many years, was an enjoyable experience.
The pace of the film moves briskly and never slows as one major star replaces another in scene after scene.
And well there have been many movies after the year 2000 that have stories involving many people- with their own stories.
Watch her as she plays her scenes with John Barrymore......she is besotted with him after their night together.
i was left with lots of questions after this movie, but i still enjoyed watching it.
Here, what's on the page is clichÃ© after clichÃ© -- pretentious conceits that were already old and tired by 1932.
No detail was overlooked, and in terms of production values alone few films before or after have bested GRAND HOTEL.
Even after 70+ years, Grand Hotel remains just as brilliant and fascinating as it was to begin with -- if not more: each character is as dynamic and enthralling as the next, and each frame is filled with surprises and idiosyncrasies.
Realizing that she was a drama queen as a profession, I excused a lot of it, but it got to a point where I was really snickering to myself after awhile, because she was acting just like Gloria Swanson later would in "Sunset Boulevard".
Some seventy-odd years after its release in 1932, GRAND HOTEL today holds an interesting attraction more for the presence of its two leading ladies than from its cinematic power, although there will be some purists who will state that because the images of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo have been immortalized in their own respective canons, that in itself is cinematic power.
Radiant in love, one can only imagine the despair that awaits her after the film ends.
This documentary white washes neither sides' responsibility for the massacres perpetrated by both sides during and after WWI.
During his final years of being president of New World Pictures, Roger Corman produced another typical but fun car chase comedy starring Jimmy McNichol as a mischievous teenager who loves to steal cars and having the local sheriff and his bumbling deputies chase after him.
The convicts spend the latter part of the film just being chased by the sheriff, the mummies don't even join the pursuit after their one fight scene.
After realizing how many precious classic Dodge Chargers were destroyed during the "Dukes of Hazzard" TV run, it's also kinda sad to see a hot '57 Chevy banged up in chases (watch the disappearing dents, they used more than one of course) but the highlight definitely is that great crash by the '57 through the roof (where of course, McNichol simply keeps driving after the car lands).
And after two viewings of it I can't even tell you what the plot is of this mess.
The long story arc approach was brilliant; it got better and better after each episode.
This ninth "Friday the 13th" movie has some interesting story twists that were only then, after eight previous movies, being concocted.
It introduces new characters every after a killing which further alienates the viewers from the film.
The only way that Jason can return is by gaining a new body, and he does this immediately, jumping from body to body, killing person after person, ruining life after life.
Oh, one more point a friend brought to my attention: The hero of the movie sure can do a god job punching people after Duke breaks his fingers!
So does having the FBI go after him.
The other scene I liked was the end where Jason's mask is lying in the sand after he's been sent to hell, so Freddy Krueger reaches up to grab it.
Jason Goes to Hell is a sequel that brings something new to the franchise by having Jason destroyed at the beginning but he still lives through his heart and after making a coroner eat it he posses him and continues killing people until he finds a new host to put his heart in.
So Steve and Jessica confront Jason and after cutting the bodies head open Jason's heart that has sprouted a head, arms and tail crawls out and is thrown into the basement where he finds the body of his sister that he killed earlier on.
Now in his new form, the J-man sets out after his only remaining family members who are the only ones capable of killing him for good.
Seven Mummies starts out on a lonely desert road where a police transport vehicle has crashed, the five convicts can't believe their luck & after killing one guard & taking the other (Carina Vincent) hostage they set off across the inhospitable desert terrain towards the border.
Come on people: Jason X should have been shunned by any self-respecting fan after all the promos claimed this to be "The Final Friday".
In one laughable sequence, you would be forgiven for thinking "Jason" (or as I'd like to refer to him as...the Imposter) being reborn meant the world would end, however a mere 10 minutes or so after he was "reborn," he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger (who were the camp counselors who ignored Jason as he died...some ancient Sumarian or Egyptian people or something?
Jason is finally reborn after a red creature grows out of a man's slit throat and rapes a dead mother's corpse.
I dont care if it's WAY WAY to unrealistick that he comes back too life after being blown into billions of peaces.
Well to be honest, if the film would have ended after the first ten minutes, I would have been more satisfied than I was at the end of this film.
But the brainwave of having Jason possessing one body after another alters the very fabric of what made these films good.
The concept that even at this age, people can still maintain, grow and explore all forms of sensuality and sexuality is very appealing - kind of makes me feel that there is sex after 50!
Once after that, I asked my father if that was the, 'pirate from the silent movie', while we were watching something with Gilbert Roland.
Douglas Fairbanks Sr. stars in this exciting, action-packed swashbuckling pirate adventure yarn, as a young man seeking revenge on a band of pirates after they ransacked and destroyed his ship, killing his father.
There's a few plot holes and questionable plot twists here and there but it all holds up incredibly well after all these years although in today's world lead actress Billie Dove would have been given more to do.
Yet we first meet Mr. Justice Holmes and his lady right after that appointment, buying a new home for themselves in Washington, DC.
I was also delighted by Eduard Franz's underplayed portrayal of Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish justice on the US Supreme Court, after whom Brandeis University was named.
I couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best Â yet this film remained in my mind for days after I viewed it.
While the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit, director Jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery.
I had much the same feeling after seeing this film.
It's all downhill from there, and the film's climax is particularly absurd, as Crawford makes up with lover Robert Montgomery immediately after shooting him!
The movie ends about 40 seconds after 'Bingo' shoots Andy.
The theme song from the film, "Chant of the Jungle" (sung by Joan Crawford in the film) was a hit in 1929, when the film was made, and you'll be sure to get it stuck in your head even after the movie is over.
Montgomery was one of those actors recruited after the change from silents.
It's totally different from all her other roles, and I don't think, she played another similar part after...... Joan plays her part ''Bingo'', so charmingly & adorably...... (in a way, naive & innocent) It's really not something, Joan fans are used to watching......
after watching a couple of episodes... i was totaly hooked!
if you aren't a fan of Robbie yet, you will become after watching the show!
This was certainly an outstanding follow-up after the wonderful "Love Me or Leave Me" two years before.
A soundtrack album of his music from the film - issued at the time of the picture's release - is now a much sought after recording!
though two french stars(reno binoche) are trying to make their character genuine, their presence don't make a good story, you even wonder what sergi Lopez cameo's appearance is doing in this story?jean reno as a international business man is not very convincing and Juliette binoche plays as in a loreal commercial endorsement, after 20 minutes the intrigue is gone, and everything is just not believable if you like the plot you'd rather watch Philippe Lioret very good "airport" movie "TombÃ©s du ciel" with jean rochefort
Perhaps, 81 minutes is not enough to convince us that these two flawed and insecure individuals will overcome their past and live happily ever after but Binoche and Reno masterfully and elegantly created on the screen the possibility of love and readiness to accept it.
But, after the initial half hour, things get a bit bogged down, especially since most of the remainder is a dialogue between Rose and Felix and in a hotel room.
Not that she ignores the bigger picture, she does, after all, set her story in an airport and an adjacent hotel allowing a mere five minutes or so of non-airport/hotel screen time at the very end.
He is chasing after a woman he belives he still loves.
Time after time Reno feeds her the lines and she returns with the best moments of the film.
I saw all three versions of "A Star is Born" in the past, and enjoyed watching this original and the 1954 remake again after so many years.
Finally, after a messenger boy calls him by his wife's stage name ("Mr. Lester"), he snaps and goes back to drinking.
He can't stand the PRs insults about being supported by his wife, and after a brawl, he steps up to the bar to resume his drinking.
The next scenes show Lester and studio head Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) worrying about where Maine is after four days.
His companion gets mad when he finds out that he is a son of a murderer and prisoner so after one of the most tedious and hideously acted monologues ever, he starts a fight with the Jack (the hero).
The plot revolves around Federal Marshall Jack La Roca (Lou Diamond Phillips) who is after a fugitive on the run named "Rabbit" (Steven Williams) who just happens to have made a stop on Route 66.
This film is a riot from beginning to end, and after that, you will never forget the "Learning Machine" or Mr. Bruce, the sports teacher.
This is one of those movies you wipe the tears from your eyes after laughing so hard about.
Well, after a good shot of Venus the Nothingo, moles come and put sacks over their heads, dragging them into the ground and putting them in a room where they will be nicely kept docile.
Plus the ending after the expected ending is such a terrible letdown that it will leave a bad taste in most viewers mouths.
The other members of the expedition make their way down (Lafarge and a guide, who like Dr. Stuart, dies after falling down).
Even so, about half of this early section Â involving a group of archaeologists who climb a previously irreproachable mountain after stumbling upon relics belonging to a legendary 'lost' civilization Â is, amusingly, comprised of stock footage (some of it, apparently, from the celebrated German Silent 'mountain picture' THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU [1929])!
However, we're never told how the mutants evolved or, for that matter, just why a normal and inevitably beautiful girl should turn up among them after all this time (and whom they obviously consider a 'freak of nature'!).
When Agar retires, she goes with him and he must gently fend her off because, after all, he's a man of principle.
They believed Agar when he told them he was a messenger from the Gods, after all.
May Robson as the Grandma is good also, but a little tiresome after a while (I think it's more how her character was written than her acting abilities).
As Ritai's group tracks the poachers we see the after effects of their poaching.
Like a backpacking/trekking trip, you might have to think about what you saw or felt after you "come back".
I rented this one again after having remembered enjoying it when I was a kid.
And in this case, I wasn't all that thrilled after reading it.
Makes up for an interesting read, but the downside is, that the book becomes very repetitive after a while.
Strieber keeps on going over the same events that happened on two nights in such a way that after a while he really isn't adding anything new.
I just finished watching it for the 3rd time (after quite some years), and I like it better now.
I'm became a complete Walken fan after this movie (my first Walken experience if you will), and I won't reiterate the already spot-on comments.
We can hardly blame her, after all no woman should have to carry Flip's child.
Sure all films are in color today, but notice the rich, full-rigged use of color here, only a decade after talkies began.
The art deco, lavish production, haunting music, and scene after scene of "behind the scenes Hollywood", well they sure worked for me.
For some reason, I kept watching long after the movie got ridiculous.
I had thought that I might miss the music in this earlier version, but I found after having watched it that I didn't miss it at all.
How could you miss the point after seeing that?
There were some minor flaws to this epic show cast though, with the most obscene one being the fact that the character introductions are pretty much absent, seeing as everybody seemingly just pops up and goes away after a few scenes, to return later again.
At first I was put off this film due to the title 'Please Kill Me, I'm a F*ggot N*gger Jew', but after being constantly badgered by a friend I eventually sat down to watch itÂ Boy was I surprised.
I got this movie after reading a review on digitallyobssessed.com and I have to say I was plesantly suprised - a low budget horror film that actually had a brain - this is not your average teens in a wood horror film - a lot of care has gone into the construction of the story line and it really keeps you hooked to the end - there are some nice sfx and a great atomsphere and bizzarley an acting turn by Uri Geller.
Well worth a look - especially if you're after something a little bit fresher and more stimulating than a masked killer slicing and dicing people.
This is a super-hit movie of horror genre with Superstar Rajesh Khanna in the lead.The song Sang mere nikle and other songs of the film became a big hit.Danny had once sang a Nepali folk song which when telecast in TV, R D Burman had heard casually and remembered this tune so that he could use it in Danny's own production and based on that tune he made beginning tune of Sang mere.This film is rarely telecast in TV channels.Rajesh Khanna's movies were not doing well between 1976-79 with 12 movies flopping of which 4 were classics and had only 3 super-hits during the period.He bounced back with box office hits Amardeep,Aanchal,Kudrat,Dard,Thodisi Bewafaii and unsuccessful Redrose.Phir Wohi Raat is a super-hit film which came after he regained his box office rating after which he had a good phase till 1991 as a main lead hero.
I will not speak a word after this about its story.
on a whim i rented this flick after seeing a preview at a local video store.
The goat of the pack is the final vignette, a story titled after a Picasso painting that features prominently in story.
Watching this movie after seeing the French original is like reading wikipedia summary after reading 'Romeo and Juliet'.
He is set to spend the weekend with a Swedish girl, a cousin of a friend, but, when he runs into a beautiful, young, and married girl outside of the Picasso Museum, he has to run after her.
Best romantic scene is when Rochester thanks Jane for saving him from the bedroom fire - as Rochester holds onto Jane's hands, the glances they exchange and when Rochester says 'Jane' after a silent pause as she walks out of his room - speaks volumes.
The final lines said by Sorcha Cusack, taken out of the last chapter of novel (sadly missing in all the other TV and movie versions), are a sort of resume of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s faith in God: after helping both Jane and Rochester going through their ordeals, God blesses her supremely and judges him with mercy; so, there is reason to believe in God.
The direction manages to make Jane and Rochester's lengthy tete-a-tetes interesting - more than it ever did in the 1983 version - and the production values, for the time, are pretty good (a lovely touch - the wisps of smoke Rochester passes through after the fire).
The second is the parting scene after the aborted wedding.
It is fantastic that the powers that be have come to their senses and decided to re-release it after all these years.
Jayston managed to bring the character to life as none before of after him has managed; the viewer never has the feeling that he "plays", that he is artificial; he really becomes Rochester while on screen and looks like he feels any line and any movement he is acting.
This is a woman who RAPED and left semen behind, after she over came her ex, with the other woman present.
I am quite the horror buff, so after seeing that this movie was in the top 50 horrors of all time, I had to rent it.
By the way either before or after Stanwyck did a film at Warners, Christmas in Connecticut an infinitely better film.
I do admit, as far as explaining Bogie's character (Geofrey Carroll) with being mentally ill, the story is vague there... Their really is no reason or explanation as to why he tires of his wife / wives and decides to kill them off one by one after painting a morbid portrait of them....
Bogart plays a artist who's wife dies a mysterious death after he painted her as the Angel Of Death.
It's very interesting to see Bogart do insane, as it is to see Stanwyck do helpless damsel, after her stirling work as femme fatale in Wilder's Double Indemnity.
This is a Bogart masterpiece which, until after you've seen it, will leave you with a deficient attitude towards Bogart's greatness as one of the most versatile actors Hollywood ever produced.
It tells the story of Geoffrey Carroll(Bogart),a struggling artist who marries a wealthy woman,Sally(Stanwyck), after his supposed invalid wife dies.
Garrison, after being dumped again, meets a fellow female at Curves who brings her to the bar Les Bos (see the pun?
It is based from Mark Twain's Novel about two mischievous boys Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn who, after witnessing the murder of Doc Robinson, the town's undertaker by the evil, knife-throwing Injun Joe (who will remind you of Indiana Jones if you've seen it), they must sware in blood not to tell anyone.
The morning after the murder was committed, Injun Joe blames the whole thing on the town drunk, Muff Potter, saying that Muff committed the murder when Tom knows it was Injun Joe.
They swear an oath not to tell and sign in blood, for fear of Injun Joe coming after them.
Right after this our narrator says that she was just told that PVC is safe as table salt which is absolutely not what she was told.
Instead, after a few seconds, I realized this was a documentary.
There are also interviews with an Italian scientist, other American scientists, and a plethora of PVC victims who became seriously ill after exposure in the workplace to PVC.
From there the story moves - not always logically or comprehensibly, but - hey - this is a crazy comedy after all!
In fact, it was a movie that I "settled on" (after I saw the line for Gladiator).
I'm not going to give anything big away, but after Norm McDonald and Dave Chappelle realize they have failed to kidnap Mrs. Crock's dog, Chappelle let's out one of the funniest one-liners that I have ever heard.
Finally, Willard cannot take it anymore and after a ho-ho-hellish eruption at Crock on Christmas Eve he discovers that he will be fired the next day.
As their after dark heist for Crock's pet takes place, Willard and Rusty's dim minds cannot handle the pressure.
It's some three months after the accident that Prof. Constable starts to believe that there may well be something very psychologically wrong with him when one evening driving home he runs into, and almost runs over, a live Mary Constable walking along a lonely road.
Being a man of science Prof. Constable doesn't believe in anything like ghosts or the supernatural but after seeing and talking to Mary he starts to believe in it.
He lost his hair after a permanent he received for "Reap the Wild Wind," and eventually embraced baldness.
John Getz plays Senator Steven Abercombie III, an anti-immigrant politician who becomes governor of California after the actual Governor disappears due to Hispanic heritage.
It may seem hokey to some viewers that in the end, after all the Latinos (not just "Mexicans") disappear, they come back and are embraced by everyone who finally realized how important they are to the society.
Way too slow introducing things, and the inept caucasians and uncaring African-Americans just aren't amusing after the third or fourth wacky misunderstanding.
In real life we saw it all the way up the ladder of leaders after Katrina.
And after the credits roll, I found it to be a film that stayed with me for some time after - indeed, I am still trying to shake it from my mind.
I loved the scene of the hanging, after the guy deals the cards.
At the party, we follow a bleary-eyed Pete, who is lusting after Cheryl (Gillian Alexy), a girl whose good looks and sexual swagger magnetise every male she meets.
Even so, I'm still hankering after East.
I was extremely moved and impressed after watching this film, which is a rare experience in the current climate of Australian films, which tend to stereotype real people with comedic intent.
There are a couple laughs, but mostly all you get is a strange feeling after this movie.
I've never seen Shane Meadows' other work but after seeing this, I'll definitely keep an eye out for his next movies.
What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie.
The film has one hilarious moment after another.
Jan Hooks appears as a student of Beldar (who is seen working briefly as a driving instructor)who lusts after Beldar and her silent encounter with Prymatt in a supermarket is hysterical.
I really wondered if you could pull off a feature film from basically a 5 minute TV skit...but the script is so well written with so many funny jokes...David Spade is another who delivers line after line as the smarmy kiss butt assistant to Michael McKean's character.
The characters are completely wooden, the plot is non-existing, and the quality of this movie basically consists of one sex scene after another with the occasional unconvincing murder.
Soon after, a wave of killings by an unknown assailant armed with a nail gun begin.
It is almost certainly guaranteed to please any trash movie lover and leave you with the feeling that maybe TROLL 2 was quite competently made after all!
Some hilarious thing to look for are: Man moving after being killed on a BBQ Woman's foot thrown in the air after she plunges to her death in the end of the film Man being "nailed" to the highway Radio song being played in a car twice in a row  Don't forget to have fun!
This reveals how difficult it may be after you have been in the limelight of law enforcing in a small city.
People after the worst criminal activity is gone, want to have a more peaceful and less visible law-enforcing police force.
In fact, Harich, after his release from prison in 1964, went on to publish and teach in the DDR: he continued to argue for German re-unification under socialist auspices and for greater attention to environmental concerns under socialism; he traveled to the West and always returned to the DDR (though opportunities to 'defect' were not lacking), and, after the collapse of the DDR, refused to testify against those who had imprisoned him in 1956.
he suddenly talks to his loyal 'helper' Elisabeth Hauptmann about his work after having studiously ignored her for a week.
i have never written a review but felt obligated to after watching this film.
In Amu, a twenty-one year old Indian girl named Kaju goes back to her homeland after eighteen years to discover her roots.
I think there were definitely points in the acting or possibly editing that would smooth out the transitions and increase the believability of the movie, but it is fairly easy to look beyond this after the plot line pulls you in.
Her accent and body language were flawlessly American on screen, as they should have been (Kaju is an Indian girl raised in America), but Bose explained after the film that Konkona has lived her whole life in India and was only given two weeks to immerse herself in Los Angeles's culture to prepare for the role of Kaju.
The fact that there some people in the audience crying and others sat in silence after the movie had finished, showed that the movie had indeed touched all of us.
Additionally, since Maxwell Bright was shown as part of Scottsdale's International Film Festival, producer Steven Wolfe and actor Patrick Warburton hosted the filming and stayed after for a Q&A -- REALLY wish there were more of that in this country.
The writer/director spoke after the screening I attended, and he said that he had no outline for the script; the story just told itself along the way.
For example, one wonders if his life became chaotic after the loss of his initial girlfriend--the one we get a very good look at in the beginning--or if it was always like that.
Why does Mei-Ling accept him twice, the second time after he's humiliated her horribly*?
If, however, you want a film with genuine emotional depth, that makes you think and resonates far after the end credits have finished, then this may be what you're looking for.
I went to a screening of The Civilization of Maxwell Bright at the Scottsdale Film Festival last night because it looked intriguing, but really, it was because Patrick was presenting the film and doing a Q+A after, and I didn't want to miss anything he might say about The Tick.
Bruce Lee is very admired amongst martial artists for the many great things that he achieved; and he has inspired many people in martial arts, physical fitness and so on, even after his death.
All I can say is that the "Game of Death" footage alone is worth the price of admission and any true Bruce Lee fan will be left salivating after seeing the incredible fight scenes coupled with the philosophical undertones that Lee so wanted to convey to his students, fans and audiences alike.
Fortunately, there's still some decent laughs after that.
The comedy in this film is so violent some of it actually works as parody-- which, after all, is how it was intended.
It's about the passing of time and those glorious memories of loves past that nobody can take away in spite, after all, of those unbearable and unjust social actions of people in high places against working class folk.
I didn't recall having seen THE LONEDALE OPERATOR when I started the film, but soon after it started it was like a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu.
In the opening scene, the main character reveals on a televised dating show that his longest ever relationship ended after just three months when he found a used prophylactic in his bed.
If you want to see a real piece of cinema about Nuclear War, then get yourself a copy of one of the following: American movies "The Day after" & "Testament" or the British films "War Game" or "Threads".
What entailed, however, was one bumbling misstep after another by two young lovers who were not exactly the sharpest tacks in the box.
I'm one of those who actually liked this film and after reading the reviews here I'm glad most rated this film above average.
I came in at a point early on, where Anthony Edwards is about to get some sleep, after which the power goes out and he wakes up late.
Released shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the U.S.S.R., it's Armageddon time shortly after Harry meets Julie, and what fun it is to watch Romeo battle his way to the side of his Juliet.
The film was beautifully done in color (for 1958) but the storyline so bad- what was she doing, trying to train the adopted girl to become her husband's concubine after her inevitable death?
The plot is incredibly good, with much more depth than I thought after seeing it the first time - at that time I mistakenly thought it was a little flawed.
One positive note: the film uses a cute technique of animating still photos, but even that novelty wore off after about 5 minutes of it.
But after about an hour or so, I started to fall asleep, I think the film maker has the potential to be another "Orson Welles" if she learns pacing and that more is not necessarily better and figures out that an hour of stimulation beats an hour of stimulation & a half hour of boredom.
What happens after this will try your patience to the utmost as the girl leaves her snug bed at the orphanage to run out into a rainstorm with her toy horse along the seashore.
BUT in the movie before the escape him and Dega go in woodcutting camp that's not true , Papillon went in the woodcutting camp with Clousiot AFTER THEY GOT CAUGHT, after Papillon escapes with ANtonio ,the guy who speaks Spanish, from a Colombian prison.
MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT HAS BEEN CUT IS THE TRIAL AND THE DREAMS OF REVENGE THAT KEEP PAPILLON GOING THOSE ARE Extremely IMPORTANT and you realize that after reading the book .
I still enjoyed the first half of the film up until they leave the leper but after that the pace gets strangely confusing.
this is a Masterpiece ...god it almost made me cry..please vote good for this movie ..this movie deserve to be on the top instead of stupid movies like "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984) and lots of other not so deserving titles on top 250 films list on IMDB...Steve McQueen is at his best as Papillon...great story and overall an excellent picture..if you haven't seen it yet ,do not hesitate you owe that to yourself if you are a movie fan and don't forget to vote after you watched it we have to have this movie on Top 250 films list..Don't you agree with me?
The amazing thing is that, on my way home, I started thinking back about the movie and it was clear to me that I perfectly remembered, after over 15 years, every single part of the movie, from the beginning to the end, even the smallest details.
I'd love to know if this was a conscious decision by Schaffner or the screenwriters (Trumbo and Semple both had good progressive credentials, after all).
Best watched at 2:00pm in the afternoon after a light lunch on a Sunday afternoon with your favorite brand of beer.
Despite all these privations, he never loses his resolve to escape, though Hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt.
While there is a lot more to the movie and what I have mentioned (after all it's a very long and involved film), the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison.
Usually, after reading a long book filled with many interesting adventures, watching a two-hour film later winds up being a big disappointment.
This is the second greatest "run after freedom" movie i've ever seen.
When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.
I felt so moved after watching this film.
At least Deidre Hall had a career after this...
Since the origin of film-making, cinematography has maintained its reputation of being a craft, long after the role of the director was given creative control.
I remember that Robert Stack and Lauren Bacall did a convincing, significant job in their roles and made me want to see them in every thing else I could after that.
One scene in the movie was Lauren reflecting on her situation, looking out an upstairs window onto the garden -- I can still picture it after all these years.
I mean, after a string of flop original TV shows I imagine they must have all been sitting in their meeting with a collective frown trying to figure out how to (finally) achieve success.
I enjoyed the film, though it was tedious in a couple of places, but the attention to historic detail and accuracy is what encapsulated me...I'm a historian after all...and this was something welcome in a low-budget, B-grade comedy.
That is if the sting of "Daisy Does America" hasn't worn off....  "10 Items or Less" establishes all the same clichÃ©s of being a grocery clerk that any common customer could see while wrangling this menagerie of failed auditions for Mad TV under the frayed control of manager Leslie, who assumes ownership of the family store after his father dies in a supposedly comedic fashion (a heart attack that knocks over a display stand, with the nearby employee fixing the stand first before helping the fallen owner).
The founder's son has inherited the store after the death of his father.
She was a wonderful woman, who died from complications to stomach stapling surgery, after we'd been married almost 24 years.
Right...well Ali (based on a "true" Story) is a bit of a Fat Phobic (just like almost in one in America who's never felt the pain of being fat)..thinking it all about your attitude..and when she loses her sports scholarship..she decides to enter a student film competition for the prize money for school.....and her idea is to prove being unhappy and fat is all out the fat person's negative attitude....if only people like her little brother(overweight) had a positive attitude their lives would be better..thats why she's popular (not because she's a pretty blonde jock)..the commercials leading up to this promised a true look/insight into one area of life where bigotry and prejudice are allowed to reign supreme... i "thought" finally people see something about the cost of our obsession with weight...how thou bashing of gay and others may be illegal...but fat bashing is More than OK....But the promise of the commercials was NEVER delivered...even although Ali don's the "Fat suit" for at least a month...at the end of it..she's still very hateful over her mom's past weight (its treated like a very dirty little secret)..never asking why people over eat...or even some the different causes people gain weight, her partner on the film has a hard attitude towards the world in general and never stops calling the one "fat" girl and meets and befriends.."her Fat friend"...after a month spent on this Ali changes only a little..after lying to everyone very little is said after ward...you keep waiting/hoping for her "a Ha!
the film is very precise in it's description of life in our poor land after the riots and the exoduses that occurred in the early '90s.
It is pretty clear to me after watching the movie that Ross had never intended on making a movie about Sherman, but rather was the inventor of the modern day self absorbed BLOG.
You'd have thought that after leaving the 12 year old home for the weekend, by accident, and having him give himself alcohol poisoning, that they would have made some reference to it later.
SOME SPOILERS TO FOLLOW (IMDB requires that I draw attention to these spoilers to provide readers with a choice but I should point out that I consider them imperative to a proper understanding of the film, although they may be read equally well after one's first viewing)  At the commencement of the film Bernard is a successful academic and writer but one whose work has been overlooked in recent years.
I must have avoided this movie because it was released after his death and I was not ready to enjoy another comedy with him at that time.
It all comes to a head when Walt confesses to the school counselor that he used to like his mother some when they watched Robin Hood together on television, and when she reassured him after he saw the picture of an enormous whale swallowing the squid at the Museum of Natural History.
THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is a sharp domestic drama about bitter people caught within their own patterns of behavior and it lingers on after its abrupt but symbolic ending.
)Bernard's wife Joan, played by a mousy Laury Linney, decide that after many years of marriage that divorce is the best option; which seems odd considering that they have nothing good to say about each other and that Joan has had affairs with at least four different men during their marriage.
Walt, played by a brow-furrowed Jesse Eisenberg, idolizes his father and models his view of the world after Bernard's twisted vision.
However I did fear that after viewing the trailer that I had already seen the best squid had to offer.
Instead we see nothing of Lili after and Walt didn't meditate very long after hearing something so low come from his father's mouth.
But still, it was far harsher then anything he uttered before or after.
Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end.
Baldwin provides some comic relief with his incessant "my brother" narrative and Feifer is extraordinary in capturing teen adoration as she lusts after Eisenberg.
then they continue firing at the squirrel   Bidwell returns to camp after a bear has bit off his leg.
It is one of the few films released over the last few years that gives me belly laughs throughout, and after repeat viewings.
Nathan Lane is especially good, and after this film I became a big fan.
I liked 1, 3, and 6 and I have yet to see 2, 5 and 7 (I hear 7 is much worse than this)   The movie is about an author named Marie (Played by Romy Windsor) who after a nervous breakdown, is sent to the town of Drago, along with her husband Richard.
And then after a long and sleepy hour, at last some werewolves appear (hello are you still awake, it took me a lot of coffee to achieve that) and then there is some action.
I've seen many sequels of the original Howling (can't keep track how many actually) but this had my mouth drop wide open right after the first few minutes of it.
Howling IV: The Original Nightmare tells the tale of Los Angeles based author Marie Adams (Romy Windsor) who has a deadline looming but has also been suffering from bad dreams & hallucinations of a mysterious nun, after a public breakdown her doctor advises her husband Richard (Michael T. Weiss) to take her on a break, a complete rest form work.
One day a nun named Janice (Susanne Severeid) visits Marie & tells her about her friend sister Ruth (Megan Kruskal) who was found in the area wondering the woods rambling incoherently, sister Ruth died shortly after & Janice is determined to discover the truth.
Howling IV is about a writer named Marie who after having a metal breakdown goes to a town called Drago with her husband Richard.
Doing so Marie has no choice but to burn the tower with her friend, and after looking at the burnt body of her husband a Werewolf jumps out at her.
It is suppose to be a werewolf film yet we don't even see one until after an hour of Marie just walking about the town and occasionally hearing howling noises coming from the woods.
Go ahead and watch this one....  Now I wished I could have disappeared after seeing such crap.
As it turns out, he was a soldier who was meant to be "the ultimate weapon" for the military with a specific agenda but after neglecting to give him the serum, the whole project went awry.
Frank Turner (played by Peter Facinelli) are the first to arrive on the scene but to their utmost shock the FEDS arrive soon after and take over the bizarre murder case.
However, after seeing this movie, I found that the quality of directing and visual effect look like a TV series that was made 20 year ago!!
I thought I would give this a go, after spotting an advert for it in a well-known UK film magazine.
Debra Winger is seen in a Vital Role after a long time.
And five minutes from that, she decides to be the volleyball coach after meeting nice guy Bink, who wants to take her out to dinner and in no time, they're an official couple.
Dawn Anna discovers (after tumbling around in school and forgetting things easily) that she has some sort of brain tumor and it needs to be removed via opening the skull.
From there, we see that after the surgery, Dawn is unable to speak or walk.
She learns to speak and walk in roughly fifteen more minutes after going through physical therapy and reading flashcards.
Some evening a few days after (or seconds, depending on who's time your on), Dawn is tucking in her daughter Lauren, who up until now wasn't the main focus whatsoever, and we zip up to five years later (1999).
They didn't follow any distinct direction except the "Let's just throw in one bad thing after another to show how this woman can overcome it all."
I still felt the film was relevant even watching the video 35 years after I first saw the movie in a theater.
Barbra is doing this film soon after winning an Academy Award for Best Actress in her first film (Funny Girl).
There's no plot to speak of Â instead, we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms: from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching (which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord), to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal (who drives them out because of their constant bickering), then going their separate ways till they meet again (after he has learned about her movie experience Â a hilarious scene Â and a 'colleague' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace) and go out together (where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers), after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fiancÃ©e (a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline), to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another (beginning with their real names).
The way to tell a superb comedy, is if after the the film, you are left with a feeling of nostalgia.
George Segal plays an uptight New York City book-clerk who hopes to be a writer but can't get anything published; after calling the landlord one night on prostitute-neighbor Barbra Streisand, he finds her on his doorstep.
Giuliano Carnimeo takes the directors chair and does a good of directing Fenech for the second time, after The Case of the Bloody Iris.
Her Anna is soon forced by the Mob to run drugs and turn tricks, but amazingly, she retains her stunning looks even after repeated beatings from her man Guido.
This film is pure fun from beginning to end, with great action scenes, after all it was directed by Budd Boetticher, whose westerns are like wine: they get better as they get older.
This is, after all, a COMEDY!
This is simple gag after gag moving along quick.
Rented the DVD & after hearing the directors comments I must say I'm so glad that his DP told him he couldn't have white walls.
He/she does eventually, when the macho boys try to impress Gabrielle with their nasty shark-hunting games, and after killing Miguel this chapter ends suddenly, like it was just a tiny little sub plot.
When that annoying tiger shark kills yet another one of his girlfriends, Steven gets really upset goes after his nemesis.
Mediterranean playboys woo the affections of sexy tourists, and treat them to fun and frivolity aboard their yacht, while a ferocious tiger shark cleans up after them.
You do get ideas about how you'd like to have that much money so that you could live on a yacht without responsibility and the promise of toast after toast with your latest shag, but the continual slaughter of sharks, sea turtles and stingrays for a movie such as this leaves one filled with guilt.
Pretty much the whole movie is one laugh after another.
Soon after that they become friends again and decide to go womanising together, several times.
It's only in the last half-hour (of this 126-minute picture) that the chase is well and truly on Â after the shark attacks and kills one of the two men; still, this doesn't take the other's mind off sex Â resulting in perhaps the film's highlight as a group of revelers is attacked at night, with the girl (one of two American sisters vacationing in Mexico) accompanying the hero ending up killed.
Apparently, the creature is really after the latter Â and eventually he gets to work on executing his personal vendettaÂ   Being a Spanish-British co-production, the film features two English actresses among the bevy of willing beauties Â Susan George (whose contribution is the most important, even if it comes exactly half-way through the film and extends to little over 30 minutes of screen-time) and Fiona Lewis (who appears early on and is actually the shark's first victim).
Tragedy soon strikes as the tintorera once more returns to feed in the waters and, after a night-time massacre during which a group of party-goers are killed by the deadly shark, Steven finally decides that the time has come to exterminate the killer fish.
Soon, however, after some 30 minutes of the film, finally the nasty shark starts to eat and kill people and also return the vacationers back on earth from their dream world.
The writers actually say that they have modeled the characters after Greek mythology!
My wife and I picked up the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on TV.
Well, if they did, perhaps it just shows that educated Northern white boys aren't that smart after all!
Since this film was loosely based on the 1964 killings of 3 Civil Rights activists, one of whom only got sentenced a few days ago, 40 years after the crime, I thought it would be appropriate to check the film out again.
The persistence of the two men's characters was very courageous and inspiring also, making even me want to be an FBI Agent after watching the film.
It was only after the FBI began to play hardball with this hoodlum element that something was able to be done.
I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity.
I find it sad that the director Alan Parker didn't have many movies after this one.
As the clued-in Hackman puts it, "They have to live here long after we're packed up and gone."
Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea.
That scene and the rest of the movie never get old after watching it numerous times.
I also liked how not everything was explained, it allowed us the viewers to draw our own conclusions (like whether or not the son Todd knew about what his parents were doing and what happened to him after the conclusion of the film, or what the meaning of the scene at the abandoned house really meant).
The first song "Tinka Tinka" is wonderfully subdued yet stirring and will stick with the viewer for long after viewing the movie.
Abraham tries to quit the hit-man business after a hit gone awry but finds out the hard way that quitting the underworld is not as easy as it may seem.
He finally realizes the enormity of his wrongdoings after accidentally killing a small girl during a mission.
What made me feel good after watching this movie was ... a good story and brilliant acting.. specially Priyanka Chopra has done a very good job... she is the lady who knows what acting is.... and no doubt if she will be the next bollywood queen... John Abraham has also done a very good job playing the character of a hit-man... all together a good movie to watch ... worth the time... And I think after a long time had bollywood came up with such a brilliant movie I don't know why such movies are not liked by the Indian audience... they go in for crap...
I also noticed a goof when John received his wife's finger it was a full finger but when he was talking to her on the phone after the song Ishq Nachaya Kare her finger was half cut.
This movie is so bad, your feel like you have to take a shower or five after watching it.
In short, "Charcoal Black" offers a one of a kind experience: after watching it, you'll feel like you have just committed a crime.
The problem with this movie is that after the quick, effective introduction, things move at a slow pace.
The movie had an intelligent story, and though it's called Spectres, it was more about a mother struggling to make life with her teen daughter as close to normal as possible after a suicide attempt.
Laura Lee and her daughter, Kelly (Lauren Birkell), go on a summer vacation to get to know each other again, after Kelly's attempted suicide.
Dr. Halsey after examining her and seeing for himself what's happening to Kelly, and her mom back home, feels that whatever Kelly is suffering from is out of the realm of science and reality and goes to his friend Will Franklin, Tucker Smallwood, a psychic for help.
At the same time you see through Linda, how after losing her life, how she took advantage of Kelly's mistake to make life better for her orphaned young son, C.J.
Linda did this by getting Kelly to, sub-consciously, track down C.J and find his dad Sam Philips, Chris Hardwick; so that C.J can have someone to look after and care for him as he grows up into adulthood.
The next day Albert is in his office with the IRS and after going over his books, Albert is told that the IRS owes him $11.19.
Meanwhile after having a few drinks at the local tavern Elaine gets into car to leave.
Sitting at that stop sign is a police officer who turns his lights on and goes after her and finally pulling her over.
It's only made tragic by the knowledge that similar behavior off-camera led to his premature death shortly after making this film.
Reading through those after watching the film, just thinking about many of them again made me laugh out loud.
In "What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?," Geraldine Page plays Claire Marrable, who moves to Tucson after her husband dies and leaves her penniless.
Aunt Claire was a demented, unhappy lady that was left with very little after her husband passed on.
Finally, from the outside some 40 years after the movie was made, I'd bet the actors had a blast making What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?
I can just imagine Page and Gordon having a good long laugh after shooting some of their scenes together.
Page plays an older women who has essentially been driven mad with rage after her husband dies and leaves her only his debts and .the contents of his briefcase.
Katzin tells the story mostly from the POV of Page's character so that after a while the audience is actually identifying with her.
At the same time that she is found out, she finds out that her husband actually made a provision for her to live comfortably after his death.
Geraldine shakes furiously from head to toe after a fiesty Ruth flat-out inquires: "How MANY women have you killed?"
She even remained her favorite toy "Catrina" after the baby butterfly.
I can understand it might annoy many viewers but the film's teasing scenarios, I believe, predetermined the ending and any careful viewer would not have felt robbed by the fact Julie was not real after all.
Eventually they come together, even finding things they have in common, on the way toward Sarah helping Julie out after something terrible happens.
If you want to see what I mean, you can try another Ozon film, "Under the Sand", after this one.
Okay, I hate to give so much away but after watching the film, there's no other way to review in a way that it would make sense to the people reading the review other than to tell it like it is.
I might not find the first 70 minutes too slow after all.  
Mattei supposedly died from a brain tumor, but after seeing "Cannibal Ferox 3", I'm beginning to suspect Arnold Swcharzenegger and John McTiernan killed him for exaggeratedly imitating their masterwork "Predator".
Who knows why studios do what they do -- and apparently, they didn't do this film justice in 1998 (after all, it has an ensemble cast where -- gasp -- no one is under 30!)
She really did her best portraying a suicidal widow of a Holocaust victim who becomes a trapeze artist after she is saved from drowning by Kirk Douglas's character.
Ironically enough after the two collabreated on "Hollywood Scream Queen Hot Tub Party", neither's subsquesent movies were as entertaining.
Purely a vehicle for slasher T&A, the movie makes no excuses and doesn't really take it itself all that seriously - what movie COULD, after having a man fall off a 15-story building and walk away?
The highlight of the film, for me, was the irrepressible Orville coming back from one death after another, and not seeming to hold all the abuses against anyone, when it's over.
To me, HARD TO DIE delivered exactly what it promised on the box...action, blood, babes, machine guns, Corman references (this is, after all, a New Horizons video) and loads of cheesy fun.
And it is still better, as stated earlier, than the same director's "Rush of Fear" - which I sincerely hope BBC1 doesn't show in the same slot that this TV movie was in; it would hurt us Rosanna Arquette fans a lot if it was scheduled after little sister Patricia in "Medium" as well...
4- Story Third-rate, B-movie high school flick with a completely unbelievable character development (chauvinistic Muslim guy changes his entire mind-set after wearing a Burqa (hello?)
The film is a bit silly and you and your friends may squirm at some of the lines, but there is a heartfelt message and you will walk away from the film feeling pretty good about yourself (although you may feel like hitting the gym right away and puking up that movie theater popcorn after staring at the gorgeous actors for 90 minutes)
I recall that they re-launched the show without him after he cracked up.
As everyone he loves dies, he begins a race to save her and Airwolf, after she had promised she would not die on him.
Mabel stares at him with sleepy eyes; it is quite obvious that the emotions have not left even after all the years that have passed.
Cheesy melodrama set during the time after the fall of Battista in Cuba.
Director Edward L. Cahn was the best kind of journeyman director, a true pro who could take a talented cast, a few small sets, and a genre-based script, and turn it all into a solid, unpretentious feature film that still entertains and engages decades after it was made.
The only good moment in this movie comes after about 10 minutes: a fake cereal commercial that is actually quite funny.
The perfect son, Shakespeare, looks after his little siblings though it could cost him his life.
All of the cars seemed to look the same after a while.
"Speedway" came out a year after Nancy's Number One hit "Somethin' Stupid," a duet with her famous dad Frank.
This movie will stay with you for days after seeing it.
Keeping up with the numerous yearly litters of four or five pups means the size of the Whiskers group fluctuates as its members stray, die, or disappear after encounters and fierce battles often to the death.
Just saw this again the other day after many years, and was impressed by Monroe's effortless upstaging of Olivier, who gives the most hammy, artificial performance of his career, unsurprising as he is directing himself.
Marilyn Monroe Productions would disband soon after.
However, there is one role and one performance in this film that makes it an absolute must for at least one viewing, and that is the hilariously funny, and PERFECTLY executed comedy of Dame Sybil Thorndike, who plays the role of a South Slavic Queen Dowager who is "a little vague"--as Marilyn Monroe, in the role of Elsie Marina says after meeting her, "a LITTLE vague?!"
An absolute delight and probably my favorite Monroe movie after Â´The MisfitsÂ´.
The name of the game here is really "pulling the rug out from beneath the viewer", but amusingly, neither the apparent scenarios nor the rug-pulling are very sophisticated, making Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator usually play like a more pedestrian "so bad, it's good" horror film gone haywire after viewing far too many "rubber reality" films, ala Mulholland Drive (2001), The Butterfly Effect (2004), etc.
I saw this movie for the first time about a year after its theatrical release, and I seem to remember it receiving mediocre reviews at the time it was released.
Although you know that the hero and the heroine will survive, Gibson and his co-scenarist keep putting them into one hallowing situation after another.
Well, it's a Mel Gibson movie after all, so that's a given.
Update of 12/27/09: I was just reading through my reviews and have to update the fact that it took me a few days after posting the original for it to strike me that the film, while not racist, was sexist as heck.
Perhaps Gibson will redeem himself in the public eye after this work.
The heads roll down the long stair case followed soon after by their bodies.
Repeatedly and without letting up, the movie features scene after scene that hits the perfect note, which is always a high-pitched one filled with tension.
Apocalypto, on the other hand, is the typical, essentially optimistic Disney story of a happy Indian youth ripped savagely from his rainforest life by ruthless marauders, after which he has to escape and fight his way back to his land and people.
His victims include a go-go dancer, a prostitute and a nude model before going after his own unfaithful wife again.
Ironically enough, Roberta delivered her best work ("Tenement: Game of Survival", "The Oracle") after her hubbie died in a helicopter crash
It's hard not to develop an appreciation and affection for meerkats after watching this show.
Although she grew up in what many would describe as a fairy-tale world, this movie shows that not all Hollywood productions are "happily ever after".
first time I saw it I thought it was lame but with time and appreciation for independent films I developed a special appreciation for this movie after working at an advertising agency for 3 years.
Robert (Peter Saarsgard) has written a brilliant script after the death of his lover, Malcolm (Bill Camp).
I'm not too familiar with Clarkson's work but will certainly look forward to other films after viewing this.
Robert bolts, but succumbs to one tiny little detail: one million dollars, payable to him immediately, to which he can after this one story do whatever he chooses to -- create stories of gay men left and right, ill or healthy.
I would have to believe Robert had only recently taken it up after the pain of losing Maurice and his overwhelming loneliness, since he doesn't seem to have friends or a life outside his computer and fiction.
(Then again, anyone who's come into the Internet for the first time does so with a sense of novelty that only progressively, after much disappointment, loses its truthfulness.)
Craig Lucas introduced the film and took questions after.
There's one catch - the script is a tribute to Robert's partner, who died recently of AIDS after going through painful medical treatments, and Jeffrey wants to change the story to a heterosexual love story to assure the movie has wider commercial appeal.
The structure and metaphorical significance of the story will give you a lot to think about after the film is over.
However, after the screening last night, in 3-D at an IMAX theater, I'm glad I did.
But, his elation soon comes tumbling down after he spends the night with a beautiful womanÂ and is then accused of her brutal murder!"
Richard Gere's decision to put himself back into the hands of his lawyer after he is safe at the Embassy shows that he is honorable, & thank God his lawyer can prove his innocence!
I spoke with many of my friends after seeing it the second time and told them about it.
the plot is completely predictable after the first five minutes, the acting is hammier than a pig farm, and there is nothing special about the special effects.
-pregnant woman to her friend while she gave birth under a pile of rubble after attending her own baby shower.
But the best bit is how the lady gets out of her car after its been hit by the landslide and - oh, thank heavens - her cell phone is only two feet away from her, lying safely, right on top of all the dirt and is just a little bit dusty.
OK. but *then*, after the heist he finds the scotsman on the street by chance -- and leaves him w/o getting his money.
I saw the trailer after I saw this film, and it reinforced my thought that the idea behind the film is intriguing.
However, the movie largely ignores all of that after the first 20 or so minutes and instead focuses on the story of Nick Diaz (Jsu Garcia, whose first name appears to be missing at least one vowel).
On the loose again after escaping from prison, Tritignant, known as "the Swiss" for his precision and his habit of working alone (?)
As I had the DVD, I went back and reviewed this transition where the two male crooks are eating at the home of the lady Jean-Louis Trintignant met at the theater in 1970 (after his prison escape).
The film will probably confuse some viewers because there is no clear indication that after Simon meets Jeanine and goes to see Martine at the park and his subsequent escape to either Spain, Switzerland, or Genoa, the narrative will go back to tell the real story in flashbacks.
His camera angles, especially when the inspector is interrogating the Galloises after their son has been kidnapped, he shows the couple on both sides of the police, of whom we only see the back of his head.
I just saw it this week after not seeing it since the 70's, and the film stands the test of time marvelously -- still as fresh, funny, and involving as when I saw it originally.
But after a while you get used to it.
He's an international star, who's career looked so promising after GREYSTOKE in 1984.
Wells plays Maddox(what a name, i bet he thought of that himself) who likes beating people up and raping young men(what a role, he obviously had some considerable influence after his role in Commando so he gets to do whatever he wants in movies) Lambert is class as always and the plot is genius, what more do you need apart from maybe Schwartzkshgjsfgnjsjvnjnnegger or Edward Woodward to add to the already masterful piece of art.
A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground.
At the time it was released I was impressed with this film and over time my affection for it has grown (it continues to entertain even after seeing it several times).
In my opinion, this is probably Gordons Second best film, after re-animator.
The central characters are John and Karen Brennick - a couple sent to the Fortress after she becomes pregnant with a second child, thus breaking a futuristic population control law.
Beowulf then becomes King, sleeps with the Monster Jolie and then a monster son comes after him.
This has a great story, great sets, great atmosphere, is constantly inventive within the technological limitations and lives in the imagination long after it's finished.
Doug dances his way through the role, and much of the movement seems literally choreographed, such as the three fat guards' heads popping up one after the other.
These scenes are both tentative and passionate, with the most beautiful moment after he scales her balcony.
But suggests that whoever brings back the rarest treasure after seven moons, she will marry.
I remember there is a moment after he meets the princess, we can see him kind of become reflective as he starts to consider living life without thieving.
He vows to straighten up his life after he introduces himself to her--beginning by telling her the awful truth about his life.
It's of course, our hero The Thief/Prince who marries the Princess but not after fighting intrigue, baddies and experiencing a fantastical adventures in remote, mythical locations, among them under the sea, where he is tempted by mermaids, and The Citadel of the Moon.
What really impresses is the ending in which the Thief uses his magic dust to create tens of thousands of soldiers out of the earth to defeat the Mongols' take over of Bagdad, as he then sweeps up the Princess in his invisible cloak, and flies off on the magic carpet with her to live happily ever after.
Film histories note that after the end of the premiere showing of the film in New York, Fairbanks, as the producer, writer and star, leaped up on the stage to thunderous applause.
Especially toward the ending the movie starts to become greatly adventurous after a sort of slower middle and good first part.
I thought it was terrific then, and after viewing it again now(2003) I still think it is an exceptionally fine movie.
I never watched the TV series but I've seen other Made-for-TV Movies after a series has been canceled and they all felt like just another episode therefore they were really anything that special.
It didn't really have very much of a movie feel to it after the first few minutes or so but I still enjoyed it and hope Ms. Lansbury's in good enough health to make a new `episode' or two.
When the series begins we meet Kurt Von Helsing (Stephen Johnson)and Mary Gibbons (Carol Baxter)going after Dracula's coffins.
I could have done without the sexual innuendo and wise cracks though   " I think you`d better step outside "  " No thanks I don`t have time for a < Sexual act > "  Not sure if I`d be watching the TV series on a regular basis after watching this feature length spin off
It's sad that Tales from the Crypt totally died after this movie but the powers behind it went on to found the Dark Castle production company (check out those movies they're actually quite scary and effective).
It surprised me the way the Tales From the Crypt people have gone, especially after Demon Knight.
The dragon was killed years after Beowulf killed Grendel's mother, according to the book.
The kind and noble King Hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with Grendel's mother (hence the existence of Grendel) and who end up killing himself after making Beowulf king.
Vampress Lilith (Angie Everhart) is brought to life again after a long rest in one of the far corners of the world by Reverend Jimmy Current (Chris Sarandon) and his partner Vincent.
He does make some of the most classically bad facial expressions I have witnessed in a long time (honestly, after seeing this, I want to know what acting school I have to go to just to learn to "Act the Dennis Miller Way").
What redeems this film is that after this point in the film, it becomes better, and the plot begins to move a little.
The sound quality was horrible, but after a half an hour, it didn't bother me anymore.
He became a mighty King in his own right after protecting the existing incumbent and his son.
Finally after the death of the serpent, and the subsequent death of his dear lord from his wounds, Wiglaf berates the cowards who deserted their lord and made them feel their shame.
Beowulf, after a long, unsuccessful battle with the dragon, was supposed to have died, not having killed the dragon and Wiglaf ended up defeating it.
I rarely write reviews but after just seeing this, I thought that I couldn't leave the experience behind without commenting...  'Night On Earth' unleashed the whole array of emotions for me to experience.
Beowulf does not kill Grendel's Mother: In the poem, it's reported as fact that Beowulf kills her after a ferocious struggle.
But luckily after the LA episode came the NY episode which was the best overall.
Sure his cockney acting at first seems a bit bizarre coming from the character, but after a while you see the subtlety of the performance and come the final half hour you realise he's quite possibly the best thing in the movie.
In fact, after watching this a second time, I got to get the sense of what the film might be about- getting past that separation between a driver doing his job and a passenger with their own issues.
Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book, but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical.
The one on the bridge with the birdseed is terrific, the timing and use of the pop-up steel wall is perfect and the gag that involves the Burmese tiger trap, and the freeze frame directly after that (you will recognize the moment) are hilarious.
Wile E. Coyote (Eatibus Anythingus) has a bad reaction after eating some flying insect but he's so hungry he'll eat anything, even an empty tin can on the road.
However, it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.
Right after the film boosts off, hell breaks loose).
This had to be one of the first movies I saw because I watched it for years and years after that.
Finally, Robert Zemeckis is the director and my great respect for him plummeted through the floor and into the crawlspace after he presided over the insufferable 'Forrest Gump'.
I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release, but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it.
The first is the one in which our psychotic monster rips an unborn fetus out of the belly of a woman and starts to eat it, while the dying husband is watching and the second one is the ending when the killer is starting to eat his own intestines after being stabbed in the belly.
I saw this film (uncut) straight after Absurd and kept wondering when it was actually going to start - there is one initial scene where a guy on a beach gets a meat cleaver through his head (extremely unrealistic effects) and then the next "excuse of gore" is a head in a bucket which is so pathetically unreal I nearly split my sides with laughter !!!!
Beowulf killed the witch he did not have sex with her.The dragon was not Beowulf's son and had no connection with the witch.Beowulf was not made Hrothgar's heir,nor did he marry his widow and become king of the Danes.In the poem Beowulf returned to Geatland after slaying Grendel.
Only after the new king died did Beowulf become king of the Geats until his own death in later years.Also, why all the nudity in this film?
'300' scenes were like paintings come to life and the Spartans' impressive physiques and fighting skills were real,after hard training,with no computer enhancement.
There are some decent throat-bitings with tons of blood - a decent intestines-eating, and of course, the notorious fetus-eating scene which is the reason that the un-cut version of this film is so sought after.
The plot was so sluggish I wanted to shoot myself (there was plenty of fast forwarding after sitting thru the first 30 minutes), the gore was limited and/or nonexistent, the fetus eating scene looked like it was cut and it was still boring as balls.
The Uncut version has raised controversy mainly because of two gruesome sequences including the cannibal eating a woman's fetus and the later being his demise when he tries to eat his own guts after being slaughtered.
"Antropophagus" is the very definition of a slow-burner as it idles along showing the tourists walking throughout the village(..modeled after the Greek Islands and looking eerily similar to Narciso IbÃ¡Ã±ez Serrador's "Island of the Damned")attempting to find any citizens.
I was unsure what to expect, however I ended up leaving the cinema extremely satisfied with the film, and tellingly, unable to stop discussing it long after the ride home.
The wife objected, and the man stabbed her in a desperate struggle for survival, after which he seems to have developed a taste for human meat which he satisfies on his murderous spree.
Immediately banned in many countries after its release, Joe D'Amato's Italian Gore Classic "Antropophagus" of 1980 is a truly disturbing and immensely scary video nasty, and fans of ultra-violent and nasty Horror should not be disappointed.
I was interested in the eclectic music in the film and discovered after listening to the commentary that the music was composed by Doug Robinson and individual songs were written by the writer/directors as well as the lead actor who played the role of Easy.
I did some research and here is a list of what would have happened in season three....  Brooke breaks every bone in her face after being in the accident.
(Brooke was hit be Nicole)  Harrison Chooses Brooke-then dates other eligible ladies  Nicole says she was driven to alcohol (and driving drunk) after being sexually abused by Mike McQueen.
She is claimed just before being put to sleep by Cherry Cherry after her twin B. Ho is gunned down in her "hood".
Carmen becomes a nurse after the tragedy that happened to Brooke and becomes Sugar's girlfriend.
Unlike Popular the show would have been a half hour sit-com and follow the Cherrys as they try to rebuild their lives after losing all the money and wealth.
I think the failure of "Popular" was the advertising I referred to earlier for the show...it was going after kids in high school for ratings.
The animators of Beowulf clearly had great fun working out new ways of making things jump out of the screen at the audience, but the effect becomes slightly wearisome after a minute or two.
When Sandra comes back into the ship after a spacewalk, she flips the visor lid up, and there's no seal around it!
I'm convinced that the dialogue was written by a thirteen-year-old boy after watching video games for eighteen hours straight: `she belongs to me', `it's stuck in a loop!
I do like it when Jonathan cries after having to kill his brother.
He was absolutely magnificent and completely exemplified the despair the brothers finally let surface after what has been an apparently long gestation period.
He delivered my favorite line of the film, which struck home because of my own (at times) dramatic tendencies: "You have to kill yourself after you eat it because you can't live!
Bottom Line: Watch this movie - just not on an empty stomach, unless you don't mind running to your local italian restaurant after.
Two brothers, immigrants from Italy, run Il Paradiso, a restaurant that is about to go under after two years.
This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days.
in Turkish young people.I think after the great Hababam Sinifi; movies (the old ones with Kemal Sunal,etc.)
And the last words...It's 9/10 and It's not 10/10 because of its ending...It gives real good advices to the life but when the film finishes you leave the theater with some questions in your mind but maybe there is coming a second film and I may change my mind to 10/10 after seeing the conclusion.
I watched this a second time after seeing it first some years ago.
I'm thinking pretty strongly after a second viewing that that's part of the point.
And on a first viewing- and perhaps this shows how strong a feminist tale it is considering as a guy I got almost too subjectively involved- one might not understand why Mattieu keeps on going after Conchita, even after her intentions are made.
If anything the ending is most frustrating, as after all that's happened and been told, and even after the seeming break-up, they're still together.
The final shot, by the way, is like one last wink to the audience- if not a totally spectacular one- that still is in my mind after the film has ended.
But here's my question, after all is said and done, why does Armand tell Katherine at the end that "we are very proud of him" in reference to Val?
Gary Cooper plays the title role in "The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell," a 1955 film based on the real-life court martial of former Brigadier General William Mitchell, who was demoted in rank after violating orders and later court-martialed for criticizing the Armed Forces in the press.
If it could Great Britain would have surrendered after the blitz or Germany would have been pounded into submission by Army Air Force and RAF bombing of the place for three years, starting even before one American soldier was in ground combat.
But after watching it I went searching for a retailer.
I saw this movie after reading about it in a magazine 4 years ago.
There, two young filmmakers, Peter Jackson and Costa Botes, found reel after reel of film, stored and long forgotten in rusting containers.
Tell them after if you must, but I think I would have liked it even more if I hadn't known!
I was fascinated as fact after fact fell into place with the unmistakable rightness of truth.
It was only the next day, after bemusedly watching a workmate fold over laughing when I related the latest proof that a kiwi had beaten the Wright brothers to it and demanding explanation, that I discovered the whole thing was a complete fabrication.
Too bad at one point he didn't recognize the Prime Minster, after which he was beaten by cops.
I'm reminded seeing Forgotten Silver- of course after knowing that it was all a 'hoax' and that there is no filmmaker Colin MacKenzie- of a film where another hoax was played but with real filmmakers, Incident at Loch Ness.
This comes out clearest in the actual silent footage itself, where MacKenzie breaks through first with color, but because he (unintentionally) shoots topless natives in the shot, he's thrown in jail after the judges deliberate long enough to watch the footage repeatedly.
There's also MacKenzie's bread & butter as he tries to finance his pet project, Salome (the film Jackson and his team are sort of after in present-day), which are the random silent comedies of Stan the Man (Peter Corrigan in hilarious make-up), who goes about hitting people un-suspecting pies, as he figures that attacks that are on the innocent (which happens after he strikes a child in one of his early comedies) could work well, that is, until the Prime Minister is on the scene.
And I'm not sure we're meant to identify with his hang-ups, after all he seems just a bit too innocent to be tricked by Conchita so many times, however he's lust-driven.
Peter Jackson and co narrate the story in a completely straight, documentary style, while the inclusion of interviews with real life industry figures such as Harvey Weinstein, Leonard Maltin and Sam Neil lends the film an air of absolute authenticity (so much so that, as the DVD making-of reveals, for 24 hours after the initial showing of the film on TV, New Zealand thought it had discovered a lost national hero).
Private, personal projects, most of which never saw the light of day or vanished quickly after their initial release.
In fact I didn't find out for some time, even after I had taped it and rewatched over and over and marvelled at this amazing story and even retold it with childlike enthusiasm and wonder to my less cinephile friends.
More than twenty years after the deed, the crime remains unsolved.
I found parts of the film falling into place long after I left my seat in the cinema and I regard that as a rare and valuable thing.
We as people in love tend to go after the unavailable, that which tempts us but manages to remain maddeningly out of reach, or just within the spectrum of possibility but vanishing at the last crucial moment.
A more conventional ending would have had the two parting ways after their physical exchange, but Bunuel had other plans, and his last sequence is one that only he could envision for a story about the polarities of love and hate, desire and repulsion.
Hesitantly I went to this movie after reading an interesting review on a local freebie.
Robert Osborne pointed out afterwards the amusing anecdote about Mrs. Ira Gershwin saying to her husband after seeing the rushes of this film: "If you've got any MGM stock sell it!"
I'm still not a fan of the throwing(and it gets to be downright common, here), but they kind of had to have it, after it appeared in Mysteries of the Sith.
It gets to become pretty obvious after a while, but at first it is wonderfully surreal, the sort of subtle gesture that Bunuel is an expert at doing.
I Want To Keep My Baby starred Mariel Hemingway as a girl who became pregnant by her boyfriend and decided to keep her baby, whom she named Elizabeth, after the youngest daughter on The Waltons, rather than give it up for adoption or raise it at home with her meddling mother.
The same episode showed these two incompetent officers going after a cat and completely tearing this guy's apartment apart, wantonly destroying his property, and literally throwing boxes of his stuff across the room to get it out of their way.
For those who enjoyed it, I'm glad they could find some value in "Acne" that I couldn't, after all diversity is what makes the world go 'round.
I do not believe BuÃ±uel for a second when he claims that he intended to use one actress, but she quit unexpectedly after shooting several critical scenes.
And some invent a duty to remember, an obligation to keep in mind, even when we are two or three or more generations after the conflict and we do not have direct witnesses to speak of it any more, and their word is only their word modified by time, propaganda, celebrations and simply the desire to forget.
Clint Eastwood juxtaposes memories of the preparation leading up to and in addition to the actual events at the Battle of Iwo Jima with ceremony after ceremony of War Bond fund-raising and the different effects it had on each man.
You may very well feel like I did after watching this movie.
And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit, but then the next time, he practically prostrated himself for her.
This isn't a review but simply my impressions after seeing the film for the first time.
I thought I had a handle on it going in after reading about it and still I was surprised by what the film really was up to.
One can almost feel the sadness coming from text written by invested historians even today, now more than 60 years after the event that began just before 2AM on 16 February 1945.
Ryan Phillippe, who was previously best known to this viewer as the boy-toy of "Gosford Park," acquits himself admirably in the role of "Doc" Bradley, although the acting honors arguably go to Adam Beach as Ira Hayes, the American Indian who wrestles with guilt and alcoholism after his unwilling rise from obscurity to national hero.
You can argue that the conflict was that they were just kids and were uneasy with being labeled heroes, but after you get that message there's not much else this movie has to say.
And then the ending third of the movie seemed like an after thought and totally useless, like the filmmakers suddenly realized they haven't bored us enough and needed some more useless, unimaginative, uninteresting, drab filler.
The Iwo Jima here is a substitute backdrop, not the real Iwo Jima with black beaches that you can see right after the end credits roll, as if in silent meditation of the soldiers on both sides who had given up their lives fighting for their cause.
And how do we live with ourselves after experiencing horror of the worst kind?
Jesse Bradford copes best after the war but fame is short-lived.
Six soldiers on the 5th day of the island's invasion planted the flag of infamy just seconds after the first flag was that was erected was taken down.
One particularly amusing scene is when Jet walks into a police station to go after the bad guys.
Thus, John goes on the run in a city he's unfamiliar with; he has almost no allies and is being chased after by the police and Richard's countless cronies.
Not only is that element improved upon from that film, but Li is actually given a hell of a lot more screen time and the fact that everybody seems to be after him gives the movie a more frenetic pace.
That line as uttered by Richard the baddie after Jet Li's character told him he had been *Kissed* by the dragon was an instant classic!!
It's great to see that Li and Fonda do show strong on-screen chemistry, because after all I never expected so much quality from any martial arts movies.
although i really like this movie ....i still wouldn't want a kiss of the dragon though (you'll understand after seeing the movie)  Germy
This is Jet Li at his best, without too much fighting, which (although I love it) can sometimes become a bit tiresome if you just get fight scene after fight scene.
The result is of course a preposterous plot that should duly have been expected, but without doubt for action fans this is a real high kicker that delivers thrill after thrill as Li beats up Paris.
Keen to stay alive, Lui Jian flees the scene, but not before screaming, mad and completely hat stand police inspector Richard (Tcheky Caryo in his typically delirious role) sends just about every hardened police psycho after him.
One is thing certain, though, our hero won't be taken without a fight... a really good fight... and a few more after that.
Edward, who would have been the king of England after the death of his father, has to do some reckoning about whether to give up the reins to the empire in order to marry the woman who conquered his heart.
The result was his abdication and a life without his family, who protocol dictated to stay away from him after the scandal.
Edward and Wallis lived the jet set life of the few privileged people of the times after he resigned the right to be crowned king.
As it was, and I suppose to her credit, the future marriage (if not the passion) did last, but she lived it in disappointment and disillusionment, and after him giving up everything and bringing the whole British Empire into turmoil, probably felt she couldn't leave him.
I was looking to get more information about them, after all they stole my heart.
Tormented, he has but one exit, and after one final attempt to publicly lay bare his plights and that of lives he feels responsible for, he shoots himself.
In truth, two actresses were used simply because the lead actress quit partway through production after having completed many critical scenes.
This was his second movie (after Tonight is Ours, also with March in it) and he does a fine job.
I really have a question about Michael Levin, He was a substantially great actor ... and I can't find anything much he did after Ryan's Hope.
I would so be interested in what type profession he found a liking for after Ryan's Hope ????
I still remember trying to finish up last-minute stuff, have my shower and get ready for school the next day in time to watch "Life Goes On" (and on many occasions, "America's Funniest Home Videos" after that) Often I would be running late, and would watch "Life Goes On" in my parents bedroom, practically still dripping wet, wearing a bathrobe, with my hair wrapped up turban-style in a towel to air-dry as my dad ironed his work clothes, and I watched the show.
What sort of person carries on watching anything after that.
Anyway - after they finished painting them & went inside the camera remained outside, for several minutes - while the viewer did indeed "watch paint dry".
And please, can't we somehow put a stop to these people, after they leave the "Big Brother House", relentlessly inundating every other aspect of the media with their talent-free offerings and advice on how to achieve world peace by sticking pencils in our ears (and yes, for those who actually watch this, I know no one who has featured in Big Brother has said this Â well, that I know of -- this is called exaggeration but considering all the other rubbish they spout, they may as well have)?
"Celebrity" now is synonymous in describing those who have no talent at anything accept appearing on shows like BIG BROTHER.The amount of people who have earned a career,and a lucrative one at that,from this programme since it's debut has been astonishing.Brian Dowling and Kate Lawler are just two examples,but the most remarkable was that of Jade Goody,who didn't even win the series she appeared in.She came a cropper in 2007's CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER after her misguided behaviour towards Shilpa Shetty.Now having sadly passed away after a battle against cancer,it is arguable that unscrupulous media types exploited her naivety and inarticulacy (which was in no way particularly her fault) when she was not especially conscious of such events.
This was a good portrayal of how young people fritter away their time chasing after their own useless future when they could be preparing for a better life.
The show's title is named after the fictional character in George Orwell's novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'.
The basic idea of this show tanked in other countries where the people are more intelligent but somehow, five years after the rank original, the people of Britain still buy into this crap.
It seems to start the usual way in the big city, but the road trip begins immediately after the cops vs bad guy shootout.
That would be my guess but as the story developed after 15 minutes, the movie got better.
Scott Wiper is Boomer, a chicago cop, who becomes disenchanted with the big city life after a bust.
Bernhardt plays an ex-Navy SEAL who is forced to murder a corporate executive after the Yakuza kidnap his daughter.
Their is a subplot involving Bernhardt and the Yakuza boss...oh, and Naval Intelligence and the local police are after him, too!
It's been a few years since I saw this, but as I recall it was an enjoyable variation on the venerable(even by 1954) femme fatale theme, the sort of thing EC was doing month after month in Crime SuspenStories at about this same time.
Eventually, their secretive romance leads up in the deaths of two men and they must try to figure a way to get out of it along with the two hundred thousand dollars the mobster robbed during a bank holdup after he murdered a police officer.
He starts thinking with his hormones after being assigned to meet and stakeout a beautiful gangster's girl, played by alluring Kim Novak in her debut.
This story becomes quite exciting as a crooked cop tries to cover his tracks and makes mistakes after mistakes.
Basically, Connie is attempting to escape her stifling everyday life; she and her mother are constantly at odds (well played by Mary Kay Place); and she spends most of her time at the mall; just like many kids, she has no direction, but enjoys meeting other kids at the local hamburger stand; eventually, after several encounters, she meets Treat Williams, who is a little different than most boys.....
I can't remember any of their names, and some would disappear for long lengths of time and then die quickly (after having about 5 minutes screen time total previously).
None of the characters put up a fight at all, and would be killed very quickly and then they would be brutalized after being killed.
Phone call after phone call to Kurt Russell, with little or no forward movement of the storyline.
After having seen it a number of times-- first in the mid 1980's after if was released to negative reviews and poor box office receipts--most recently last week-- I think that THE MEAN SEASON is an under-appreciated, tightly crafted suspense thriller that, in spite of what other reviews have stated, does NOT pander to clichÃ©'s--this film is old enough to have helped establish those very same tropes that have since become clichÃ©s; remember, this was made before Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, 15 Minutes, etc etc...and was one of the first films to deal with the whole notion of fame/celebrity/serial killers and the lack of ethics displayed by journalists, who must rank somewhere below pimps and pickpockets in terms of moral turpitude.
( no surprise, really) and I guess I should deduct points for that and Lalo Shifrin's sometimes bombastic score--but I am not going to; because after 21 years of mostly pale imitators, The Mean Season is looking better and better with age.
Nice outdoor shots though; after viewing the film and before looking it up I would have sworn due to it's sort of dated execution (even for the time) that it had been made several years before this (even with the exception somewhat of the hair 'styles' and such which slightly may have indicated a tad more toward 1985) ALL of these people have done MUCH better!
A few days after filing the story Malcolm gets a phone call at his desk at the Journal from someone claiming to be Sarah's killer.
Well, at least she shows her tits in the requisite, early shower scene (gotta' get that "R" rating, after all.)
I can't say I'm surprised that Phillip Borsos only directed two more films after this one.
Everybody expected a lot from him after his last brilliant work on the Idiot by Dostoevsky (his previous miniseries).
I can only hope that after everyone has gotten their fill of a certain "galaxy far, far away", that a return to the more substantial basics of storytelling and characterization is deemed imperative.
Elsewhere Jano Frandsen is fairly representative of the talent free performances of the military types going after the creature and Nicholas Lea (the villainous Alex Krycek from The X Files) has an early and charmless appearance as a young soldier.
Well duh, it's the second movie after the first movie.
Jan being brought back after being forced to retire because he destroyed the last facility that the device was used in and once again opened a doorway allowing alien creatures to escape!!
Where did cameron come from after the master demon was defeated?
This is a super movie that, after a light hearted start, develops into a highly dramatic film.
It was made in 1931, so they were able to get away with all sorts of lines that would not have been included had the movie been made a few years later, after the code was established.
If anyone out there has seen this and can tell me anything about what was going on at virtually any moment of the proceedings after the author's van blows up, can they please e mail me and enlighten accordingly.
Moreover, it was originally meant to be a two-part drama, and there is such a shift after 90 minutes that this hamstrings it, when watched in one sitting.
The basic gist of the story is Helith and the evil Asrael go head to heads after Asrael wakes the Earth spirit Magog from her slumber.Magog represents the destruction of the earth.
I didn't completely hate 100 Girls, there was something about it which I try to hold on to, but after seeing 100 Women, I've grown a little faith in Michael Davis.
With the existing technologies it could have been done better, but after all I can only conclude that, even though it is "only" TV, this series doesn't disenchant and its main merit is probably the the fact that Bulgakov now found a much bigger audience than he ever could have had with his books.
He has no sense of betrayal, no sense of having been wronged by these two girls, even after they have the gall to implicitly expect him not to be upset by their behaviour.
Especially since we know who does the crime after the first ten minutes, we love surprises in how Columbo catches his man or woman.
Although you may loose hope after seeing the opening zoom-over of the Martian surface (which is taken from a NASA animation by the looks of it), the effects gets a whole LOT better over time.
And after the crash Peck quickly sprouted some impressive bristles, which then all but disappeared.
Gregory Peck's damaged pilot is still suffering from a bad case of 12 O'Clock High after the death of his wife in an air raid on their wedding night until he falls for Burmese girl Win Min Tan.
Forrester, it seems, has gone "round the bend" after losing his new wife in the Blitz.
It works neither because of nor in spite of whom Preston Tucker really was, but because he has been remade in the film to represent something larger--the postwar optimism that buoyed the nation for nearly two decades after the end of WWII.
I would like to know more about his death six years after the trial.
I would like to know more about his death six years after the trial.
I see that Coppola had weighed making this movie right after "The Godfather Part 2".
This is one of the best films that take place during that key period just after the conclusion of World War 2.
Movie buffs will find the film splendidly acted and directed and car buffs will find this film intriguing for the Innovations that the Tucker Auto had right after World War 2 that caused the Big Car companies to do all they could to shut down this Innovative Car Company.
The 1940's after the war had a very slick style.
Anyway, this was an interesting supposedly- true-life story of how Preston Tucker got a raw deal form the Big Three car-makers of the day, and by the government after he built a much better automobile in 1948.
as cheap as the movie was (and i don't mean that as necessarily bad) i couldn't help but to feel some compassion for derick and derwin, particularly the part after derwin gets beat up and derick has to do that presentation by himself.
I guess after the controversy wears off, this film has absolutely nothing to lean on.
It was interesting to see these pieces after having seen that film because it is so clear that his innovative and (usually) whimsical vision were present long before that film was released.
I bought all three at a retailer for $45 and I thought THAT was a bargain after watching this one on Michel Gondry.
After being introduced to this series shortly after it came out I've taped this and shown the entire series to two women, who also loved it.
Of course this was a natural for me after studying Latin for five years (but classical Latin literature pretty much ends with Virgil and the early Augustan age)  I'm not one who normally notices good acting, only bad acting, but Jacobi (and, really, the entire cast) was brilliant.
It does get a bit repetitive after a while.
Years after watching it the first time round, I was delighted to have my hands on that "new" technology, the VCR, so that I could watch "I, Claudius" whenever I liked.
And the sets are what I am modelling my house after, and my wedding dress is going to be a toga, and my parties are going to be bigass Roman orgies with at least a few Sejanuses and a couple of Drususes and the odd Herrod Agrippa (but no beard), and lots of Caligulas- they'd be a riot.
Over the course of his long reign, Augustus has managed to bring peace to his nation after nearly a century of off-and-on civil wars.
To the surprise of all (none the least himself) this drooling, stuttering, limping old fool turns out not to be such a fool after all, and in one of history's great ironies, wins the prize everyone but he is after: absolute power.
In recreating the novels for the stage (after all, let's face it - this is predominantly a televised stage play) Pulman was constrained only by a modest budget and the limitations of the television studio.
The only thing that connects this to the first film is the title and setting, anything after that is Cohen's own creation.
He also presents the gripping dilemma that Joe faces, forced to stay and write for his son's safety and at the same time seduced by the prospect of writing a unique chronicle...and by an ex-girlfriend who has never aged after he left.
But after that Larry's script seems to have run out of ideas or time and he quickly reverts to a showdown where Joe teams up with a crusty old vampire slayer who just happens to have blown into the town.
To it's credit, RTSL goes for much longer before the camping grounds are laid, and even after that, retains a good modicum of interest.
The movie dies right after Joe (Moriarty) gave Van Meer (Fuller) the book about who the people of the town were, The Vampires.
So he was a stand-up guy after all!!
At the end of the day, there aren't many films you can return to after taking a leak and not realise that's it's still paused for 10 seconds.
Joe Eszterhas co-authored this screenplay (from an original treatment by he and Richard Marquand) about a convict (the able-bodied but colorless Jean-Claude Van Damme) who is on the run from the law after a prison-bus breakout.
There's a surprisingly minimal amount of visual excitement after the opening bust-out; that's all well and good, except that nothing of interest takes its place.
Twenty five years after "Symptoms" is a disturbing masterpiece of the horror movies and one of the most romantic studies of crazy love that other prestigious directors in the seventies, for example Truffaut, De Palma, Rivette, Richardson or Losey, did in this past prodigious '70 decade.
This was the third Larraz title I've watched after VAMPYRES (1974) and THE COMING OF SIN (1978) Â and will be promptly followed by another, THE HOUSE THAT VANISHED aka SCREAMÂAND DIE!
(1973); it's his second best-regarded effort after VAMPYRES itself and, in retrospect, a reputation that's fully deserved.
I watched this movie twice, once late at night after my kids were asleep because I knew it might be a bit scary.
Trinity went to work on me long after I saw it and some of the images achieved on a relatively low budget stick with you long after the titles have faded.
But I would watch this after Scream.
Then after the joke is played out, it just drags on.
I wasn't sure about this movie when I got it--went out on a limb after hearing some decent reviews.
A TV crew follows Leslie Vernon around, a guy who has the ambition to become the next slasher legend after his idols Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger (who exist in the movie's reality).
As Leslie shows the team how he prepares for a killing spree he deconstructs one horror rule after the other with pretty amusing results.
The Fleishcer's never quite recovered after Disney made 'Snow White' and they made their two average, but box-office dud, features (with one glaring exception-the three color Popeye's they did).
I got this film after reading the back of the cover.
I really believe Jeremy could do better with much mature skill after years practice.
Imagine my horror when I learnt that it had been cancelled after only fourteen episodes!
This level of realism within Gulliver is still astounding today, almost seventy years after the film's production.
The first episode of Trauma was the most exciting, but after that, things seemed to go downhill.
Work on this film appears to have gotten Win Sharples the scoring job for the Fleischers, one he held down after the Fleischers were given the gate by Paramount, and which he continued to hold until Famous Studios was padlocked.
There is no story, just one scene after another that is comprised of the Dead Girl looking for more idiotic victims and tons of shots comprised of the boring French provinces shown in wide angles, including a lackluster French band playing corny music.
Though the end (which results from a twist in the storyline) seemed quite odd and ordinary to me after I finished watching, it is different now.
after Catherine sets free the wounded girl from the catacombs, look at the exterior shot where she stumbles towards the water Â the way it is lit, the red boat in contrast with the green grass, the shadows separating that scenery from the concrete of the castle-wall on the right, her white dress reflecting in the shimmering water, the violin playing on the soundtrack).
after HÃ©lÃ¨ne discovered the bodies of the dead couple, she walks in on a naked Catherine playing the piano Â just look at the shot where she's sitting naked behind the piano, her back facing HÃ©lÃ¨ne), while in any given Franco movie you can't do anything but pass it off as cheap sleaze.
), is revived from a spilled can of toxic waste, put there by some corpse looters, after a minor earthquake.
A "blood sister", Helene(Marina Pierro)did not know her best friend from childhood had been dead and after a phone call leading to Catherine's discovery(hearing the sound box playing music both listened to as children)she races to the villa to see about her.
Why it was canceled after one season, is a mystery to me, but I definitely miss the characters.
After much hijinks and endless trips to the mall for eggs (Marcie keeps smashing them as she doesn't know how to do egg-painting) Snoopy saves the day and proves Linus right after all.
Admittedly, the story became a bit monotonous after a while and there were extended scenes that really didn't seem necessary to the development of the story, but director Mark Rydell does manage to pull the viewer into Rose's life, and make her a sympathetic character.
I saw most of "The Rose" on TV a few years after it came out.
The roller-coaster of emotions that you go through in this movie will stay with you long after the last credit has left the screen.
Loosely based on the real-life flash-in-the-pan live fast, live hard, live like today's almost over and tomorrow ain't never gonna happen and if you live like this too much you will most certainly die young sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll exploits of Janis Joplin, "The Rose" poignantly exposes the horrible price of fame and fortune, showing to often devastating effect the way fame destroys one's ability to have a personal life, pushes people to a near breaking point, and grinds people down to nothing after they lose the strength needed to withstand the strain being a famous person grimly entails.
I was working with The Canadian Film Institute in 1980, one year after the release of this film, and we put on a festival in Ottawa at the National Film Archives Theatre in July.
Midler's manager, Aaron Russo - who had come to check me out - called-out that I was doing Bette's "jokes" during a live performance in the world-famous "The Queen Mary", a night club in Studio City, CA - now sadly closed after 42 years.
On the final day of shooting, it became very quiet after the "wrap".
I worked for many years in "The Queen Mary" after the film was released.
Her band just casually gets on a bus and her manager grudgingly goes over and helps her up after a moment.
Loosely based upon the life of Janis Joplin and her struggles with fame and drugs, the Rose stays with the viewer long after the final fadeout.
It deals with a woman who lost her mind after her husband deserted her.
This is NOT a complaint about the play or the film--after all, Tennessee Williams was deliberately crafting a portrait of a terminally controlling and annoying lady.
A motley crew of annoying people are washed ashore after a plane crash and terror ensues when some of them inexplicably turn into incredibly cheap looking monsters.
Having said this it should be remembered that this is just a TV movie after all.
So its not a modern day Swiss Family Robinson after all.
With Kathy Ireland as a Gingeresque supermodel who presumably would never run out of cosmetics even after years on the island.
I no longer live in Florida, having decided to move to California after the death of my long-time companion/partner -- a life altering event.
I was genuinely surprised by how good this film is, especially given that it was made only a few years after Stonewall.
Made just about 5 years after the groundbreaking "Boys in The Band", this greatly improves upon that film, with no self-loathing characters, but natural, real people.
He allows himself to become a more marginal figure in some sequences Â for example when Spike Duggan is knocking out one challenger after another, Charlie isn't doing very much, and is off-screen half the time, but it's his reactions to the growing number of defeated men that is funny.
We see him grow increasingly concerned as one guy after another, all bigger and stronger than him, get up to fight and return in a state of dazed semi-consciousness.
so i was stuck with it and so today when i bought it i played through the first mission and i was so excited because i thought that it would be like that for the entire first level but no it completely changed the level after.
Let me first say that after watching the pilot I agreed with the first poster; the show was awful, and I was ready to call it quits and free up space on my DVR.
Also this is a series you can't really judge after one episode.
Critiquing a series after only seeing the pilot?
Beats the pants off the high razz-dazzle shows like Smallville, which wears after an episode or ten of shock, extremes, and special effects, all form and no substance.
But soon after i found it to easy and completed it in three days.
Medals he hangs on his fathers grave, medals which are still there 2 years later (it was the 3rd annual marathon he won in a row)... Dumb on 2 counts, obviously the leaving the medals and having them stay there for years is dumb but it shows that even 13 years after his father died, Flash has yet to move on.
The plot, in which Mick gets a job as a movie extra and uncovers an art smuggling ring, is nonsense, and whatever steam might have been left in the series after the dismal 'Crocodile Dundee II' has entirely evaporated in the intervening years.
It's all very pointless and dull, and absolutely no match for the original, which is still charming after all these years.
His innocence is still adorable after all these years, as it is his way of applying the laws of the jungle to the big city life.
After waiting for about 5 years for a third movie after seeing parts one and two, I was kind of disappointed that I would probably not see another one, but after a 13 year wait, I finally got my wish.
Even after 13 years she is still a very beautiful and attractive woman.
There's also plenty of time for Mick and Mikey to explore the terrain of the big city, which is new territory for Mikey, but for Mick-- already a veteran of a trip to New York-- it becomes just one g'day after another, mate.
Watching this movie is kind of like spending some time with an old friend; it's a fun and pleasant experience, and makes you glad you got together after all these years.
But my mind sure was changed after viewing this one!
It suffered some after Stepfanie Kramer left, but it was still good.
Under the direction of Sidney Poitier the film is a lot of fun to watch, but in viewing it again after so many years since we last saw it, the film feels flat, at times.
"Stir Crazy" is entertaining and funny for about 10 minutes and those minutes are just at the beginning, so if after this comment you are going to watch it anyway I recommend you to stop watching it just at the first moment you find it a little boring because from that moment the movie will get after each passing minute even worse until the end.
Before viewing this film, I watched the trailer to get a quick glimpse, and immediately I classified this film as a comedy, but after actually viewing the film I realized the seriousness of the piece.
An absolutely amazing man who died 7 years after this film.
Viewing this movie recently after a 25-year absence, it was a shock to me to hear the language.
I discovered it in 1994, the year after it ended, meaning I was seeing all reruns, but that didn't matter.
It wouldn't have hurt if the show had lasted longer than it did, and if it were as popular as it deserves to be, it would have been released on DVD years ago, not long after they started making "Simpsons" DVD sets!
"Confusion of Genders" is all about Alain, a wishy-washy lawyer and mostly gay bisexual who has a male lover, a female fiancÃ©, and another female who is lusting after him for reasons unknown.
The result is a less than satisfying watch with a bad after taste, when combined with lots of inconsequential dialogue and, hence, subtitle reading will make for a less than desirable watch for most.
I viewed this film with my freshman theatre arts class and after taking a vote they all rated it a 1 on a scale of 10.
I was forced to watch this movie in my English class after reading the play Antigone, and while the story itself is a classic, the movie is by far the most horrifying thing in the world.
Personally i think it is better to watch this in two parts because it gets tiresome after a while, much like i thought MST3K did.
The family edition three seasons ago and the one after that with the hippies were awesome.
But last season I stopped watching after the 4th or 5th episode.
Sure "Survivor" had it's moments, but it got tiresome after awhile.
The story also is usually confirmed on the very last minute after searching for optimal tasks and routes by the producers.
Flo is a horrible person who I hope Zach seriously distanced himself from after the race.
Frankie had stolen his hard working wife's Marybeth, Lauren Holly, vacation money and after getting smashed, on cheap booze, staggered into Vinnie's office, with Vinnie away, and plunked Marybeth's money down on Dallas adding another $5,000.00, that he didn't have, on top of it with Frankie taking the bet!
Seeing just how things got out of hand after Tony became his partner in the bookie business Vinnie then decided to quit the racket but only after he not only cleaned out Tony's clock but his chicken livered,in his always buckling down to his Mafiso boss Locasso, Uncle Pete's as well!
The Whore is about this paid prostitute who goes around humiliating guys after she has sex with them!!
I particularly enjoyed the prostitute show (especially the way she bashes the men after having sex with them) and the "what would you do for money" show; where people are asked to do various disgusting things for $$$   Comedy never tasted so good.....
I saw the film in San Francisco, in a packed theater, with Peter Berlin in person interviewed after the show.
Anyway, the frogs look like they might be killing towards the end where two of them leap on the patriarch after he falls out of his wheelchair.
Aside from gators and a few of the snakes, which were poisonous, it just seemed ludicrous seeing these totally harmless creatures supposedly on a mad killing spree--though none of them actually did a whole lot other than just hop scamper about--after all, they are just cute little critters.
Dig through there and you'll find hyper Jesusy "Left Behind" movies, films Pierce Brosnan likely forgot he did, and disk after disk of Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Chuck Norris crappy action flicks.
I remember seeing 'Frogs' on some horror channel when I was about seven but I switched over after about ten minutes because it was so boring.
Milland's character is a bit too unbelievable, after all of his family's deaths he still wants to celebrate his birthday.
I recently decided to revisit this film after seeing it in a bargain bin for a little over 5 dollars.
Probably the weirdest scene has one dying from asphyxiation after lizards caused bottles of poisons to burst on the ground, with the victim unable to free himself from the greenhouse.
Like JAWS (that came a few years after) this film is plain old nature's revenge on humanity, and nothing more.
And there's a neat little cartoon treat after the final credits roll.
And stay away from fancy french food after watching!
OK when i was younger and seen frogs for the first time it was kind of scary,then as you get older you find all the mistakes and plot holes and such.this is no way as great as Alfred Hitchcock's the birds.this one deals with a bunch of rich people all celebrating the 4th of July.y birthdays on a Florida island.the patriarch(Ray Milland)who was a hunter before his crippling accident invites his family members all doltish and strange with the exception of his granddaughter(Joan Van Ark)and a model(Judy Pace)and a photographer(Sam Elliot)who is just passing through after his canoe is capsized by a drunken boater(Adam Roarke)the scenes with the animals attacking are really bad.and don't come off as realistic.a harmless rat snake,harmless geckos and anoles,even a snapping turtle,a slow moving one at that.there is a scene where some of the characters flag down a motorist.and the motorist stops for them one of them is carrying a rifle.OK if thats me i would'nt stop for anyone especially if they are carrying a rifle.
(The beginning credit sequence is one of my favorites of all time; and stick around for a little surprise after the end credits...)
Sorrowful Jones, the cheap bookie, is played to a tee by Bob Hope, who suddenly has a little girl to look after when her father leaves her in his care as a bet marker, and doesn't come back.
A man who has suffered the atrocities of the Japanese invasion of China and suffers from the bitterness which resulted from his slaughtered child(ren), kindly succours Sarah who is clearly not looking after herself.
But he prepares a lethal cake with Sarah's sleeping pills which he had formerly substituted with rice grains, when she tried to commit suicide, after she rejected him.
A particularly well played and haunting dream sequence will stay with you long after your first viewing of the film.
The film is about a simple clairvoiant who marries a butcher after she dreams that her future husband will walk out of the sea.When she moves to New York she meets a group of people who she gives spiritual and relationship advice that turns all their lives around including her and her new husband's.
Moore believes she is fated to marry a lonely but charming butcher (the wonderful George Dzundza, looking a lot more handsome than we're supposed to think he is); after the nuptials however, she begins to have real feelings for another man, yuppie psychiatrist Jeff Daniels.
He heads for London after killing several people on the way.
For a great double feature watch Beast from 20,000 Fathoms after this for a nice follow up (Events in Beast are kind of mentioned in the final fade out)
Before, after and during making his own films, Lourie as a art director for Clint Eastwood, Sam Fuller, Jean Renoir, and Charles Chaplin.
The story centers around Sun Ra's return to Earth after an extended absence, and focuses on his concern for the fate of humanity and African-Americans in particular.
Around the 6th minute after the movie starts, when Robinson's telling Crawford that the warden's neck tie was the hardest to get from him , is hysterical , not to mention when their playing baseball in the prison's yard, or when they're digging a hole in the basement of the luggage store.
Carpenter, who always tries to incorporate western themes into his movies, modeled Snake's character after Clint Eastwood's nameless gunslinger from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, and its interesting to watch Kurt Russell translate the role to a futuristic setting.
Carpenter wrote this script after his house was robbed, and it shows.
It's great to watch Pleasance strut around pompously in the beginning of the film -- hey, after all, he's the President of the United States -- and then eventually be reduced to a pathetic, animal-like, gun-wielding thug, no better than any other criminal trapped within the walls of Manhattan.
Oh Man i watched this yesterday on tv after seeing it 20years before in the cinema!
The music is also very cool, it will stay with you a long time after you see the film.
So the authorities who are led by iconic spaghetti western actor Lee Van Cleef send in Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell) a once highly decorated soldier who s now imprisoned after a string of thefts, is coerced in to rescue him, but they trick him into thinking they've given him a vaccine, which results in a very clever plot twist which it's a device which will kill him if he doesn't complete his mission in 24 hours.
'Escape From New York'is a movie that never loses it's charm no matter how many times you see.The movie is another great result of Carpenter and Russell collaboration and even twenty five years after it's release many people(including me)consider this movie as a milestone both in action and science fiction genres and it definitely deserves it's reputation as a cult classic.The movie has a dynamic direction,a unique atmosphere,a very well written screenplay with great dialogues and characters,a fascinating score and a great cast led by Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken.Russell is outstanding as ex special forces officer turned criminal S.D.Plissken and with the help of some of the best written one liners,he makes the character unforgettable for the audience like nobody can.What a magnificent actor he is!Besides Russell,Carpenter built a top notch supporting cast including Lee Van Cleef,Ernest Borgnine,Isaac Hayes,Harry Dean Stanton,Adrienne Barbeau,Donald Pleasence with some Carpenter regulars like underrated Tom Atkins and Charles Cyphers.
As we all know the queen sets a hunter out after Snow white who escapes into the woods and finds her way to the dwarfs' cottage and...well we all know the story, but this version is filled with it's own twists and turns.
"Escape from New York" may well be seen as one of the better action movies of all times and even after 25 years it still gives me a good time when watching it.
What you do get is absolutely true-to-form with the rest of the film: Snake walks away after successfully completing his mission (and saving his own skin) and yet can still screw the authority and the society that put him in the situation to begin with...and you find yourself grinning in approval.
Sequel, Escape from LA, filmed 15 years after the original also available on DVD.
If that hasn't already put you off, this is a tale that features two bath-sharing brothers, who, after being refused compensation for their father's broken leg, take revenge by urinating on their enemy's daughter.
The only down side to all this is that, apart from Rhys who has appeared in, to date, ten movies after this, the rest of the crew involved haven't achieved success.
Rhys Ifans and Llyr Evans (brothers in reality) are Jeremy and Julian Lewis, two boys who are out for revenge after their dad is injured at work and his boss refuses to compensate him.
You would think people would get wise on how stupid this Weakest Link game show is with it's Ginger grim-faced presenter that looks worse for wear after many years doing her show.
*** Quick trivia note on a goof spotted - Right after Denton drinks from the broken liquor bottle at the beginning of the story, he's shown with a large scratch on the right side of his face.
It was still a critical stage for the series and a quality episode was required after the disastrous 'One for the Angels'.
As Denton after his powers have been restored, Duryea is hangdog and resigned to the inevitable.
Even the stars agreed, after the show, people like P-Diddy, 3LW and Carson Daly commented on Shakira's performance and how great it was, and it was talked about for days.
And don't think to much about kind of Âmessages' in the jokes: after films, which should be funny because of racial stereotypes, excessive drinking, puking, crapping, re-animating dogs, eating dog-shit, drinking sperm in beer and f**king apple pies, I don't see a problem in the (absolutely funny)ÂHitting-Women'-Joke, when all the male characters are hitting themselves through the whole movie.
There are so many good lines in this film that it continues to be amusing watch after watch and for the first few viewing had me almost in tears at some points.
After Christopher McDonald says "Yeah Right, and Grizzley Adams had a beard", after he walks away the screen goes to the green where all the people are and the car that hits Happy Gilmore later is already crashed even though the seen has not happened yet.
Happy, after meeting Chubbs (Carl Weathers), goes to the Waterbury open where he nearly kills his caddy because he thinks he's getting robbed.
David Spade, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Steve Martin, and Bill Murray are the other men who have done well after Saturday Night Live.
Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a nearly unlikeable loser who after a strangely traumatic childhood, grew up to be a raving, anti-social lunatic, who happens to be obsessed with hockey.
This whole movie is one hilarious moment after another.
We were reunited in 1993 after finding a graduation notice from his high school.
Someone did contact me after my sale and offered to sell me a DVD of the movie which I accepted right away, I watch the movie at least once or twice a month.
imagine people eating apples and becoming apples after that.
What reaction am I supposed to get after seeing people turn into apples?
The second and third horror stories were more of comedies and the movie got less horrific after the initial 20 minutes.
Perfect strangers were hugging each other after this film!
It is a wake up call - a prophetic challenge to Hollywood's "conventional wisdom" with layers of meaning that keep unfolding long after one has left the theater.
How about that bit after the film?
A bunch of Unity people got together after the movie to have pot luck and talk about the movie, and no one would say anything.....just two people brought up a couple of "lines" that they thought were good and then silence!
Either way, after partaking in the magical mystical movie Indigo you will never again look at the world the same!
Helas, that already happened after 10 minutes!
The seeming moral of this movie is that you can take a couple that is drifting hopelessly apart, strand them on a deserted island for a couple of days, and then they can live happily ever after.
On the plus side, there were several good laughs, it was for the most part quite wholesome, everyone does eventually live happily ever after, and the beautiful Roma put in a good performance as always.
This film is just one banal art-house cliche after another.
Why does she go back to him after saying she won't?
Mr Ru whom after 30 tears of marriage is feeling homosexual falling in love with a young guy the same age as his son, making his wife's life miserable.
The third chapter is about Susanna, the local landlord, middle-aged, homely, and never-been-loved and the trials she puts herself through after a fateful tarot-card reading predicting the imminent appearance of a man in her life.
One of the first great scenes of the movie is when, after abusing his wife a few days earlier, he's crying on her lap and looking for comfort and she's reluctant to console him.
This movie is an impressive and exciting story about the people,their feelings,love,desperation,anger and hope.Although the scenario is a little bit melodramatic , the film is a must indeed.It is quite different from the blockbusters with happy ends because it is real and outstanding.Several lives and fates are mixed in it.Every character has his own unique personality.They all have to take decisions for their lives and have to fight for happiness.The actors are very nice.The stunning Hayek makes a good performance .Gomes Krus is also convincing as a man who becomes gay after 30 years marriage.The supporting roles are also well-played.Don't think that this is some kind of soap opera- it is something deeper...
Then ultimately you will be justly rewarded by film's end because this is one of the few, and I do mean few, American remakes (and a comedy no less) that is worth watching time after time!
That's her big breakthrough after an hour and a half of being very mousey and shy.
Ah, I think, at last a film with the courage to laugh at death while looking it straight in the eye, to derive its humor from a wellspring of suffering, which, after all, is the best, truest form of humor.
It took about 20 minutes for me to get into the general idea of the characters but after that I was lost in the world of the unfortunate situation the brothers had found themselves in.
Can't say I was surprised after seeing her in Dirty, Filthy Love but I never recognise her name as an actress.
In "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself," a young man - who basically lives from one unsuccessful suicide attempt to another - is looked after and cared for by his brother who is suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer.
The affair continues even after Harbour is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
Harbour, rather than try to go on fighting a almost certain death sentence from cancer, commits suicide in the hopes his brother will honor his promise to look after his wife and stepdaughter, giving Wilbur a reason to live.
Chronic lateness brings the Scots equivalent of a pink slip and Alice ends up working at the bookstore after she quickly falls in love with Harbour.
It's almost 30 years since I last watched Chico, but I still remember the theme song after all this time.
At dawn on Monday 27 June 1880, after a courageous stand-off at the Glenrowan Inn, Kelly emerged wearing his home-made plate metal armour and helmet, still firing at police, before being shot down and arrested.
With this film, Shemp Howard demonstrates no rustiness after being absent from the Stooges for 14 years.
Thus Fallon and Viel created Rane, an ex-cop who has his future taken from him (in more ways than one) in a brutal opening sequence, and who then proceeds to make the perpetrators pay dearly for their actions after putting an arrow in his head (see what they did there?)
Being a devoted Michael Caine fan I was horrified after watching "Shadow Run" that I indeed had spent money on the DVD.
The excitement/suspense slowly keeps building up scene after scene.
However, just like Cameron Thomas, he was not able to stay faithful to his wife and family and ran after every woman he could find.
it's a wonder the poor slob, and a doctor to boot!, isn't impotent after going through all the shame, the shame, the shame.
Jan McGill as Wood's wife meanwhile is just so outright bad that it's no wonder that Wood's character doesn't seem all that effected when she (thankfully) leaves him not long after the film begins (I'd be relieved too).
James Wood is Lloyd Hopkins, the jaded cop who throws himself into one particular case after his wife, Penny, leaves him.
After that screening I called a friend and told him that the Korean master had made a manifest about human cruelty, after seeing "Deaden" I thought that Christian Viel (the director) and John Fallon (the screenwriter, actor and producer) have made a manifest about human rage.
The history of a man betrayed by a system in which he believed in, first, by becoming what he hate most and after that by being abandoned by them after the brutal murder that I talked before.
and we know what he'll do after the revenge is complete and why he'll do that.
(End of spoilers)   The movie perfectly reflects the anger and the rage that invades you after you're assaulted or your girlfriend is raped or simply when you're humiliated by your boss or betrayed by someone you love.
He's the kind of cop who picks up on the bad guys girlfriend after he shoots him dead on the street.
The plot focuses on your everyday hard-bitten cop, Lloyd Hopkins, who after investigating the murder of a woman in Los Angeles, comes to believe that a serial killer may be operating in the area.
Compared to the rest, this is definitely a standout--one that got me thinking well after the film ended.
This woman is fighting for a cure but ends up quarantined from her daughter who resents her mother being away from her after her fathers death."
You will remember the characters in this movie many months after you see and hear their story.
Caveat: I gave up after about an hour.
Our band of merry adventurers after 17 days paddling up an African river doesn't show the slightest signs of sun exposure or physical discomfort.
This is one of those movies in which increasingly contrived events keep happening ... and AFTER each one occurs, we realise that it didn't really happen after all: Claire seems to be turning more and more hallucinatory as the film proceeds.
You can stop watching after the first scene in the basement, I'm going to give you a quick summary: The main character doesn't say anything until it is too late.
The film takes place in the fifties and we focus on David Moran; a young boy who meets a young girl named Meg Loughlin when she moves in next door with her sister after the death of their parents.
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is based on the bestseller by Jack Ketchum, which is based on the torture and murder of Sylvia Likens, a case which I did extensive research on to understand what this film was about, and compared to my research the actual events were certainly more brutal than what is shown in the film, but the film still packs a powerful punch, think of it as a semi truck packed full of mixed emotions, because thats what you'll feel like after you've watched this film, like you got hit by a truck and you're left with a bag of mixed emotions.
The acting is brilliant, each of the cast members did more than a great job, but it was rather the character story of the developing relationship between Meg and David that gave this film its actual strength, and the very last moment between these two characters is something that would even make a grown man cry, which takes place after the grueling last fifteen minutes.
I'm writing this at 4 a.m. because after watching this show, I can't sleep.
I am still deeply disturbed and have been for days after seeing this film.
"The Girl Next Door" is based on the true (yes TRUE events) story of a young girl named Meg and her sister Susan who move in with a foster mom after their parents are killed in an accident.
He lays with her and cries as she slowly dies after some words to hi.
If there is an intelligent creator-he/she/it would just set us all ablaze after seeing the things we do.
This is ridiculous because the boy continues to go over to the house time after time watching (and sometimes partaking) in said torturous activities.
The film is a true story set in the 50's about a two young sisters who go to live with their aunt after losing both parents in a car accident.
At first the young David seems like a lucky fellow-playing games with local friends, drinking beer next door at his neighbour's place, and meeting Meg, a lovely young lass who is adjusting to a new life at Auntie Ruth's house with her caliper-splint wearing sister after losing her parents in an automobile accident.
I got mine off eBay after a bidding war.
The language of course is off the charts, but the childish ignorance of adult content (Stan seeks the clitoris after Chef tells him that's how you keep a girl around) is there too.
ahem, Terrance and Phillip... so basically, the 4 boys watch the Terrance and Phillip movie which is very rude yet hilarious, so after they watch it they become vulgar mouths and the south park parents are very angry and rages a war against Canada for making children become potty mouths.
The profanity angers Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny's mothers (but mostly Kyle's) after they see it, and they tell them never to see it again.
Even more surprising is how the film stormed into the public imagination after "Alien3" (1992), Fincher's sour--and quickly forgotten--directorial debut.
-and I say that being a person whose hated musicals all his life with a fiery passion  -The movie chronicles the events that takes place after the gang sneaks in to see an R rated movie.
The story is about the four boys of South Park (Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman) and after they go into a rated R Terrence and Phillip flick, they start to use their new founded dirty words to excessive use.
The investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes Mills and Sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins.
Sommerset is like a sniffer dog released from the pound after a long and tedious stay.
Meanwhile, his business associate Carey wonders what's going on and local sheriff Ansara keeps looking for him (even several weeks after the disappearance!)
Sadly, he would suffer a devastating motorcycle accident not long after this, losing an arm and a leg.
Really just a series of skits about carrying on in the English way after a nuclear attack, the film never connects in any way with the viewer.
Anyone who thought Brad Pitt was all good looks and no talent will have to take it back after seeing him convince beautifully as Mills, and Freeman's character is, for once, not the sugar-sweet know-it-all he's typecast himself as.
...Yet I couldn't stop laughing all the way through, even after the 10th time.
The main character is dreadfully afraid that he is going to turn into an English Bed Sitting Room (a room in a house: Wikipedia "bed sitting room") All of this occurs against the backdrop of the world after it has been nuked to a trash pile.
Made by Richard lester (A hard Days Night, Superman 2 & 3) in 1969, just before Monty Python hit pay dirt, it tells the story of Brits after the bomb, working class through to upper, it encapsulates the British eccentricities perfectly.
If you catch it, you'll wonder if you saw it, then you'll be angry that you've never heard of it, after that you'll never forget it, it's just a shame you'll probably never get to see it...
(Her pregnancy arouses Hordern--until she gives birth, after seventeen months, to what is either a bird or a large pile of felt.)
So she cuddles up to and makes out with the guy who she first thought killed her brother, but who turns out to be a good guy and they live happily ever after on the $3 mil in real and counterfit money that every body was after in the beginning.
The concept was kind of funny, but after a while the single joke got kind of thin.
This is where the title of the film was derived, but about 80% of the short occurred after this and was unrelated to the song, other than the fact it was all told as a giant morality tale against vice.
However, unlike in IT'S A GIFT and THE BANK DICK, in which Fields surprises us with one hilarious punch-line after the other, the verbal gags are at best only mildly amusing, serving as little more than "fillers" in order to maintain the interest of the viewer.
The Godfather, Seven Samuri, The Third Man: all fantastic, but after messing around for many years pondering over what is "the best film ever made" I find that I need look no further than this abominable piece of piffle that conceals within its two creaky reels, the quintessence of the art.
As far as anime adaptations go I haven't seen the original series and have no idea how it corresponds to the original story, but after enjoying Speed Racer and Transformers this just isn't the same.
The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind.
But high among the clouds in Metro City, President Stone (Donald Sutherland) is after him for his Blue Core, a powerful crystalline nugget that Dr. Tenma implanted in his chest.
I'm sorry I paid to see it, but that's what "caveat emptor" means after all.
Astro, as the mechanical Toby eventually becomes known, is shattered after Dr. Tenma rejects him for not being able to live up to his human counterpart, and realizing that he's not who he thinks he is, Astro leaves the Metro in search of a place where he feels he'll belong.
But if you look for the things you can learn after seeing the movie, Astroboy is one thing you're gonna enjoy.
The beginning to this movie was captivating, but after a while it starts to lose it's flair.
I just really wished this movie was in 3D and it would have been one heck of a thrill ride, after finishing this movie it felt like it was made to be 3D which was a disappointment cause it was not...Bummer, oh well maybe in part 2 or part 3 where they might title it "Astro Boy 3D".
And only thing left after seeing it was a wish to warn others not to see it.
Didn't get the point when President is still speaking of reelection after being absorbed by a giant robot destroying city.
Freeman is Detective Somerset, ready to take his retirement, while Pitt is Detective Mills, who has been hired to take on Somerset's job after the latter leaves the homicide section.
It did feel as though the voice work was done after visuals and not vice versa which led to a somewhat flat performance by some actors.
Yes, it was very directed at kids, you know, the far off humour and such, but when I saw Toby, the genius' "kid", I felt that the movie was after all NOT just a Pinocchio rip-off where an old man made a robot-boy because he was bored or lonely... the reasons behind the creation of Astroboy were tragic and even mature.
Even though the effect wears off after repeated viewing, you can always remember the way you felt after your first experience with this movie.
warning:if you choose to watch this movie,know that you will enter on a dark and twisted journey.David Fincher directs this film,which concerns a serial killer who executes people,using the seven deadly sins as justification.though there are some horrific and graphic images here,there real genius of this movie is it's implied horror.this movie will leave you with an impact long after the end credits have rolled.David Fincher directs this intense psychological suspense thriller.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives on the trail of the killer.Freeman plays veteran Detective Lt. William Somerset,on the verge of retirement,after this case.Pitt plays rookie detective Detective David Mills.Kevin Spacey also stars in a powerful performance that is mesmerizing.this is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen so far.if you are not affected by this movie,i'd be surprised.for me,Se7en is easily a 10/10
It's not the first, but this one features the astonishing Kierston Wareing, who landed this leading role after appearing briefly in just one TV episode.
Had he made "The Game" right after "Alien 3", there would have been no "Fight Club", or "Panic Room".
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Angie (Kierston Waring) is fired from her job after not taking any cr*p off her boss who pinches her bum in public.
This is a film full of characters to feel sorry for, trapped in a system that makes them all go over the edge, from Angie who has a soft, caring side that allows her to take an Iranian family under her roof after discovering them living in poverty to a need to succeed that sees her reporting a rival camp of illegal workers so she can move her own in to, of course, the workers with a genuine desire to work and contribute something who end up going through all that cr*p for peanuts.
The first is (David Mills/Brad Pitt) who is so rash, tense, running mostly after his sensations and always relies on the photos, the shape of things.
But after an attempted suicide, he divorces her.
Death comes again, this time for Madame Von Meck, who suffers a mental illness after becoming bankrupt.
It appears that Tchaikovsky felt he used Van Meck and she haunted him after her death.
It was sad when they canceled it after the second season, but it could have been worse.
This is my fourth favorite cartoon, right after The Simpsons, Futurama, and Pinky & The Brain.
Originally a teenage computer nerd, he becomes Freakazoid overnight after he is zapped by the computer screen, whilst on his PC and thus he becomes a totally different character, wearing a black mask and what looks like either red leather spandex or tight skinned pyjamas.
Larry Jackson (David Morrissey) thinks he is seeing a ghost: a convict-turned-informant named Eddie Myers (Timothy Dalton) who was supposed to have died after escaping custody.
I am dumber after having watched this movie.
Synopsis : Here is a tale of a young woman, Laura Kove, who struggles after being subjected to some frightening occurances on Halloween night.
And I can also state quite confidently that the scariest movies were made in the between the 60's and 80's (Exorcist, Amityville Horror, Rosemary''s Baby, Carrie, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw, Evil Dead.... just to name a few), and the crap that came out after that was mostly crap (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Candy Man, The Others, and your average slasher thrill-kill flicks...).
Any casting director who worked on this film would be forced into suicide after viewing it, so I can agree with another poster who took the opinion that these actors are the director's friends, or friends of friends.
Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity.
But soon she notices that things in her apartment are being arranged, and after one terrifying incident she is convinced her apartment is haunted.
I mean, I am a busy person... but this film was well worth my time... Perhaps the best Brad Pitt film that I have seen, this film involves two detectives (Pitt and Freeman) going after a delusional killer (Kevin Spacey) who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, lust, etc... Spacey takes pride in his killings and leaves clues for the police, similar to "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz when he murdered six women in New York City in the 1970's ("Summer of Sam"= another great film)...
My only regret is that I had did not see it until 10 years after its theatrical release...
Nikki killed and buried Malculm Dixon, but she accepts to go to the abandoned house in the night to show the corpse to Elizabeth after seeing the weird events in Laura's kitchen.
On a small level, nobody knows why he throws milk over his shoulder into a customer's face or why he takes so long preparing for his own meal after he wakes up.
The horrific crimes of Doe are patterned after the Seven Deadly Sins Â for Gluttony, one victim was literally forced to eat until his internal organs exploded; for another, Greed, the victim is forced to cut an actual pound of flesh away from his own body.
I thought this movie was decent and, but of course, I knew when I got it I wouldn't be saying after I had watched it, "Oh my god, this movie was perfect, it's the best movie ever!"
Apparently if you are a really hot, oppressed teenage boy whose parents want you to be a "real" athlete and play baseball, you can get on a horse (after falling more times than is really necessary, the horse was already trained and it was rearing/bucking?
After each character is introduced, the film follows the journey of the men from areas of the Bronx (where beer bottles are thrown at the car after a protective father hears one of the men whistling at his daughter) to Midtown Manhattan, where the group partake in some harmless pre-Giuliani peep-show fun.
What's most heartbreaking is what came after this film; after the promise of his debut, Vasquez was given a ton of money and backing for his next feature, but the film had to be shut down after a week of shooting as Vasquez was walking around the soundstage proclaiming himself Jesus, among other insane ramblings.
It just kind of ends, and you really don't know where it goes after the ending, well you do and you don't.
I then heard a CNET radio segment on the film and decided it might be kind of interesting after all.
I assume that the Linux OS and the idea of open source did not lose steam after the dot-com stock bubble burst.
But after watching it, I feel like this is a documentary that I could show my parents so that they can better understand the Open Source Community that I call myself a member of.
The lady turns out to be wacky Carole Lombard and just before March shows up to interview her, she finds out from her dopey doctor (Charles Winninger) that he was wrong in his diagnosis and she will live after all.
Soon after, she meets Wally, who wants to bring her to New York for a last fling at the expense of the paper, which will follow her until her last poisoned breath.
after watching this movie,one thing really struck me:how talented Carole Lombard was as an actress.she has a real gift for comedy,of which there is a fair amount in this film.i found i very funny,but beyond that,i just thought it was well written,and even more relevant today than back then.it basically skewers every imaginable target,including the price of fame,and paints pretty much everybody as phonies,when you you get right down to it.even your average every day person is painted with that brush.but this is also a romance and drama,and it also works on those levels.Fredric March is the male lead,and he does pretty well in the role.the supporting players are also good,but,like i said,it is Carole Lombard who steals the show.i had a great time watching this film,and highly recommend it.my vote for Nothing Sacred:8.5/10
The plot itself has a lot of built-in tension because, after all, both Lombard and the audience know she isn't sick.
The same thing happens when one of the parties cancels a wedding at the last minute, after the invitations have been sent out and the presents have arrived.
In brief, Wally Cook is a New York tabloid reporter relegated to the obituaries after his most recent story is exposed as fake.
The team of David O. Selznick producer, William Wellman director, and Fredric March leading man, after having had a big hit the year before with A Star Is Born, teamed up again to create one of the great screwball comedies of the Thirties in Nothing Sacred.
What will give you chills is the pervading knowledge as you hear Carole Lombard's dialogue about death and dying...that she wasn't to ever grow old gracefully, but died in a plane crash not long after this film was made.
On a seemingly ordinary day like any other something terrible is happening in Starline Tower, a university professor named Dr. Emil Hobbes (Fred Doederlein) has just brutally killed a young girl whom he was both having an affair with & using as a guinea pig for his bizarre experiments & he slits his own throat shortly after.
Watching this again after a gap of so many years I was amazed at how much sex there was in it.
Though the low-budget is pretty obvious and some things about it are dated, (this WAS over thirty years ago, after all), Cronenberg still stages some scenes of horror here that will have you open-mouthed with shock and surprise.
Dr. St. Luc as a rather interesting hairstyle, too, kind of an extreme wind-blown look, perhaps achieved by applying spray after coming in out of a gale.
And then, after all the fun is over at home, why not take a drive to Montreal?
It is, after all, only minutes away.
( film critic Barry Norman said he felt like throwing up in the gutter after watching it ).
You won't eat a Hot Dog again after seeing this film!
Nearly 15 years after her best role in "Black Sunday" she still is the yummiest witch queen of B-cinema!
That's Hamlet, part-time movie critic for the Elsinore Herald-Gazette, writing his review after watching this reverential dud.
In between is just one dull scene after another as Stewart tracks down Mr. Big and the Secret Service stays on Stewart's tail.
Payton's life was a sad, sordid melodrama, finishing at the age of 39 after alcoholism, public drunkenness and arrests for heroin and prostitution.
why would bloody bill believe that gwen was his sister and the fact that they look XACTLY like each other isn't very plausible either, and it would have been nice to find out what happened to gwen after she left death valley.
These zombies, supposed to be ghosts of those cursed by Bill after he returned from the Civil War broken and defeated, finding that they had murdered his sister, only to be executed by the township, using the notorious killer's own sword, are yet another retread of the George Romero brand where they rip away flesh and drop when shot in the head.
Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.
Point is, a lot of this, however just totally ludicrous it all sounds (Bloody Bill's a confederate- no Yankees or blacks after all), could just be moot if it was at least a halfway decently acted or technically executed effort.
A group of what look to be mostly 20 year olds set off in a van on what I think was a going to a trip to a debating contest.Along the way they get hijacked by a dope dealer who is trying to find his partner who has disappeared out in the Arizona landscape somewhere.Anyway the group tracks the dope dealer to a ghost town in the middle of nowhere.Shortly after arriving the kids are attacked by the missing dope dealer who is all bloody and talks kinda funny.
So immediately one of the debaters starts rattling off about the legend of Bloody Bill,a confederate solider ,who ended up out west after the war was over.Legend has it that Bill swore revenge on the town-folk who had killed him for bad stuff he did in the war.How they linked the wounded dope dealer up to Bloody Bill so quick was sort of glossed over and the kid who knew all the details was obviously and painfully reading his lines as we watched flashbacks of how Bill came to be.
to this same over informed male character after he has been bitten by a zombie, meanwhile, he is screaming in pain!!
Also, why does the little "population" count on the town sign keep ticking up after people are killed, but does not tick down for the zombies that have been destroyed?
Brittany Murphy is a girl in the navy who is dishonorably discharged after she experiments with another girl.
JTT's performance after he was beaten and raped was very sad and moving not to mention dramatic.
Set is 1954, it follows a young Naval woman home to Homer, Connecticut after she is given a dishonorable discharge due to "sexual deviancy."
The first on passes in 1954, when a navy officer (the great actress Brittany Murphy) returns to Homer after quitting Navy.
He soon becomes obsessed with finding the pistol and feels especially guilty after he finds out that it has been used to commit multiple murders.
Even with some very slow bits in this film, I still have to say it is my second favorite film by Kurosawa (after Seven Samurai, of course).
Mifune's Detective Murakami and the criminal Yusa are, ostensibly, mirror images of one another--both are young veterans who had their possessions stolen from them on the train-ride home after the war.
On first glance the scene feels too long and the audience gets the point after a minute, but by doing this the focus turns from the plot to the character of Murakami as the viewer sees how badly he wants his gun back.
At times he can only focus on getting his stolen gun back at any cost, getting person X and not noticing his surroundings, and blindly heading after people.
Harumi Namiki, who is the murder's girlfriend changes her mind after the rain fall and decides to help the detectives.
Then a woman who buys it becomes ill, and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing (apparently she barfed on it) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter, who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train, a bus driver, and then gives up the dress to send to Africa, but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up, trims it a bit, and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker, who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away, etc.
Only after the premise is established does the movie slow down.
Mifune's cop is, after all, not too different from the psychopath whom he pursues: both are veterans in their late twenties who ended up on entirely different paths which have suddenly converged.
Mifune is an honorable young man who chooses to be a hero: after all, it would've been easier to quit the force after enduring the shame of getting his gun stolen, and it certainly would've been easier to roam the black-markets like his antagonist Yusa and generally cave in to psychopathy.
Mifune explains how his possessions were all stolen after the war, and that he contemplated turning to crime but decided on the opposite route of law enforcement.
It tells the story of a policeman who, after experiencing the theft of his gun while travelling on a bus, embarks on an odyssey to retrieve it.
You can almost smell the steamy atmosphere of a morning after rain where everything is about to heat up again.
During the trip, one of the singers takes an unreasoning dislike to the sailor, picks one childish fight after another with him, rummages through his possessions, and comes up with a theory that he killed the person on the earlier voyage because of a love triangle of some sort.
Usually movies so-called curveballs don't catch me off guard, I am after all one of the viewers who knew instantly that the guy was actually dead in "The Sixth Sense" - it was plainly obvious to me but seemed to surprise some people - so I was a little taken aback by the curveball in this wannabe DEAD CALM.
I think after that I'd be looking for the nearest ship, island anything to get rid of them both!
Notice the double standard of Kensit's character as she first has sex with a man (in exchange for something she expects but never gets) & then disapproves her friend's (Hurley's) going a bit "too far" after their burlesque dance routine.
It's impossible to comment on the performances, or on much else for that matter, after the passage of so many years but unless my brain has turned to tofu, I'm compelled to recommend the film.
It's revealing to me that someone else.. as a child.. after so many years.. could have come away from the film with the same, exact feelings.
The last 30 minutes are really intense after Lovejoy cracks, stupidly admits his crime and is unfairly accosted as the murderer (he was the accomplice, not the murderer.)
Then, the townsfolk, fueled by sensationalist journalism by the local paper, form into a huge lynch mob and storm the jail after the two criminals.
I saw this movie as a child, and had a chance to see it recently after more years than I want to admit.
It's a script that fiddles with the time-line of a man from mid-twenties to (tragic) death with interviews after the fact, and for anyone who knows the name and work of Lenny Bruce would do well to see this 'version' of his life.
All this substitution took place while I was in South America and was recalled to film additional scenes, after shooting had ended.
They learn to respect each other's strength and virtue after the usual initial mutual suspicion.
Director/co-writer Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu departs from the pattern established by the previous 4 directors and makes the driver more of a background character, focusing instead on a war photographer who, after snapping a shocking series of photographs, is on the run and grievously injured.
He is unable to help them and all he can do is take their picture as all he is after all is a witness.
Later on,after trying to find something on TV I saw this movie and was like "oh,this is Lenny Bruce".
I was very surprised after watching the other films from the BMWs films "The Hire", because although all were clever and entertaining, none had the emotional power of this one.
This is the kind of war movie they stopped making after Vietnam, so it really has a distinct nostalgic feeling to it.
the only gripe is sometimes the action is a little repetitive after a while but its only a small gripe.
Of course "Bastards" was also part and well, I will be trying to see all of those films now not before but after Tarantino's "Basterds" and yes, I'm still a newcomer in regards of war pictures and yes if not for QT I probably would have never seen this film, hell anyways it would have never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray (the 3-disc edition contains a really great conversation with QT and Castellari).
This half-of-a-dozen "Dirty Dozen" actioneer has court-martialed American soldiers and a reckless Air Force pilot escape from an escort of MPs after they clash with the enemy.
I somehow doubt the real Lenny Bruce, shock-comedian of the early 1960s who quickly passed into legend after his self-inflicted death, was so romantically melancholic.
Even, though many scenes are shot against animated backgrounds, it contains one of the best of it's kind, take notice of the huge field of scrap metal after the Americans have dropped a plethora of nasty bombs.
It's 30 years old and contains many scenes seen in many movies made after Inglorious Bastards; the air of the movie is filled with scenes, seen in other movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Enemy at the Gates, Stalingrad, Das Boot.
Quentin Tarantino is the last person to re-write and direct a movie like this if he don't get a grip after his total fiasco Grindhouse: Deathproof.
When everything seems to be on schedule, the mission suffers a major set-back when a second train featuring a host of German soldiers arrives in the village where the first was supposed to stop, with many men dead after all is said and done.
Much of this film doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but you won't realize it doesn't make sense until after the movie's over, because while you're watching it it's easy to be distracted by the energy of the storytelling and film-making.
I don't really know why they shot it in black and white but after a while it didn't bother me anymore.
To be honest, after hearing a few things about this film and that it's being compared to The Dirty Dozen, I was not surprised at how funny, light and enjoyable this film was.
The Italian industry from the 50's to the late 70's thrived by imitating big Hollywood box office hits and even though The Inglorious Bastards came a good 10 years after the WWII action cycle of the 60's, it's still a welcome addition to the genre.
Two years after his spaghetti western masterpiece Keoma, director Enzo G. Castellari gathers a cast of b-movie stalwarts spearheaded by Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson, a couple hundred disposable extras in Nazi uniforms and unleashes hell.
Basically, a bunch of US soldiers, on their way for court-martial/execution, somehow, escape after an incident, and go on the run... only to find themselves getting embroiled in a mission involving a train, a whole s***load of Nazi's, and perhaps a few casualties here and there Â few dozen to few hundred give or take.
... That is, after all, what the subject in question was all about; candidly highlighting the REAL 'evils' of the world and arguing very convincingly that there wasn't much wrong with discussing common truths, even if they DID happen to be 'unpleasant'.
Hoffman brilliantly shows us a guy unafraid to bare his soul on stage night after night, and when the authorities took that away from him, there was basically nothing worthwhile left.
It's like "Time Of The Beast" tries to make you forget it ever existed after you've seen it.
In order to test his wife's fidelity after a bout, the Actor (Lunt) disguises himself as a foreign guardsman, goes out of his way to meet his wife in disguise, and furthermore goes on to try and seduce her.
You knew from the start who did it, but they continued to try to screw with our heads even after the killer was dead.
No wonder none of the actors never acted in many films after.
A poor farmer struggles to keep his family fed after leaving the security of working as a farmhand to develop his own farm.
And Norman Lloyd as roguish nephew, he's a veteran player still acting , who joined the original company of Orson Welles-John Houseman Mercury Theatre and after that he was hired to Hollywood to play as secondary actor in Alfred Hitchcock movie and other ones and made him an associate producer.
The bad make-up job doesn't help either and serves as a constant reminder that the Tuckers are after all only a make-believe family.
And when Sam does waver after the flood, it's Nona providing the strength to persevere.
At Versailles the Serb king was made monarch over the whole polyglot nation and after World War II, a very charismatic leader named Josip Broz Tito led an independent Marxist/Socialist government.
the "clever" lines before and after kick some terrorist ass without even being touch were a joke, but the kind of funny stuff that doesn't supposed to be laughable.
Since after it was aired there has not been a mini-series in production.
Anyway, after Winds of War I remember someone saying in an article in TV Guide or someplace that they would never make War and Remembrance because it was just too big.
Volume 1 ends after living in relative luxury with Aaron and Natalie being transported to Theriesenstadt.
I actually saw this film not that long ago on History Channel, after seeing the entire Winds of War on network TV when I was down with a back injury years ago.
However, with 5 years between the first and the second series, much happened and the result was a number of actor/actress changes that make the second series confusing after seeing the first.
I felt good to watch this, but rather than the plot generating this fuzzy feeling, it's probably really just brought on by the memories of watching B-movies at 4AM after a good night out.
But what the hell was this bunch of guys, both Sub-Carpatian Ukrainian and mafioso like looking, that came after them???
I can't think of a single place in the Czech Republic where gypsies would look anything like it, not mentioning the fact that after 40 yrs of communism there's zero left of their traditional life.
I have to say that after watching this movie the first time, I totally enjoyed it.
Nonetheless:good acting, good dialouge(for the most part), good direction, but after repeat viewing the movie doesnt hold its strength.
We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone.
I don't know if it's just the greatness of the actors overcoming an under-thought out script, or whether it's just the script concentrated solely on crafting great scenes one after the other, but not so much in coming up with a convincing through-line.
(It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)
Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he is scarred and left destitute following a break-in.
This is a pretty boring slasher in my opinion, as I was quite disappointed, after reading lots of positive stuff about it.
This is a pretty boring slasher in my opinion, as I was quite disappointed after reading lots of positive stuff about it, and I say avoid it.
In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the "pre-fantasy" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.
Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, "wait, what?
You mean to tell me that after our hide and seek game, from your perspective I must've disappeared for hours, and you didn't wonder where I was???"
***Random personal trivia: I finally saw this three years after the movie had come out, but it wasn't random.
This is a tremendously talented actor, and even after a string of consistently brilliant performances in outstanding films, I don't think he's getting the recognition that he deserves.
I've never read the books but after this movie I'm ready to take a trip to the bookstore.
I expected much of this movie, I mean, the special effects of the commercials seemed great, it was like a war between the good guys vs. the bad guys, and after all I was right.
So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance.
Perhaps one of the strongest points of "Lenny" is that it does not overtly proclaim the truth of this sentiment, one way or the other - the overdose sequence comes, naturally, after the crescendo of Lenny's legal losses and might therefore lead one to believe that his death was caused by his struggle for freedom of speech.
Not surprisingly, they arrested him after that.
It was just sex scene after sex scene, which can get boring pretty fast.
Scott Baio stars as a high school kid who gains telekinetic powers after experiencing a scientific mishap.
Barney finds himself falling for pretty student reporter Bernadette (Felice Schachter) while Peyton spends the movie lusting after sexy but snooty Jane (Heather Thomas).
Those cheesy and sentimental ballads got to be a little much for me after a while, but they don't really erase the charm of this fun flick.
Nerdy high school science whiz Barney Springboro (a likable performance by Scott Baio) acquires telekinetic powers after being exposed to an experimental batch of premium grade marijuana.
Ironically though, such a structure might have deprived of us of seeing more of Hoffman doing Lenny's bits 'live' on stage - and for me these were the highlights, which I wish had lasted longer, rather than flashing back to some past event after 30 seconds.
Fosse, known for his choreography which is still being used in films like Chicago years after his death only directed five theatrical films and three of those were musicals in Sweet Charity, Caberet and All That Jazz so Lenny would be the first of only two non-musicals he would direct, both biographies, Lenny and Star 80.
I love gangster movies and after seeing this i even loved it more.
Seeing one of these "B" Westerns some sixty years after they were made is a neat exercise in nostalgia, and only goes to show how far films have come since the good old days.
The first thought that sprang to mind after the movie was: Why did I have to see this movie?
I think the scene where the old man began dancing a jig and laughing crazily after finding the "precious" ore tipped me off.
And it's a shame his point didn't resonate until after his death.
Toward the end of the film, he takes Judge Turner to dinner; before long, the entire cast is at the table talking and arguing as the waiters continually sing "Happy Birthday" to one customer after another, and a diner at another table tries to retrieve Rudy Vallee's chair for his own party - it's a great scene.
However, soon after, Grant delivers a lecture on the pleasures of a career in art to the local high school.
I went into this film knowing nothing about the comic Lenny Bruce, and after watching this film I have already added two of his CDs to my Wish List.
Born well after his death, I had never even heard of the man, but the words that I witnessed from this film from his mouth shocked me.
Under the direction of Irving Reis, this comedy is still fun to watch after all these years.
and surely relates to this period,after Tom's mother's death,where Tom's heart is moribund.
The film doesn't talk down to the audience, something I find very refreshing after a summer of blockbusters...the first few minutes are a bit chaotic and confusing and they mirror the troubled protagonist.
I think if this show came out right after Renegade went off the air in 97 it would have gone at least 3 seasons.
Let's just take a bow for a moment before a film which DARES show that actually, in these situations, in 9 cases after 10, YOU LOSE.
More formula as we see him at the piano naked from the waist up after making love, flattering lighting, Chopin, Debussy, Bach and Mozart.
two days after watching the film i am still pondering what was meant by the glance at the end, what kind of emotions tom must have & why he does not kill the Russian guy.
My favorite scene of the entire episode was definitely after Mulder ans Scully sank and got stuck up on a rock.
One moment he's in leather jacket, wiping the blood of his face after a little bashing with some squatters.
What follows is an intriguing and humorous plot line as Tom takes on a piano coach (from Beijing no less) and tries to regain his affinity with the piano almost ten years after he'd stopped playing.
Alex's fiancÃ© Grant Coleman (Doug Savant) is a close friend of the president, after saving the life of his daughter Jessica, and he intends to propose Alex.
I can't wrap myself around the concept that Marlowe was even alive after a few days journey to town and back.
While Cooper's career spanned ninety-two feature films, in which he appeared as everything from a masked Cossack to an Italian Renaissance explorer, a foreign legionnaire, a baseball great and countless sophisticated romantic adventurers, he is best remembered as a Western star...  'Garden of Evil' tells the story of three American adventurers (Cooper, Widmark, and Mitchell) who are stranded in a Mexican fishing village after the ship that was taking them to California is put out of commission...   All three were headed for the Californian gold rush...
This was her second movie with Gary Cooper since her appearance in William A. Wellman's superb, high adventure 'Beau Geste,' and her third with director Hathaway...  Richard Widmark proceeds his ways of gambling with a neat line in cynical cracks; Cameron Mitchell fails in his unwelcome sexual advances; Hugh Marlowe uses a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with his angry feelings; Victor Manuel Mendoza gets intensely angry after being hit; and Rita Moreno delights the environment with her sweet voice...  Hathaway was one of the great Hollywood veterans still in harness, a versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as his other films... Filmed on location in Mexico, his 'Garden of Evil' is a beautiful spectacle to behold...
Okay, one of my favorites... Cary Grant and Irene Dunne lose a baby...then adopt a baby only to nearly lose her in a court battle...then SHE DIES...they nearly divorce...and then (finally) they get the blue-eyed blonde baby boy they'd initially requested from the adoption agency and (presumably) live happily ever after.
Eva Lee Kuney, who had no known acting roles after the late 1940's, was adorable as Tina and steals every scene she's in.
But after all, it is a highly recommendable movie for all lovers of everyday dramas.
When the couple's happiness seems doomed after losing their unborn child, adopting a little girl brings an abundance of sparks back.
Buchanan is Grant's good friend who comes to work as a pressman when Grant starts a small town newspaper after coming home from the Orient.
Then, they adopt a baby who makes it to about age six or seven and then dies after a quick illness.
Near the end, when the couple is ready to divorce because they couldn't handle this tragedy, another baby is offered to them, they accept and live happily ever after.
These reviews were given by Moviegoers after recent film festival screenings...they were posted on various web-sites...I hope they don't mind me posting them here.
Honestly I cried like a baby during and after this movie, just because I saw how painful it can be to live as a trans gendered teen.
If you look 'through' the movie and watch the story unfold (which is the intention - after all), you'll probably miss how much fore-thought has gone into splicing the scenes together.
Only after a tragic event does Matt finally realize that he has to look out for himself and not for others.
It can be embarrassing to find errors in your work after it has been published.
After every visual cliche, after every scene of buffoonery (almost innumerable) I told myself it would get better, that the scenes of space flight were coming.
And under such obvious direction: "Smile when the light goes across", "Look up after a second", "React with surprise" and so on, making the actors seem like puppets sometimes.
It is such a story that is told extraordinarily because of how it takes itself seriously as a historical document, but never so much so as to get in a great joke - the kind of natural joking that people do, such as the few quips done by Yeagher in the cockpit to whoever was listening after breaking the sound barrier, which actually happened - or some sliver of satire to the mix.
And that he's not doing any of it for fame or fortune (although in real life the real Yeager cashed in with TV ads and a best-selling autobiography after both the book and the movie were released!!).
And even after his plane crashes he walks out of the gulf of fire and smoke with a severely burned face as if he will be back; you can't keep him down.
the two have a catfight and Vince comes down to separate them and has to carry Trish over his shoulder while Stephanie chases after them.
Lazaro is a young boy, raised dolphins in the jungle, after his mother is raped and killed (before his very eyes), by wicked men!
However, for a short while after viewing the movie the fist time around, I did keep an eye out for large snakes hanging out in trees whenever I went hiking or cannoning.
Lazaro, after loosing his father--look out for big snakes--and later his mother, lives alone in the jungle for a short while.
The problem was when after finishing seeing the movie i went back and saw the first minutes, and then... oh boy did i cried.
Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival.
Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko.
So when we reach the end of the movie, with an image of them as spirits, sitting on a bench looking happy and healthy, with a modern day city around them, this is actually a happy ending after all the suffering they went through.
You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime.
They both go to their aunt's house to live, but after knowing that Setsuko and Seita are now orphans,their aunt changes her behavior and starts to be cruel and annoying with them.
I will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister.
Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital, where she dies shortly after.
Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out.
As another testament to the power of this movie, I decided to sponser a child through Compassion after watching it for the second time, 8 years later.
In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid.
I learned after the film that it was semi-autobiographical of the writer/director Carl Thibault.
I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to "decompress" after watching it.
Compare this with 'Private Ryan', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.
My mother watched one episode with me after I told her about it and now she can't wait for the new episode.
Right from the get go you know your in la la land when the rangers jump out of a Hercules transport at dawn somewhere over the mideast, but then after a water landing they surface in the dark!
Even the two I felt were the most ridiculous ideas (Fat Momma and Cell Phone Girl) have made me think twice about them after seeing them both in action.
And I know that I'll be the only one... but this is from my favorite Comic Book writer (Stan Lee) and is an interesting show to watch... even after the Premiere!
My audience applauded even after the lights were up.
These you'll likely ponder long after the film ends.
By concentrating on the fascination that all the characters in the movie had with these paintings, the movie thus, for me, extended itself beyond the requirements of who stole the goods and how they did it (the theme, after all, of many tedious heist movies) and became an extended meditation on what it means to possess and be possessed by an image.
Looked at this way, the movie grows in the imagination long after one or many viewings, and deepens very satisfyingly.
First, despite there being little to base such a strong attraction on, Kirsten sleeps with the man and pledges her life to him--even after she finds out he already has a mistress (who, left her own husband to be with him).
I wish I knew how many Norwegian were as disappointed as I after they paid money to see it.
; Edward Arnold's belated entrance, in my opinion, brings the film to life after a rather slow first half.
As for the mystery, well, after the tale told by Atwill about what occurred in the Blue Room all those years ago, one expects an explanation by the film's end but this aspect is never properly resolved (nor is the business about the stranger who breaks into the mansion): instead, we get a 'twist' ending which had actually occurred to me as I lay watching the film but had subsequently dismissed as being too obvious!
3 of them are bounty hunters; the wet blanket-esquire ex-cop Jet, the ultra slick former mafia assassin Spike, and the headstrong Fay, a young female anachronism revived from hibernation more than a century after her time.
This is what an anime fan could get after a month worth of prayers.
Faye Valentine, an amnesic, who was awakened from a cryogenic slumber, her past is a mystery but is slowly un raveled during the course of the series, she is also running from Debt collectors after being scammed upon being awakened from her cryogenic state.
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
I just caught it again on TV, after a long avoidance.
I was never a fan of that type of music but after watching the show I now owe a lot of records from the smooth jazz realm.
The film is called "The runner" as Amiro's running ability is underlined three times in the filmÂfirst he runs behind the train and wins a psychological race over his peers, then he runs after a cyclist who tries to avoid paying him for the cool water and catches up with him, and finally running with a block of ice that he has bought while others try to rob him of it, against a backdrop of oil fires.
I know after a night of going out on the town drinking, drugging and dancing there is nothing I enjoy more than kicking back and playing some Ouija with friends!
The real problem with this film was that it came out after a good genre like 'teen slasher' has been flogged to death.
I thought because it was released in the same year as two other very well regarded British horror movies , one featuring a squad of British soldiers as good guys fighting a bunch of werewolves and the other featuring a squad of British soldiers as bad guys battling against crypto zombies , that LONG TIME DEAD may have got lost in the market place but after finally seeing it I doubt if the merits of DOG SOLDIERS and 28 DAYS LATER had anything to do with its failure - The reason it bombed is that it's a rather poor horror movie  First of all can we please stop seeing movies where horny , drug taking teenagers get stalked and slashed .
After pressing play on the VHS, this rather confused and quite frankly stupid reason of thought was quickly diminished after the first ten minutes or so had passed by.
I wasn't expecting much from this after a majority of reviewers thought poorly of it, though I was pleasantly surprised.
Shortly after Annie dies in an accident & her body has burns on it, the remaining member's of the group feel something is wrong & do some research which leads to some unexpected answers & the discovery that maybe not everyone is as they appear or who they claim.
There is another scene in particular I keep thinking about that sums Long Time Dead & it's silly script up, when two people break into a police guarded house & turn the lights on only for the police officer on guard to be conveniently looking in the opposite direction & only looking back at the house literally seconds after the lights have been turned off.
The other bad part of the film is that we quite often see the characters running away from the evil demon which does get a bit annoying after a while.
The first scene leads you into thinking that it may be a good movie, but after that it rolls out all the old clichÃ©s.
You actually start feeling sorry for the bad guys after a while, which could have made for an interesting turn-around, but this movie unfortunately has nothing new to add.
I got into this film shortly after it had begun, surfing to the CW channel.
It was during a local programming period, and the local listing of the title was erroneous, so I was able to get to this site only after seeing the credits at the end.
Mostly as a filler for the time after the local news and the start of prime time.as a kid and as an adult i have always look forward to the old movies and this is one good flick for its time.I am trying to find this on DVD and would appreciate if some one who reads will help me find it although it will probably pretty tough.When Tris movie was on the TV i would always make an effort to see it.Although seemly laughable i still think it is a worthwhile investment for what is still a good scare.When the zombies come out to do battle with the police is still a shocker even by todays standards
Writer Siodmak specialized in "living brain" stories after the success of his superior "Donovan's Brain."
Launer pretty much steals the film from the rest of the cast, both before and after he is killed.
This must have been quite frightening on the big screen, particularly after being accustomed to the more distanced style of the first sixty minutes of the film.
I wish they had a fourth season or even more, and I could have seen, "Pranks for the Memories," if they hadn't canceled the good series after the end of season 3 because it was a very good series.
I missed good old Darkwing Duck after they removed the show from Toon Disney and replaced it with Jetix.
Twelve years later, after finding some taped episodes, I am still in love with this wonderful show and glad to see there are lots of devoted fans out and about.
Why can't we love and lust after our elder aunt?
"I'm sick of Symmetry" a character says in this film, and here we have one of the last works of Luis Bunuel's surrealistic fantasies that brings a story after another with a never ending that mocks the ignorance in which societies live in; It's just amazing how Bunuel exposures the conventionalism to which we are so accustomed and makes of any place a more decadent and irrational angle of the world.
Part of what is amusing about it is that I found myself laughing at myself after expecting something specific and finding that I was making assumptions based on my stereotypical thinking.
Another quite shocking scene that we encounter right after the nephew scene is the scene in which the nephew enters a couple's room.
We see the woman enter the restroom tidying up her exotic outfit, as her partner goes in right after her, releasing to the audience his bottomless trousers.
I find his surrealist films putting me in one curious situation after another, and I can only wonder what went through his mind each and every time.
What moved me the most was how, after basically watching movies since I was born, I realized just how programmed I was to the standard structure of film narrative that each transition by BuÃ±uel struck even more drastically than the last.
It would be unfair to describe all the scenes, you really have to see this picture and allow them all to soak into you, preferably after several viewings of the film.
Bunuel still lived nine more years after his "Phantom", Pasolini was killed shortly after the postproduction of "Salo".
Luis Bunuel's final film from an original screenplay (by him and collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere), The Phantom of Liberty, befuddled me so much more than the other Bunuel films I've seen that I had to turn it off after twenty minutes, thinking I'd get back to it at some point.
The strange thing is about this film, and I've come to realize it more after seeing Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie again recently (my favorite feature length film of his), is that there is such a line that is walked, like a tightrope walker holding an elephant in one hand and a thumbnail in the other, that one wonders whether this should be taken totally seriously or just with the general hysteria and (crucially) absurdism that laces much of Bunuel's work in his post Mexico period.
Scene after scene arguments are used as beautiful excuses to subvert reality and attack established and hypocritical institutions with acute humor and surrealist means.
The master of surrealistic cinema, Luis BuÃ±uel, changed his approach to the bourgeoisie after "Tristana", and his last three films are all comic and prevail through a mixture of pure surrealism, extreme irony and the one consistent theme of BuÃ±uel's auteurship- hatred of the ruling classes.
"Le FantÃ´me" is not funnier than "Le Charme", but it is harder to understand, and this is exactly what BuÃ±uel and CarriÃ¨re wanted after the success of "Le Charme" at the previous Academy Awards.
No one can replace Julia Stiles as Sarah Johnson--angry ballet dancer with the hot black guy chasing after her(ha-ha) The only reason I sat thru the whole movie was because Columbus Short was in it.
But after everything was said and done, the movie was just missing something that I can put my foot on.
Times changed and so did the attitudes and views of most americans, especially after WWII.
Why in the world would anyone want the guy after fooling around with Mazie.
Apparently, he was such a demanding boss that secretary after secretary from the school either quit or were fired and so Jean goes to give him a piece of her mind.
However the main problem with this film is not that the women's movement has moved on 70 years since the film was made - 1930's comedies are after all, remembered for the strong and independent heroines and Fred is of course made to regret and reconsider his words and actions.
Many of the latecomers, frustrated that all the good creeks had been claimed, established narrow claims on the beach, after it was discovered that the beach sands contained appreciable gold.
This earlier adaptation, however, stands as a prime example of the genre from the more innocent pre-war era; in fact, starting from the year after Â with William A. Wellman's THE OX-BOX INCIDENT (1943), to be exact Â the Western achieved sudden maturity that would lead to any number of masterworks in various veins (noir, psychological, elegiac, revisionist) till it died out towards the late 1970s.
Margaret Lindsay plays the new girl in town after Wayne's heart.
Also, after seeing Martha Sleeper's "vamp," I'd love to view more films of hers.
If You rent a snipes movie,you know what you get!You get action,and if thats what you're after, You've picked the right movie:) I'm not at all disappointed!
Pretty Madge Evans is the girl Novarro pines after for four years.
I was amazed seeing "Palace of the Parliament" the second large building after Pentagon, and other buildings.
The lack of script starts showing up after that first scene making the movie a pretty bad clichÃ©.
Then after it started, I walked off doing chores and taking care of things for the next day.
after seeing her on naff British TV, it was rather a shock to see her brandishing a pistol rather than a pint of larger or an iron)
The english dub is ok. As with the games,the thing you will be left with after seeing this is a Good,Chill feeling that you will want to experience again and again...
He ends up with more than he bargained for after his latest heist, a briefcase containing a $65 million Van Gogh painting that may or may not be real.
Every street or boulevard was in a different part of the city, even though the scene looked like the streets came one after another.
Now tons of gangsters are after him: dead or alive.
As for the guest stars, Peter Stormare, who has slowly blossomed into a film star after his role in "Fargo," is entertaining, as always.
I know it's not the exact line, but when, after completing the "I Shot an Arrow Into the Air" poem, Sara tells him to "Keep the Faith," I was almost hoping for her to call him Brooks - again see Shawshank.
Pretty Cool Movie Well after hearing Trina's albums and being a big fan of course I went out to rent her 1st movie, and hearing her talk about how its important to practice abstenance was the only way to stop the men from violence blew my mind.
The rest of the crew, well, they act like they've never acted before (and after this flick, probably never will again), the chairs and tables in this movie act better than the actors!
i was essentially sold on him after watching "Audition", which was an incredibly creepy piece of work to say the least, but alas, that's not what i'm writing about so on we go.
Or how the government don't do anything to stop this guy after he blew up the pentagon, jeez how dense are these guys?
That's right, "Sukiyaki Western Django" is both an adaptation and a prequel to the Spaghetti western, "Django", which came out two years after Sergio Leone's "A Fistfull of Dollars", both of which were adaptations of "Yojimbo", which was a samurai nod to westerns, but based on Dashiell Hammett's noir novel, "Red Harvest".
It is apparently set in something like the mid to late 1800s, after the Shogunate has begun to lose power, but before the Meiji emperor's government has gained dominance; a time in which Japan appears to be in decline, and has been humiliated by foreigners.
Sato Koichi (Cheerful Gang Turns The Earth, Tennen Kokekko) is pure evil as "Taira No Kiyomori" who fancies himself after Shakespeare's "Henry VI".
Sukiyaki Western Django, however, shows his true capability as a director and that he isn't just another run-of-the-mill carbon copy like I originally thought after viewing Audition.
Overall, I'm going to quote something I heard someone say after they viewed Sukiyaki Western Django: "Well, that was different, but I wouldn't call it entertaining."
The movie takes place after the series with Doug and his friends looking for the "Lucky Duck Lake monster".
The cast is a bland mix of no-names save for Jill Haworth, slumming it after working with the likes of Preminger, Marais and (on Broadway) Hal Prince.
When a singer hires him after she gets death threats, conflicts begin but feelings follow.
In the real world Costner's character would have told her to screw off after the first day and dumped her, but--in a plot "twist" you can see coming a mile away--they proceed to fall in love.
Here on IMDb I've seen some overrated movies,and in the other hand I've seen a lot of underrated movies - but after something like this I'm not sure I will pay to much attention on reviews on IMDb in the future.
In my opinion this is the movie for 8.5/10 grade,but after this incredibly stupid 5.3 I'll give it 10!
The Bodyguard is one of those films that was long in gestation, originally mooted in 1976 to star Steve McQueen {it was written with McQueen in mind in the 60s} and Diana Ross, it was put on the back burner after McQueen fell ill to the cancer that killed him.
Enter Kevin Costner and his boys at TIG Productions, original choice to star alongside Costner, Maddona, ruined her chance {thankfully} of starring after being a bitch to Costner in her Truth Or Dare documentary.
", after the ship is shaken up, Spock proceeds to literally and in full detail explain the physics of his fall - like some demented robot, and without a trace of sarcasm.
'That Which Survives' is a good, low-key, atmospheric third-season episode that has a melancholy air to it, especially in retrospect after you learn what happened to Losira and her people.
It's quite a different approach and frankly it becomes annoying after a while, though some of his lines are funny.
All in all, a hugely satisfying comedy series, that still looks good after 30+ years thanks to the amazing countryside scenery.
I just wish he would chase after Nora Batty now who left.
The problem is that right after that the body "wakes up", and a lot of other, less interesting plot-twists ensue.
So in the end I'd say that the film is pretty graceful - gracefully written, acted, shot, though out - from the beginning to "Billy, you got what you deserved", and after that it turns into something else, another type of movie which we could call "the-plot-twist-contest-kind-of-movie".
The music plays unnoticed in the action's background - no theme remains in your mind after the end credits, no lyrical moments have flashed your ears - but then again, you didn't come see the film for its music did you?
I have seen this film many times but each time i enjoy watching it, it's the best film I have ever seen, Antonio Banderas did his best , he's a Cuban man loving an American girl but there's a problem : She was such a lier girl and a thief as well .Simultaneously she was in love with another man so after a while she took all Banderas money and ran away, Banderas started to find her in order to kill her .He Employs a detective to do so but guess who the detective is : It's her lover missing her too and is searching for her.What would happen next?
In fact, I had avoided seeing it after it had screened, then after it was released on video... until my best friend and I decided to give it a whirl.
would a modest righteous monk agree to help a death row convict assuming serious consequences for himself, only after hearing her not-so-convincing story without any repentance?
With this movie, one feels disappointed - that everyone gets away after choking the audience to death for almost two hours.
And after making sure every radio listener heard, "The Music of My Heart," even the inconspicuously conspicuous Estefans forgot to drop the hint that they contributed to the film's lushly romantic score.
Bunuel made films in France, his native Spain, and in Mexico where he had to immigrate after Franco came to power in Spain.
My advice to all of you that are reading this review after reading all others is to watch the movie, because i loved it, Antonia and Vivek are going places and after this movie you'll know it  It's just plain beautiful, just them looking into each other's eyes is sexy, just the kind of feeling you need in a love story, follow Kisna as he goes in the paths of 'Dharma' and 'Karma'....Though if one thing has failed in this movie it was the late Amresh Puri, his last film was no big phenom acting wise, but Kisna is a film to remember, and hey i didn't even think about falling asleep during the 3 hours it was on, or the songs, it is unforgettable, if you got a girl......take her to see Kisna, i think she'll love you for it ;)!
Subhash Ghai makes a beautiful film after the disastrous Yaadein.
I have to agree that Luxmi didn't have much to do but dance and show off her pretty face, but after all if you look at the auditioning process, that's what she was hired to do.
I just want to save a long good period of frustration and anger which I went through after watching it, what a waste of a talented budding actor like Vivek Oberoi, I pity him really.
Now, after re-watching The Age of Innocence, I am sure that Scorsese has made one of the most beautiful, tragic, passionate, sensual, sexually charged screen romances ever, which is at the same time perfectly suitable for the whole family watching.
Michelle Pfifer is also good in her role, which Scorcese must have picked her for after a similar role in Dangerous Liasons (a far superior movie).
I saw this recently after seeing Terrance Davies lovely The House  Of Mirth, and was not disappointed.
then when they hit land, for some reason they dress up as hobo's while they're still carrying around M4's and Ak's, while trying to be under cover.This is soon followed by the Rangers wandering around the streets taking they're hobo-taskic costumes off, after they only had them on for about 3 minutes, you can't blame them, this film is such a steaming pile of crap I would've refused to dress like a jack-ass.
In a way I am disappointed after reading the comments because I thought I was alone in adoring this ravishing and masterful film, and I thought I would get to be the sole voice in the wind proudly proclaiming its brilliance.
Scorcese calls this his "most violent film", and after seeing it again, alone, watching intently, it struck me how completely right he was.
Even the normally atrocious Winona Ryder excelled in a role that was simply a tour-de-force for her...the vapid but yet not so vapid after all May Welland.
It's just one forehead-slapping, painfully stupid scene after another as the clownish, dim-witted cardboard cutouts substituting for actual humanoid characters push, pull, and drag the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion.
The family were so cheesy, "Love you mum" "Love you even more honey" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, "Love you mum" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home.
She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to look after her.
Could be great fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!
I did laugh though when one guy who was starting to "turn" tried munching on himself and a reverend also turning after being bitten, cut loose with a stream of profanity in the pulpit.
holy crap.i thought this was a great movie.it is a made for TV movie,but it is better than most TV movies,and even comparable to some theatrical releases.the premise is not new,family moves into a new community after a break-in at their old house, to start a new life.things seem great in the new community,but then things start happening.i won't say anymore except that there is a psycho stalking the family.and let me tell you,this psycho is really nuts.but what really elevates this movie is the acting.which i thought was fantastic.there's also lots of tension ans suspense to keep you unnerved.this is a very entertaining movie,deserving of a higher rating than it currently has.i've seen a few TV movies of the genre and this is one of the better 1's.my vote for 'Love Thy neighbour': 9/10
Gentle and kind, Umekichi takes in her lover Furusawa after his business goes bankrupt.
In the film, Umekichi is devoted to a bankrupt businessman, Shimbei Furusawa (Benkei Shiganoya) who comes to live with them after an argument with his wife.
But it could after all have actually happened, since Passaic, New Jersey isn't that far from the Bronx Zoo!
Bela Lugosi made a come back after a long period of unemployment and the use of drugs, and he was the only person with great acting abilities.
I'm not familiar with any of the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis comedies, but after seeing this film I'm not in a hurry to acquire any of them.
The plot has something to do with Mitchell and Petrillo ending up on a jungle island where they meet Lugosi (Half an hour in and after bad Petrillo mugging and a well sung but badly written song) who wants to do experiments on the pair.
I got my poor wife excited into watching a great, funny horror movie, "Better than Shaun of the Dead," which we loved, and after 45 minutes she got up and quietly walked away and left me to watch it alone.
Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo mercifully left the cinema after this horribly bad film which only left poor Bela Lugosi work for someone like Ed Wood.
This surprisingly intriguing horror film has people turning into bald,blue-skinned killers after dropping contaminated LSD ten years before.
Jerry Zipkin is on the run from the fuzz after one of his main-men freaks out and kills a couple of chicks at a swingin' party, and Zipkin is inadvertently thought to be the bad-guy.
I wish I could have "been there" myself at this point in time, and after seeing this film I was able to "live in their painting" for just a little while.
His life changes after that for better of course.
Pooja's best friend, Jhanvi (Preity Zinta) comes in from the US after hearing about her accident and she meets Raj.
It's hard to believe that just 4 years after this ridiculous film, Johnson and Taylor costarred in the memorable "The Last Time I Saw Paris."
I don;'t remember seeing many Undergrad gowns (compulsory after dark) - maybe I missed them, or possibly they thought it would confuse American viewers..
The writing was sharp and they had a great cast but, after the initial controversy, this show quickly died.
It used to come on in my area just after the 11:00 news.
Back in Oklahoma, I would watch this show after Mary Hartman, then go to summer school the next day and laugh about it with my mates.
It ran as an independent show, after Mary Hartman Mary Hartman in many markets, which put it on between 11:30 and midnight in Vermont where I saw it.
The first word I thought about after watching this was "ugh."
Whoever this Doug was, he mustn't have been such a dummy after all.
Hey, I noticed everyone spotted the spoof of Knight Rider, but did anyone pick up on this - the plot line about getting super powers from the sun after coming close to it in space is lifted straight from another doomed pilot show 'Northstar' - in which a NASA astronaut got hit in the face by a solar flare and then got super powers every time he looked at the sun!
So, Ben Stiller, I might have faith in you after all.
Always out to get what he's after Kroll turned his sights on German actress Marta Molnar and, despite her wanting to have nothing to do with him, finally ended up getting her to fall in love with him.
***SPOILERS*** It was after the stock market crash of 1929 that Kroll's unbroken string of luck suddenly ran out.
P,S The movie was based on the real Match King Ivar Kreuger who, after getting wiped out in the crash of 1929, blew his brains out in his Paris Hotel on March 12, 1932.
Even with all the technical mastery available now to Hollywood filmmakers now, no studio can come close to the greatness of The Match King, made only two years after Warner Bros. scrapped its Vitaphone sound discs to switch to sound on film cameras.
Looking back now, it seems incredible that the Warner Bros. dream factory could make one high quality movie after another in 1932, usually with a 3 week production schedule (6 day work weeks with no overtime pay) on a budget of around $150,000.
The film closely follows the life of the crooked Swedish safety-match tycoon Ivar Kreugar, right up to his suicide, after being caught trying to sell forged Italian government bonds.
However, after working with the florist for four years, he still can't get a raise.
However, 38 years after the original, interracial relationships aren't uncommon enough to be a daring subject for the screen.
Until at the end despite being a liar, upsetting his dad and telling a racist joke his noble side shine's through (after having a major argument with his girlfriend) just like meet the parents they make up and get married.
Jen no longer trusted any man after her husband left her 16 years ago.
I sat in the theater for a while after the credits rolled and then remained in a quiet space for some time in the car.
It tells the story of Freddy (Freddy Flores), a Bolivian with a gentle disposition, who, after Americans burn down the coca fields where he is employed, loses his job.
Anyone who doesn't think that 'The Five Doctors' doesn't have a plot, may reconsider after reading this.
Sure, it's better than the 10th anniversary story "The Three Doctors," but it's definitely not as good as the latter story, "The Two Doctors," made a few years after this, and which I recommend wholeheartedly.
As the directorial debut from Limp Bizkit's outspoken and often loathed frontman, Fred Durst, it's safe to say that the bar was set very low for "The Education of Charlie Banks" -- too low, as a matter of fact, as Durst's film (drawn from a screenplay by Peter Elkoff) is a surprisingly rich experience that unfortunately sat on the shelf for too long after being made and which got virtually ignored by critics and mainstream audiences alike.
Anyway, it's a good, tight little B-film, with the novel idea (for its time) that movies and TV might get along, after all.
Having just watched this on TCM and after reading the previous reviews for this film all I can say is that although there may be limited moments of great suspense which does not take anything away from the film.The plot- insane man escapes from a mental institution and holds five people hostage in a bar.
Strangely, in this role we do not really expect him to pick up a wine bottle and drink it all in one go, or wipe his lips after having had some snails.
Time after time, the clothes come off, the girls are making out, you see a little fur-burger here, a little whisker-biscuit there(just frontal, no open clam), and just when it looks like the chicks are going to get down to some serious munching, it just cuts to some worthless clip of them cuddling after they had "made love", whatever the hell that is.
But after a few more times it becomes clear that director Jaeckin and screen writer Richard really tried to follow the book, and the characters and their actions seemed plausible and natural.
Although not quite as good as it's sequel, "Emmanuelle: Joys of A Woman," this film made Dutch actress/model Sylvia Kristel an international star, and changed the way sex was presented in mainstream film forever after.
It stays in the mind long after seeing it and Kristel looks comfortable with or without her clothes.
This is particularly apparent in the second half of this film when the heroine, after being jilted by one of her lesbian lovers (the oddly named Bee), takes up with the elderly Mario, a man who, despite his grey hair and advancing years, fancies himself both as a lover and as a thinker.
However, I feel like I was being thrown against a wall with one morally disgusting scene after another.
Isabelle Huppert's performance was not her best, a lot of long pauses and dramatic painful-staring-off-into-the-world stares that just got annoying after awhile.
It is filled with difficult scenes and ideas and certainly is not a film for the faint of heart or spirit, but at the same time it is a brave film depicting the dissociative state of sexual mind to which we've come after the influences of such thinkers as Bataille, Foucault, Derida, Gide, and others.
He is truly a good actor, and luckily he is playing different roles after Veer-Zaara (but Veer-Zaara and Main Hoon Na were kind of different).
I realize that I am late to watching this movie and that I watched and edited version on AMC but after just listening to the entire book on CD I want to know that the heck happened!?
I just finished watching this after I just finished hearing about it.
J.Carrol Naish(Police Informer) ran after Fonda throughout the entire picture.
Henry Fonda plays a priest on the run from the government after brainwashing people into believing god exists, in fact he actually believe he is right.
Sidarth finds out and after a while Sidarth makes Rahul decide, being boss of the agency or Seema.
Just watch it and see super-animated scene after scene.
In this sense it is after all a wonderful tribute to Graham Greene's novel.
They're all about the action after all.
Of course after the trailer and poster my expectations were getting lower and lower.
A Lot of Dumbheads try to say look like ...... look like these idiot always love to look like something now mario kart idiot Mario kart bla bla was made after Twisted metal and Vigilante 8 these are basic car combat games like snes Rock and Roll racing D: relearn them then try to say look like ......  And I m the fan of vigilante , twisted metal and Rock'n roll racing But death Race is a TV Show before all we said made it SO STFU DUmbheads Ä°t's a awesome action game not like the others but You all IMDb's idiot knew everything better then others so U gave 6.4 or ~ like it Please don't watch movie may be you could read book your IQ will be upgraded SO go relearn all things go to the kindergarten
So, after a year of being perpetually disappointed in Hollywood blockbusters and franchise revivals (oh, Indy, how could you?
His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy (Janaya Stephens) and having a baby girl.
She has created the country's most popular pay-per-view sport, a kill-or-be-killed car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins.
I wanted to leave after the first 5 minutes as it was, and after that it was like sitting through one of those bad documentaries at school for the other 2 hours.
That is made true when he gets into a fight with some tough guys there, and after that spat, he is sent to Hennessey's (Joan Allen, The Bourne Supremacy) office, where he is told that he has one chance to get out: DEATH RACE, a game in which you win 5 races to get out of prison for your own life.
The title is "Death Race" after all.
Along the way prisons have been handed over to the private sector that have chosen to make a profit by broadcasting gladiatorial style death matches starring the inmates, with the reward to the inmates after 5 victories Â FREEDOM Enter Jensen Ames (Jason Stratham) a recently unemployed steel worker and former race car driver who lost his license but no matter how bad things are, he's a happy man as long as he has his family.
William IV was forced to call back Earl Grey and bow to the wishes of the people's representatives, now even more representative since the Reform Act of 1832 reapportioned Parliament after several hundred years.
Based on a one-man stage play by Mr. Lepage, it is both a history of man's exploration of the surface of the moon and the inner exploration of two individuals who are trying to put their life in order after the death of their mother (Anne-Marie Cadieux).
I read a lot of positive press about this Canadian-shot film, first when it was being made (in Vancouver) and soon after its release.
They should not have associated themselves with the Los Angeles Police Department, as the movie is an insult to any law enforcement agency.It took me ages to appreciate these actors after that.
Only one friend remains standing at the end of this film and his remark to himself is that HE TOO WILL START OVER because after all there is always hope.
For example: after spending a night in Jail the young men of youth are released, bounding with energy and full of Hope deciding to pool their monies to buy a truck.
I doubt many youth would find that to be the case, Nevertheless this is where the story begins...EVENTUALLY each youth is lost---victims of crime, circumstance or missed opportunity after each of which Mr. Fukusaku would have us believe that underneath disappointment lies opportunity.
I felt connected to Victoria and Albert somehow after I finished watching the movie.
I named her Lyric after the role of Jada Pinkett.
Pinkett, who gave a bravura performance (along with Queen Latifah) in the earlier "Set It Off," is no less than brilliant as "Lyric," sought after by the hard-working "Jason," played by another neglected thespian, Alan Payne.
The disturbing part for me though was Forest Whittaker's performance as the father who go's berserk after the Vietnam War, losing all sense of morality for himself and his family.
If you can find this movie (after all, I saw it on Showtime and haven't the video in any stores) totally see it!!!
That's all good once in awhile but it gets old after about the fifth time.
I rate it a solid 7/10 after all was considered, as it managed to give me a feeling of euphoria after my viewing....something which rarely happens.
In going after the truth it can only lead to one thing...
I had missed this film during the many years since it was made, and caught it by chance on a Friday afternoon, after a particularly long and hectic week.
Even though she doesn't always believes in his innocence, she still goes after the real killer.
He said the second day after the fall of the Taliban, they reopened a theater... and the people saw a Hindi movie, with dance and singing... and everyone in the theater danced and sang for the pleasure of it.
The only optimistic thing you can say about the film is that the girl playing the leading part (who was a beggar) could buy a simple house for her and her family after having played in the film.
That it was made only a year after the Taliban were ousted gives it an authentic documentary feel, but it would still be as effective if the events were years earlier.
Osama is the first movie made after the fall of the Taliban last year.
This film has gained a lot of notoriety for being the first movie made in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
it was hardly "beautiful" as the women were subjugated to being summarily rounded up, imprisoned on a the slightest whim and then beaten, raped, buried alive, or as this one woman...stoned to death by a gleeful mob after being wrongfully accused of uttering obscenities.
"Hope"...Osama, the girl forced to be transformed into a role as boy so that she can go unescorted to work in order to bring home a watermelon and a few scraps of meet for the family, is just so filled with this "hope" as she "embarks on a terrifying and confusing journey" to avoid detection from the taliban (this is not the journey you or i may take after paying five to tens of thousands of dollars to some guru to become enlightened)...NOT!!!
she is taunted, teased, hung from a rope suspended over a seemingly bottomless well (hysterically crying for her mother), after which she is jailed.
The atrocities of the Taliban and other extremist Islamic fundamentalists must be revealed to the resistant and skeptical west and "Osama", the first film to come out of Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, does just that.
For a debut feature, w-d Siddiq Barmak delivered a quietly poignant film - it may not be evident at first impression right after seeing the film with the sadness and injustice it burdensomely carries.
In a time when the world is so focused on the conflict unfolding in Iraq, the thing that is most clear to me after watching this movie is the old saying that after thousands of years of wars fought in the name of religion, we are not a second closer to peace than we ever were.
I bet that after the movie, you will go and kiss your young daughter.
And it's all because the various Powers (Eleni's soliloquy of "guards" in different colored uniforms) didn't allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, i.e., the Movement, the Cause).
The film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another, with no involving narrative thread and no humanity.
As they grow up, their lives take one fateful twist after another, beginning when a teen-aged Eleni gives birth to twin boys.
Theodoros Angelopoulos presents 30 years of Greek history beginning with the return of the exiles from Odessa after WWI to the rise of the Colonels.
They managed to get them back after the village flooded.
Alexis heads to America, while Eleni loses the children again after she is imprisoned.
The music of Eleni Karaindrou is very beautiful, and will resonate long after the film has finished.
Orphan Eleni was looked after by Alexis' family.
I found this movie extremely disappointing; having been referred to it after IMMENSELY enjoying Noah Baumbach's "Kicking and Screaming" and, to a lesser extent, "Mr.
It's one pseudo-intellectual diatribe after another with no hint of a natural segue.
It's bizarre how Clements and Farina vanished from the movie scene right after making their accomplished twin debuts.
In particular, the focus here is on a group of privileged Eastern Seaboard collegians enjoying the Christmas holidays in a series of Park Avenue, "after dance parties," in which they loll about and ruefully anticipate the disappearance of their youth, their success, and their kind.
Since the film's short, bouffant,cocktail dresses and automobiles unmistakably place the film in very late modernity--the Reagan era in fact, and long after the Ray Anthony's Orchestra, top hatted milieu it depicts, we cannot fail to miss the film's core observation--the parallel evanescence of the groups' own social connections, as placed against the simultaneous collapse of civilized life as we once knew it.
They fall in love, ultimately, through their conversations, which is, after all, how we all fall in love.
Charlie philosophizes about the decline and fall of the UHB and pines for ideals that fell out of fashion after World War I; Nick despises titled aristocracy, believing them to be the scum of the earth; and Rick, a baron, is incredibly slimy, giving credence to Nick's assertion.
The major flaw of this production is its finale which is quite frustrating and out of tone, especially after Beatrice Lillie probed to be a delightful personality and you cared about her.
Tony, being an idiot, suggests that they hold a sÃ©ance with a Ouija board he just happens to have, after some goading everyone agrees & the sÃ©ance begins.
The story follows Michael and his friends, who after Michael's birthday party decide to play with the ouija board.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
A group of brainless friends summon a demon (named Virgil...not exactly a petrifying name, if you ask me) and this demon soon after possesses one of the kids.
Way back then I remembered that after presenting a code to solve, the head man stepped down and walked down the aisle asking "When do we go home?"
However after having seen this highly artistic film,I am ready to say that it is one of the most original films made in recent times.I find it difficult to swallow the comparison made with US film "Taxi Driver".
I spotted a few errors but in researching more about her after the film was over, I found that most of the film was fiction.
I was tempted to give it a 10, after all, it was made in 1935 and is still good....
(Kyser married the lead singer after this show and she quit her singing career.)
I think he is one of very talented young actors, but after Titanic had no chance to prove it.
Earlier i saw the movie, only after that i have red the book.
But like all movie stars after one big film hit they get a funky haircut, put some glasses on and go shopping for clothes in the second hand store.
One of the film's most chilling incidents comes after Christo, one of the group, is seriously injured after being attack by a shark.
You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical disease   THE BEACH is very similar in many ways .
It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisation   Take one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart .
Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is the most riveting hereÂ after the heroic artist he played in Titanic (1997), it's surprising to witness his portrait of this pot-smoking brat.
After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.
The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings.
Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters.
Recently a friend of mine watched "The Beach" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e.
But as a watched it one week after the other I began to dislike more and more.
This is not, after all, Robert Ludlum or Ken Follett.
Why then did they do many almost criminally bad mistakes, one after another, the last ten or so episodes?
With the main characters being awake all night, fighting, hacking networks, and other stuff that they do, none seemed to even remotely tired after doing that for 10, 14, 17, even 20 hours.
It will be difficult to stop watching season 4 after what you see, but there are things in season 4 that you will not get the full significance of if you do not go back to the beginning.
Nearly every time he would say "one more", we would watch 4 more hours because the cliffhangers were so good, he couldn't stop after any given hour.
I would say to myself "after this hour, I gotta go study" at 1 a.m. 5 episodes later, I would still be saying, "Ok ONE MORE hour, and THEN I will study".
I was hooked after a couple of episodes in Season 1.
Originally I was simply amazed by the constant cliffhangers that are drawn up week after week by the amazing writing crew.
Jamie when interrogated by Nina and Tony), and Jack's wife after calling the CTU about Alan.
However, it is strange that Robert Cochran produced such a bad thing after being very good at "The Commish".
i would say that I've watched only the past 3 series and series after series its the same storyline middle eastern fundamentalist getting hold of a nuclear bomb and jack having to defuse it .
I suppose the intent is just to keep you watching week after week with the anticipation that the story will be tied up in 24 episodes - Which should not come as a surprise as THIS IS JUST A TV SHOW.
It's even more fantastic, if you not watch it as it's aired, but record some episodes and then watch them in in a pattern of 2 per evening for some days after another.
Kiefer Sutherland leads a cast of exceptionally impressive and compelling actors/actresses that make the show great week after week.
The only thing that intrigued me was the real time gimmick, but after a few episodes you realize that the show could just as easily not be in real time for all the difference it makes.
The real time gimmick is the only thing that differentiates this from any number of soap operatic TV dramas, and even that doesn't hold up after a matter of episodes.
I could go on forever, even the characters who die after two episodes are very convincing.
Overall one of the things you can't stop watching after you've seen five minutes of it.
I want facts," he says to his butler/servant Levinsky (Robert Croggio), and after so much time hearing his company's accounts and finances- a very empty task for a codger like Clay to hear- he decides on something that might get the juices going in his head, to make real a story that's been told many many times, about the sailor getting paid by some rich man to sleep with his wife.
Now some of you don't 'get-it'--2,000,000 wasted Phillipinoes, before and after they helped stop the Japanese invaders?
3,000,000 Indo-Chinese, after violating The Geneva Convention's lawful ruling--Nixon destabilizing Cambodia, leading to Pol Pot's 'killing-fields?
Sensory overload is what came to my mind after watching Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers'.
Tom Sizemore was very good as Detective Jack Scagnetti, the crazy Detective who chases after the Knox's.Rodney Dangerfield really helped steal the show as Ed Wilson, Mallory's drunken abusive father.
How true... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap !
one has to admit that she is unlike any other to come before, or will probably come after.
The reason I bring this up again, after so many years, and so many more violent films later, is because Entertainment Weekly has published a list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies of All Time and Natural Born Killers is ranked as #8.
The story told on "American Maniacs" about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in an attempt to try to silence the couple's growing fan base.
But after I figured out it was all part of the movie, I became convinced that NBK is in fact, a masterpiece.
Stone's film-making has gone somewhat awry over the years (look at the pointless excess of his films after this), but this fits the bill because it IS a story of excess.
This is troubling, because while the film works hard to analyze the dubious process by which violent killers are turned into romantic heroes in the mass media, NBK seems unable to escape from the same orbit, ending with the killers as living happily ever after, justified by the brutality of their backgrounds, and morally superior to the prison officials and popular journalists who pursue them.
The 90's - A decade after the Reagan years and a time for the next generation to settle down and basque in the trails of excess that the previous decade left behind.
But after she finds some unknown secrets on the building's history, its evil history comes to hideous light.
So I watched it again, just in case it was merely a case of me having a bad day the first time I watched it, or perhaps the film all came together after I had quit watching it.
So now, after watching it all the way through, my final conclusion is that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
Example#2 Right after the part I just described in Example #1 when the train takes off, it keeps proceeding forward.
an emotional roller-coaster which leaves you staring at the credits in la la land long after you should have gotten up and fetched that other beer.....i find it strange that the most compelling story i have witnessed on film is not readily available on DVD..in NTSC format at least and also that adrenaline pumping ...Tyral Hicks scene.. which brings these riveting stories to their anti climax..or climax if you may..is hidden away in fine print in the cast listing by billing......is there anyone who can help me source the DVD in NTSC format.
In the first scene of the film, the bespectacled hero, a pallid imitation of Miller, picks up a girl in a cafÃ© and, after sex, gives her all his money, can't get any more credit at the restaurants, and is forced to raid his own garbage pail for leftover nuggets.
That's how a viewer feels after watching this.
Certainly off to an interesting start, the film immediately gets one to think though that there is a promise of more like the hardcore footage shown right after the strange credit sequence.
Here are some of the perplexing things for me:  --Joey complains that Nys could have left him a few francs after he first met her and gave her his money, but Joey actually INSISTED she take all of it to begin with.
--The women are portrayed as a bit mentally off, except for Colette's mother (upon which Carl then just says how hot she was, which seemed like belittling her after she was kind to them).
If we're supposed to appreciate Joey and Carl's "bohemian lifestyle," it doesn't help that they just waste food and drink after always saying they never have it.
--Hoping there would be a resolve to the story, instead after a naked woman can't have sex with them because she was crying over the memory of her late husband, the others just sit there naked and laugh while the camera zooms in on their genitals.
I don't regret seeing this film after wondering for so many years what it was all about, and discovering more curiosities from that era.
The movie is named after the bird Sankofa.
this movie is just some scene taped together with no story line (at least i could find it) the leading male with a monologue that made no sense how you looked at it the comedy in the movie was one clichÃ© after another stuff we seen over a million times like white guy teaching black history(SEEN IT IN 'HOW HIGH')not funny and what is with the badly dubbed music scenes this a perfect example of go home and do it over also why is the leading male living in a crack house if hes loaded its a low budget movie there's no lieing in that but that doesn't mean that the movie it selve needs to be crap everything is cheap in this move including the script
Laura San Giacomo was in Steven Soderbergh's 1989 `sex, lies and videotape' with James Spader, Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher, and in writer-director Simon Moore's 1992 `Under Suspicion' with Liam Neeson (a very good who dunnit with twists after twists and.
It can't really be helped that there be a certain amount of hype around Anderson's name, after all, his films "Rushmore" and "The Royal Tenenbaums" both generated vast critical acclaim and three of this young director's four films have already received the Criterion DVD treatment.
It was, after all, less than one hundred years ago that American women finally got that basic human right, suffrage, and, after a viewing, no female will ever take this matter nonchalantly again.
I'm ashamed to say that the first time I rented it I popped it out of the player after only a couple of minutes.
I remember this movie serial as a boy in the thirties,we would ask our mother's for a penny on a Wednesday after school,and line up at the local movie house along with hundreds of kids..mostly boys,it always promised fast action,the Mystery Squadron who had their hideout in a mountain cave,the Black Ace the leader always seemed as though he would never would be revealed,would provide the bad deeds,as the action heated up thousands of young feet would stomp on the balcony floor,it was a wonder that it never collapsed.it would build to a crescendo,THEN it would stop suddenly,everyone would hold their breath as the hero would be put in seemingly inescapable peril,NEXT WEEK...see the next thrilling chapter,we would pile outside still gripped in the spell and discus with actions what had taken place,we would then speculate as to how he was going to get out of this latest fix,Bob Steele,Tom Mix,Hoot Gibson,Buck Jones,Ken Maynard,our heroes,who never kissed a girl,in our games no one wanted to play the Black Ace.Happy innocent days.
The narrative features an interesting narrative hook (a man can't remember who he is and now thugs are after him for something he hid... and he doesn't know where it is, let alone *what* it is).
I really hope that Shadow ends up getting his own video game series after this.
However after seeing a rolling demo of the original Sonic on the Megadrive (aka Genesis)in Woolworths, I saw something special and pestered my parents into getting me THAT game.
Two teenage girls (Trini Alvarado and Robin Johnson, both likable), who are patients in a New York City hospital, escape their confines and move into an abandoned warehouse; after attracting media coverage via a prominent disc-jockey, the kids become cult celebrities.
I first saw this movie on late night television in the fall of 1986 on an independent channel which had a policy of showing a movie after midnight would guarantee that nothing would be censored such as adult language or nudity.
Being old enough to have grown up with Jacques Cousteau, I felt Anderson really captured the look and feel he was after with the the "movie within the movie" sequences and the yellow typographical stuff was spot-on.
Even after the first 10 minutes I found myself laughing at the apparently serious film.
Moyle now wishes he had not left the production after a dispute over including additional songs (so they could have a double album) because his continued presence would at least have had some damage control value.
The audio of these screams is extended into the morning after establishing shot of their dock building.
If silly "B" fun, coupled with oodles of nekkid cuties, is what yer after, then the MooCow is here to tell ya this is yer twisted cup of java.
Now the fact that Power didn't do so well with impersonating a Russian wasn't a problem--after all, he wasn't supposed to be perfect and she was supposed to eventually figure out that he was a phony.
Now we could assume that either Miss Young's character is schizophrenic or suffered a massive brain injury, but when her aunt agrees with her and they work hard to get Power (even after he's robbed them), this strains common sense way beyond the breaking point.
She barely knew the guy and most of what she knew about him was terrible---yet she insisted on marrying him and having everyone live happily ever after.
The Bad Girl gets better at Latin, the Fat Girl takes off her glasses after becoming evil, the Good Girl becomes less mischievious, and the Black Girl... Well, the Black Girl is really a third wheel.
He is a construction worker who establishes that he is good early in the movie by saying to his fellow construction workers, "Okay guys, show's over," and turning down the music on their boom box after they all watched The Bad Girl strip for them by her window for a few minutes.
Steven Spielberg seems to be a docile creature who is charitable enough to act as their guardian during the trek, but as the members of the squadron of mermaids begin to disappear one by one, they realize Steven Spielberg has ulterior motives after they spot a mermaid scale stuck between two of Steven Spielberg's teeth.
You'll be hooked after the first 15 minutes.
People treat him differently after the incident and take interest in his life, as he gets invited to parties and the opportunity to share his ideas with the company.
Bound to continue to work on the mind, and possibly the psyche, days after viewing.
Similarities seem to end fairly early in the picture after Bob first becomes a hero and a media darling.
Bob visits Vanessa in the hospital and after the initial rejection, she asks him to help her to commit suicide.
"He Was a Quiet Man" is an impressively dark and morbid character study of a paranoid man after years of humiliation and loneliness.
This modest, non-color film by Robert Glinski is one of the most important achievements of Polish cinema after the year 1989.
But the climax comes only after dad's belated arrival to join the family.
Nikki, who thinks the old woman is off her rocker, accepts the role anyway and after that strange things begin to happen to her and the lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur.
We can also question the connections since David Lynch said he got a lot of the ideas separately and serendipitously and only after it had begun did he understand why his brain was giving him these ideas.
He is not a common filmmaker and I certainly do not believe he would just do things meaninglessly for the sake of being weird though many are quick to believe such a thing -- after all, attention spans and mental growth potential have been left in the womb by many a film-goer.
Perhaps there is some way out still, into Sweetness, to The Palace, to Pomona (a city named after the Roman goddess of abundance).
If anything, after we go to the little dream world that takes over the entire last 2 hours of the film, anything we have learned or liked about her are quickly killed as the film tends to focus on her as an abused, sadistic, and bitter woman.
The interpretation offered below is not even an opinion -it is simply a facile, creative construct I use heuristically for talking about the film after my first viewing.
Though after watching this Frenchified supposedly American film it looks like Biggie did us all a great favour.
Justin Theroux did a Q & A after my screening of Inland Empire and he described working with lynch as light hearted and fun.
If you aren't in on the joke then I cannot imagine you leaving the theater happy after three hours of pure, free from concentrate, unpasteurized lynch.
I was skeptical going into this movie after what I had read, thinking Lynch had gone off the deep end.
As the end titles role I'm always left with a feeling akin to the after glow of good whiskey seeping through my heart.
Young script writer Benjy Stone is asked to look after fading ,alchoholic ,swashbuckling film star Allan Swann who is appearing on the comedy show that Benjy writes for.
In the course of that week Stone somewhat accidentally teaches Swann that what he's missing the most is a solid family relationship, and Swann teaches Stone how to be more confident and go after the things that he wants at all costs.
It gets shown on TCM once and a while (good on them), this is where I had re-stumbled upon it after many, many years.
Was it the swash buckling washed out Alan Swann (played by Peter O"Toole) as he moved from one situation after another?
Even today, years after most of the shows have vanished (except for those on kines-cope) they remain legendary.
What a shock we never saw much else from him after this tour de force.
And i know i will still love it after 10 or 20 years.
I thought it was the best series around i live about 3quarters of an our away i use to go with mum after School every 2nd Wednesday and meet quite a lot even the 2 old cogers :) one who lived in Minyip nice chap :) herb Krause very nice to have a chat with the old Emma Garage is now a Internet Cafe , the 2 milk bars have now closed down.
Juice is definitely a favorite of mine and it seems like it never ages after 15 years.
It's basically a morality tale in which good defeats bad and everyone lives happily ever after.
like when the Peter predecessor asked the Brian Predecessor, if he was OK after thrown into the wall, he brought tragedy which i do not know how to spell or even get a hold of how to spell it.
Set on a small island off the Californian coast, Aquanoids stars Laura Nativo as Vanessa, a beautiful diver who, after being attacked by a hideous fish-man, attempts to warn the locals of the danger that lurks in the surrounding waters.
I just saw Mind Game on YouTube after AMID in Cartoon Brew recommended it and I've gotta tell you: You have not and most likely will never see anything like it again!
the comedy was good at the start but it dragged after that.
the villain is played by kamaal khan by the name of romeo who is an international hit-man who kills a priest after doing an act of terrorism(i thought the character was supposed to be smart).romeo comes to apna Punjab on a mission and when nihaal singh tries to arrest him(for not having a revolver license) he fools him and escapes crossing the border effortlessly(wow!!
The opening half hour which shows nihal-deol in Panjab was funny, well shot and well acted but after that it was just too much to bear.
Where Q, after failing to save Bishop from falling to his death is told, he's got all the juice now, he just shakes his head and it shows a flashback from when Bishop was his friend, we wanna know if Q and Steel get away with robbing the liquor store!
Have you ever watched one of those movies where, after about 30 minutes, you realize that you really, really wish that the capable actors in it were in something a bit better written?
But from watching the film once, there are some clues in there, such as the speech he gives after watching the film White Heat.
This is unfortunate considering it follows relatively soon after the slow jukebox tableau, the camera tapering around the pub for the whole duration of a Wreckless Eric song on the jukebox.
"Death By Dialogue" is your typical low budget direct to video crap that is produced after someone's fame.
The movie is supposedly about a group of teen agers who are all pushing 26 or so that find themselves trapped in a web of terror & murder patterned after a movie script found in the basement of a house next to a studio.
Stage Fright is basically a "whodunit" because you, the viewer, will think you know who the culprit is in this for a while and then realize that maybe you don't, after all.
The second, a return to his standard narrative form after two noticeably experimental pictures, was an adaptation of the story "Man Running" by Selwyn Jepson.
She wants her widow's weeds cut lower in the front and plans on attending a garden party right after her husband's funeral.
Alfred Hitchcock made this highly enjoyable and under-rated divertissment in 1950 after a run of glum movies in the second half of the forties but before embarking on his richest period in the fifties.
I don't know why some people feel tricked after watching the movie, seeing and believing are two different things, especially in an Alfred Hitchcock movie!
you follow the story with the shinigami Tsuzuki Asato and Kurosaki Hisoka as they meet and slowly get a strong emotional band after a rough start there dark pasts and there enemy Muraki connect the two to work together to stop the evil maniac.
For example he uses refreshingly little dialogue for a german film and he even lets it go on for a few more minutes after the last words have  been said, telling the end just with images.
I finally had the opportunity to see it after many years, since I saw it included in a list of best films, in James Monaco's book "American Film Now".
The absurdity of situations seemed to come back to me days after having watched it.
Like Dreyer, Bergman and Lang after him, he takes essentially theatrical material to create pure cinema.
This movie makes you laugh when Chris (Will Smith) is having one of his worse days ever, chasing a gypsy in the middle of the road, getting hit by a car, running after a crazy guy, running from a cabbie without paying him and finally, finally when he has the greatest day of his life it makes you cry.
And as for the problems Will's character faces along the way: 1) They started to get a little ridiculous after awhile.
Some say Pac's problems started after he made this film...That he was living out the character...
See if you can look in the mirror after watching this film.
The best part was after the movie, my friends and I all got up and realized that this movie had actually made the four of us tear up!
I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings.
This is an honest, meaningful film that will stay with you long after you leave the theatre.
I hope a few of us will let our motivations own us for years instead of hours after the movie's over.
The rest of the time we, like Chris, are chasing after it.
Well I guess it did get better, after all it couldn't get much worse, but even better was pitiful.
The characters are bland, with very little dialogue, in fact, there is really only an escalation of dialogue after the 40minute mark, till then it is pretty much people running, but don't worry after the 40min mark, people still run for the majority of the film.
after the first five minutes i considered throwing it into the fire and paying the fine just so nobody else would ever have to go through what i just did.
The "surprise" at the end isn't terribly original Â though it pays to remember that this film was shot in 2001 and spent three-and-a-half years in troublesome post-production before being released, so it's kind of coming in after its time.
Terry Dean is an exceptional career criminal, after his release from prison he is hit by a car saving a young boy.
Linda Kozlowski again teams up with Hogan {after the earlier Crocodile Dundee pairing}, here she has very little to do but she slots in very nicely, even if a pre-end credits sequence does her and everyone else no favours at all.
I especially love the scene where the police are interviewing the bank tellers after the robbery.
And after you have seen it, I think you will agree it is worthy of a sequel.
He became a pacifist after making All Quiet.
With that said i would also like to say that i love Tombstone, and bought it right after i saw it the first time.
Tombstone is about, just that, Tombstone and what the Earps did there and immediatly after.
Months after the film Tombstone was released came this film, but it instead shows the full life journey of one of history's greatest lawmen, from Razzie nominated director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill).
Then grown up, he marries sweetheart Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), who soon after died from typhus, while pregnant, and Wyatt burned their house and all possessions inside, turning to a life of crime to survive, forcing him to run away from Missouri to Dodge City.
He was around for quite some time before and after that famous gunfight at the OK Corrall.
And his life kept right on trucking after that.
"Wyat Earp" had the misfortune to be released not long after the classic "Tombstone," which told the same story.
Even the music grows on you after several viewings.
Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorfulÂ Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each otherÂ  In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gamblerÂ Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignityÂ Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealistÂ Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosisÂ  In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchiefÂ He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best momentsÂ His character has his own form of abilityÂ Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosisÂ Kilmer, in "Tombstone," never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degreeÂ   Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need ariseÂ The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurysÂ The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the CorralÂ  Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film "Tombstone" does not even touchÂ While "Tombstone" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondÂThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old ageÂ   The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well toldÂ But we always remember Ford's "My Darling Clementine" for its other qualitiesÂfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the wayÂ This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magicÂ  "My Daring Clementine" was a film of touchesÂFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors danceÂ  Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriageÂ Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous "Westerners" of all time...
It's supposed to be about how some Vietnam vet had problems after coming home from war and how he was using "the vicious combat techniques of raw power and heroic behaviour he learned in Vietnam to stand up to the street scum" of New York.
If you watch this film based on the cover or the Troma-logo,don't bother, chances are that you feel rather drained after viewing.
I first saw this film just after I left the Navy in '73.
Thankfully, after a brief tear-jerking mother daughter reunion you can switch off, go to sleep and repress all that trauma.
But he does do a nice thing for Ponce, albeit in a sick way, in helping him out with his female troubles after Ponce said that he wouldn't touch a dead girl because he hasn't had a live one yet while being questioned by Telly Savalas's character, Sam Surcher.
We are given scene after scene of girls in impossibly sort mini-skirts bending over, crossing their legs, standing on elevated surfaces, or just walking up the steps.
Not only does she get felt up by Hudson, she also enthusiastically deflowers the gawky teenage male virgin after extolling the virtues of John Milton's "Paradise Lost."
Nice job by Keenan Wynn is the wheezy geezer local sheriff assigned by Savalas to direct traffic after incompetently touching every bit of evidence at the first murder scene.
Initially, I was disappointed but my disappointment quickly evaporated after I heard Severance speak her first line.
I'm probably forgetting something, but that's 10 big plot issues to be dealt with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that's both not too complicated--this is a kids' film, after all--and that's also humorous and heartwarming.
It's violent but hardly exciting with one scene of brutality after another (Mason's daughter is raped by McDowell, an uncooperative Gypsy is set afire).
)Âafter which Mason tries to attack Quinn for pushing her to this, but falls flat on his face in the snow after only a couple of paces (this bit somehow reminded me of a scene from one of the NAKED GUN films in which George Kennedy lashes at a couple of bullies for mistreating his partner and ends up getting beaten to a pulp himself!).
Worst of all, though, is the climax as a deranged and wounded McDowell turns up at the cabin (after having miraculously survived an avalanche he caused himself!)
Now, after I've seen so many movies and memorable performances, I realize that McDowell was over the top and judging by his own words, he knew it very well and did it on purpose:   "I played this real nasty Nazi who was chasing these people across the Pyrenees.
You seem to be doing something different from the rest of us'..."   If after so many years, one performance in a supposedly bad movie stands out and you can't get it out of your mind, and you remember the exact day when you saw that movie, who you saw it with and how you felt, for me it means that the movie was not bad at all.
certain scenes are indeed quite disturbing; malcolm's slicing off of a victim's fingers during an interrogation, malcolm's massacre of a gypsy family led by christopher lee and malcolm's subsequent rape of the scientist's beautiful daughter (kay lenz) after removing his nazi branded briefs (charming).
I do not think the violence was overblown in the movie - not after visiting a few Holocaust museums in Europe.
This is one of those films that haunts you years after seeing it.
Nikolai Cherenko (Lundgren) is a former spetznas (Russian special forces) who, after his family was killed by a mafia boss, went to the US to work as a mechanic.
I found myself actually hoping that they would live happily ever after.
Second film as director , first masterpiece , after a very good first movie .
The Fans of "Star Wars - Clone Wars" may tar and feather me for my opinion, but after seeing this on TV a few months ago (aired directly after the original "Star Wars - Attack of the Clones"-Picture) i was extremely disappointed.
As a "Star Wars"-Fan since 1977 i expected something, that surely will not par up to George Lucas original movies, but a least pay homage to the original movies, but after 15 Minutes i turned the TV off.
This takes place right after Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones and right before Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith.
The story starts a little after where 'Attack of the Clones' left and finishes right after Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi are given orders to retrieve Palpatine from Grievous.
Each short is extremely action packed, which makes watching each micro-episode one after another a little exhausting, since you rarely even get a chance to catch your breath before the next section of action begins.
You know, where the 'hero' gets wronged and has go after the bad guys, regardless of the fact that he is one man, and he is going up against a well connected organisation.
Speaking of structure, Clone Wars is divided into two parts: Volume I (takes place some time after the Battle of Geonosis) and Volume II (Chapter 21 ultimately concludes the story arc of Attack of the Clones, the rest takes place some time before the events of Revenge of the Sith).
They then find out (after the fact) that they Aren't supposed to blow it up.
Eventually after all her classmates are dead, she is left in the train with the mysterious flute playing monk (which he cannot play - his finger and breathing rhythms don't match up with the flute music), whom "helps her lose her virginity" in order to escape the Prince of Darkness' want of her - the girl has to be a virgin in order for her to be 'his'.
So, after chasing the imaginatively named 'Phantom' out to sea by hilariously out-pacing a jet ski whilst swimming butterfly, Zohan fakes his own death in the most excruciatingly unfunny comedy fight ever conceived.
Adam Sandler plays Zohan Dvir, an Israeli counter-terrorism army commando who, after growing tired of the Israel/Palestine conflict, fakes his own death in order to pursue his dream.
I hope he returns to the form of films such as Happy Gilmore, but after this stinker it's highly unlikely.
Zohan defends Michael (Nick Swardson of "Reno 911, The Movie") in a street brawl after a motorist blames Michael for his accident with a delivery truck.
But Zohan's fame will bring him some problems too, and after he falls in love with Dalia, a big confusion is going to start.
The movie makers get my personal "thank you" for that, it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between "black" and "white" people after the civil war, or about Americans and Japanese directly after WWII, there is no prejudices against Arabs here.
The first time in the movie it was a little funny but after it was in every scene, it became tedious.
Not long after his arrival,(in,...you guessed it... NEW YORK CITY!!
This movie is a comedy and it stars Adam Sandler if you walk into that theater expecting anything except a stupid-funny movie then you need to instead leave the theater to go home and hit yourself in the face with a rock, after all it can't do more damage to your brain.
Agutter plays the brilliant architect who seems to be the ghost's main target and Moriarty is the clairvoyant police officer who looks after her.
Other reviewers have already commented on the superb photographic artistry, so I'll just say that, more than 20 years after first seeing it, what still stands out in my mind is its ending.
However, in hindsight this movie deserves a second look, and seems to have received one, as indicated by the positive reviews I have read from virtually every amateur online reviewer, which would qualify this movie as a sleeper 20 years after its original release.
Furie was right to make a movie about Vietnam with a unique storyline: after all, I am sure there were romantic relationships that developed in that war, with such close contact among medical personnel in trying circumstances.
It's probably just another example of the confusing Italian horror tradition of sticking numbers after random titles so people will go and see the film.
There's a night-lamp that still seems to work after 20 years?!?!?!?!
And the girl's corpse doesn't show any decomposing signs after 20 years of rotting away???
Upon viewing it recently, after a friend bought the DVD, it certainly brought back memories and would no doubt be equally as popular with today's toddlers as it was with kids in the Eighties.
One freaky part is how the clown turns into Tina after she is dead, and comes to Susan.
I'm telling you, this movie gave me nightmares after watching it.
There are a number of biblical references, and it turns out that John's father is a pastor, although John himself is filled with doubt, especially after the death of his wife before the movie started.
Certainly the reviewers here who believed they knew the ending after 10 mins, I think are conning themselves , they probably saw the trailer or heard it on the grapevine as clearly up to half way through the movie the audience is led to believe that Cage's character is clearly there to stop the disasters from happening or at least try to save some lives , the end of the world does not come into it at all.
Why was Calen (Koestler's son) still writing "numbers" after the big crash was forecasted?
Though it is no masterpiece like '2001', 'Knowing' suggests the same thing '2001' did Â that determinism and coincidence, intelligent design and natural selection - the great differing viewpoints on the nature of our existence - may not be at odds after all; they may be counterparts to a greater whole.
John Koestler is a single father raising his son, Caleb, after his wife was killed in a tragic fire that claimed the lives of several dozen others.
It is a mean spirited, fantasy film at times, but sometimes you laugh harder after you've been scared nearly to death.
I ended up seeing it yesterday after a friend and I went to see "Taken" and it was sold out.
The disaster scenes were ridiculous - people on fire walking around after a plane crash?
One would think that perhaps he is turning over a new leaf after 5 minutes, but his best friend informs us this is not the case.
After half a glass of whisky he found the first date from the first set of numbers he looked at, after a whole bottle and a sleepless night he found the rest, but it took his trucks GPS product placement ad to find out the rest of the numbers are latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates.
When Cage's son, who can hear the voices, starts writing down more numbers, even after the final revelation, Cage dismisses it as his son's impetuousness.
We are talking about Hollywood after all, not the Vatican.
But after the first half-hour, you say, "I never want one of those things!"
This is already obvious after five minutes watching.
Their conversation in bed after the first time doing "it" was a gem.
And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight.
While these creatures remain ÂMogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster.
When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so.
Eddie Macon (John Schneider, in his first film starring role since coming to prominence on 'The Dukes of Hazzard') is an honest-to-God good man who ends up in jail after losing his cool with his sleazy employer.
"Le Porno Killers" has definitely an awesome title,but fails to deliver both violence and an abundance of sleaze.This tedious bore features two female agents(one of them is Carmen Russo of "Patrick Still Lives" fame)who go after Vassilli Karis.First of all the title is completely misleading,because there are no porno scenes and no killers in this flick.At least beautiful Carmen Russo provides some full-frontal nudity.First we see her sunbathing nude then she gets up to walk across the yard buck-naked.Then she takes a shower with her female co-star and they engage in a truly fantastic lesbian scene.Finally we see her in a menage-a-trois totally nude on the bed then briefly getting up.Still the film is pretty light on sleaze and the action is deadly dull.Only for tolerant fans of Italian smut.4 out of 10.
And it had more warmth in it than the movie I imagined after reading two or three reviews in New York papers when it was showing there at the IFC in autumn, 2005.
Soderbergh is wise to put the looking-for-work moment very early rather than after 38 minutes, because it is better to start out with that.
I had read many reviews and comments and thought that I was prepared for the intense story but I wasn't prepared to feel both assaulted and uplifted after seeing this movie.
For example, one suggested that perhaps Keane had really kidnapped Kira and that the film was told backwards after losing her?
I have always been taught to avoid such people because they are dangerous and not to give them money because they will just spend it on drugs and alcohol Â nothing that I saw in Keane disputed those beliefs but as I stopped to give the poor man some money it occurred to me that after experiencing this film, I could no longer just ignore someone like him.
I was lucky enough to see this film at the London Film Festival where Lodge Kerrigan and Damien Lewis where present and did a question and answer session after the film ended.
(Dir: Lodge Kerrigan) William Keane (played with heartbreaking brilliance by Lewis an Academy Award worthy turn) is a man wrestling with ultimate grief: he is searching for his lost little girl months after the incident that has sent him into a downward spiral into mental illness.
Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
It's the kind of movie that leaves a lump in your throat after wards!
Keane is the kind of movie that touches you, even long after you have left the theater!
He uncannily captures the look of disturbed men seen unfortunately frequently on the streets of New York (I was punched by one once after he stared at me fixedly in a store) and who are brought to public attention openly after a subway platform pushing or inexplicable knife attack.
Rumiko Takahashi's "Inuyasha" (named after its central character) is one of the most popular mangas of all time.
In SOWC, the ghost Soyosama, a former counsel of Inuyasha's father, releases the evil demonic sword Sounga from its sheath after containing it for 700 years.
Don't feed them after midnight.
"Meet the Spartans" is the only movie-movie after Scary Movie that was funny enough to keep me entertained.
I switched the channel after an hour of TRYING to watch it.
It holds up very well after all these years, and you won't be disappointed.
The film's idea is that you can be beautiful, but only after a severe makeover in which your physical appearance conforms to what makers Friedberg and Seltzer would want Â they have an idea of a perfect man, as well, and that is in the form of the handsome, white, Aryan character named Grant Funkyerdoder, a character played by British actor Adam Campbell.
It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end.
Boy meets girl, boy thinks girl is beautiful, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl face obstacles in their relationship, boy and girl overcome said obstacles, and they all live happily ever after.
This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing "Date Movie" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted.
I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting.
In one scene, after the family has toasted at the rehearsal wedding dinner table, Lil' Jon comes in and says, "What?
And in the end, after you watch it, you really will wonder if thats a possum or gremlin in the vent ;)
This movie is a quotation after quotation of James Cameron's Aliens (1986)... or better said copy, rip off, stealing.
The bad points: Cliche after cliche hits you until you can't take it seriously.
Years later Connor hooks up with Jenny and makes the mistake of not snuggling with her after sex.
Don't feed them after midnight) are broken?
Guy gets his heart broken at a young age, becomes a player, has one night stands until one day he somehow manages to woo the 'one that got away' and they live happily ever after.
Then - after all her yammering about "taking it slow," she forces him to spend the night.
So after hammering home the idiocy that marriage will keep you from misery, the movie shows us explicitly how a marriage can BE misery (for HER as she pines for her "True Love"; for HIM as he never gets through to her completely), yet it never recants from its demonstrably incorrect platitude.
A young man (Zach Galligan) receives a cute but unknown creature named Gizmo who multiplies, and after the new creatures (mogwai) eat after midnight, they become monsters.
It really could have been so much better, the plot was intriguing (or at least that's what I thought after watching the trailer), the idea of the ghosts of these girls finally giving a lesson to this full of himself guy seems to completely vanish after the first one.
He courts her, she falls for him, then after sex he bails and never speaks to her again.
When she gets her first glimpse of him (after years of silence), she is all glassy eyed and love struck.
He breaks up with 3 girls on a conference call in front of a fourth girl and after such a despicable act, the fourth girl still wants to sleep with him.
the ending was very weak for an already weak storyline with a seemingly impossible wedding being put back on again after Connor has a 2 minute pep talk to the bride ,in which she realises she is wrong for not wanting to marry the man who slept with her best friend still sitting in the same car on the way to the airport.
to cap it all off we return to the ghosts chatting each other up and everyone lives happily ever after.
Sure, some moments are perhaps a little too daft (personally, I don't understand that rule about not feeding a mogwai after midnight, and I can't fully accept the scene where Gizmo drives a fully functioning Barbie car) but excellent animatronics courtesy of Chris Walas, a nifty script from Chris Columbus, loads of in-jokes for fans of fantasy films (look out for blink-and-you'll-miss-them appearances from Gremlins producer Steven Spielberg and animator Chuck Jones, an appearance from Forbidden Planet's Robbie the Robot, a stuffed ET toy sat between a cuddly Sylvester and Bugs Bunny, and the Time Machine from the 60s George Pal movie) all go to make Gremlins an unmissable treat.
The big reunion in FOUND is little more than an owner finding misplaced car keys after a five minute search.
Parents finding their daughter after 15 years from her being kidnapped - I've acted more excited over finding $20.00 in a jacket pocket.
The big reunion in FOUND is little more than an owner finding misplaced car keys after a five minute search.
In 1897, David Eastwick was born, yet in 1902 he was nine years old, five years after being born.
Never ever feed him after midnight.
Till they eat after midnight!
How could Billy have possibly been at the contest after he was dead?
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   With everyone talking about how youth crime and violence has skyrocketed almost to the same level as the States in Britain, this action thriller from over fifteen years ago now looks like a grim prediction from back then, with Harvey Keitel's hardened detective flying over to help stem the drugs/murder problem whilst pursuing a villain he was originally after in the States who he now believes has started to prowl around Europe.
Well choreographed, exciting fight scenes, a good storyline and deep characters played by good actors (not just Wincott and Hudson, but the co-stars too - most notably Richard Jaeckel as their father) In my opinion, this is Jeff Wincotts second best film after the amazingly good Mission of Justice.
Its first twenty minutes are so painfully nonsensical and over stylized you can't help but cringe in anger, yet after those initial phases of ridiculous OTT poppiness blow over, the project reveals itself as quite enjoyable.
This happens after Ming Ming purloins a sum of money from the gangland boss, funds to be used in financing a new life for her with sulking hunk Ah D. The latter, a fist-fighting mob enforcer, is conveyed by Daniel Wu in a thoroughly disappointing part.
I finally just saw Lookwell after years of hearing about how brilliant and funny it is.
Why was he never given a chance after Batman?
It might have been exhausting to keep this going week after week, but I sure would have liked to see them try.
This definitely makes my top 10 plot a man named randy peltzer is looking for a present for his son billy Peltzer just as he seems to have run out of luck he discovers a small Chinese shop and a strange creature known as a Mowgli after a small argument with the shop owner randy finally gets it when the owners grandson gives it to him as well as telling him three rules 1.
Don't get him wet and finally never feed him after midnight And so Randy takes it home.
Billy being the typical person that he is breaks all the rules At first gizmo multiples creating 4 more Mowgli who then eat after midnight turning them into Gremlins viscous nasty goblin like creatures With help of his mum Billy succsefully kills off three gremlins except there leader Stripe who escapes to the swimming pool and jumps in all hell brakes loose I'm not really sure why i like this movie probably because of the music and because of the gremlins them selves there cool
The Swinging and getting up buildings quickly will be hard to grasp at first, but after an hour or two, you won't wanna turn off your ps3.
This same choppiness also prevents Spider-Man from using his incredibly limited repertoire of attacks effectively, since any attack activates about 2-3 seconds after the corresponding button has been pressed.
i was expecting this to be one of my favorite games ever because ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 games are my favorite games ever but this isn't huge let down its just conclusion of the game is bad if you seen the film harry dies he also dies in the game but when its all over they completely forgot about that and story mode is short to atleaset on the ps2 version but swinging around new york is just pure fun so is story mode but its disappointing that it is so short and playing has black suit is fun but its to bad you cant after you beat the game.
It took me about 5 hours to complete the story, and the overall the game is quite good, but after Spider-Man 2 (and, in particular, Ultimate Spider-Man) I was hoping for better.
The fights with him are long and difficult, and his taunts get very annoying after the hundredth time (and he repeats them about 50 times in one fight, so you end up playing the level, dying, and then repeating the level, which equals more annoying taunts).
Historically important since this was the first Merrie Melodies short after a year of Looney Tunes with Bosko as the star.
Then they are fed after midnight and this turns them into Gremlins.
I've only just got around to watching this film - 3 years after its release but it was worth the wait.
And yes there are several stereotypes on show but that clever script I mentioned earlier throws up surprise after surprise.
There are three *extremely* important rules to follow in order to take proper care of "Gizmo": don't expose him to light, don't expose him to water, and above all else, never feed him after midnight.
Before I go, I want to say that writer turned director Chris Columbus's script does beg questions such as: If the wrong time to feed "Gizmo" is after midnight, when does the right time begin?
I've never thought after From Dusk Till Dawn that someone would try to make a clone of that movie.
It was ranked on a lot of top horror movie lists, but after watching I can honestly say I don't understand why.
The movie also gives brief biographies of each character, but this becomes redundant after the first 3-4 and by the time they are all done, you're wondering why they did so many.
Director John Gulager and one of the writers, Marcus Dunstan, chatted with the audience after the screening.
Plus, although at first I liked Sylvia Sidney's character for believing in her man, after she knew he was a murderer and STILL followed him, she just seemed totally stupid.
You Only Live Once is Director Fritz Lang's second American film after leaving Nazi Germany.
Fritz Lang made better pictures, but this one holds up well after 70 years.
During the Depression, a young couple goes on the lam after the man is accused of a crime.
Moving at a crisp pace the film delivers plenty of suspense and surprises as Fonda is framed for murder not long after his release and, interestingly not long after he is fired, threatens to return to his miscreant ways.
"Back to the Future" came out a year after "Gremlins," and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius.
"And don't feed them after midnight."
And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.
It's one of those movies that, after it ends, leaves you kinda (or very) shaken up.
I remember seeing this movie at a movie theater with some friends of mine right after it opened 20 years ago, and I said afterwards, "this is going to be a huge hit".
There are three rules that must be followed in caring for the Mogwai: Rule #1 - Keep them away from light; Rule #2 - Don't get them wet; and Rule #3 - Don't feed them after midnight.
If your after a comedy - this might be your cup of tea.
If your after a high quality 'fake-o-mentry' or mockumentry horror... this isn't one of them either.
I highly suggest to rent this and not buy it as it loses its worth after one view through.
Well, i cant believe what a film that was, If you are like me, then you will find that horrors nowadays are not what they used to be, But JACKPOT BABY, I mean i know that it is made in 1998 but it does not stop it from being probs one of the greatest horrors to be made, Right from the start it actually maintains the course of looking like a genuine home video, and when they realise the aliens are actually after them, The horror on there faces, Some believe Sum Do not, it is just brilliant, And the Way that they portray that Rosie has been taken over somehow is just brilliant, Also they bring in the racist side of it tackling that view with great authority, they make every bit of the film as enjoyable as the ever, People who are looking for flaws in the film i have this message( My God Get A Life ) its a film go bloody have a pop at a Disney film or summit, As for me This is Danny Robinson Signing out with a big 10 outa 10
I guarantee after you watch this you will be a bit more hesitant to venture out at night during a power cut ;-)
His name is Aaron Pearl and he appears one year after the Incident in Lake County in a film entitled "Wrongfully Accused" starring Leslie Nielsen.
acting (I seriously tried to get into the film but the bad acting from EVERYONE accept from the black guy and the one called Mel...and they were only okay) 4) Eye Sore watching all the different camera angles from the camera 5) Not Original (came out just after year after Blair witch came out)  5 great reasons to hate this film and for the love of god read this = IT IS NOT REAL, IT IS NOT BASED ON TRUE EVENTS, IT IS A STORY Written BY DIRECTOR and just found out today the film has a fan club.
I mean after Ghostwatch in 1992, which was a hoax too, but that doesn't matter.
For people of about 14 and upwards, you should understand even if video footage was found of a family who have been abducted (and nowhere to be found), the government would never allow it to be released for TV (at least not after many years of working with it).
The fact he could come back and play after a near-fatal auto accident was amazing....but I would not watch this again because it was too subjective and just not the truth.
The apparent simplicity is used as a tool to conceal deeper issues in later installments, but here it's exactly what it looks like: a very basic script that allows any viewer to access the classic Star Trek universe without worrying about any complicated, underlying "mythology" (an element that has been mandatory in successful genre shows made after 1990).
There's an incredible plot complication about two-thirds of the way through the movie that I won't mention, but is amazing, and the drunken "confession" after it is classic.
In addition, the great screen drunk Arthur Housman stumbles through one scene, and Rick Vallin is priceless as a gigolo who is stuck with an elderly but rich lady as his date, night after night.
As they interact quite naturally with others, it dawns on the viewer that perhaps these two oddballs are not so peculiar after all, and that they'd perhaps fit in very easily with the eccentricities of society at large.
But after I saw it a second time (the full Black and White version), I fell in love with it and I now own it on DVD and have seen it quite a few more times.
There's nothing more engrossing than watching West & Art suffer breakdowns, after being pushed to the brink, or witnessing the demise of a seemingly innocent blow-up doll, after winning over our hearts and minds.
The actors surely must have felt that, after reading the screenplay.
Yes almost 30 years after I read the book and saw the movie, I still have fond memories that are obviously lasting a lifetime.
Besides its dialogue being simply stunning in piling up repartee after absurdist repartee,the very plot of the film feels more as a joke at the expenses of structuralist critique than a structuralist text per se.
He died when his couch caught fire after falling asleep with a lit cigarette on December 12th of the same year.
Funny thing in this movie is that Lt. Columbo has a new and much better looking raincoat, who he constantly keeps forgetting to take back with him after visiting a place.
Later on after the ordeal the man still happens to be the house, but she grabs a shotgun and shoots him.
Upon watching this movie I really had only the Death Wish films to rate Bronson by but after watching the "Rider on the Rain" I can understand why he was an acclaimed actor.
Now, after 38 years I saw it again on DVD, and it evoked some memories!
Jack Cassidy died not long after this episode was released; he died in bed when his cigarette caught his mattress on fire - a very 70's way to die compared to today's peanut-allergic world.
It was released two years after Richardson had died and it also features that other classical acting knight, Sir John Gielgud as well.
He then pulls out copy after copy of the document and hands one back to Santini.
I wonder who's going to take care of her after Cassidy is put away?
Then after finishing it he suddenly realizes that he made himself look like a personal enemy of the deceased.
The reason for that is simple, there aren't many shows that after five, six, seven or more seasons remain as good as the were at the start of their showing, but NCIS is only getting better.
I especially like how a little water trickles out of the trap door after Santini's daughter (Cynthia Sikes) opens it.
Week after week the officers of NCIS deal with murders, kidnappings and other threats to the lives of Naval officers across the globe (well at least the U.S.) but rather than adhere to the dark, overly serious tone of the law&orders or CSI's this program offsets the (often heinous) crime of the week with the banter between the central characters.
Well the above was written after watching the first 2 series of NCIS, so now I thought I would comment on what I think of the show in series 3 and 4.
Time for another update as season 5 comes to a close in the UK although we are getting to see the first episode of season 6 a few days after it airs in the US.
Wherever you are Jack, we miss you still after 30 years.
That's why we see Gary Sinsie breaking a terrorist, David Carusso putting his sunglasses and shaking the hand of his Mexican friend, who in the next episode, he may kill, after doing what they call "justice" OK, ladies and germs: for those that think that crime and justice are so easy words, I'm sorry to tell you: You're wrong.
Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season.
She is attempting to get the projects torn down in a struggle to find meaning after her son dies.
after one episode (i watched it on accident once after that 70's show, which is still the very best show on tv), i was hooked.
There's something important after the credits.
Tony, being an idiot, suggests that they hold a sÃ©ance with a Ouija board he just happens to have, after some goading everyone agrees & the sÃ©ance begins.
The story follows Michael and his friends, who after Michael's birthday party decide to play with the ouija board.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
Yes, there's some Harry Potter here, but I think Harry was a couple of years after and Cinderella (for that matter) was a couple of years before, if you're going to get into who ripped off whom.
A group of brainless friends summon a demon (named Virgil...not exactly a petrifying name, if you ask me) and this demon soon after possesses one of the kids.
SPOILER however (if you don't already know it) fede dies and flor's prince changes(supposedly Fede returns to earth and enters the body of Max, or something like that) That is quite annoying because after all this trouble they went through they didn't even manage to get married really (unreal weddings-cris morena again!)
But in the end Flor marries her prince and they live happily ever after while the villains end up in jail.
She whacks him across the head and shoos him into the house and, with a glance over her shoulder, adds, "Wait till after dark."
We are confronted, after all, with similar situations all over the world -- not just Northern Ireland, but Palestine, Iraq, and the cities of the United States.
I watched it by chance; after renting a Hollywood box office action film.
New drive away of the trio after X stole some money to the Quickiemart's register.
Why do everybody is always after the three people's poor fate?
A teenage couple, sick of the world, pick up a drifter after a concert at quite a metaphorical venue.
feeling you get after watching this and the other two movie in this series (Nowhere and Totally F***ed Up).
If you do watch this movie and don't like it the first time I suggest you watch it again, i promise after the initial shock you will see the art behind it all.
For example, they could have done without the tiresome sequence of the girl running into the woods and the others coming after her (and no shock factor like in the first movie's version).
In Conan Doyle's original, Dr. Watson makes it clear that he was meeting Holmes in London for the first time after retiring from service as a surgeon in the Indian Army (Imperial British military during the Raj).
When the first EVIL DEAD came out in 1982 or whatever 80 something it was gore after gore after gore in such a small budget and it became known as one of the most shocking films.
The best part - hands down - was when Campbell, after having taken his hand off, places a bucket over it to restrain it and then puts a bunch of books on top.
The funniest scene of all is Ash having to sever his possessed hand, of course after it literally beat the living crap out of him.
However, after the paraphrase of events at the start of Evil Dead II, which only features Ash and Linda and Ash is once again hit by the same evil spirit.
However, I sometimes wouldn't sleep too well after watching something creepy.
Night after night, a group of citizens meet at his house to discuss the jar and its contents and to try to discover what it it is.
Many specific scenes, like a very harsh (though always under the surface) scene between Karin and Henrik, when she tells him point blank to leave and never come back to see Anna, or when Anna is told after the death of her father Johan (Max Von Sydow, always great to see him even in limited time) about how she destroyed a letter she found that she meant to sent to Henrik.
Watching this movie made me realize that if someone had to come up with a fantasy after enormous amount of research, it surely can't get any worse than this movie.
Background music is the second intense thing after Hrithik's acting, that keeps you engrossed.
Then, after a further series of adventurs, the love interest is made the subject of a second sacrifice, and the heroes must rescue her and destory the temple.
A young boy named Jalaluddin stands on a war front In 1555AD India to be crowned as the new Moghul Emperor after the death of his Father Humayun.
Jodhaa-Akbar is a story of love between a husband and a wife after they get married.
Making a comeback after a highly spiritual Swades (2004) Ashtosh may not have as appealing story as Swades but the love in Jodhaa Akbar cannot be denied.
Even after when I came to know that Ashutosh Gowarikar is directing this movie, one who gave us amazing experience in "Lagaan" and "Swades", I was still skeptical to watch it.
Even after the movie finishes it is hard to decide if the movie is about Akbar's war with Rajput clan or a so called love story between Jodhaa and Akbar.
Hoping someone will edit cut it down to 15 minutes and post it on Youtube ( hehe)  politically correct, historically inaccurate, financially flushed, glamorized notions ... look at Ashoka - I personally hated that - after all these reviews, I a can only imagine what a torture it would be sit through 3.5 hrs.
The rest of the cast and crew undoubtedly have a long career ahead of them but Mr. Deohans' career might come to an abrupt halt after this film.
I don't think this was a result of the character growing because like I said; there really is no growth after his marriage to Jodhaa or any character for that matter.
I did not have much of a choice when my brother-in-law bought a CD of this movie home & my wife insisted that we should view it as a family...I have been hearing rave reviews till now & so was just a little bit intrigued...however after sitting through the entire movie, I am wondering what the hype was all about...without doubt, this is an above-average film and has been made with a lot of care & effort....however does it deserve all the accolades heaped on it...can I, for once, cry out "The Emperor has no clothes"?
Instead an unknown actor with a commanding presence would have better suited this role...I think Hrithik would be more suited to play the part of Jehangir, in a historic movie, as Jehangir was known to be a typical ladies man...  2) Aishwarya Rai as a Rajput princess is a joke...same as Hrithik, she lacks the stature to play such a part...she is pure eye candy...her voice is weak & she sounds absurd delivering her lines...my choice to play this part would have been Sushmita Sen...  3) The plot of this movie is 2/3rds pure fantasy...Akbar did not have a wife by the name of Jodha...he married a Rajput princess called Hira Kunwar, who promptly converted to Islam and was called Mariam-ul-zamani...she was one of Akbar's many wives and bore him his heir apparent Jehangir...  4) It is not evident whether the director meant for this film to be a love saga or a political drama...too many sub-plots spring out throughout the length of the movie, but get resolved quickly & conveniently...it seems the director wanted to pack in as much masala as possible, culminating in an unnecessary fight scene...  5) Akbar's birth name was Badruddin Mohammed Akbar, after his grandfather Shaikh Ali Akbar and "Akbar" was not a title conferred on him...  5) Akbar was better known as a master strategian & shrewd administrator, not for his chiseled physique...he was also not monogamous as is depicted in the movie, but like other emperors of his time had innumerable wives & concubines...though he has been painted as being broad-minded & liberal as compared to other Mughals, Akbar was far from the benign & forgiving monarch portrayed here...he was responsible for slaughtering thousands of men, women & children, destroying hundreds of temples & ransacking scores of towns & villages...finally no Indian emperor would be fool hardy enough to challenge his adversary to single combat & stake his entire kingdom on the outcome of the fight...  6) The battle scenes are evidently inspired by (read - copied from) Hollywood movies such as Troy & Alexander...however after watching the realistic, gruesome wars depicted in the latter, these appear as tame, watered down versions...the climatic confrontation in this movie reminds too much of the awe-inspiring stand off between Hector & Achilles in Troy...
I admired Ashutosh Gowarikar for his original & entertaining Lagaan and also for his thought-provoking, soul stirring Swades...Aamir & Shahrukh Khan managed to get in the skin of the characters they were playing to such an extent that after watching these movies, you do not remember the stars, you only remember Bhuvan & Mohan Bhargav...here, you are only watching Hrithik who has played romantic lead in several other movies...seems like Ashutosh has succumbed to the practice of making politically correct, commercially successful movies...
And then 'Azeem oh Shan Shahenshah' is one song that will remain etched in your memory long after you leave the theater.
A young Akbar, sets out to conquer Kingdoms and those who don't join him, are brutally executed but after a while he begins to pardon them and that's when many of his opponents begin to realise that they had and have, misunderstood him.
The couple do unite in marriage but only after Akbar agrees to the two conditions which the Rajput Princess has put forward.
At the same time, he has to win her heart as well as to look after the interest of his public.
The first half-an-hour had some war sequences which were shot wonderfully but got kind of stretching-too-long after a while.
This was the turning point in the film, after which it took off beautifully.
Except for Porthos, who's actor does a fine job after all, all the cast is close enough to the book as possible.
After all, she married athos at age 20, got hanged after a year, became the Cardinal's (a great Karyo) top spy in the meantime, married Winter's brother, killed him ....you see she was quite busy all the time.
Milady in this had no fleur-de-lis instead she has a serpentine Mark of the Devil which appeared on her skin after the Devil resurrected her after Athos had hanged her.
looks and feels more like a travelogue than anything else, with establishing shots of internationally famous landmarks and reel after reeling reel of home-movie style sequences that add up to nothing at all in the end.
The story begins with a death of a 80-year-old Hans at the restaurant after listening to "Gloomy Sunday".
I went just after seeing LOTR:FOTR, and found Gloomy Sunday to be a more introvertive and rewarding film..... it was just one of those days... just like going into see Fitzcarraldo with no expectations....
At the beginning when the 80 yr old man dropped dead after hearing "the famous song" and people saying that it's cursed, I already had impatience for it.
The character of Hans appears initially as a lonely, rejected young German man, who after being rejected by Ilona, comes back years later a changed man, a Nazi colonel on charge of the rounding up of Jews in his area.
The game is afoot as Holmes examines minute particles of...what?, locates snowy footprints in the school quadrangle, examines the school's kitchen...all with the clock ticking away and with the school's students racing after him, with Watson in the lead.
The owner of a restaurant saves the life of a German who is trying to commit suicide after being turned down - by the restaurateur's mistress.
One night is spent with Andras and the next one with Laszlo, who after all, is the one with the money and paying the bill!
This part was very predictable, since one knows after seeing so many stories like this, it always ends tragically because of Nazis, even friendly ones, as Hans was, deep down inside hates Joachim because he had what he never could have, Ilona.
I am told she is a newcomer to the screen, but as an actor she will surely be much sought after in the future.
Fine acting all over the place, especially by Krol and Becker (still brave in German moviemaking to show a Nazi not as a complete monster, even if he is, after all, the bad guy), and despite the overall sad story executed surprisingly lighthanded.
I would have walked out after 30 minutes, but there was a slight suggestion that Wally Norman's son might be gay, so I stayed on to see where they went with that.
The pub scene when Wally comes back after the goat race was a hoot to shoot with free beer flowing all day.
However, after the director addressed us all, also announcing that he added a sepia tone color to the print, oh and by the way, he hasn't seen this print yet, so please comment afterwards!
Letterman's going to finally top the ratings after more than 17 years.
I know after watching 66 episodes that the Tonight Show is really an awesome show to watch thanks to Conan unique hosting style.As the show is progressing it is becoming more streamlined and unique.
Dr. David Callaway (Robert De Niro) and his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning) decide it is best to move from New York to the country to care for her more after the suicide of David's wife.
Watson's experience after being shot with the drug were funny.
There was another parallel with the dead women in the bathtub in both movies and the father getting crazy and going after an authority figure with an axe.
The actress gives a chilling performance as troubled Emily Callaway, who after her mothers suicide, goes to live with her dad in a new town where her imaginary friend shows up...scary things begin to occur and the movie really gets going.
INteresting premise with a little girl who is traumautized after seeing her mother dead in an apparent suicide.
we literally hid under the blanket after all of those frightening moments.
also we were afraid to go into the bathroom and look in the bathtub after watching this film.
It is about a psychologist, David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) whose wife commits suicide, and he decides to move to upstate New York with his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), whose personality has severely changed after her mother's death.
Then after David and Emily move into their new house, David meets Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue), who becomes a friend to David and Emily.
When it leads to suicide shortly after the film begins, David, a psychologist, packs up his young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) and heads from New York City to bucolic upstate New York to try to start over.
The ending is marked by a clever twist that most viewers may not see coming, and which will pleasantly broach more questions than it answers long after you have seen the film.
DeNiro should have looked at the script and then decided to burn it after reading the first 3 pages.
Okay, I won't really spoil the ending but after "the revelation" of this Who's Doin It, it did NOT work for me.
but after going to see it with a clear mind, i was pleasantly surprised.
Her father(Dinero) moves with her to a remote place out of the city for a new start after his wife's suicide.
I am still shell shocked, after watching this shameful waste of a beautiful island.
Ms. Ross was the second (or third since Cicely Tyson was also nominated that year for Sounder) African-American to be nominated an Oscar for Best Actress after Dorothy Dandridge's previous nod some 18 years before.
It felt like there was scene after scene of her being drug-addled, whining, and screaming, which began to abrade after a while.
He's even an one time Oscar-nominee after all!
For years after my first viewing of the movie I wondered why that song didn't have a bigger impact for me the first time I saw it.
This picture was made only 13 years after Lady Day's death.
Billie Holiday literally changed the way popular songs are sung, and therefore influenced every singer that came after her.
It is difficult in hindsight to appreciate Billie's impact on vocal style simply because she so totally changed the way songs are sung, and every singer who came after her, whether they realize it or not, has been influenced by her on some level.
John agrees to marry Joan, but wants it understood that there will be a divorce after a respectable amount of time has passed - six months.
Powell has brought her to his apartment on several occasions (and we imagine it is for more than the cocktails served to them by his butler, Reginald Owen), but one night Stephenson shows up as the angry, red-faced father (signalled to come by Brown after Harding calls Brown up).
Apparently they had a heavy duty argument at one point, when he agreed to pay off a big clothing bill, a few months after the marriage - he telling her that she better change as he was not rich enough to stand this kind of extravagance.
She decides to trick him into marriage by going to his apartment, then changing into "something cooler", after which her father shows up, and for some reason Fletcher agrees to marriage.
The flaw for me in the film is that I find the male character to be kind of a jerk and can't really see why she's so gung-ho to want this man - personally, I would take a decent, nice guy any day over a wealthy playboy who's always chasing after other women.
It's a good example of a "Pre-Code" film as topics such as adultery and premarital sex are actually discussed--something that would probably NOT been allowed after the new and strict Production Code was enacted in 1934-35.
The movie was a welcome change after I had viewed scores of Hollywood flicks.
(Wait after the end credits roll to see one last scene...)
A Palanca-winning story, masterful directing and great acting from just about everyone in the cast, but most specially child actors Jiro Manio, Isabella de Leon and the boy who played Manio's best friend, combine for a viewing experience you will remember long after the credits roll.
I didn't really like anything about this film, except for the fact that it has to do with beer (that was the reason I watched it after all) and that you see a lot of home-made sausages in several scenes (accompanying the beer).
Characters are full of charm, flesh and blood, and life... yes, Central European life after WWI (some visits to the area are still a good help in order to take better understanding... but be careful because later the understanding becomes LOVE forever, I can assure)   Just waiting the next one by Menzel, based on another classic by Bohumil Hrabal: I served the King of England.
The story is about a country-side brewery somewhere in Czech republic, at the beginning of the 20th century (maybe right after WWI).
The best movie of Czech genius Jiri Menzel (after the Oscar-winning 'Ostre sledovanÃ© vlaky' of course).
The Brown children are very naughty and very disobedient and Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) is looking for another nanny after the children had chased away 17 nannies.
The kids are great, and the movie successfully makes you sympathize with them, even after portraying them as little monsters.
Emma Thompson keeps on amazing us all with her screen writing (she is an Oscar winner for that, after all!
She must be 111 by now--- she was already a big Hollywood star back in 1941, after all.
I saw this film on television perhaps 24-25 years after its theatrical release and caught what must have been close to the original 1969 theatrical release or cable version.
And Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr looked a lot better after a couple of cups of coffee and some make-up.
The director, in the commentary on the DVD, tells why this occurred and that was basically due to a change of management at MGM shortly after this movie was released.
Kind of like sailors on liberty the three are looking for a good time and after an uneasy dinner with the couple strike out in search of female companionship.
All based on a Marxist conception of criminality in modern society that, by the way, still after 40 years rules among most criminologists in western Europe.
An utterly unbelievable criminal-turned-angel Delon tries to go straight after a 10-year sentence but the effort is shattered by an utterly unbelievably evil police detective.
The film is slow (but certainly not boring) as we assist to the development of the character; we see him recovering from 10 years of prison after the bank assault.
A "fair" cop who was in his first arrest ten years ago finds him in Montpellier and immediately believes that he is running after mischief.
He pleads for leniency in the case of safe cracker Gino Strabliggi (Alain Delon) who is up for parole after 10 years inside, against their better judgement the parole board agrees to Cazeneuve's request on condition that he takes responsibility for Strabliggi.
Four years after their Clan of the siciliens, JosÃ© Giovanni again joins together the couple, Gabin/Delon in a film .
I'm actually pretty calm and don't tend to get emotional...more of a cynical humor kind of guy...but this just left me staring good couple of minutes after the show was finally done.
And the wife is afraid of heights, yet about half the things they do require heights and she just exclaims how scared she is every time...and how happy she was she ignored it after they're done.
And Pop and Mum were great, never got married etc., and Mum a little heavy after giving birth to what 'seven kids' was a great cook etc.
From deep space, what transpires around the campfire(the smoke billowing off the ground has a prehistoric look) is the past, after all.
Don Plutarco realizes this, after the vanishing act in the cornfield(on his return trip to retrieve the violin), when the captain emerges from the compound with his stolen instrument in the autocrat's clutches.
All the characters are annoying caricatures that'll be grating on your nerves after the first 15 minutes.
One by one, the buildings are being demolished after its elderly citizens are dragged from the comfort of their homes to live in some colorless, sanitized new apartment home against their wishes.
This is, after all, their home we're talking about.
Genuinely unique and creepy, Homebodies tells the depressing story of what life is like after society has discarded you.
In the end, after finding out she is in fact a twin, she finds her other self buried alive.
Okay, I'll be honest, I confused after about half an hour, so I can't be accurate about the full plot.
Being familiar with miss Lohan's personal struggles much more than I am with her movies, I bought my ticket with a somewhat open-mind, even though after seeing the trailer (maybe the only bad element of the movie), I admit that I was basically expecting a teenage slasher movie.
Of course, I referred to Lynch, Tarantino and Verhoeven (who interestingly enough suffered the same kind treatment after the camp classic Showgirls) but I would not go as far as saying that I Know Who Killed me has the same rare genius that will make it last through the years, but it absolutely delivered the cynical fun that comes out from somewhere in between utter stupidity and sharp wit.
Oh, and by the way, two weeks after you have abducted me, she is found in a ditch, missing the same limbs that you cut off of me cause of the whole twin stigmata thing, and within a 24-48 hour period, she recovers, is interrogate by the FBI, is outfitted with a fully articulate artificial hand and leg (almost the same type of hand that Ash got in Army of Darkness, imagine that), has insanely wild sex with my boyfriend while my mom scrubs the sink downstairs...  *breathe*  "...And then once she puts it all together that my father, who really isn't my father, bought (as in purchased) me at the hospital from my crack whore birth mother, she confronts him and says the key line "I know who killed me", and comes to find you.
Because after this, there will be no more jobs left for her, other then that of a stripper in a seedy low rent strip club.
But after reading all the bad reviews (who I quote) say it's "The worst movie they've ever seen" It kind of puts you off.
The film's twist, one so ludicrous even the most die-hard Lohan films will giggle, is pulled directly from left field after a seemingly magical epiphany by the film's main character.
The packed theater of varying demographics was rolling in the aisles as clichÃ© after hackneyed clichÃ© flew off the screen in rapid succession to hilarious results.
Aside from the occasional, "I almost died laughing when....", I heard scarcely a good comment in the lobby after the film.
It's energy and light-heartedness has endeared it to generation after generation of fans.
I was named after the lead character.
Rajiv says that he likes her and wishes for her to go to America with them and see what life will be like after marriage.
I thought the entire production was brilliant, and am so happy to have been able to see it again after all these years!
In Paris where the World Championship was held, she was second after school figures, but the difference in score between her and VrzanovÃ¡ was rather small, so she still had good chances to win.
In 1979 my mother became severely ill and died in 1983, four months after my father who had died from a sudden heart attack.  
The plot of the show has Lano and Woodley getting marooned on a desert island after a plane crash.
I suppose the audience on the night may have enjoyed it, it was after all for them.
I still remember after seeing the movie I was shivering all over,and couldn't get the crazy scene out of my head~it was like the first time i felt that way after seeing a horror movie,kind of cool in a way!For those horror-movie lovers out there,I'd say this one is a must see!
The students, seeking revenge, asked the Cambodian voodooist Pawn to cast a black magic against the couch, who mysteriously died after fishing.
With black magic in the works, things are never what it seems, as the group of students revisit their teacher a few years after a tragic and shameful incident happened in school.
Perhaps excessively slapstick-y at times (Benny falls into a well, falls through the floor, goes up the stairs and falls through the ceiling), but even that stuff gets its fair share of hits (one of the better sight gags is, after being forbidden the use of the neighborhood's main street, the off-road arrival by car of Benny at the house).
And in Latin-American culture, once a saint appears, you have to listen and act accordingly; after all, saints are all-knowing and have miracles to perform.
The fact that I still remember well the movie after seeing it once about 7 years ago should tell you it made quite an impression on me, as well as my funny-bone!
When I watched it for the first time, I was mostly interested in what would happen to the characters, after which I concentrated more on details.
Well, I must say that I really enjoyed the film for reasons I'll get to later Â which makes its absence on DVD more than a little baffling; incidentally, it was the tenth of Power's eleven collaborations with director King (the following effort, THE SUN ALSO RISES [1957], is perhaps the one I'd love to watch most of the star's remaining titles) as well as the second and last in which Power is co-starred with Susan Hayward (after the excellent suspense Western RAWHIDE [1951]).
Among the undeniable highlights in the episodic narrative (which spans several years) are: the opening fox hunt in Ireland, which sees hero and heroine alternating between squabbling and loving; the afore-mentioned ambush of the 'pioneers' in which Hayward's staid husband John Justin is killed; Power (who neglects Hayward through his struggle for the Boers' independence) engaging in a whip-wielding duel with his romantic rival and former best friend Richard Egan (himself lusted after by a young Rita Moreno); Egan having his leg crushed by a tree he's trying to fell (symbolizing Hayward's affair with Power) during a thunderstorm; and the climactic clash between bitter, peg-legged Egan's outlaws and the natives led by the obviously virtuous and rugged Power.
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
The confessions of Esperanza, always after some confusion, are also hilarious.
Well after viewing the first season I can say that ALL my fears were baseless.
But most cartoons that I've actually wanted to check out, I've been happy after the first episode.
prior to his even thinking of becoming Superman, and literally promise to bring him right back to the moment after they've left (hopefully after at least fifty episodes!)
Jeff Wincott was once a hit-man, and after he died he was brought back to life to do killing for the government.
Robert Shaw plays a convincing Pizarro -daring, ambitious and greedy- who after a while shows some kind of respect and even admiration towards a man he can't quite understand.
This is a great animated feature film.It was so cool to see He-Man and She-Ra and Skeletor and Hordak together!I loved it when He-Man and She-Ra did their transformation after each other near then!
By Phil Villarreal Arizona Daily Star  One of the resounding proofs of my mother's love was seared into my brain on Saturday, March 23, 1985, when she took me to see "The Secret of the Sword," succumbing to my relentless begging the day after the film opened.
Mostly when it plays back in He-man's world( why in the world would He-man and She-ra just leave Skeletor in Snake mountain after they defeated him?!
This is the best epic movie of all times until now.Great actors,beautiful music and very good work from the director.I have seen this movie almost 50 times and i never get bored to watch it.It takes away from this world.It takes you to other places that only in our fantasy we can see.This movie is not just a fantastic story about King Arthur,it also contains very good messages for those who can see them.The higher you go - the farther you'll fall!The only thing that i can not understand is why all of the actors(expect Helen Mirren)did not continue with great movies after that and they just move aside making movies(BAD movies),that no one knows.
I watched this experiment shortly after watching the second episode of Doctor Who.
The most moving part for me is still the climatic finale, in which, after the death of Arthur, and the world seems to have ended, Excalibur is brought back to the Lake and Three mysterious queens take Arthur away on a barge, all this while the dramatic music to Wagner's Siegfried's Funeral March blares triumphantly.
The screen starts blank, with the distant drums of Seigfried's Funeral March playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as Uther's men do battle with those of the Duke of Cornwall.
He does this all with the understanding that he doesn't kill anyone, and the cop who's always after him doesn't kill him either.
Lupin is so huge, that many, many, many things have also been made after him, and don't be surprised if you find many references to him in other shows, movies, etc.
Apparently the filmmakers felt this gave them license to produce scene after scene of random, unrelated material with twisting camera angles and the characters moving from a somewhat solid, real atmosphere to a whirling dream world where everything spells disaster.
Don't get me wrong, it's a "think about it after the movie is over" ending and I did but I really wish they would have ended it a bit better.
Well, after 30 minutes of that, it becomes pretty annoying and tedious.
The psychiatrist visits weren't real, just like none of the life after the accident was real.
My interpretation of the story is very simple: after finding her beloved husband cheating her with the nanny of their children, Danika becomes an insecure, stressed and overprotective mother, affecting her professional life.
This situation is very clear when Randy tells that she cannot forget and forgive him, after the incident with the police.
One bit of advice for those people reading this review after watching the movie and not understanding it: go back and look >closely<, this time, to the items in the shopping cart at the end.
Obviously, it ends up getting tedious after a a while.
Everyone in the theatre sat frozen in their chairs long after the lights came on after the movie.
Of interest is the way that the love story remains a mystery to all the other characters in the story and, how after the sad events of the movie, the characters remain in silence about the true nature of our protagonists relationship.
this is one of those movies that you'll enjoy in a night after a long day of boring life.
He just had to show up at work the day after the funeral as if everything were fine.
There is Aya who also loves Jagger and in turn is sought after by others in the tiny force.
I was a little hesitant to rent this movie after seeing "Trembling Before G-D", which was a real eye-opener to me.
Jagger (named after Mick Jagger cause he's a bit of a rock star himself) is the more flamboyant, vivid, playful and childish one Â he's romantic, he is a dreamer, he makes plans for his future with Yossi and wants a love like in a Hollywood movie.
He lived on to age 85, only passing in 1994, but never made the transition to "adult" leads and after the minor role of an Amputee in the 1939 blockbuster, GONE WITH THE WIND, only made one more minor film during WWII, and called it a career.
Eugene O'Neill remains, some fifty two years after his death and some eighty seven since his first plays appeared on stage, America's greatest dramatist.
It is only after I'd experienced a host of better potables that I become an adequate judge of real quality.
But I had to give up after about 36 minutes of this.
Why did he end up back with Norma on that fateful night after her suicide attempt ?
The relationship is after all a romance and to be credible as long-term there has to be the spark that it is mutually enjoyable.
The stories about the decline of Mary Pickford, Mae West and Pola Negri to play the part of Norma Desmond, the mysterious beginning of the movie, that, after a disastrous preview, was cut and vanished forever (rumours have it, that Billy Wilder himself had a copy of it, but refused to screen it because the experience was too painful for him).
To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again.
Even more so when, after intermission, the second act began with her character giving a Q&A session at the local Rotary Club.
Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this still-stunning-looking yet down-to-earth "young fellow" -- over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.
She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about.
Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film.
They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status.
Shortly after her arrival an old nemesis who goes by the name of Jack of All Trades, a vicious serial killer who has an obsession with Sam, starts going after her and the ones she cares for.
The presence of Indira Varma kept me watching a little longer until I was forced to hit the fast-forward button after about half an hour.
If you are after a movie with humour, a touch of romance, and a new twist on the hero undercover cop, then this is the movie.
Liam Neesom plays an undercover cop with a failing digestive system after coming too close to death following his last assignment.
The ending threw me off as being very far-fetched, but Hollywood will do that in order to get a "happily ever after" ending.
Surprisingly enough, I watched Gun Shy again with friends after watching Analyze This, and I still enjoyed it.
Okay, everyone just getting up and dusting themselves off after launching a mini-nuke into their kid-infested base was unrealistic and could have been portrayed better.
Fulvio (Oliver Platt) comes home after a particularly stressful confrontation and enters the dingy, cluttered kitchen of the home he shares with his wife, Gloria.
If you're like me, and you're tired of seeing the same old crap come out of Hollywood year after year, add this movie to your watch list.
She has to decide, if her superficial carnal pleasures are worth it after all.
Especially after her husband threatens to walk out on her, when he gets fed-up with Viva's excessive sexual shenanigans.
Of course the pleasure can't last, as the heroine does go on a journey after all.
Big Show wins after a Chokeslam on Mysterio for the win.
Theodore Long tries to interfere at some times, Jazz gets the win after what looks like a Gory Powerbomb sort of move.
Anyways Sean 'O' Haire gets the win after a finishing move {Which looks like an F-U but you toss them backwards from your shoulders}.
Val as the referee tries to help the Dudley Boys after low blowing Kane but to no avail gets Chokeslammed by Kane for his troubles.
Kane & RVD win after a Chokeslam, followed by a Five Star Frog Splash on D-Von {Another referee came to the match} to retain their World Tag Team titles.
Goldberg gets the great win against Rock after a Spear followed by a Jackhammer to get the win.
The Next match featured the much smaller Rey Mysterio facing off against the MUCH larger Big Show,the match quickly took it's pace.Around 4 minutes after the match started it was Big Show who stepped out the winner, after the match was the worst bit Big Show carried a helpless Mysterio who at the time was on a stretcher was slammed straight into the ring post.
The next 6 Man Tag Match featured 6 former World Champions the first team of Booker T, Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash against team 2 Triple H,Ric Flair and Chris Jericho.The match quickly took action as all 6 superstars got involved as fast as they could at the end Triple H (shockingly) pinned Kevin Nash after a pedigree.
After many years from seeing this performance on TV, I purchased the DVD, and after viewing it I had forgotten how amazing and entertaining this concert was.
).Such provoking black jokes you are invited to enjoy one after another.
The more relevant social commentary is the portrayal of women, after they have lost that flush of young love, tend to become disillusioned.
And held together musically by Jaubert's haunting theme melody, which I can still hum in the nostalgia cupboard of my memory fifty years after I first heard it.
With all the negative news about LIza in the past decade or so, some people tend to forget that in the two decades after CABARET Liza was indeed a superstar of the first magnitude - if her movie career never really took off (remember duds like LUCKY LADY and A MATTER OF TIME?
And yet, after all those viewings, I didn't realize the important lessons it teaches.
i enjoyed reading the books more than watching the same tired old animation by rankin bass...fine for kiddies but still below par animation...why they went back to this low grade animation after ralph bakshis fantastic animation in the lord of the rings beats me.
This movie will always come last with a great distance after all the other adaptations ever made of Tolkien's work.
It was one atrocious scene after another.
This film in particular was very sought after in the 1980s, because unlike the other two it was not widely available on video.
Delilah gives Beatrice Pullman (Colbert) her family's, passed-down-for-generations secret pancake recipe after just telling her she would take it to her grave.
Not only do they drag the viewer through the initial festering dialog, they feel the need to recap nearly every "plot point" several times immediately after.
Claudette Colbert plays a widowed mother trying to run her husbands business after his death.
Contract Player Alert: Warren William joins Claudette on screen again after playing Caesar in DeMille's Cleopatra.
**SPOILER ALERT**Other dramas develop as Bea's daughter Jessie falls for Steve who is after Bea.
It was said that Ms. Colbert had the best figure on the Paramount lot -- not lost on Universal, which dressed her to the nines in scene after scene.
She made both movies on loan to other studios after Paramount suspended her!
Thirty years later, her career is revived after another divorce and health problems.
Some of the highlights include Gene Wilder's incredibly long reaction shot after a Shepherd informs him that he has fallen in love with one of the sheep from his flock.
The movie opens with a pretty funny skit, but after that, most of the other skits fall flat.
The sketches are hit and miss but the ones that hit are brilliant and will have you laughing long after the film has ended.
Many of the sketches are too long and "peter" out, but ALL of them have very funny jokes and insight, but two of the sketches are classics and are as funny as anything Allen ever wrote: Gene Wilder's bit where he plays a man who is destroyed after a certain "fetish" is introduced into his life and the last sketch, where they show the inside controls of a man's body as he gets ready to have sex with a date: Burt Reynolds and Tony Randall help run the master control room.
I noticed a sign somewhere that said it was called Bay City, but after a thirty seconds of Google, I couldn't find out if Bay City, CA was real or not.
The helicopter tumbling after our "heroes" looks animated - and "glued" in.
Made more than 10 years after Predator, the effects are actually worse.
after 15 years of painful waiting period for the new Real Rajko Grlic's movie, I saw Karaula last night and I was so sad and disappointed...
I liked the fact that they focused on Bambi and his father, after his mother dies, and the story itself was very sweet and well crafted.
It explains what happens between after Bambi's mother's death and before he grows up, and focuses on Bambi and his father, The Great Prince Of The Forest.
It's an intoxicating feeling when a movie excites and enlivens us like this -- and there's a particular giddiness to be had in thinking about what movies can (but don't often) do for one's soul after imbibing such a fine vintage!
What happened after Bambi met his father in that heavy snowfall and before the spring he shook owls tree scratching his antlers?
Why was the dancing on clouds moment after meeting Faline ruined by some buck challenging Bambi.
Rondo, as far as I could tell was never named in Bambi, but the fight between him and Bambi makes more sense after the sequel.
Bambi's father takes care of him now, after the death of Bambi's mother.
I like that the story is not of Bambi's son but goes back to right after Bambi's mom dies and follows his transition at that time.
I bought the 2nd movie the day after it came out for my two brothers who are 7 and 10.. and they loved it!
Especially after the let down of Little Mermaid II and Cinderella II.
However, after I had seen Bambi 2, I found that it was an enchanting, funny and warm movie, it is definitely one of the fewest best sequels came from the original one.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
(8) When production company is purchased by a foreign concern (the British-based TVS Corporation) that can't manage the company effectively, budget to continue producing series will begin to dwindle after seven years.
Larry, Daryl & Daryl even got jobs doing commercials after this show went off, they became so famous.
Kirk, the neighbor, who chases after Leslie, operates the Minute Man Cafe and doesn't know much about the restaurant business.
Then pray that Tarantino + the other judges had a very pleasurable time as regards their leisure pursuits just before & just after the movie's screening.
One of the "sweded" films in Be Kind Rewind, this starts out as a ripoff of King Kong, then switches to a Tarzan movie as Johnny (Danny Lee) discovers Samantha (Evelyne Kraft), an absolutely gorgeous babe that was raised by The Peking Man after her parents died in a plane crash.
You can imagine the carnage as The Peking Man becomes Godzilla-like after he sees Samantha being raped (not really, it's PG-13).
Then suddenly one night, after a particularly tender moment between the two lovers, Tong walks away into the darkness of an open road, while Keng returns to his post in the jungle.
There's a Scottish legend called Tam Lin (one of my favorites), long story short, a woman falls in love with a faerie, and discovers he used to be a man, but made a deal with the faeries to serve them if they spared his life, after an accident.
A scene in which Keng mouths Tong's hand after he had urinated and Tong returns the favor with equal passion advances the sexual nature of their relationship but it is not consummated.
I could not even sit through the entire movie and walked away after an hour or so feeling completely wasted.
watch out for tons of movie errors including this:  Continuity: At the gas station, after the cop's car gets shot, it shows the car having a flat tire.
However, after watching it I'm not sure if it was meant to be an action-comedy like Rush Hour(which I truly think they weren't going for).
after 5 more explosions and much more crappy acting later, he beats him up and the whole place blows up with a huge explosion....he dives in for his wife....who is obviously dead at this point, brings her up, and saves her somehow....and in an ironic twist, john tritan says to his wife "shoulda gone to da beach" ohohohoh, hilarity ensued.
Later on, a group of diamond thieves who are trying to evade the authorities after their latest heist kidnap Triton's wife.
Triton decides to do the usual in a dumb action flick; he decides to go after them and take the law into his own hands.
And towards the end when Triton surely kills Rome in the blast, then after reviving his wife, Rome suddenly rises again with severe burns and then Triton kills him for good, VERY VERY B movie, if you ask me.
The dubbing sometimes comes after their mouths have stopped moving.
...Well, after I added this flame, I suppose there will be 'nuff lines to finally display my modest comment on the movie.)
A teacher then goes after the lost girls.
The movie is directed very well (Peter Weir) and is eerie at times, but it really loses intrigue after the half way mark.
Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk.
'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system'   'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time'  'but it's not going after software, it's killing people'  watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
If that's all you need then tune in, but when it first aired in America, few did, and it ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005-06 season Â and was then dropped after eight episodes.
The dog ended up having to be shot after contracting rabies because.
Old Yeller died after protecting his family.
I oh so wanted to see this film desperately after seeing the awesome trailer for it.
THAT was truly gaga, but soon lame musical number after lame musical number envelops what good that does and makes this an AWFULLY uncomfortable sit through.
However, it is an interesting short to watch, just in terms of where it fits in his filmography, especially so soon after "Punch-Drunk Love".
This is simply just PTA and Sandler screwing around with a free set after filming PDL, so I doubt any real thought went into this, so please don't expect "Magnolia" or "Boogie Nights" or anything, just expect a stupid, retard Sandler style short that will leave you confussed, laughing, and saying out loud "What the F***?
Mighty Peking Man was done in the seventies after the last Godzilla film of the original Godzilla series (Terror of Mechagodzilla, 1975) and this totally takes up the slack.
Memorable bits include a sick-o nightmare sequence with Lindt being pinned down by four women and raped with a wine bottle and the finale, where someone in the cast ends up a gory mess after being chopped up with a meat cleaver.
I sure hope that some other video company releases the film after some restoration work--it was interesting and I really wanted to finish it, but couldn't because the print was THAT bad.
When he's assigned to stand watch over the horses, it's entirely predictable he'll run afoul of horse thieves (after being left bloodied and horseless by the scurrilous gang, boss Bush of course blames the naive kid, not himself for neglecting to get an experienced cowboy on the post).
A trail boss that lets his men get close to a shootout between themselves and lets a green kid take the night watch alone after just losing four men to rustlers?
The settlers the men died for don't even have the decency to bury them and then the final straw was the kid throwing his gun away after the burial.
I really felt lead on after sitting thru this movie.
A college student (Lou Taylor Pucci) loses his scholarship after his roommate (John Hensley) throws a party that gets busted.
So, there is also some kind of mysterious body-switching guardian who goes after whoever has the talisman to kill, maim, hurt, whatever.
I quickly fell asleep there after.
It's a journey of 4 troubled teens that ends up in the destruction of them all after I guess the climax, which was a shoot out at a school.
Still after all these years watching this movie again and again I still can barely believe it's norwegian!
With speech after speech about right and wrong, the worst element of the film is the ending, as a judge hits us over the head with a moralistic sledgehammer.
One of the girls, after being blasted with a shotgun, announces, "It wasn't supposed to be like this," before lying down gently with no visible signs of damage whatsoever.
It sounds like it might be a cool horror film but it wasn't.A few good scenes early in the films were pretty cool.Rance Howard and Gary Busey played a couple of weirdo local yokels but they were used too little and never seen again after these early scenes.Why Im not sure,cause none of the youngsters in this film were good actors at all.They were a dull and uninspired bunch.Mario Lopez was really really bad.I mean really bad.
A shame, really, because the premise is solid enoughÂhulking maniac Jeremiah has spent thirty three years hiding under the floor of his cabin after witnessing the rape and murder of his mother by rednecks, and now kills anyone else who should stumble across his homeÂand although not great actors by any stretch of the imagination, the cast are likable enough.
And after he almost loose the race because of the engine trouble he suddenly got the machine together and wins the race in the last second.
We hear a gunshot when a survivor of the army meets group B and group A run towards the camera after hearing it and claiming "we're saved".
The director, Ernest B. Schoedsack, is the very same Schoedsack who directed the original King Kong way back in 1933, but after a series of similar adventure films in the 1930s, he had been inactive for nearly a decade before getting involved here.
Aside of Guttenberg's horrible acting rip-off of Murray's character from Stripes, Police Academy has some funny moments, but after the sequel it just got horrible.
Having her become his evil accomplice wasn't a bad idea, but what sank this film was by having Manchu killed soon after this.
I was eager to see more of her work, and knew that she'd made several silent films in Hollywood during the '20s and a number of talkies there in the '30s, after she'd returned from Europe.
THE BLACK CAT is directed by Derio Argento and tells the tale of a crime photographer(Harvey Keitel), who is haunted by cats after himself being involved with a murder.
Please, do not compare with Chaplin's "The great Dictator" (1940) ... that was conceived and produced DURING the WWII and not 57 years after!  
There's a moment of the movie when Benigni manages to reach the lowest Â an endeavour you had thought not possible after one hour and a half of the previous ordeal Â it is when he, very underhandedly, provides the viewers with a thick mist in order to veil, that is to hide, a pile of corpses of prisoners murdered by the Nazis.
SEALs-to-be go through such a rigorous training that it seems hardly likely that Del Piso would have sufficient energy after daily training to pursue any woman let alone the captain's wife.
Having her parade around like a show pony in one cutesy outfit after another is just laughable in light of the subject matter.
At first, I thought it might be interesting, but after the rather hard-to-follow introduction, it just kept going down in my view.
Richard Chamberlain is back as Adventurer Allan Quatermain, this time he along with lover Jesse (Sharon Stone) are back in the wilds of Africa searching for his long lost Brother after he disappears seeking a lost white race.
The 'recupero,' as the Italian film industry dubbed it, was one of the most forlornly hopeful forms of film-making: offsetting part of the cost of the film you wanted to make by filming another on the cheap back-to-back with as many of the same cast, crew and locations as possible in the hope that at least one of them would be a hit even though just about the only recorded case of that ever happening was when Il Magnifico Straniero, shot back-to-back with Bullets Don't Argue to 'use up waste materials,' became a surprise hit after changing its title to Fistful of Dollars.
Much loved by exploitation merchants, it was no surprise that Cannon films would adopt the practice, especially after their two back-to-back Missing in Action pictures proved surprisingly profitable.
While H. Rider Haggard wrote enough unfilmed Allan Quatermain novels to keep a franchise running for a decade, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold is one of those films that's so bad it's just bad, making you glad they called it a day after this one.
But if your looking for an old-fashioned adventure romp, even like those in the same league as its predecessor KING SOLOMON'S MINES, your find yourself yawning after the first "action" scene unfolds.
Isaac Hayes seems to be cast only for the joke of being billed as "The Chef," and then disappears after three short scenes.
However, there he is, in scene after scene, in filthy clothing, telling people that their ass stinks, and then throwing himself pity parties because the other kids don't like him.
Oh and no prizes for guessing who Angela is after the fist 10 minutes.
i paid $19.96 for this piece of garbage, and after having seen it i wouldn't go through the trouble of picking it up if i saw it on the side of the road.
I'm guessing I'm not the only fan of the original film who ended up being actually furious after seeing such a horror classic being disrespected.
The head counselor over the Camp has his head caught in a cage after awakening from a hammer blow to the head, tied, with rats to feed through his face, shown gnawing within his torso.
One pot-smoking slacker is burned alive after being force-fed gasoline, with his stomach exploding.
WE have a sheriff often popping up after murders take place trying to keep everyone civil as a killer is on the loose.
We rented Vulgar after seeing the trailer.
A Prod and a Catholic become best of mates, launch a franchise, some antics ensue, and in the end we can all laugh happily ever after.
So after the first half-hour, An Everlasting Piece runs out of steam and attempts to reach the finish line with smoke and noise.
In fact, after watching this poorly crafted sequel, I have a bit more respect for the original.
In one scene, a character said, "They're all looking for their 15 minutes," an apparent reference to a statement by Andy Warhol made in 1968, three years after the time of the statement in the movie.
The time of Detective Riley's first appearance in the movie was identified as March 1965, slightly more than a year after the Beatles first appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, shocking most adults with their not-quite-shoulder-length hair.
Introduction/Characters  I rented this film after enjoying Owen Wilson's comedy work in such films as Shanghai Noon and the Royal Tennenbaums.
From awkward glances at each other while waiting in line for movie tickets with their respective dates to a "nervewrecking" scene of Dave struggling to call Rafi after looking her up in the phone book.)
Were it not for Meryl Streep playing the quintessential Jewish Mother (reminded me of my Grandmother) I probably would have turned it off after the first 3 hours.
Here's a young doctor madly in love with the older woman playwright, has seen all her plays and absolutely worships her, is kind, considerate and fresh (vs jarringly jaded), but the older woman just hankers after moronic old Jack who treats her incredibly badly.
It is a cultural phenomenon in Norway that is just as popular 30 years after its arrival, which was proved by the video game based on the film that became the biggest selling video game of all time in Norway: 25 years after the films debut.
There's Ms. Puke-face who dates Mr. Lays-all-the-chicks who falls for Ms. Post-Meno-Mom, but wait Ms. Puke-face bows out so that the two STARS can romance each other and then along comes Dr. Do-right who ALSO bows out (talk about a non-Alpha-male type) in Paris (no less) so the Geritol-set couple can finally after two tedious hours ... who cares?
An example being the sequence at the girls house after the first date to the bar, which was rather lame as far as the story and especially the acting goes.
I just can't accept it especially the decision was made rightly after the lose of fight, and before which, they robbed a pretty girl.
I really shouldn't be complaining though, it was free after all...
A "friend" brought it over after work and it was so awful we zoned out after 30 minutes and started talking.Lets just say the conversation we had would have made a much better film but thats not to be repeated here as children may read.
I thought the film would be good first 10 minutes in but after that it became more and more painfully obvious this one was going to blow.
I often thought of making my own movie, but after watching 'Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj' I can confidently say I have seen this art at perfection and cannot hope to improve upon it.
Baby-faced comic Ryan Reynolds channeled Chevy Chase in "Van Wilder," but the eponymous hero graduated from Coolidge College after seven year of lolly gagging.
Imagine, for a moment a giant staircase where you must look at travel brochures of London or slides of a dog show for five minutes after which time you are forced to jump onto the next step and land squarely on your head.
He had at least moderate buzz going for him after a string of decent performances, and then releases this nonsense.
There were really memorable moments, like the one where a bunch of people puke after riding a ride turned nightmare (actually, they were puking over being extras for this movie).
6) You want 2 be a director and after watching this movie you have hope that if this piece of crap makes it , U have a better chance.
Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!!
The whimsical and bouncy nature of "Bad Guys Get the Money" forms a stark contrast to the dramatic almost nerve-biting "Realistic Battle on Top of a Roller Coaster Track", a technique that bands like Radiohead and Smash Mouth began to employ many years after.
It still amazes me that this could have been printed, honestly, the movie is just one stupid gag after another, one's we have already seen and are tired of.
Victor Wong (let me return to a bright light for a moment) died after this film.
after seeing 3 ninjas kick back and 3 ninjas knuckle up i wasn't expecting 3 ninjas high noon to be that good, since the 2 preceding ones weren't' that great.
so finally, 8 years after the release i rent 3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain....where shall i begin.
My kids told me we needed to go to Burger King and get them (after the fact, of course)...since I don't watch the Nickolodeon ads, I didn't know this.
Eventually all characters are brought together, after some small moments of adventure, and they do manage to sort everything out.
okay this is a very funny show i remember when i first saw it i could not stop laughing but i after a while i had hear all the jokes and it was starting to get lame.
People are after her.
Upon return to LA after a disappointing experience on the East Coast, tables turn and surprises arise.
Eternity and a Day (the director really knew what he meant) is an art-house movie made after an infallible recipe to win critical acclaim and eventually those great prizes of the broken hearted that will never make a blockbuster.
The ingredients of the recipe are quite simple: you take a famous actor that already stared in a few cult/art movies, namely Bruno Ganz and have him play after a script written by a famous screenwriter who was behind many successful art movies, namely Tonino Guerra and add the name of a famous director already acclaimed as a master on the whole thing and you have...this.
This was the responsibility of T. Guerra, a name that I have come to hate because, even if I agree that La Notte was a masterpiece and L'Aventura comes pretty close, I see them mostly as the result of Antonioni's vision, and Guerra's later projects convinced me he wasn't much of a screenwriter after all.
The monkey informs his father (an unattractive reimagining of Gruesome the Gorilla from McKimson's previous 'Gorilla My Dreams'), who comes after Bugs in search of retribution.
I really enjoy them... =) I almost felt sick after the opening scene... Who wants to se a girl loose all her legs and still keep on running?
This movie was just lame on every level.The lead actor was as weak as water.The story was suppose to be disturbing, with urban "street smarts", and it reminded me more of a cross between an "after school special" and a Lifetime movie, but with some horribly delivered and unconvincing mature language.The plot was suppose to be a loosely based "true to life" story about a juvenile sent to an adult facility, and the hardships he endured, with rape scenes that I guess were meant to be disturbing.
First I will admit, I did not watch the whole mini-series all the way through and jumped around bit after the first part because I was so disappointed.
I will also add that I've read the books a few times, so my expectations were probably high, especially after Lord of the Rings.
Before I give my comments on the mini-series, after reading the various comments from other viewers, I'm convinced the standards of viewers have dropped and the shallowness of the average viewer cannot be overestimated.
I saw this mini series a couple of years ago after searching on the internet and found this film adaptation from Canada (I live in England) and I though 'great' so I bittor... err... obtained a copy and watched it all - I'm not sure how - in abject horror.
In the last shot (check it, tivoers) after the hero and heroine kiss for no good reason (spontaneous horniness brought on by increased universal harmony presumably causing all nearby to pair up and go at it) the soldiers surrounding the temple suddenly start to hug each other for no apparent reason.
Cut to a few minutes later after a cheeze chase scene that looked like a crowd had found something strange and was moving cautiously towards it.
Oops, must have wanted to live after all...
The conclusion (after the climax) was about all of two minutes long.
Glover mails in his lines, Ashmore fails to achieve the depth of character necessary to make the audience feel the change before and after the incident on Roke Knoll, Calvert turns Kossil into another tiresome scheming vixen; Roche at least has fun with the only role with no counterpart in the novels, and he hams it up royally.
Even my husband, who is not a fan of the books, didn't want to keep watching it (we tuned out after about 45 minutes and then looked in twice more for about two minutes each), purely because the script was so wooden (oh, for the lyricism of Le Guin's original prose!)
But after a while it just puts you to sleep.
I am in the movie and I have only seen 20min's of it(basically just after I get killed off)  I have to say that the acting may seem wooden tho I have to say I don't think my acting was wooden, bad yes but I had emotion!
One of the few movies I was tempted to leave after the first twenty minutes.
The female characters are either weak (the woman who won't let go of the boyfriend who shot and killed her, then continues to hunt and hurt her after she's dead) or absurdly strong (the character that refers to men needing to grow a pair, prove their manliness by killing, etc).
Look what he did with "School of Rock" after all.
Then you basically find out after reading the reviews on here that the movie is not what you expected it to be.
Its just drug use after abusive situation after drug use all twisted up in a largely boring cafe.
If written by a woman, Hope (heather graham) would've reached for her pepper spray after Will's (Jeremy Sisto) initial pick up line.
The book was written, after all, by an American...
The stooges are launched into space, land on a distant planet and (after the usual stooge shennanigans, save the world from alien zombies (a young dan "hoss" blocker") The only reason i give this movie a 1 is because that is as low as the ratings go.
This film is characteristic of the type of films Ernst Lubitsch made in Germany after he stopped making exuberant, although (from what I've seen) hit or miss, comedies and started making vehicles for Pola Negri.
Olvier Gruner stars as J269 a robot who becomes the target of a group of mercenaries sent to destroy him after he kills a man trying to rape Nora Rochester (Daphne Ashbrook), fearing bad press Goddard Marx orders the machine dead in this well made yet very routine rip off of Robocop and The Terminator.
In B.E.II, he dumps her after 2 weeks and swears never to go out with an American woman again.
They run afoul of a local brat after feeding his grandfather acid (oh, it was his sister that they molested earlier by the by).
after 45 minutes it just gets mighty boring as it is completely random and pointless.
As a read this might have been more interesting, but after watching the movie, I don't feel the need for more ... "torture"
At first, she seems like the perfect older mentor for robin, as she enjoys spending time with her after school and showing her how to bake and do other rather useful things.
This movie is Jewish propaganda and it's trash, I felt like hugging Jews after i saw this movie.
The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was "How is this possible that 'The Believer' actually won a price at the Sundance Filmfestival????"
after a very quick cut to a scene somewhere else with the same characters.
Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!!
Okay, there's this explanation of banishment when he was a child, but I just don't see how you can choose for being a skinhead after that.
This movie fails miserably on this crucial point, that alone should keep it from 5 stars, but of course, there is much more:  OK, so after going into a synagogue, this violent Nazi who has no qualms about beating up Jewish kids, setting up bombs in synagogoes to kill dozens of Jews, has the uncontrollable urge to protect the Torah from his friends and other religous properties?
Better ask the 5 star reviewers, the fanatics in this website all these questions, because after watching the movie I can provide you with none.
Why Danny showed no anger/emotion at Phoenix or Zane when he saw them making love, the make out scene the day after , right when Danny just threw up, what exactly makes Danny so incredibly valuable to Zane and the fascists, Zane's laughable hairpiece, etc etc etc.
It's evident after to watch this movie, that we can conclude actor/actress don't make movie just for fun but to win money to pay their "Kingdom", their Mercedes, their swimming pool, etc.
And after seeing him in that one you just cannot take his whole 'respect my Arabian authority'-thing in DESERT LAW serious.
At one time, after a dialogue is finished, the camera stays focused extreeeeemely long on a guy's face instead of cutting away to the next scene.
And what's worse: after that, in some sort of epilogue, we find out that sissy-boy Elliot Gould was a traitor.
the movie was actually that bad.....Yes it is one of the worst movie ever it is non horror at all , should be a thriller of a low grade and never be made as horror at all .True that the plot start promising but i just lost all interest after 29 minute of hardly trying to keep my eyes open ....why you ask >>>well thats a Thai movie who tries to capture a phenomena that happen to turn it to supernatural base it is purely cultural which is OK an all but the movie have set Zero effort to place any fear There is suspense I give u that but overall the film could have been made into a much better film and in my own review i say the idea is great but the display is very very poor just give it try when u have time to kill and u are Bored so just by then knock yourself out lol
All the gimmicks like lip syncing wear out their welcome after two or three repetitions.
Suddenly, she is on scene as a widow, and after Cole (Ed Harris) asks her if she is a whore, the two plan a house together.
While it is true that the film takes place in the territory of New Mexico, 40 years before statehood was achieved in 1912, the only thing we might remember Arthur for is becoming president after Garfield was assassinated.
The thing that ruined this film was the "love interest" subplot and the fact that Cole was fool enough to keep trying to make a life with the woman even after he saw her cheat and knew she would do so again and again and again.
This movie was so boring and so lame and annoying and filled with clichÃ©s that my friend and I, ended up fast forwarding after we had seen about 30 minutes.
I am a Filipino and proud to be one but after watching a movie like this I felt so little.
That all changed after I saw feardots**t. This movie is so incredibly bad that i felt obligated to warn others.
I got tired of hearing that terrorist on the other end of the phone line after about 10 minutes too.
But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself, the movie starts to go downhill.
(though I don't think that there's anything to spoil here...)   I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie off after the first 20 minutes or so.
If your computer explodes after viewing the site, why didn't the computer expert girl's computer explode?
Well, they all died 48 hours after logging into the site FEARDOTCOM.COM....yes, it's feardotcom.COM  Sounds like the ring eh, well it is and it isn't, because with the Ring, you get more into the reasoning behind the video tape, in this movie you have some guy filming himself killing people, then people die from their worst fear after going to feardotcom....sorry feardotcom.com.
People die after seeing web-site.
People die after seeing a video.
Only, the videotape has been replaced by an internet website and the poor victims have only 2 days left to live after being exposed instead of 7.
(but just for grins they (the unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds, and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up connection.
Catherine takes a lover, bears a child, plots against her husband and deposes him after he has reigned only six months.
I'd go on about the plot or the performances, but it's just one contrivance after another that leaves the viewer frustrated and angry at the characters (ALL of them) not to mention the director.
So the female hero immediately chases after him herself, her only lead stupidly helps her without meaning to, and she successfully tracks him down within 24 hours.
I stopped this movie after the police paid a visit.
I almost gave up on it after the nauseating Ballgame scenes, but I became a little more interested when the plot picked up after Daryl is taken away by the government scientists.
The whole charade can be simplified, if the terrorist take the money from him after closing the bank account.
The film should've been called "Australian Story" to make more sense of the lopsided and biased view of what the Aussies perceive to be the strange cultural behaviour of the Japanese - after all, the whole film depends upon a Western view of the woman looking at this strange man from the Far East who seem to have no cause or reason to be wandering about the Outback other than the fact that he can.
For Collette's character to give in to his demands so easily after having said her piece about not going out there, and then to complain about what he did to them out there, and then not to explain why she even has this job and what it really means - might have been a much more interesting film if the Japanese guy had to find his own way around, and had met a strange woman in the desert with whom he plays, instead of having this geologist lead the way.
It was only after I did some research on-line and read other reviews, that someone said it's dangerous to dive head first into a "billabong."
It didn't make sense.... after they do it while she wears his pants, she asks to get her things back from his room.
That character just dies awkwardly after diving into a shallow pond head first while the story was a positive note.
My nephew nearly fell asleep and never again mentioned the movie after we left, after days of anticipation.
During (and after) watching the movie, I was much appalled by the Hollywood stereotype of Texans (we talk like hicks, rednecks, trailer trash, uneducated idiots)....
Sorbo plays Nick, a sheriff returning home looking for vengeance after some local thug kills his father.
I have absolutely no rush in watching the third movie after this kind of crap.
It seems that Charlie took a revolver that he recovered from the gas station after it blew up and gave it to Detective Pete Michaels of the Dallas PD to run a ballistics test on it.
My brother, who is in the film trade in Hollywood, told me Bullock had fired her manager or agent, after drawing lots of attention for a few successful roles.
I hate those movie reviews that really hang it heavy on the movie in question, but after just spending the last 100 minutes of my life watching The Legend of Lucy Keyes, I can't help but think I've been seriously ripped off and am about to do some serious hanging!
But after a very brief promising few minutes at the start, for me, this movie just became more and more predictable and ridiculous.
Ooooh, and don't they love being in front of the camera, strutting around, talking, nursing their wounds (of uncertain origin - was it a tiny shark bite, after all?
They're after the shark-killers, overfishing sharks in equatorial Pacific for their fins, brutally slicing off the fins and often discarding the bodies (which makes me wonder how some of that footage was made, were the filmmakers actually aboard one of those boats, filming the definning process, without bothering to intervene?).
I can only figure that they were in too much of a hurry to use a tripod, because the constant blur does't add anything to the dramatic impact of the film after the first few minutes.
I watched this because of the high rating on IMDb; shortly after it started I realized that all those good reviews were no doubt done by him.
Don't get me wrong, I am all for saving this planet, and I agree, eradicating animal species one after another is unacceptable.
Shortly after his arrival in Manilla, a phone rings in his backpack.
A little more serious problem is that after its climax the film loses some steam moving towards the denouement, but overall the screenwriting sisters have produced an entertaining film that speaks with authority on its subject.
Four siblings are locked in the northern wing of their grandparents' house by their selfish mother and sadistic grandmother after the death of their father has left the family in debt.
Though perhaps that's because I originally bought the movie tie-in copy of the book, and the kids on the cover were modeled after the actors.
The story is like this: after their father dies accidentally, Corrine, the mother, takes pre-pubertal Chris, Cathy and little twins Cory and Carrie to her own wealthy parents hoping she would inherit from his dying father.
The film adequately succeeds in laying the groundwork for a promising and clever finish (after a simple plot twist in the middle of the film).
Ella Raines and Helen Walker did a good job, though I think Ella's character should have gotten stronger and nastier after she found out that her husband was alive and her lover was dead.
So, after flying across the Pacific, stopping over in Taipei and then landing in the Philippines, Adam is perplexed when his mother does not meet him at the airport.
Most of the time the cell phone tormentor is speaking Tagalog, or a mixture of Tagalog and English, and the subtitles for that seem to fly by ... meaning, once again, that it is impossible to grasp the size of the problem facing Adam ... because we know after the first four times that the caller says he is going to kill the mother and the sister that this is a bad hombre.
She is joined by (Glendon)Sean Penn who helps her to get the jewels and avoid the sneaky Walter Faraday(played by Paul Freeman) who is after them and the jewels.He is disguised as an old man whom Gloria thinks is just a storekeeper.Most of the action is corny , the acting bad ,poor writing but you can't blame it all on the writers.Casting Madonna as a virginal missionary and Sean Penn in an Indiana Jones type role was pure idiocy.
How did Sean Penn go on to have a successful career after this film?
In the mean time, they are being chased by a corrupt official with prosthetic hands (He lost his real hands from opening a booby trapped money belt called a "shanghai surprise", which is what the movie is supposedly named after.
The plot is absolutely ridiculous -- Madonna and Sean Penn chasing after a mysterious cargo of opium known as "Faraday's Flowers" (incidentally, the name of the book this movie is based on) must run from a Chinese gangster with porcelain hands, have a romantic interlude with an Imperial concubine, teach baseball skills to another Chinese gangster, and (boy, aren't we surprised) sleep together to seal a deal.
I saw this movie on DVD after it was given away free with the Sunday Times.
Rigaud is also an important evil element among the Dorrits abroad, where he teams up with the dissipated Henry Gowan - who is also, sadly, never seen again in this film after he marries Pet.
I saw Alien and Aliens when I was little and they scared the hell out of me with their originality of the aliens, along with the feeling that you have been brutalized after you have seen them.
The characters run around, they don't know where they're going, we don't know where they're going and after about 20 minutes of this you lose interest altogether and just pray for a good ending, sorry not in this one.
When I first watched this short, I actually was enjoying the new footage and when I saw the reused footage, I was quite dissapointed and when I saw reused footage from another episode, I was even more dissapointed and I think this short is only worth for the first 5-6 minutes and I understand that Curly was ill during this time and I think that Curly was more sick than usual in this short although Curly seemed more healthier in the next two shorts 'Uncivil Warbirds' and 'Three TroubleDoers' although his condition went even more downhill in the two shorts after that.
But then one of the industry's greatest failings is that it takes itself far too seriously, so perhaps it's not so surprising after all.
They should have called this movie "Angry women ride off of a cliff after committing crimes."
The romance that developed between David and Sarah (after she eventually pounded her amorous interests through his idiot skull) was believable enough I guess, but you really had to try hard to get past the idiotic acting and the pathetic dialogue.
will be the question you ask yourself after seeing this film.It contains nothing but boring and pointless dialogue not to forget a pointless movie.I highly suggest you avoid this film , and spare your brain cells.
It's no wonder that Avati went on to make art films after this.
Later , after a gap of 4 years when the child is 4 years old - the Police officer requests them to help the IPS Officers by rendering them their sharp brained services !!
I must say Abhishek and Rani are superb and they make a good on screen pair (after Yuva).
Fire trucks are racing to the professor's own house, which has been engulfed in flames after a freak furnace explosion.
But after only one viewing, it is not clear why loud classical music has to figure twice in the scenario.
Her horrible warbling is exactly what the producers were looking for and back in 1934 it would have gone over quite well at the time--after all, she could sing, though in a style that is so out of style today that many will find the singing quite painful (my ears are still bleeding).
In the end, just like in the campy MacDonald-Eddy operettas, they live happily ever after and the audience is thrilled that the singing is finally completed!
Together in his lair in the forest, Hilda discovers that Stingaree truly does love/lust after her Â he is a man who takes whatever he wants and wants everything, but, as he tells her, "You are as safe here as you wish to be."
Chris Fuller's no-budget experimental film attempts to capture the feelings of anger, unease and loneliness plaguing the youth of St. Petersburg, Florida shortly after a series of race riots.
I just finished watching all 3 seasons and for the most part I thought it was good, season 1 was great, then season 2 introduced the George Hearst situation which after building up for 2 seasons I felt was a really crap finale: I mean Hearst hired 50+ Pinkertons whilst finally getting Mrs Ellsworth to sign over her claim, so Al Swearengen sent off for reinforcements, (Mr Wu's men and Hawkeye's men) but then Hearst just up and left!!!??
Personally, after this train wreck, I refrained from seeing any more of his theatrical releases and stuck to just enjoying his music.
The material was all there, boy bands are such easy targets, ripping out song after song of lost love and crooning over some woman, but drop the ball early on.
I in fact walked out of this after 40 minutes to catch a second screening of Children of Men in the cinema besides, the only thing keeping me from feeling ripped off.
The tag-line of "Population Five" might actually apply to the number of people that may have been left in the cinema by about half-way through the movie after everyone had stood up and departed.....
Of course, "Cavite" takes it one step further by allowing the caller to be a well-known terrorist who not only has Adam's cellphone number but his victim's mother and sister too (after having already executed the father).
Adam, a 32-year-old Filipino security guard from San Diego, must fly home to the Philippines after learning that his father is died.
Thank God this film bombed when it was released; otherwise, who knows how many gay men would have committed suicide or stayed forever in the closet after seeing it?
Charles and Harry clearly detest one another after being together for so long, yet they can't possibly envision their lives without each other.
There is one scene though that I did like where Harrison has gone out and picked up a hustler for the night(lord he must have been hard up ,the blond man he takes home is ugly and certainly not that young).Anyway after humiliating Burton in front of this man by drinking and laughing ,Harrison finally goes too far and Burton backhands him hard against a bookcase causing him to bleed.
It promptly falls flat on its' face after delivering the idea and the only tool it has left is boredom and lack of action as a clumsy attempt at building suspense.
Well.. you will be waiting for half an hour before any skin presents itself and be promptly let down directly after.
I gave it a 4 for the first minute or so of the movie - after that it's probably a 2 or even a 1.
It is, after all, a British comedy, and I kind of expect the British accents.
Well, I was pretty disappointed by this one and also pretty surprised by the ovation it received in the web sites I've been browsing after viewing the movie, and that's the main reason I react here.
What made this film strange was that it began so strongly with a detailed scene about how devoted Dean was to his trade, but after that, it just went further downhill by avoiding details and the classic cop-out "educated guess" technique.
He played the part, but didn't build the character, and after all of it I still had the looming thought that Rydell left me with at the very end Â the "educated guess" which completely debunked the film Â but that is another story.
I LOVE James Dean even though I was born 15 years after his death.
But after having watched this film, what do you really learn about James Dean?
My opinion of this movie has nothing to do with it not being a typical "happy ending" movie where the girl and guy live happily ever after.
- Joyce calls back immediately after seeing Derek's number on caller ID when Stacy and Barb accidentally call her with the computer, then proceeds to leave a message that makes it sound like she calls all the time.
But after all your musings, this film fails to deliver what it aims to give.
What major network news organization would hire a associate producer, of a local market Springer-type show, who walked off the job after demonstrating her treacherous nature on the air?
"Highlights" include the Egyptian who Moses stabs coming out to the scene with the knife visibly already in his belly, all the closeups of Kilmer's gut, a Hebrew apparently having a seizure as Miriam sings "Horns of Jericho", the song Horns of Jericho itself, as that story doesn't even happen until after Moses' death, and the fact that outside of Moses, Ramses, Joshua and Aaron no character's name is ever mentioned, leaving you to guess who is who.
The first ten minutes are shock cinema at its finest, but after that it's a more realistic-than-thou, account of an end of the world scenario.
One can make a point about seeing beauty in everyday "things"...yes, but after an hour and forty minutes of it, all I saw was gray.
The janitor, however, is killed early on after making no serious advancements in the plot.
Eventually, after killing everyone except for the school's punk rock version of MacGyver (who just so happens to have an impromptu love affair with the school nerd while in hiding from their deranged professor), the homeroom teacher takes his own life with very little fanfare, slitting his own throat with a utility knife.
After a few minutes of driving, they demand he stops the truck after seeing blood on his boots.
I think they are thrown out of hell by God after seeing this movie.
Drew is sent to go get gas by himself after losing a match of rock paper scissors.
being the nice guy he is, after he takes some gas, he leaves ten dollars.
after having good ol' fashioned tease loving, the lovebirds see the lights of a car turn on and think it's their good ol' friend drew.
medicine 101. after this starts lover girl's first of fifty million unbearable screams throughout the film.
after 15 minutes, you don't even care.
She's merely on screen, constantly keeping her hair out of her face, belly exposed after scissoring her shirt early in the movie.
watch his reaction after he gets shot in the head.
and in the scene after the 2 girls have their first encounter with farmer brown and knock him out by gently tapping his shoulder with a shovel, they wander BACK into the farm house to... well, i don't really know why... to investigate, i guess... they end up in a bathroom where they find news clippings and blah blah blah.
He just lays down and dies after his hand gets cut off.
I have to wonder if the filmmakers even WATCHED this film after shooting it!
Battle after battle, the ship could have (and should have) started taking on a beat up Millennium Falcon kind of look.
relationships develop out of nowhere (7 0f 9 and chakotay are virtually lovers in season 7 after barely speaking for 4 years) or never change at all.
after the brilliance of the original series and next gen, the darkness of ds9 voyager does what no one else was able to do, kill off star trek.
The animation itself was good, which is why I gave it a two, but after a few minutes the lack of substance made my wish it would end.
Let's put it this way: when it was shown on the cinema, it was a tie between the public, because half of them were children who loved the show, ergo they loved it, and the other half were the parents who went with them, and they probably fell asleep after the first ten minutes.
The movie shows the suffering Mewtwo faced, and what he did after escaping from it.
This movie portrays Mewtwo's encounter with humans for the first time, its reaction when its being controlled and its actions after it escapes.
The comedy includes all the cliches: The teenage rebel (been there, done that), who has a bully after him (ooohhh the originality), and who goes off on teachers who are dumber than him (well, I haven't seen that before.
I must admit that after watching Project Greenlight every Sunday night, I was not expecting much.
So, "The Battle of Shaker Heights" was made and released, and yet again after watching I realized it's still more contrived, fluffy, and safe offerings into the film world.
The cult then is after the niece, trying to kill her and resurrect her into their cult.
This will make a great Holloween Night Film for a spooky party after Mid-Night.
Characters die after being gored (and lots of gore, at that).
The plot dies after being bored.
Here, the director had a chance to redeem himself after a series of flops and turds.
The latter half of the movie is an irredeemable catastrophe, as if even the editor gave up on this movie after the midpoint.
Not long after that did I see production began on this movie and there are striking similarities to my script and this movie...though this movie is much lower quality and has less production value.
ooOoo maybe if i scream every time, even if the monster are not after me, someone will rescue me.. opps i drew the monsters attention.. i wonder why.. let me scream a little more, maybe ill scare it away!"..
Almost immediately after that, the sister seduces our hero and gets him into bed.
But after reading some of the comments on here, I should explain something.
In the meantime after losing his job, Jared Taskin has become a bounty hunter, which is displayed in the hilariously terrible first scene of the movie.
After the fighting is over, the scene abruptly cuts to a sleazy motel room where a man known as Death Touch kills a hooker after having sex with her in an excuse to show nudity.
Next, after a totally random fight scene, Taskin runs off to meet up with Bill who is going to Louis' restaurant and its self-proclaimed "Eat Now, Get Hungry An Hour Later Arena."
In the meantime, Bill drives over to Lee's house after snorting some cocaine for no apparent reason.
Finally, after a long fight, Taskin grabs Bill, turns him around, and lights his jacket on fire (much like Kent Ducanon did to another character in American Streetfighter!).
Bad camera-work and sounds that apparently were all overdubbed in a sound studio after the fact for no apparent reason accent the terrible acting, swiss-cheese plot, and general terrible feel of this movie.
Well, the title says it all; NIck is a sore looser, by some strange and uneventful coincidences, he starts to work in a psychic hospital as clerk/janitor and because of his lack of tact, gets fired after a few minutes.
As a result it plays out like a long snuff movie with one violent death scene after another, until it all comes to a rather dull and sudden ending.
But hey in the end the guy meets a groovy chick and they go to san Francisco and probably live happily ever after in a camper van.
I have had another huge disappointment with the director Eric Rohmer after watching "Le Rayon Vert".
I actually had to start this movie twice because I stopped it at the first try after 15 minutes not being able to concentrate on the "storyline"(there actually is not really much of a storyline to begin with).What I am trying to get across is that this is just not a movie that captures you in the first couple of minutes and also this is definitely not a horror movie.
I've learned only one thing after seeing this movie, about taste you can't discuss.
The retard should have been treated when he first struck but then the movie would have ended half an hour after it started.
When the father is forced to travel to London to solve his financial issues, James insists to look after his mother instead of an expensive nurse.
And leaving the schizophrenic son to hide out in his room, after nearly poisoning his mother to death... no one, not even his father, seem to check up on him, or even know exactly where he had got to.
For stars such as Ann Sheridan and Alexis Smith to have to utter the crap served up to them must have been repulsive to them - while Ann overacts as she has never done before or after.
And Bergman has some hilarious dialogue, like the old lady at the train, comforting Ingeborg when she wakes up after a bad dream:  "You must've eaten something unsuitable.
And although you might think that JLo was in this movie after seeing it, you won't find her anywhere in the movie or in the credits.
Sometimes the characters looked like they were trying to get their lines over with after practicing a dozen times in front of the mirror, other times they were over-acting, it was the typical acting style you see in high-school dramas.
Bob's mother actually tells him that the babysitter may have gone home to see her parents after she is killed; in fact, Bob's parents make a career of ignoring pretty much everything Bob says or does.
In fact, Bob's mother doesn't seem to think it strange at all that a pale, creepy young woman, who doesn't ever, ever speak, materializes from nowhere to look after her son.
Some above-par gore scenes contained in "HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY" would include a man getting his throat torn out and a woman meeting her demise with a screw-driver type implement after she gets her foot stuck in a crack in the floor!
Only one scene stood out for me in this movie and that was when the realtor backs out of the driveway after leading the family to their new home, accidently knocking over a tombstone to which she yells, "DAMN TOMBSTONE!"
This is also just one of the many countless incidents contained in the movie that bare absolutely no relevance whatsoever on the plot, including a scene where Anne is cleaning up a trail of blood off the kitchen floor and an inane second story-line involving a prior occupant of the house who committed suicide after claiming the house was 'possessing' him!
Plus there are about FIVE "going down into the basement" scenes... one right after the other.
I was already rolling my eyes after the third one.
I feel like this horrible film tainted my eyes after watching the first 3, which were full of movie magic.
The final one, after all the tedious agony Pete's gone through to have it occur, is a half-ass job with the body not even deeply/fully buried.
The local animals would have his remains eaten and spread all over the place, assuming of course, that there would be anything edible after all the amateur embalming that has taken place.
Despite having an air of doubt over this film after reading that the director Uwe Boll was given a Razzie award for worst director I decided to watch it.
Corey (promising new star Matt Twining) moves to a new town for a fresh start after a tragic wrestling match leaves his opponent dead.
While the character introductions and subsequent dialogs may strike notes of familiarity to the seasoned connoisseur of cinematic warfare, it's the unfamiliarity of the cast (with Boll regular Michael Pare being the only 'name' actor present) that makes it all stick; the lack of name actors only heightens the suspense, especially after they've earned our sympathy.
But after that, stop the tape.
After that you've got a relatively bad script... after that you've got some minor league talent.
I put this on my list with some decent excitement thinking I was going to get a low budget good indy film and after the first shot of Conrad playing mood to show how lonely he was in front of the TV-- well I knew it was going to end in pain... for me.
The acting is perfunctory at best and there are a few amusing moments, but by and large, after laying out 200 American, you may well be asking for your money back.
I just wanted to cry after watching it and I still do...  BTW - I am gay, so don't start with the anti-gay movie review comments.
Nothing about will shock you like it wants to, after the first victim is swallowed by the CURSE, you'll know every line, every plot point, everything that's going to happen.
A struggling farmer believes God has blessed him when his crops begin to grow substantially after a large meteor lands in his field, dissolving into his soil and water supply after the local doc, Forbes(Cooper Huckabee), pokes a hole in it.
Poor Zack(Wil Wheaton) has to rough it on his own once his mother, Francis(Kathleen Jordon Gregory) becomes "under the weather" and his sister(Amy, Wil's sis) is assaulted by manic chickens, as Nathan(Akins) and his antagonistic jerk son, Cyrus(Malcolm Danare), both even worse after being infected, torment him through insults and harsh treatment..you see he's not their blood(..his mother married Nathan, it seems, because they needed support he could give) which means they feel little pity or affection towards him.
As soon the GIs step down into the dark and narrow corridors, however, they gotta learn the hard way that their enemy is way more accustomed to the unusual surroundings and skilled in the antics of guerrilla warfare than they are and hence it doesn't take long until one GI after the other has to face a merciless death and the defeat of the whole platoon seems almost inevitableÂ In an early interview, Uwe Boll once said that one of his main intents for TUNNEL RATS was to show the absurdity and senselessness of war.
Completely unnecessary "happily ever after" final scene?
There was potential for great tragedy here, and after I saw the film, there were news reports of such slave-prostitution rings involving Eastern European girls run by the mob, being uncovered here and and in New York, so it was a timely subject.
Quite seriously, I wanted to commit suicide after I saw this miserable peice of crud.
In this third and (thank Christ) final installment in the trilogy-the action picks up directly after the events of the equally stupid second film-with Duane spending some time in a rubber-room after trying to sew him and his deformed Siamese twin brother Belial back together.
"Part 3" was even more genuinely needless which didn't seem possible after the first sequel!
after seeing The Forsaken, this is the worst vampire movie so far  
However, after seeing the movie a second time, I grew to appreciate the crazy antics of Ernest and he instantly became one of my favorite movie characters.
The story continues as seven years after the incident, each member of the group gets an invitation to a reunion along with a bunch of cash and is asked to meet at a hotel.
they were a waste of time and should have left after they dropped them off because they were totally out of place.
Seven years after that dreadful, life-ruining evening where a group of sorority babes accidentally killed their newest member (guns aren't toys, ladies!
The story revolves around a group of young women who are invited to a reunion party seven years after a bizarre initiation ceremony at their sorority claimed the life of one of their 'sisters'.
Seven years after a pledge is tragically killed in a sorority initiation rite, five of the other sisters are invited to a remote mansion (modern style, not Gothic) where they face a fight for their lives, "aided" by two horny young men who are trapped with them.
And, after he pushes the guy into the electric fence, where does the dog go and why doesn't he attack anyone else?
Seven years after the pledge's murder, the five remaining sisters are invited to a reunion at an isolated mansion, presided over by an unknown host; two male escorts hang around as the girls get picked off, one by one.
Here, you walk out of the theater, and yes ,there are some intense, memorable scenes that you can't get out of your mind that lingers on days after, but there is no one left alive!
Four sorority girls take a much-needed vacation from the pressures of school (after showering and changing clothes for about ten minutes, of course) and travel to a secluded cabin in the woods with their boyfriends.
For years I been hearing about how original and good is this show, but after watch the first 4 Tv movies I just a found just a few pieces of trash with nothing new except there is anything less science.
I been watching reading science fiction for more than twenty years and after watch this I can only say this has nothing original
But after "Legally Blonde" and this, you might have to re-prove yourself.
Her heartwrenching performance will stay with you long after the credits roll.
Jessica de Rooij's score turns ominous after that and was one of the highlights of the movie.
I walked out after that, but I hear there were several more minutes of worthless filler afterwards.
7 years of trying to get a divorce, 8 months of being with "Prince Charming", and she gives it up after being in Hickville for a week??
This film tries to twist and surprise you which it doesn't do and you find her transition, jumpy and forced, instead of a steadily realisation she just seems to wake up or click instantly into this next stage of realisation (after punching a woman in the face.. hmmm.. our heroine suddenly develops a very strong south American accent and this quick transition comes across as purely ridiculous.
Life is short but not so short you should avoid watching this film, after all it's a feel good film.
Now,after watching "Tunnel Rats",I cant help myself wondering if this guy really improved his skills significantly,or he got lucky?...maybe he wasn't even directing,but hired someone else??...
This is exactly what I did after hearing it featured Cheerleader Ninjas vs. Catholic School Girl Bullies.
After some surfing they decide cheerleaders are behind most of this stuff - after all they are on a lot of the sites out there.
the jokes are painful, almost all of them involve farting which usually stops being funny after 6 years old.
the parody of the power rangers was very annoying after 3 or more spots in the movie.
the star trek references got old after the 2nd jab.
But, after about 20 minutes of this non-sense where she is hypnotized and talks about this past life--nothing else is said about this until about two minutes until the end of the film!!
Their performances as the best friends of Danny and Debbie who get consumed by jealousy starts to grate after about 15 minutes.
But I don't want to give away too much, although I'm sure most of you will be able to pick up on every little thing that will happen plot-wise after the first twenty minutes.
A very big waste of time for anyone who watches this after reading this review.
They do manage to bite a few people too, and after one teacher at a school for autistic children is bitten, another teacher captures one & good old Doc sees what's biting (and killing) the folks that have expired in his exam room.
Within minutes Frank (Edwin Owens) has become the tarantulas first victim, shortly after Gloria (Penelope Windust) has become the second & Dr. Hodgins (Pat Hingle) soon realises what's happening.
The tarantulas themselves just crawl across things very slowly & we get shot after shot like this which becomes boring as they never do anything else & it's hard to feel scared by something so slow.
We are in the crowd that follows Claude Atkins as he carries away the kid who is bitten after being stupid enough to climb atop a truck carrying orange crates in a fatal attempt to catch a spider with his bare hands.
Review: Baby Boy starts off as interesting, but after a half-hour into the film, it feels like John Singleton just stands up and shouts "The hell with it!"
In closing, I think it would have been better if Singleton did a sequel to Boyz N the Hood that takes places 10 years after the original with Cuba Gooding, Jr.(Note: Cuba's brother, Omar, is in this film), Nia Long, and Laurence Fishburne returning rather than making this movie.
Johnson, Taraji P Henson cant act but their characters are underdeveloped and poorly written Shouting and arguments turn into sexual situations and the most asinine scene in the movie has to be when Jody backhands Yvette after she punched him.
In a Q&A after the screening, Schroeder said that he did not want his film to be full of "Hollywood" clichÃ©s; unfortunately this is exactly what happens.
Granted, this is science fiction, but that can't be an excuse for an empty feeling after watching it.
There is actually an amusing scene after her husband has been murdered, and Pamela Smart is worried about how she will look on the 6PM news.
Then we have the dude they're both after, who does nothing except getting captured, thus being in need of rescuing by the two girls.
How does it fall so easily after two girls infiltrate it when it's supposed to be so powerful?
We begin by watching a the REAL Last Horror movie, a direct to video slasher with bad acting and wobbly sets, but after a few minutes of that (a cunning ploy to make what follows look good by comparison) some guy appears and claims to have taped over it with his own home-made horror (obviously he has a full editing suite somewhere in his house) and tells his own story of killing and torture.
Its got a good premise and would probably have been mildly entertaining in a shorter format (would have made an okay episode of Urban Gothic) but as it is its just one yawn-some killing after another.
Soon after, the substandard acting and repetitive dialogue pushed me far past boring to extremely annoyed.
I love Poppy Montgomery, Jennifer Esposito (especially after "Crash")and the guy from CSI and I was so embarrassed for them that they were in this mess.
It shows about 6-7 different stories around the US that include a woman battling to keep custody of her son while the jerk of a father makes her life a living hell, a young man searching for the approval of his mother and estranged father - when his crazy aunt comes in early for their Christmas dinner to give him a new perspective, a young woman who is the maid of honor at her best friend's Christmas Eve wedding and the drama that ensues when it looks as if the wedding may be canceled due to weather not to mention the hidden feelings the young woman has for the groom-to-be, another woman who is trying to escape Christmas after her husband died last year at the same time, a conniving husband who is cheating on his wife while he tells her he is tied up at an airport, and finally the weather man who brings it all together during this once in a lifetime event.
Amber then rejects the possibility of an abortion, portraying herself as a caring, nurturing person, but is now ready to deliver a second illegitimate child (after the first, whose father was improperly identified for years).
What a surprise then, when I searched her on Google after watching the movie, to discover that she had written the required book, appeared on numerous chat shows, sold the film rights, etc.
For example, one minute she is alone in the world after the revelations about her ex-boyfriend, the next, she is in bed with a massage colleague and has been made pregnant by him.
Korea's answer to "I Know What You Did Last Summer" follows a similar story route to its American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one.
The actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they're asian) so i'll give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.
Of course, after those 40 minutes I couldn't stand it any longer and switched it off, so maybe the last 50 minutes really explode from all the fun.
The plot, which I must say didn't seem so bad, actually turned in to a big pile of junk without sense after a while.
However, this takes it to the extreme, such as when Ambar insults Nikhil day after day after day!
But instead of having them do so at the end of the film, the writers chose to have them profess their love and live together after only a couple of days of having known one another.
I hated the kissing scenes, and Preity Zinta use to be my favourite actress but not now, after watching this movie!!
Since the "living" dead girl of the title cannot speak when discovered by the two main male characters in an abandoned mental hospital, it is naturally assumed by the writer and director that at least one of the boys will instantly see the chained woman as a sex object, that is, after he kills her three times.
It was after all tagged as a trailer on front of the wonderful, The House of the Devil.
Myself, I went to Sunday school at the Temple, and worked with the stage crew in setting up the monthly illustrated sermon settings, and performed in many of them, from the late 1930's till just after her death when I went to the Navy.
Whilst the roommate of his first victim teams up with the incompetent police force, the maniac Â Charlie Â gets killed after a failed attempt to make another victim.
I joined because after having seen this movie I was anxious to see just how much other people hated it too, alas, they seem to like it.
I gave it a chance but after about 30 minutes, I realized this story was formed around a single idea and the rest was just filled in along the way.
By the time one gets to posting a commentary, we're all familiar with all of that......after all, we're not writing a "critque", we're just giving personal opinions.
Awful is the not the only word that comes to my mind after I watched The Art of War 3.
My god, what the director and the whole crew members where thinking when they ware shooting the sequence when the main actor shoots at the two Koreans from 2 meters and runs out of bullet after depleting the gun trows at them with the pistol and hit one in the face.Come on guys even a 3 year kid will not buy something like that.
But don't expect anything brilliant, after all, this is an Amityville sequel.
Go back to the beginning and the Lutzes.could we have imagined back then what their hoax was going to do to the world .even to this day people keep trying to go to the house which has been remodeled and the address changed,hollywood still keeps churning out these stupid fictitous movies regarding the orginal hoax ..the owners who moved in after the lutzes never had any incidents and even sued hollywood and the lutzes for fabricating the whole thing.
Crappy movie after crappy movie all because one family couldnt pay their bills so they had to concoct the most infamous paranormal hoax ever.
Anyway, the race organisers would have stopped him and pulled him off the course after a certain amount of time (especially after the report of his broken ankle) due to insurance reasons.
Why anyone would continue on a coach tour after two deaths is perhaps the greatest mystery in the production - especially as this includes one of the victims' husbands (supposedly so, anyway).
And the lazy demonising of Libby's new love Whit is obvious and convenient so Dennis can worm his way back in to Libby's affections after five years of being the most detestable and unreliable jerk she could hope to meet.
But if you're after something similar to Peggs previous work, that's inventive or off the wall, then this film isn't it.
As for the movie, shame on everyone involved in its making and shame on you if you watch it after reading this.
And then, after they take a bike ride, go BACK to his house he had just been kicked out of, and return to the bedroom with Eban?
And within this justification is one embarrassing scenario after another.
However, in "Stick Around", Hardy sports a bowler hat that's identical to his later "Ollie" titfer (although with a fuller moustache), and he and Bobby -- after spending most of this movie as adversaries -- end up as drunken comrades.
he said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, after you were done, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding.
then all the scenes in the total pitch black, where honestly since the characters are so flat, you don't really care whats going to happen, but regardless, after it happens and someone is killed, you just say to yourself, was i supposed to see that?
Anyway, I wanted to see this film (at home only of course) but now (just after) I am absolutely disappointed!
Here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in Bulgaria( we are supposed to believe that the location is London, like only a complete moron would buy that)The story is the one of 1000 other movies: retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job- after that government wants to get rid of him- good guy gets away after killing bad guys (was that a spoiler?
We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars, I'm sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation, but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior.
SO19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the Met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after Snipe's along with the CIA.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist.
With this in mind and after Snipes's history of duff DVD efforts, this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it's hot.
This one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring -- something that should never happen in a good action movie.
I suppose this movie is supposed to reflect the unease of New yorkers after 9-11, but if so it seems the worst sort of exploitation.
Apparently, the movie was "about" 9-11, and if the point was to portray the feeling of pointlessness and futility that many of us felt after the attacks; mission accomplished.
The Great New Wonderful - a mixture of 5 stories in NYC set in Sept 2002 - a mix of comedy and angst- this low budget movie has several recognizable faces including Stephen Colbert,Edie Falco, Jim Gaffigan , Maggie Gyllenhal,Will Arnett & Olympia Dukakis- but the guys that stole the movie were the 2 Indian bodyguards that lived next to each other.This felt like an art-house movie- nothing wrong with art-house flicks I guess- but after awhile I get tired of the meloncholia and the intrusive soundtracks.This comes out on Tuesday and has the option of watching the movie either as one story or as 5 stories- while all 5 stories have some interesting moments- the best one is the bodygaurd arc.
I am, as always after watching a film, glad to have watched it and I felt that it conveyed several important and often overlooked messages: As humans we will always have intrinsic values that we may not even understand ourselves.
Great New Wonderful was a movie where someone said, "Let's do a film about the daily grind of life after Nine Eleven," and everyone around them said, "What a great idea...that sound really important."
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Street cop Soldier Kelly (Lorenzo Lamas) gets worked up at being unable to take the drug dealers off the streets and ends up massacring a whole bunch of them (as you do...) He ends up being committed to a mental institution, where a sexy psychiatrist tries to evaluate him, but he manages to break free and teams up with wise cracking black guy Speedboat (Larry B Scott) to go after the big time dealers and save his sister from the scourge of drugs.
There has been a couple of Oldman straight-to-video releases of late (NOBODY'S BABY, INTERSTATE 60, TIPTOES) after a steady string of high-profile films during the 90's.
The plot concerns the maniacal acts perpetrated by Oldman's character, who is pursued by Rhames' character, the former cop who lost part of his arm and all of his idealism after a shady police arrest and illegal interrogation of an alleged cop-killer.
It wasn't until after I saw the movie on Channel 4 tonight that I found out something relatively important and that is that the source novel by Emile Zola was set in 19th century France and not sometime 20th century Yorkshire .
After the worst series of murders in a slasher movie and after dialogues and love scenes that are really bad, the movie ends with a "surprise" ending that is too silly to be credible.
Jennifer Runyon is Nancy, Forrest Swanson(Alex), Linda Gentile(Melody), William Lauer(..as TJ, the rich jock with the plane), and Judith Bridges(..whose Leia goes bonkers, singing to herself a lullaby as she dances around in her own little world after discovering the decapitated head and killer Santa with a butcher knife)round out some of the cast in trouble of being chop suey.
Writer-director Neil Jordan (on a roll after the critically-acclaimed "Mona Lisa") nearly took his name off the credits of this low-level whimsy, saying the final result had been altered by outsiders.
It has a few society-critical parts too, but after the main storyline being that weak, i just couldn't feel the punch lines... Visuals.
Moments after viewing it, I need only say the title to send everyone into fits of laughter and gagging sounds.
The movie is the worst I have ever seen, not because the dialogue, pacing, script, acting, sound or editing are weak, which they are, but because after watching the movie you will feel like you need to wash something off... and you will know even if you do, nothing is going to go away.
They left soon after.
Second, major plot holes: how did they get to the island after the escape.
I found it so painful to watch that I had to turn it off after the first 45 minutes - and I enjoyed "Seven"!
A humorous moment apparently occurred when Rachel's father walked up to mesh a few weeks after the show had ended and said "you picked the wrong girl!".
This reveals little about their characters and gets boring after a few minutes, but it just doesn't stop.
to a female inmate that left her scarred after they started a fire to cover their crime.
The only cure for him in the context of the film would be shedding Grace - and maybe going after Jacqueline.
Yet at the end Grace - lovely again - runs after Bing and good old Bill just watches from a window, giving a stylish long and elevated shot of Bing and Grace going home together.
Was this an ending added after tryout?
The main character, Raymond Joshua, is an amateur poet and drug dealer who gets sent to prail(prison and jail, which I'll talk about later) after making the moronic mistake of attempting to jump a fence instead of running away from the fifty year old "doo-wop" cops.
I could go on, but just about every other claim made in the documentary is either misleading, strongly disputed in the scientific literature (I made the effort to check after watching the documentary), or plain bogus.

the idea that humans are gong to start eating each other after the gas supply runs out is completely ridiculous.
the whole plot seems like something someone would come up with after a few too many at a wannabe goth convention.
Let me just say that after seeing two of the After Dark films last year (The Hamiltons in theaters and Gravedancers at home) I was very excited for this film, and considering the cast, it was warranted in my mind.
The director must fancy himself a creative fellow by naming all of the characters after cars.
But somehow I found myself losing complete faith this movie due to terrible writing after the first 5 minutes.
The concept that the apocalypse started after the world "ran out of gas" was very far fetched as best, but what really got me was the aftermath in the storyline.

The acting is pretty lousy, including Sue Lyon (whose career went straight downhill after appearing in Kubrick's "Lolita"), the always wooden Chris Mitchum (son of Robert), and familiar face Jean Sorel ("Lizard In a Woman's Skin").
While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that's a BIG maybe!)
A re-edited version of 1950's "Gone to Earth", which apparently derived after an artistic struggle between the production team The Archers and David O. Selznick.
Altman should have hung them up right after making M*A*S*H. This movie is bad.
The movie is too long, with a running time of a bit over 2 hours, and while the first hour seemed pretty well paced, the whole concept got a bit tired after that.
Reunited, after Megghy mistakenly believes that Andrea is dead, the film celebrates their reunion to the hilt with a high-spirited, but insipid musical number aboard a bus, which provides an inadequate suture for the fact that Andrea would have deflowered Megghy, had he not passed out in the tent.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
And let's not forget the degenerate-looking mental subnormal that drools as he rides his motorcycle, in scene after scene.
I really don't remember too many details about this show, other than that it seemed to always be on after the real TV programmes had ended, and that it was pretty downbeat.
I've been after this movie for a while, though mainly because of the cool VHS cover and the fact that Yvonne De Carlo is in it.
With a little malice, I might add that the amateur acting was so artificial that it drove me crazy after twenty minutes.
My daughter, a very bright girl if I do say so, was mentally energized after seeing "The Last Mimzy" and couldn't stop talking about it.

Walked out of the cinema after the group session to select the contenders for the Comedy Award.
I don't know if it improved in the second half as it got deleted after an hour..
I gave up on it after just over half an hour.
Plus the random inclusion of disgusting and/or completely unnecessary scenes such as a priest going after a young boy, Stephen Mangan's genitalia, one of the Irish comedians being f*sted while holding some puppets, you get what I mean.
The idea is good, the day in the life of two men who meet in a traffic accident and everything goes downhill after that, but the execution is severly lacking.

I stopped following the plot after a while, not because it got too complicated, but because I didn't care anymore.
In 1991, after a career spanning four albums and the death of one of history's most talented bassists, Metallica released an album that sold tens of millions of copies worldwide and made them household names.

The only good part about this movie is when it shows Amber Heard naked, but after those few scenes the rest of it is some more shallow and boring stuff.

A big city cop moves to Arizona as a way to avoid stress after a bad incident in Chicago.
for him anyway, st. stupid cute guy... we can give him some credit at this point for not running after her.
and so it seemed to me that it was cafe girl at the denouement... when boy gets we guess killed, or at least properly mangled, whatever he looked like at the end of the movie...he certainly looks worse off after his big car accident.

Therefore, Kathleen can utter ridiculous lines some "ice please" after she's just been belted by her husband and, without losing her pasted-on smile for a second, can make chirpy little jokes about her husband's disgustingly ugly drunken behavior at the party that she has spent most of the film (and perhaps most of her life) planning.

What he's a cop in a big city and after so many years it's just now struck him he'd rather be doing something else !
The opening sequence screams that it's going to be a violent - Very violent - urban thriller , there's bits after this that hints it might be a farcical comedy and then the movie settles down into a rom com .
The ending wasn't too bad, but I suppose after the mess of a plot that came before it, that's not a huge feat.

And after he has recuperated in the hospital he chases down his true love from the trio of girls - Mimieux - and tells her "we have the worst behind us" and can now continue their romance, or some nonsense like that.
The film would have worked if: 1) the guy were an a**hole, 2) all three girls were virginal and pure (or thereabouts), 3) Jones, after having hooked up with Mimieux, came on to the other two and not the other way around (practically), 4) the humour had been emphasized and better written, 5) all notions of making a message were dropped, 6) he were tied up in the attic and not free to leave, and 7) the movie made up its damn mind if it wanted to be a psycho-thriller or a cheerful comedy.
I loved the first film and after waiting 15 years to catch CS2 I have to say I was disappointed.

The scene in the beach after a refusal to kill one Yakuza boss is especially memorable and also close to the work of Takeshi Kitano.
It is hard to make any interpretations on single images and scenes while everything before and after them fights against any serious analyzes.

ve seen people look worse after a weekend bender.

It isn't surprising that the David Ogden Stiers character was dropped after the pilot.
Now the movie seemed to imply she was possibly a prostitute or a mistress--but even then, it seemed silly to have her traipsing around in one glamorous gown after another in a third world nation.
Again, maybe 1930s Hollywood thought it was okay to say pretty much ANYTHING or ANYONE was Vietnamese--after all, who in the audience at the time would have known differently?

Anyway, for a reason I have yet to figure out, Jennifer Love Hewitt runs in the rain wearing a sweater and bikini bottom to tell Brandy and the rest of the victims that she ran over Ben Willis 2 years prior and that he went after her and Ray and killed 2 of her friends last year.
When they arrive,turns out it's the rain season.Why would a radio station give people tickets to the Bahamas in the rain season?Can't they just like,call the station and try to change the date or something?Freddie Prinze Jr.(he has a name,but unlike Ben,I don't still know)also heads for the Bahamas right after waking up from a coma or something to save the day and he kills Ben once and for all,after Ben killed his own son by accident,cos he apparently never watched pro-wrestling.

So not long after Sonic Adventure 2 came out, Sonic X began making the rounds in Japan, and internationally soon after.
But then after the rescue occurs, the series proceeds to grind itself stupid.
I lost track of the amount of scenes we have to endure where characters introduce themselves to other characters after a few episodes (in the second episode alone, Chris introduces himself to Sonic, then the next day introduces himself to Tails and Cream, who introduce themselves to Chris, who introduces them to his grandfather), and the lack of action the setting forces upon us (Sonic and company moves into Chris' household, and have to hide from everyone else for a few more episodes, then get the attention of the outside world after that) forces the writers to hammer out awkward "Komedy" (like the excruciating seventh episode, where Cream spends most of the time hiding from the household while a party is being hosted and generally gets into all sorts of wacky hijinks) to try and make the complete lack of action more tolerable, but are really just making the show even less dignified than the fourth Home Alone movie (you know, the made for TV one with French Stewart as Marv).
You would know John Woo was involved by the inclusion of doves flying through the under ground lair shortly after an explosion!

At any rate, the Feds zone in on a bunch of harvesters ready to pick their crop and get out of town fast, especially after they killed a couple other Feds.
Of course, after the initial dusting, the harvesters are puking blood & not feeling too well, but not long afterward they begin to change into...wait for it....zombies.

I had a lot of problems with this episode, but one thing I did like was the Spike and Buffy scene (even though I never wanted them together, esp after he turned stalker-y and built a mannequin and a sex-bot, sniffing her undies...etc) I didn't understand why the spell had to turn all potentials worldwide into all out slayers when the major battle was in the school.
The script makes cloddy attempts to show that Annabelle has an artist's depth (which we are supposed to conclude from her not-very-insightful interpretation of poetry, her recognition of Simone's photographic skills, and the singularly unremarkable song she apparently wrote and plays for Simone), the compassion of a much more mature person (which we are supposed to conclude from her comforting a classmate who has lost a pet and from her comforting Simone after discoveringÂby snooping, no lessÂthat the woman Simone loved killed herself), and the courage of her convictions (which we are supposed to conclude from her unwillingness to give up her Buddhist beads).

They get up after some time without showing any signs of pain!!
I'm sorry but I stopped watching this film after about 30 minutes.
I figured out why after a while.
The fights in the movie are done pretty naive, but there is one definitely good thing: it lasts 1 hour and 15 mins, so that is good, one cannot get bored so much, but that is too short for a movie, because the story is cut to a bunch of scenes which go one after another without cohesion, well thats my personal opinion.
And it is not very violent after all, no way its a horror, far from that.

Panorama after panorama of sumptuous Swedish scenery makes it clear that "Aideista parhain" is governed by the same parameters as a mainstream studio movie from Hollywood.
His impending departure should be cause for celebration after her constant ill-mannered behavior towards the boy.
Of course, we're more sympathetic towards Signe's claim, after all, his birth mother is f****** a soldier affiliated with the Nazi party.
"Aideista Parhain" gets even more manipulative after the old man learns belatedly about his mother's intentions in a letter written by Signe.

Meanwhile her boyfriend is searching for her after she was struck by a car and nobody believes him that she's missing.I agree the plot is predictable and lame.It is a complete rip off of the other film i mentioned.If this was a sequel to it then it would make more sense,but it cannot stand on it's own.I couldn't even stay awake to watch the rest of it as i lost interest thinking i have seen this all before.
I didn't watch the full film, so I might be wrong and all actors and director might have improved after the halfway point...yes, I could not take any more the 35 minutes.

The fact that the townsfolk are eventually revealed as 'slaves' of the giant ant community Â after having dissed their existence when reported by the vacationers who fell foul of them on a proposed island resort Â links the film with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) which, incidentally, was about to be remade (the second of four versions, so far!)
An island hideaway turns into Hell for vacationers after the ants have grown to enormous proportions, terrorizing the tourists and sending Collins and crew on the run.

Heck, if I didn't turn it off after my father's warning, then I was going to enjoy being scared by it.

(Thank you...I had to get this out of my craw first in order to prevent serious gagging after reading 'vranger's arrogant drivel.)
Not because of the story per se, but because: 1. director Avnet of the B-variety, has problems to stick to the basics and instead tries, probably with an award in mind, to create a work of art, and 2. the script (which should have been used as 2-ply by Pacino in his powder room after reading).
Man... Well, first off I promise I'm not a 'Troll' and I'm not going to say something brainless and general like 'worst movie ever' because it isn't : ) However... after thinking about it honestly, I THINK what this film is, is a good example of what probably could have been a good film and I don't know WHAT the hell was done to it, but man oh man... the result is literally STUNNINGLY awful.
But aside from being a John McClain wannabe with a suit and better vocabulary, after he receives a threat on his life, which is to be honored in 88 minutes, he is inertly passive, and wanders around aimlessly, unfazed; perhaps he is looking for a hair salon?

Your average delivery guy with hundreds of weekly visits develops a grand sensibility after couple of visits and dedicates his body even more for that extra pleasure to our lonely melody.
I've now seen this wretched rock fantasy three times, and think I can safely call it a day after this.
It makes the mistake by starting up years after this event, where the witch lady is still as youthful as ever and has tricked a nice (if a tad bit dumb) guy to assist her.

The main female character is a bit on the plump side, and she quickly shows off her assets by taking a shower after a swim (Too bad the lighting is pretty dismal and she's the kinda girl that wears panties under her swimsuit) Needless to say the shot of her getting out of the pool confirms that this chick has got some junk in the trunk.
In the beginning, the transition to the opening to the main plot is rather sketchy and is probably the most potential-wasting part after the ending.

Still, even with what appears to be convincing evidence of Luca's existence, the final scene around the family breakfast table seems to forget much of what the audience has already seen, showing the family apparently accepting Luca's ghost (whether imagined by Martino or as a "real" ghost) as an unavoidable fixture in their lives after all of those same characters have spent the rest of the movie expressing views and opinions quite to the contrary.

On the Roger Corman timeline, this is right after he got done using 'big' budgets (for BATTLE BEYOND...) and right before he started cannibalizing his own stuff for footage (BATTLE BEYOND... okay, so 'during' the period when he was ripping himself off, but I was thinking of RAPTOR), and the end result is something neither good nor interesting.

Third, there are numerous red herring "boo" scenes, even Condon admits this, which greatly limit the fear factor after a while; because, we're just waiting for the next false alarm to "scare" us.
Had she been given a second chance in Hollywood, Louise Brooks might not have been so quickly dismissed into forgettable B-pictures that were the only thing she made after returning from Europe.
Interestingly enough, although you can't hear her perfectly, Miss Brooks appeared to possibly have either a speech defect or perhaps an odd accent--either way, her voice might just be the reason she retired soon after this film.
Louise Brooks made this film after returning from Europe, where she'd appeared in the three movies that constitute her primary contribution to the cinema.
The cinematography is like an after school TV special as is the acting.
They should be ashamed to say they based the movie off of his book, and ashamed to even name the movie after it.

This movie is so bad that after watching it you'll want to run out and rent Ghoulies to get the taste out of your mouth.
The opening scene has trolls chasing someone through a misty field to the tune of 80's techno music and it only gets better after that.
What a relief after the deluge of gravity-defying and morally reckless athletes that careen through commercials and the evening news.
That doctored booze, I should add, comes as no real surprise in the film...not after we learn that Stone's middle name is Alucard.
The story deals with Chevy Chase, Gregory Hines, and Sigorney Weaver scheming to sell a dangerously unreliable aircraft to a third-world nation after it fails miserably in a demonstration for the US military.

So let's talk about the bad--because after all, that's why people today would approach this film--wanting to see and laugh at the bad.
Such as when the doctor is called because the Dumb Girl's sister is "in a bad way" after using pot.
Sadly, there might have been a good reason to make such a film--after all, drugs do make people really stupid and ruin a lot of lives.
Mare Winningham plays his wife, who frets over every penny but tells her daughter not to badmouth her dad (the man has dreams, after all).
His way to the top of course hardly meets any difficulty but, after all, this is a comedy so we don't mind as long as it's entertaining.

I have to say Lindsey Lohan was dressed wonderfully for the most part, but when we got 2 the part where everyone laughs at her I couldn't help but feel satisfied after having to watch this rubbish!!
I was absolutely speechless after watching it and quite frankly I am absolutely appalled at the good comments its bin given on this site!
On one level it begs to be some type of satirical comment on drama queens and materialism, but that's EXACTLY what the film falls victim to - its lead character, played by the despicable Lindsay Lohan, is a trashy drama queen who apparently spends all her free time lusting after a hunky teen icon.
She's supposed to be the heroine of this film, but after five minutes I already hated her.
Why did she get into a play, then go to a concert with a friend and meet her idol, then come back and star in the play after some girl told her she wasn't at the after party but she knew she was and so did her friend and then a guy who she had spoken to about twice asked her out or something like that?
She is fan of a band who breaks up and they give a final concert with an after party.
I watched this after seeing Lindsey Lohan in the better than average "Freaky Friday" and the brilliant "Mean Girls".

'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' comes as a disappointment from Lindsay Lohan after the very funny 'Freaky Friday' and 'Mean Girls'.
The film rapidly descends into clichÃ© after clichÃ© (the script seems to have been created by entering lots of clichÃ©d lines into a computer and programming it to spit them out randomly).

(Such mobsters include Eric Roberts,William Forsythe, Sasha "Kickboxer 2-4" Mitchell,Patrick Kilpatrick, Ice-T and Dennis Hopper) If anything else, Luck Of The Draw answers the burning question of what became of Sasha Mitchell after Step By Step, however that aside, Luck Of The Draw is just terrible.

Veteran director Benny Chan (A MOMENT OF ROMANCE, NEW POLICE STORY) marshals proceedings into a cohesive whole, though the movie fizzles badly after a dynamic opening sequence before rallying again somewhere around the halfway mark.

That's where it gets bizarre: a few months after Slick Willie took the oath of office, Chase got his own TV show...and it failed miserably, turning Chase into a laughingstock.
Taking its cue from "The Parent Trap", but blessedly giving us only one child at the helm, this lame-duck script has nowhere to go after the initial set-up.
This is basically the story of a man who's made it in life the hard way without even a high school diploma but decides to follow in his kid's footsteps and tries to attend college himself to help his boy's attitude after he hands divorce papers to his second wife.
You know how after eating at a Chinese buffet, no matter how much you eat you never get full?
That's how I felt after watching this movie.
Furthermore no painting were ever done of Jesus until about 400 years after his death and resurrection - so we may never know what Jesus looked like.
If you hadn't figured out by the end of episode one what's going to happen 2-5 and after watching those episodes what would happen in episode six, you probably enjoyed this show.
The presence of Linda and her fellow feminists is ironic for after Charlotte is raped, she doesn't contact anyone who either anonymous or bound to confidentiality such as a therapist or law enforcer.
Due to poor writing/directing, the main focus of the movie was that the Romans were after a black Jew.
The good Nazi, Helmut, takes offense at this and says, "I think every time you open your mouth you talk sh*t", to which the bad Nazi replies, after a long pregnant pause, "Hey, I don't like that last remark you made....about sh*t".
Yet another nazi-prison movie, that followed after Ilses success.
Wes Craven-many horror fans consider him as a master of horror,but after watching his truly god-awful movies like "Deadly Friend","Invitation to Hell" and this one I came to conclusion that he is very overrated.Only three of his movies are actually worth watching:"Last House on the Left" which is brilliant,"The Hills Have Eyes" and "Deadly Blessing" which are pretty good.His other movies,including overrated "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" are a typical Hollywood garbage.
Craven did it directly after 'The Nightmare on Elm Street', which is a movie, that provided one of the most known horror characters of cinematic history.
While, travelling on the bus they find out that they're going to be late and so they decide (by a vote off) to take a detour and get themselves stranded after damaging the bus on the beaten track.
Okay, so after reading and hearing how BAD this flick is.
Almost a decade after Wes Craven's original shocker - he directed this lesser known and largely inferior sequel.
Somehow Pluto (Michael Berryman) is still alive after the first movie.
I recently acquired this via the full-frame Image DVD in anticipation of the HTF Halloween challenge; I knew the film was nowhere near as well regarded as the 1977 original Â but I wasn't aware that Craven only made it because he was hard-up for cash, that he later disowned the result and that the picture was even shelved for two years (by which time he had re-acquired his stature with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET [1984] which itself developed into a franchise and, ironically, the director would also return to much later after another lean period in his career)!
This movie even throws in the "guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after" at the end for us hopeless romantics.
The only even marginally entertaining in this movie is an unintentionally hilarious bit in which the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie; I almost laughed myself to tears after seeing that.
The movie is also basically the one killing after the other but none of them are really original or surprising enough to leave a lasting impression on the fans of the genre.
So we watched it last night with the lights off and you know what happened after the movie was over?
The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable.
Basically the movie is clichÃ© after clichÃ© and really nothing ever comes as a surprise.
I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point.
It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point.
Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie "Showgirls", so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one.
Broken starts as single mother Hope (producer Nadja Brand) returns home after a date to her young six year old daughter Jennifer (Megan Van Kerro), after making sure Jennifer is alright Hope goes to sleep herself.
Personally I felt the film was lacking something after an OK start & a fairly intriguing premise it goes nowhere & never gives any sort of reason for anything that happens or even where the action takes place.
Considering that Hope has been living wild in the middle of a dirty forest exposed to the elements her white shirt is remarkably clean at the end after forty odd days isn't it?
It's no wonder both the actress (Nadja Brand) who played Hope and the nameless torturer (Eric Colvin) have never had any work after the production of this abomination.
There is no explanation about where they are and how the women have been kidnapped and transported to the middle of nowhere; Hope is an imbecile, and I do not understand how her character does not kill the sadistic maniac when she has the chance and after being tortured the way she had been; the schoolgirl screaming all the time is really irritating, provoking the nasty situation with her tongue.
(i don't think anybody would survive that) i don't need to talk about the other girl having no problems at all after her tongue has been cut out.
Just go up to the actors listed in the film to see what they've done after this movie was made in 2006.
A rather inoffensive monster indulges his rock-collecting hobby after being partially revitalized by said rocks.
Green Ice is a caper movie that was made long after the caper movie was in fashion.
A poorly developed action adventure film shot largely in Mexico, this affair begins in promising fashion, but after its first of several changes in direction occurs within the plot line, little remains that will interest a viewer.
Some eye-candy to watch when you come home on a Friday night after an exhausting week.
At the same time Tom is making a complete fool of himself trying to get into Amanda's, after having a one-night fling with him, pants as well as taking advantage of poor and introverted June; this after Amanda was no longer available to him.
The movie gets even more confusing when the off-the-wall Yule after threatening Tom, by phone, at the textile factory is later shot to death by the police as they catch him trying to break into the Deese's house.
But after all, I must admit it, I have a lot of fun watching it, I suggest that the genre Comedy appears on this screen.
Nadja starts in New York one night as a Vampire named Nadja (Elina Lowensohn) talks to a man (Nic Ratner) in a bar & explains that she & her slave Renfield (Karl Geary) have travelled to New York from her homeland of Transylvania because her Father Count Dracula (Peter Fonda) is dead & that it is hard to find good food in New York after 10 O'Clock.
Shortly after in a car Nadja drinks his blood.
Van Helsing & Jim become aware that Lucy is under the control of Nadja & in another bizarre coincidence Van Helsing's Sister Cassandra (Suzy Amis) is looking after Nadja's ill Brother Edgar (Jared Harris) who Nadja intends to visit, both Van Helsing's & Jim's desperation to kill Nadja becomes even greater as the people they care for the most are in danger because of Nadja's blood drinking activities...
Because even for several years after his death, he kept on appearing in tiny horror productions like as if he was still amongst the living.
Snakes were used for shock value, but after six or more times it sorta lost its punch.
Karloff does nothing of any great importance in here and the characters are all flat and tiring to look at after a while.
Either way, the fact remains that someone actually financed this tripe after reading the script, actors thought it was worth reciting this awful dialogue and somebody had the brains to release it on video when the negative should have been quietly thrown in a nearby dumpster.
There's been a number of films around this topic that do work out after all.
The storyline is amazing, thus the characters are chosen so well, and the actors are the best Yugoslavian actors there are today in the acting business.The whole storyline is carefully planned, although it might seems a bit confusing at first, you get used to it, and after that it's just a Joy ride from than on.
Or get drunk on wine or beer and shut the TV off after "Firewall's" opening credits and you're in for a better night.
Yes, we get it already Harrison, you're embarrassed over being an actor after being a construction worker.
Even ignoring the one gigantic plot hole in this film - Bill Cox (Paul Bettany) meticulously plans his dastardly deed after seemingly months of research, but then is ignorant of one incredibly crucial point - the film sputters along without much energy.
Some big spoilers coming......  Let me start with I have been a HUGE fan of Harrison Ford's most of my life but I have been dreading this one - especially after the bad Hollywood Homicide.
I was greatly disappointed in this film after being greatly impressed by the powerful and moving "Way Down East" and the groundbreaking (though shockingly racist) "Birth of a Nation."
During this VERY hectic year, he churned out film after film after film for Keystone Studios and the quality of the films are, in general, quite poor.
This movie introduced almost every character from Mortal Kombat Trilogy only to kill them off five seconds after their debut.
A bunch of these baddies (and even some heroes) die or just leave, never to return, in about a minute after they appear.
Of course, after she finds Jax, she immediately knows where it is.

Soon after (more spoilers.
I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.
Somehow this all ties in with an escaped killer called the AxeMan, who is also after the few thousand dollars the girls unknowingly have in their possession.
This is nothing more than a 1960's biker movie plot, crossed with a female exploitation movie, with traces of a horror movie, which looks like its screenplay was found after it sat in a trash can for the past 40 years, and updated on a minuscule budget.
I guess that wasn't good enough when it was released in 2004, so they renamed it and brought it out again in 2006 as a story of greedy people after $300,000.
POSSIBLE SPOILER: Everyone, and I do mean everyone, in the movie is after the money.
Raven(Darlena Tejeiro) & Ashley(Andrea Bogart)just stopped into a bar after hiking a nearby mountain and run into a nasty group of bikers led by TJ(Thomas Crnkovich who overplays the raspy voice and just doesn't provide much menace as the head biker of a band of motorcycle baddies).
Stealing one of the gang's motorcycles, Raven and Ashley get run off the road and have to walk on foot after evading the bikers trying to catch them.
He literally beds one gal he suckers into a sauna not but shortly after meeting her, promising of a healthy career as a model(..naked nearly the entire film, Femi Benussi shows she's unafraid to bare it all for the audience for almost her total screen time), but she'll, like others, gets stabbed multiple times after discovering the water faucets running in her employer-to-be Gisella Montani's(Amanda)abode.
For all the future watchers of this movie, change the channel after you see a blonde kid with a baseball cap that he's wearing backwards.
This reminds me of the early scenes of the original Stargate film, where, right after being transported to the other side of the Universe, the soldiers accompanying the geek Egyptologist, have absolutely NO sense of wonder and amazement, but rather, they entertain themselves by throwing his research books at him.
However, after watching Black Sheep again, I feel a re-write was necessary.
Here we have Warren Mitchell as the bad guy.....who went on to play Alf Garnett in "Til Death do Us PArt" in the same year as this film, and for many years after.
Anyhow after recently watching a few eps I was reminded vaguely of the "care bears" cartoon.
I really loved "Dream with the Fishes" but after seeing this I won't be so quick to seek out another film by this director.
the whole attic/shoot thing she was always jumping around in, the lovers never catching on, the new red cordless at the end of the movie, the wood plank suddenly not on the door just after she placed it there moments before....and the ending?
However, Miss Marple (Geraldine McEwen) is unconvinced and conducts her own investigation, which takes her to the estate of the miserly Luther Crackenthorpe (David Warner) and his squabbling family, all of whom are after his estate.
It loses its edge about halfway through, when Joey starts being nice, Vera starts being nice, the puppy is nice, and everyone gets to live happily ever after--what a precious moment!!!
I applaud the idea of a female hero, but don't make her so gung-ho about guns that she admits they're her "security blanket" and continues using them after realizing time and time again the hard way that the monster's completely bulletproof.
Unfortunately, the opposite happened and after this garbage he almost vanished completely and never got another chance.
Fortunately, despite the iffy plot, and even iffier performances, The Last Horror Film isn't a COMPLETE waste of time: there are a couple of squishy murders (a throat slashing/decapitation and a bullet to the head); lots and lots of topless ladies (this is Cannes, after all!
But, this film comes from his worst period - where he was making one completely unfunny film after another.
i don't think anyone is truly scared by locusts after watching that film.
Except one person toward the end after we find out that they like to eat flesh.but no other reports of death by Locust.
They pulled out one after another.
He is killed soon after, and it doesn't take long for more dead bodies to begin piling up at the modelling agency where the unfortunate young girl worked...
Thank heavens for veteran heavy-hitter Mike Farrell, who does magnificently chasing after some cows, or was that a double?
You came straight home after shooting the g-string commercials and you were unstoppable."
That was my first mistake, after the pilot I hoped it would get better, that was my second mistake.
After The Office and Extras revitalised British comedy, and after the success of disturbing Chris Morris works; BrassEye and Jam, The I.T.
Computers aren't interesting, office based comedy is obsolete after The Office, sitcoms are dead, everyone hates audience laughter (he insists that it is filmed in front of a live studio audience, but really, who cares!
I found myself cursing more than usual at any time when I play a SH game, and the fun level deteriorated rapidly after she joined up with me.
I caught this at a film festival, and I won't be surprised if it gets pulled the weekend after it opens in its limited release in New York and Los Angeles.
I found myself looking at my watch half way through the film, hoping for the end after I finally realized I didn't care about the story, the characters, or the outcome of the plot.
One of them, Nino Castelnuovo, is a fashion photographer who immediately follows her, woes her, and within minutes - naturally - she sheds her clothes without further hesitation, after which Castelnuovo can go for some 'in-depth interviewing.'
When she is judged fitting for Albatross modeling agency by Castelnuovo, he introduces her to her future colleagues as 'first class merchandise', after which a not amused Edwige Fenech sniffs, 'how we're gonna photograph all that.
The astronauts role will be to remain in hiding for several months and to provide film of supposed explorations of the Martian surface, after which they will return as supposed `heroes' without ever actually having left the Earth's surface.
Eventually, after battling horrible giant spiders suspended from very visible wires as well as watching the cat-women's exotic and seductive dance, the humans are able to escape their imprisonment and return to Earth safely--minus one crew member who was stabbed.
Too bad this show degrades his weight every week while going after the lowest common denominator
soon after, the doctor as well as her fellow employees at the albatross fashion studio are murdered by a motorcycle helmet wearing killer.
(2003) really disappointed me, i was looking forward to this after reading some positive reviews on here but i found it to be lame, unfunny and most of the characters are all ugly talentless geeks.......... it was obviously a bunch of nerdy friends who THOUGHT they could make some sort of funny "Scream/Scary Movie" type film and cash in!!!
We later sat down to watch it, and after about 15 minutes, I was ready to stomp my DVD player into rubble.
Less than a year after losing her twin sister to suicide, Megan(Elisabeth Harnois)joins her friends on a trip to the family summer home on the Louisiana bayou.
Then in the end of the movie the whole thing becomes clear after one or two plot twists.
Of course after they finish boffing each other.
Much other plagiarism is evident which is OK if well done - and after all this is a film in a retro style so should be expected - but this is the sub pass rate night before deadline desperately downloading student of film plagiarism - it grates so much that there was blood running out of the DVD player.
However, after the Code was strengthened, perverts and the curious went looking for seedy material and found it in educational films that were really just excuses to show boobs and talk about sex and drugs.
The downward path happens fairly slowly for the main character but it quickly comes to it's end on a very negative note after a badly done abortion.
The basic story involves a former Nazi affiliate being hunted down after avoiding execution for over 40 years.
I believe the name unstoppable is a description of the migraine one gets after watching this mind numbing stinking pile of trash.
I won't go into the in's and out's of the plot because my head would start to hurt, but it involves a drug that cause the recipient to have strange visions that seem real and which allow for someone to control their mind by manipulating them in their visions, they will also die after a certain period of time.
I didn't see the The Detonator yet, but I'm kind of scared to after seeing this movie.
(Yes, I DID watch it after all.)
This is the thinking person's action movie and after you have watched it you will probably be compelled to watch it all over again.
I turned this awful movie off after that - enough is enough.
The "plot" only just starts to unfold itself after an hour into the film, when a courageous boy stands up against the vicious gang but then gets falsely accused, threatened and targeted for vengeance.
You'd think these 'youth gone wild' would have gotten bored with this after a while, and so they do.
Brown's characterÂthe heart of the story after all-- starts off a likable "everyman."
Don (The Dragon) Wilson, Cynthia Rothrock, Sam J. Jones, Richard Norton, Chris Penn and James Russo are ultimately wasted in this failed cop drama which finds Wilson as a disgraced cop who ends up switching alliances to a mobster (Played well by Penn) after Wilson is out of work due to a mission that went awry and cost the life of one of his teammates.
Grant and Hepburn find Edmund Gwenn dead on the rocks, and after a moment of mournful reflection just leave him there and go about their business?
It seems to me that after the 3 leading characters are being introduced to us, the writers had absolutely no idea as to there the plot should turn to.
At the final scene, the train stops exactly 1 second after the painter pulls the emergency break.
Sadly, Dell, who plays the love interest of both Menjou and Bickford, died in an auto accident only a week after the film was released at age 19.
The 100% midget gag wears pretty thin after the first couple of minutes.
When it comes to High Concept Pictures, this ranks up there with Jules White's "Dogville" series, in which inoffensive puppies are stuffed into costumes, wired into position and then made to stand around, urinating on themselves, after which voices are dubbed into a satire of "the Face on the Bar Room Floor"; or "The Three Fatties" series: If they laugh at fat comics, and they laugh at at movie teams, then how about a movie team of three men who tip the scale at 300 pounds each?
This is a film one thinks about long after seeing it.
Can I please briefly say that the highlight of this exposition was the vintage Mercedes that had been (so we learned after the show) driven in reverse by an aged Lady from somewhere on the southern coastal region of California, over a barrier, shearing shrubs, and landing inches from the facade of the Edwards cinema which ran the film?
When it is presented originally Va Savoir looks tantalizingly delicious, but after ten minutes of eating you realize that you finished and still hungry.
Many situations were predictable for me, I knew he would get busted on the rooftop as he was about to kiss the girl and I knew he would get held up right after he said he was 50 feet from the police station.
The sequel, "More Sex..." had begun, and about a half-hour into it, I noticed the former lover who had impregnated her, and had earlier announced his returning to his wife (but only after "messing-up" the bed clothes with her in their hotel room) appeared at her door, announcing a now impending divorce.
Gibbs never reconfronts Stamos > after discovering he's not a cop, Stamos' family protects him even after one > of their own is killed, etc.,etc., etc.).
That puts him one up on people like Kurt Thomas after "Gymkata" or Ben Affleck after "Gigli".
Between the emasculated Tarl Cabot, scene after scene of a midget's hinder, an annoying side-kick named Watney, and an embarrassed looking Jack Palance wearing one of the goofiest looking hats imaginable, you've got the recipe for one bad movie.
There are no special effects to speak of - the budget was too miniscule for that, just the heady excitement of one lame swordfight after another.
I know the story has very solid metaphors for fearful discrimination but after awhile it's like we get it enough.
Having become interested after slowly being drawn in, by the tease of what was to come I battled through poor acting and sets, for the end finale.
Going straight-to-video after sitting on a shelf unreleased for a number of years where it should have stayed, written, produced & directed by Sean Tretta The Great American Snuff Film is crap, I'd call it pathetic filth but it's not even that good.
I argued that there is no way this was based on a real serial killer (never heard of him before or after....do a look for William Allen Grone on your fav search engine) and there is NO real snuff footage on it.
Then after it's over and the credits run it says "This film is and all characters in it are a work of fiction".
Some of them have important psychological problems after the "joke", and you don't have to be a psychiatrist to see that.
The whole film ends with Wilfred's unit of "soldiers" doing battle with the monsters once they are released from their "cages" after the museum is provided with enough souls by those who venture into the other world.
I have to admit that there are some errors (the-country-hurt-my-feelings explanation for the bad guy turned to a terrorist is at the least laughable, the time-travel theories cannot be minimized into a 2 minutes analysis such as portrayed here), but after all, when you see a film of this kind you do not expect everything to be clear as the stars in the night sky (without clouds of course).
Answer the question, what you REALLY want and expect for any given kind of movie and i promise that you will find yourself to be more amused after you watch any film from there on.....  For myself speaking, this film deserves a brave 8.
You don't see the ending coming in the same way that you don't anticipate the pain of dental surgery until after the novocaine wears off.
If Kunis wants a career after "That 70's Show" is off the air, I suggest she be more selective with her film roles.
And while there seems to be an attempt at sending up campus life and politics, it is not a redeeming factor at all and the writers appear to give up on it after not too long.
It's Bible Black, after all), and even "Thursday".
Maybe the director is visually impaired: how else does he fail to see the absurdity of the illustration on the cover of a book about a murder being a photo taken a few minutes after the incident for which there were only three witnesses without a photographer among them?
I was such an enormous fan of the original film (the insanity, the characters, the violence), that to be handed a stick of bubble gum after eating veal just felt insulting.
And what will Michael do after this movie???
Do not feel too bad if you walk out of the theater after this movie and ask "What was that all about?"
Still it did make me chuckle a couple of times, laugh once and cry lots when after ten minutes discovered it still wasn't over...
Anyway, I passed this one up time after time at the "used" store, but finally broke down and got it because I was intrigued.
The two deck out in cameo and carry high-powered machine guns into their dreams to fight back after one's wife is raped and killed by a ghost.
A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him.
This is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director Joby Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen at his first major role after having taken off the Anakin Skywalker costume, fabulous Jessica Alba and super-gifted Lena Olin.
..and I say that after much thought - it's not just a knee-jerk reaction.
Terrance Howard still recovering from the diabolical August Rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing Christianson and after viewing his performance I would gladly assists.
Alba, still recovering after Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver surfer.
I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it.
The list doubtless includes films that some do not consider bad (two films on Medved's list are also in Roger Ebert's Great Movies) but I have not disagreed with any of Medved's selections after sitting through them.
It was a lame attempt to present some of George Gershwin's music, shortly after his death, in a plot less musical.
There were four blokes: Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo - one hilarious comic genius after another.
This film is am embarrassment to Laurel and Hardy and the truly fine comedies they made both before and after this.
There are some good lines and some good bits of businessÂwhen Stan pretends to be Bo-Peep and gets married to Barnaby, Ollie is ready to leave him there because, after all, he is marriedÂbut nothing can save this well-intentioned, badly written, feverishly energetic, garish movie.
The elevator scene was beyond ridiculous, too much fist-fighting, I never once saw a thirdspace ship destroyed before or after the climactic event, and you'd think that Sheridan might have once been rammed into by a passing ship!
What's move baffling to me is this guy actually got real directing work after (Narc and Smokin' Aces).
In fact, after I purchased the 2 DVD disc set and watched it 3 times, I gave it to a friend of mine for his collection because I didn't even like the other movie included in the DVD set {Dead of Night} .
Then to solve all the problems... it was made possible sending him to the past... well i can't comment on that, i'll just assume it as a possibility in movie's reality, though it would be kind of impossible to imagine it after so much trouble sending the mass of little sheet of paper.
But even when he was sent to the past, after the girl's rescue, the screenwriter created suspense by making characters once again stupid and complicating everything.
Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and "Claire" (Paula Patton) had been set.
Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: In Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams after the line "Tommy doesn't know what day it is...", they showed almost *no* Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We're Not Gonna Take It (Listening to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's blazing guitar chords.
I'd thought I'd seen the worst after open water but Hostel wins that honor hands (or stumps) down.
I bought this turkey after browsing the blurbs and pics on the back of the case.
Towards the end of Hostel a woman kills herself after looking at the reflection of her newly disfigured face.
Another scene where a one-eyed Asian girl jumps in front of a train after viewing her deformed face had me crying.
I'll start by saying that I was reluctant to even see this movie but after some insistence by family, I sat and watched in pure enjoyment.
We see an assortment of colorful characters wanting a room such as: a weary hooker, a masquerading wife with her severely disturbed husband and frantic child, a father and daughter looking for a missing person, and a young Robert Englund who happens to be an arrogant patron of the local whorehouse... "Eaten Alive" is basically Hooper working off the success of "TCM" to a visually lesser extent... Every interior and exterior is obviously a set and, as I mentioned, the characters seem to role in, one after another, just to be killed off by the croc.
Being huge TCM fans we went for Death Trap, after all, Tobe Hoopers second film has to be worth watching right?
Before M. Night Shamaylan started making horribly inadequate movies after the superior "Sixth Sense" Tobe Hooper twenty years earlier was following up his cult masterpiece "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" with the dull and moronic "Eaten Alive".
The acting is horrible, the special effects are horrible and the plot is horrible....hey, what do you know, I guess it lives up to it`s name after all.
Me and my 9th grade English class watched The Old Man and the Sea movie after reading the book.
People even clapped after the film ended and such applause was well deserved.
And I almost burst out laughing when Seth said "red... COLOR" after he became human even though the whole film was shot in color and nothing hinted that he couldn't see colors.
On the one hand, I'm happy when I read a review, where the user states, he wants to visit Greece after watching the movie.
Seven years after her unexpected success with "My Big, Fat Greek Wedding", star Nia Vardalos looks slimmer and more glamorous than she did in her debut, yet she portrays almost the same self-defeating character as Georgia, a history professor who came to Greece to teach but ends up leading tourists around its ancient ruins.
This film is a rehash of other movies that capitalized on being travelogues where the action is placed as an after thought.
I was expecting a feel-good movie of the BFG-Wedding caliber....... maybe that was the reason that this was disappointing.... after the BFGW which was simply very good this could only be worse
Luckily for him, no cars come by after the initial three that appear right after Dolan's Cadillac is driven into the hole.
When we find out after the first group of murders who has been kept alive and how they are connected to the second story line (Clay's search for his sister), I had spent so much time being repulsed by the group of friends that I really had no emotional stake (re: I couldn't even remember the character's name) in whether the girl lived or died.
Fortunately, Mr. Bava had the good sense to quit after one entry; that good judgment is missing from the American side which merely sees the opportunity to squeeze a little more cash out of a dated idea.
Jason runs (*sigh*) after his victims.
Why was his body still intact after all those years in the lake?
It looks and sounds like a "real" film, soÂ In addition to the vitriolic writing, the acting proves way better than anyone in his right mind will expect from what is after all "just" porno.
And a little obligatory nudity from our heroic pixie helps her fans put up with the mediocre goings-on before and after.
A Flanders panel painting comes to light in Spain after 500 years in the private hands of a noble family who live in an ancient castle.
The only problem I have with this film is the unbelievably annoying soundtrack; it's loud, piercing and doesn't leave my head until several days after I've seen the movie.
There are different opinions, after all.
One clichÃ© after another, not a single original concept.
I almost cried after watching this move, not because it was emotionally moving, but because I wasted $5 to rent it for the weekend.
She tries innovative ways to separate people from their hidden earnings, which is, after all, her job.
Even after they are given room to act, however, they have to deal with such cheesy and dated lines as, "Are you out of your whim-whams?"
Besson attempts to tell a grand scale story with unsatisfying small scale scenes, there is little tension after the opening.
The movie spent too much time on the goofs after the main characters went through a body swap.
"That," I thought of the movie when it was over, "after setting aside all the comic exaggeration, is the real Japan."
Others than a few short scenes here and there the titular creatures don't get a great deal of screen time and pretty disappear from the movie after the halfway point leaving the audience to watch a flaccid melodrama/thriller minus what is presumably the movies hook.
It is about a tax woman, after all--the only woman amongst her coworkers.
Considering half the play is missing, we start slowly, and after Gloucester hits the beach, grind to a complete halt.
That's right after hearing the sheriff come up with a abysmally lame theory that there's a giant lizard involved.
A train wreck caused by the monster was simply a model train rolling off the end of the track down into some dirt.No grinding of metal or massive dust clouds thrown up or anything,just a little train flopped down in the dirt with some dubbed in screams from the 'passengers'.Anyway after the sheriff sits in his office a whole bunch Chase goes out and ends the movie in a really implausible silly finale.
The film looks as if it was made by a group of high school students after they had got their first movie camera.
If at a cinema I would've assaulted a crippled ticket kiosk on my way out after 30'.
I've never been compelled to write a review of a film, but after watching 108 minutes of people saying "ummm" I feel I have no other choice.
The fairly simple plot setup in "A Taxing Woman" derives its incredible depth by the fact that it's almost entirely character-driven - Miyamoto and Yamazaki are such vivid personalities and the opposing chemistry between them so potent that you will find yourself thinking about them for weeks after the fact, as though they were your close personal friends.
That is my psychological litmus test for a great film: "Do the characters stay with me long after I've seen it?"
That element is underscored in the real world by the fact that director Itami was attacked on the street and had his face slashed by five Yakuza in 1992 after the release of his film "Minbo no Onna," a.k.a.
Unfortunately, after about 15 minutes I couldn't give damn what happened.
Why did the movie leave out his college love interest died falling from a balcony, his parents house mysteriously burnt to the ground after being for sale after he inherited it.
It is after all the 60's and the world is hardly easing into change of attitude toward war, personal rights, personal freedoms and the mixing of the races.
He is under the mistaken impression that they are after something  other than human flesh, plus they move slowly, so the remaining  people should be able to out run the dead.
Bizarre angle where a "young boy" Michael(Peter Bark who actually looks older than the actress portraying his mother)lusts after his mommy Evelyn(Mariangela Giordano, who really loves to widen her eyes)groping her sexually in one scene.
There's no plot to speak of other than one dimensional characters in search of an exit off the grounds of their host's castle with slow zombies lumbering after them.
Boy, was I disappointed after watching it.
Just how bright and charming Jenna happened to marry a Neanderthal like Earl is never fully explained, except for a reference to the fact that he "changed" after he married her.
Jenna becomes pregnant after an ill-advised bout of drunken lovemaking with Earl, which sidetracks her plans of becoming independent.
Mom has baby, ditches controlling husband, gets a big fat legacy, ends her dead-end affair, and lives happily ever after.
as she said many times, will be too often a result for many women after seeing that movie, when that is the stupidest thing they could do, not warranted and not beneficial, thinking life is better without men altogether.
I'm no prude, I don't think that conjoined twins are funny in general, but there certainly was a lot of potential for original jokes, after all its not a situation you come across everyday or in many movies.
Yes, politicians deserve some blame, but I really doubt that the only guilty one's have Rs after their names.
Well, the director, master craftsman Robert Anderson, who also has credits The Young Graduates and The Hoax (not the Richard Gere one, remember that for the exam), movies no one but his wife has probably seen, and so with Cindy and Donna, his first film, he puts everything he knows into his art... which means, basically, we get a scene like when Donna is totally 'doing it' with her pot dealer in the car at night, and Cindy is looking on but, you know, the angle of the car is so radical so that there's no way Cindy is looking in on the car that the angle of the camera is and... Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, this is, after all, Grade-X trash that has basically no value; a Cinemax late-night flick probably has better production value, and maybe slightly worse music than the repetitive garage rock here.
The material is spartan when it comes to plot development and really is just one sleazy scenario after another.
I just bought Drive-in Cult Classics at Best Buy today and quickly put in Cindy and Donna after reading what this movie was about, hey I'm a guy and it sounded great!!!
It was also very interesting for me to have to dub in some of my lines after the movie was finished.
Matando Cabos is a smart comedy about two friends that try to get Cabos a powerful and fearful business men in Mexico City to his home after he get hit.
And, the vampires require a justice to arrive after enough time has been provided for possible escape to declare their prisoner guilty, although, to their credit, they never do that again.
As the sequel to the much beloved Tremors, it's easy to say that it's not nearly as good, but it is a respectable continuation that, after a relatively slow starts, mirrors the fun of the original without being a blatant rehash.
At first, killing the graboids is relatively easy for Bassett and Grady, but after a little trouble, they enlist the help of gun fanatic Burt Gummer (Michael Gummer).
+ SPOILER ALERT + Well, after seeing this movie, I often pondered to myself; "Why did Aladdin and Jasmine get married again?".
Three; after all the trouble poor Aladdin goes through to get his dad the Hand, his father hurls it out to the sea.
One wonders if after High Art a lot of directors have decided to cast her in lesbian roles.
It goes downhill after that.
Baldwin is always irritating no matter what he's in and he's astonishingly primitive here and after talking with Sheedy's character he asks her to arm wrestle!
There was also the local Shealter Island Sheriff Deluca, Chris Penn, who also got into the act later in the movie, after you forgot all about him and thought that his brainless actions earlier were just comic relief.
Whatever happened to Eighth Wonder singer Patsy Kensit after she appeared in the high voltage, high energy thriller 'Lethal Weapon 2'?
Kensit plays the lesbian girlfriend Alex, to Alley Sheedy's motivational speaker character, who persuades her girlfriend to escape the big city after she is brutally attacked.
Or that any artiest has only one timed opportunity to be creative and after its end there will be no more ingenuity ??!
Powder is not one of them - after a promising beginning, it turns into one of the worst films I have ever seen.
It's not that he's a nasty man, more that he has lived a simple and uncomplicated life and he finds it hard to relate properly to another human being (especially of the opposite sex) after so many years of labouring away in such lonely surroundings.
Leonard Nemoy does give his voice talents, however "Mountrouds" voice is horribly annoying, especially after about an hour of watching the film.
Even though mom arrived minutes after the tornado hit (and had to evade a police roadblock to do so) the daughter -- who had, by the way, ignored an earlier cellphone message from weather-guru mom warning of the impending twister -- tears a strip off mom, apparently for not being there with her while the school was being torn apart ("Where were you?
If I were the studio, I would never have picked up "T.J. Hooker" after seeing this travesty.
OK this is the 2nd appearance of The Pink Panther even though there were several other titles with that name it has nothing to do with it it was only in for a cameo where someone steals it and Cluesau is kidnapped (after the abomination of the first one I'm celebrating) and some journalist asks questions about Cluesau (Cluesau isn't in this one only in Archive Footage I know a complete ripoff even though so was the rest of the series) and they ask even Charles the real "Phantom" makes an appearance we see Clueseau's childhood and all this other crap which has nothing to do with anything if the journalist was really an author writing bio's about detectives who are so stupid it isn't funny (the only other thing in that category is FAMILY GUY) OK Clueseau isn't found.
NOTHING at all was funny after the first half.
The power of that role pushed director Blake Edwards to do another "Panther" film, a couple of years after Sellers' death.
"Trail"'s story involves the robbery of the Pink Panther diamond in Lugash (once again), but that remains unsolved even after this film ends, for the real plot is the disappearance of clumsy Inspector Closeau.
After all David Niven was already seriously ill at the time and also died shortly after shooting.
As an avid Pink Panther freak, I have nothing but contempt for the Panthers made after the death of the 'master'.
Rather than despairing about the loss of a comedic genius or the choices made by studios or Director Blake Edwards after his death, my review will focus on Trail of the Pink Panther's successful eulogy for the series and the great Peter Sellers.
Lom, Kwouk and Lumley turn in the best performances here, and after Clouseau's disappearance, Lom and Kwouk are really the only performers who occasionally create a laugh.
At the end of the film, after having created a deep bond through knowledge of each other, beyond only sexual knowledge, both the physical and emotional planes are almost familial in nature.
For example, we learn at the very beginning of the film (after the moaning, groaning, and grunting stops) that these two people don't know each other's names.
Some dead actors have managed to reappear after they died in films, like Jean Harlow in SARATOGA, but usually they were shooting the film when they got sick and died.
Edwards would make another "Pink Panther" film after this, which did less box office than this one did.
I saw this film after I saw 'Curse', and I was shocked at the number of scenes played out in 'Curse' that were in this film.
This pleasure is hampered by the fact that Sellers was really struggling - he was close to death, after all.
But then it gets decidedly ridiculous, and after a while you feel very cheated - Edwards has booked bums on seats in theatres without giving us any kind of movie at all.
I still can't figure out why they made a Pink Panther movie after Peter Sellers died.
And then there was another Pink Panther movie after this.
I almost stopped watching after an hour, but i recommend watching through the whole thing; at the very least, there's plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy.
Unfortunately, I think this scene is very pale (the acting and the setting) if compared to the Before Sunrise one, and is a bit out of the context of the movie (it definitely doesn't make sense in a motel bed right after the two made passionate wild sex).
Repeatedly, Leila's husband drops Leila off at the side of a busy street or random highway to aimlessly wander about the roadside until the husband drives back after his afternoon errands and picks her up.
Repeatedly, Leila's husband drops Leila off at the side of a busy street or random highway to aimlessly wander about the roadside until the husband drives back after his afternoon errands and picks her up.
And the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part.
Then, the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the DNA detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind ("a creature knows what threatens it").
On the contrary, the characters of "En la Cama" get together to have pure sex, after which they don't even remember their names, spend the whole movie in one nondescript motel room (other than it has a sign reading "sexit"), and there are no romantic possibilities for them.
I wanted to send him money after this.
For some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.
And the werewolf is naturally still after her, while she continuously injects herself with monkshood to stave off her inevitable transformation.
I am not sure why he continued to after she started trying to eat his flesh.
The character Akira, had his foot stabbed but after 20 minutes it seems to have healed.
It's a nice character study of two people out for a one night stand in a hotel room after meeting at a party.
The original two Hellraiser films are absolute classics, and while I quite liked the boisterous third part - I'd really rather they stopped making sequels after Hellbound.
The plot revolves around Kristys husband Trevor and his abnormal life after a car accident.
He once was a true symbol of all that represents evil but, after 6 episodes, he merely looks like a lame philosopher who prefers to plea instead of to kill.
While I certainly can't complain about the sex scenes, the interesting part of the movie is what happens after (Or, uh, in between) them.
His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his "French Laundry" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic).
I think someone must have watched that movie and tried to model Leoni's character after it.
I found my self so dis-satisfied that after the movie stops (it has no ending per se, it just stops), I walk out trying to write my own fairale stopend to Spanglish, a comdram I could have done without!
Angry, that Ferdinand and Isabella have decided to keep him in Spain, he angrily retorts: "My name will be long remembered long after they're both dead!"
Mel Gibson plays a military test pilot who agrees to become the subject of a cryogenic experiment after the love of his life ends up in an 'irreversable' coma in 1939.
I can't manage those pay phones after one night's sleep, never mind 53 years.
And they (the people slurred against) are supposed to grin and bear it because it is all in good fun, after all.
They don't have to watch it, after all.
On the other hand, if I watch something like South Park, I'll laugh quite a bit, but after it's over, it leaves me feeling a tiny bit blah.
This show has 1/4 the laughs of South Park but 4 times the dirty feeling you get after watching it.
Other than the same jokes being repeated show after show after show, the plot is pretty much being driven by Orel's stupidity.
The Foundation would soon come back after a terrible decision by Crush to take out the ref rather than Bret Hart who was pinning Smash - deliberate or rookie mistake?
Shortly after the disqualification decision on Demolition (making it 1-1), Ax comes to the ring and hides under the apron and from there Smash switches sides so a fresh Ax comes into play.
Legion of Doom come to the ring shortly after to serve justice to Demolition.
Crush gets schoolboy pinned after taking a ringside slingshot from Niedhart making it 2-1 to The Hart Foundation to become new tag team champions.
This got poor Dusty distracted, ambushed and pinned after use of Sherri's loaded purse within a very short space of time.
Dusty screaming for Sapphire after the match as she went off in Ted's limousine was quite an image.
The difference between this match and other Hogan matches is that Earthquake loses by count-out after getting slammed on a table which is an awful booking decision.
I wasn't convinced that Rude would win the match after he went to the top of the cage following the 'Rude Awakening' neck breaker.
the cops are chasing after someone.
The dialog was made of one clichÃ© after another suitably punctuated for effect such as when Walters (Luana Walters that is, here credited as Susan) announces to her husband Dixie Logan "Even if you were framed I know now that you're ROTten" (emphasis on ROT).
A coming of age film, that reveals itself photo after photo, and a very funny approach to the Mexican and American cultures.
I was fortunate in that the DVD I have has been gut to 1:43mins, but still had to reach for the fast forward button after 1:30mins.
Perhaps DY decided to make a Western, then after finishing the script watch Sixth Sense and thought "WOW!
I used to make jokes about Pee-wee taking on Chuck Norris in a movie, but after seeing him in this, maybe it's not so far fetched.
We rented this DVD shortly after Noble Willingham's death, thinking that we would watch it as a tribute.
Casey's old gang and surrogate family keeps popping up and a lot of people are killed and Casey goes after them and eventually everything gets sorted out, although even after just watching the whole thing I couldn't have told you how.
The plot - a parable depicting a man's quest to find someone who will bury him after he commits suicide - moves with glacial speed.
the scenes are arranged one after the other, but there is absolutely nothing linking them.
overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.
Whoever is responsible for the grisly acts is not going to give up his secret without a fight....will they be able to survive the avenging force that has been sent after them from hell?
The entire movie suddenly fell out of place and entered a whole other dimension where fact and fiction had to be divided and after dividing it the whole movie became fiction.
It even includes the old chestnut where the lovable whores' leave the relative safety of their lodgings one by one (after being warned to stay of the streets!)
Yet, after Boone finally kills the man, then someone raises a pistol and fires it--at which point the horses THEN take off!
A good movie on paper does not necessary result in a good movie on screen Â is the big, loud and clear message one gets after seeing this crap.
Sherlock Bones is the heartwarming tale of a small boy, his potentially dangerous father, his veterinarian love interest (who wears a lab coat in the one scene of her working, for the next three scenes, and then never again in the entire movie), her incredibly badly acted miscreant child, a talking dog, and an entire cast and crew of people who make a series of misjudged decisions after another.
This joke reaches a crescendo when a whole bunch of carts, all chained together, get nudged and end up rolling downhill, all passing over his foot one after another.
You'd think after the first one crushed it, he would at least withdraw his leg but NNOO that would ruin the joke!
I'm coming after all... How do we end this sodding movie?
It's so bad that it's good ...and then bad again and then finally...after a long, long time (a millennium at least)... maybe good...?
The final stupidity occurs when Robert Joy tells Ladd she will have Kristofferson's child, after she has made it clear she is sterile.
I have lost count of the number of people to whom I have recommended the 1983 S.F.novel "Millenium",written by John Varley.Nineteen of the twenty chapters are named after classic time travel stories and the name of each is relevant to the context,which,on the face of it might seem like a contrivance,but if it is a contrivance it's one that works very well.It's not a quick read,neither is it a book to be taken on a plane as the plot revolves around air disasters in which there are no survivors(a surprising amount - worryingly).
There are two prologues,the second one placed after the epilogue,so if you want a book to read on the beach keep on with Dan Brown.
I'm not kidding, this movie was uglier and the characters moved more unnatural than in any game release after Doom II.
The story is about sleepy hollow and after the movie there were some additional footage from behind the scenes.
But it hardly mattered as Mama Dracula's plot is there only to set up one lame comedic bit after the next Â most involving the twin vampires played by the Wajneberg brothers.
The witty banter turns your stomach after a while.
But after 20 minutes, I couldn't stand the torture any longer.
The remake did have spine -chlling ending but this ending was really good to, as it show how mad you can get after being in such a really bad nightmare.
In essence the movie has scene after scene that does nothing but emphasize and embellish hate over and over....someone gets out of line...BANG...someone spits the wrong way.....BANG.....someone talks out of line....BANG...then the end of the movie comes and guess what????
Okay, I watched this just now, many, many years after seeing The Big Chill.
This NEVER could have happened in the TV series and in many ways makes the show irrelevant--after all, what's funny about moving to Hootersville and then leaving because it DID suck after all?!
The difference in Brigitte's character after the traumas she suffered in the first movie are both believably sad and shocking, showing that Perkins is an actress of the highest caliber.
It stands as a 'tour de force' in film-making, which rejects the temptation to moralise and tub-thump and is wonderfully aesthetic, allusive and after all gets us talking.
Whether it's the first victim twitching uncontrollably after being clubbed on the head with a lump-hammer, witnessing the next being hung on a meat-hook or watching poor old Sally being held down to be 'whacked' by a cadaverous old man, the nightmarish images of Hooper's movie will stay with you long after the film has finished.
Its not even worth discussing the illogic of the plot, its twists, or how good the amusement park looks after being abandoned for so many years.
It leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl.
I think they got the point after that was said for the billionth time.
Even over thirty years after release, it is still terrifying, which can not be said of many well-remembered horror films.
Its a shame he never made another great film after this, and eventually directed the incredibly overrated "Poltergeist".
This gets quite annoying after a while.
The plot gets dumber and dumber and after about half an hour my endurance was spent.
Blair, Knoxville and Ullman's families should all be instructed to love them less after starring in this dreck.
Why she, after proving that she had obvious talent in other roles, ever agreed to this is beyond me.
But not after reading this script and saying "Let me get this straight, I talk about how good promiscuity is and having huge knockers, and pole dance through the entire thing?"
"A Dirty Shame" is a John Waters film about a prudish, uptight mid-western woman who, after having concussion in a motor vehicle accident, becomes a raving sex addict.
Rather, it set the stage for numerous films that came after, and it may not resonate with younger audiences who are more accustomed to the films that have been made since.
He eventually tries to kill both of them, and gets stabbed by a warrior after he kills yet another of the tribesmen by 'accident'.
Some people, who have never seen it before, wonder what's so great about it after watching it for the first time, well, this is probably because TCM is the most copied movie of all time and TCM will look too familiar to newbies.
You can really see the difference in movies made before TCM and those made after TCM became a big hit.
The film is one amazing moment after another, from beginning to end.
You'd think her career would have taken off after TCM but it didn't.
Their friends believe they are somewhat in love with each other and soon things get out of hand causing their perfect friendship to be in trouble since both are not after the same thing...
Jennifer is going to Italy after graduation, and surprisingly they spend a night together, after which she skitters away saying they should just be friends, and he is withdrawing also.
In fact, you never really have time to think about what you are seeing until after the film has ended, which leaves an indelible image of a skin-masked madman waving a chain saw around his head in anger.
If there was going to be a sequel it should of been done right after the original.
What happened to Tobe Hooper's career after it is anyone's guess, but TCM is good enough to top entire filmographies of other directors.
Well I've just returned from the cinema after watching this movie.
Adam better get his act in gear, because after The Wedding Singer (ugh) I had hoped to see him return to good form.
They're close-knit, and as Franklyn says after the Hitchhiker slits himself and endures it: 'Gotta admire that".
The other good thing is the scenes involving Stu Lancaster and the incomparable Uschi Digart as a married farm couple who take Clint in after he is mugged.
Utter tripe, but worth viewing for:  1) The fight scene between the Russian officer and Strike Commando near the end - particularly the head clash after running at each other head on from 20 ft.  2) The Russian officer managing to utter his final word: "Amerikanskiiiii!!!"
This is a type example of a show which just have gone on and on, years after it should have been canceled.
As one car breaks down, the owner of the other car drives past and gloats, only to have his car break down soon after and the other car start up again.
Pam enters soon after to find the house filled with furniture made from human bones.
Ginger Snaps took a risk, after just recovering from the Columbine Massacre and other uproars in teen violence, Ginger Snaps 1 could have been more appropriate, but they weren't and it worked.
Pretty much after Bridgette and Ghost escape the hospital is where it gets bad.
I saw this on cable last night, just 2 days after seeing the Sprecher sisters' latest film, 13 Conversations About One Thing - that was the reason I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. to watch it, in fact (please read my review of 13 Conversations, posted yesterday).
As the character has been developed by other script writers, we have come to realize that he, after a while, does not blame himself completely for all these deaths.
But after the god-awful performance from everyone in that film, you can't tell me he didn't deserve it!
This scene happens about 11 or 12 minutes in, so after that it goes back to suck.
We're talking about a man who saw his parents killed right in front of him as a boy; got hell from all his trainers as he prepared to become Batman; saw a close friend's double personality destroy him; after failing save a girl from drowning, got addicted to a steroid pill for which he had to lock himself in the cave for a month to recover from it(hence the unbelievability of the heroin addiction part); had his second Robin brutally murdered; had another sidekick (Barbara Gordon) paralyzed at the hands of the Joker; saw his other best friend, Gordon, stripped naked, tortured, and tormented with pictures of his daughter, also stripped, just after she had been shot and paralyzed; after going a week with less than a day's sleep rounding up all of Arkhum's inmates after they had escaped, got his back busted by steroid-laced madman; saw his beloved city have its own Black Death from the "Clench" virus, then further carnage when it got leveled by a 7 point earthquake.
With all that, why would Batman give in after finding out he unintentionally sent an innocent man to the slammer, then sent into a heroin trip, and raped?
People who have a taste for the brutally bizarre will probably hit play again after the credits roll.
But after finding out Howard Hughes directed it ...
It was made in 1949 when its shallow plot would have barely made political sense to movie goers; but wasn't released until 1957, four years after the US Air Force had trounced the North Koreans and Russians in aerial combat in the Korean War.
The plot seems as though it was made up as they went along (on a few occasions, I thought a reel must be missing) and I don't think I'm giving anything away (like there was any suspense anyway) by saying John Wayne must really love Janet Leigh to stay with her after she pistol whips him.
Jet Pilot was released seven years after it was originally filmed and by then the planes really looked out of date.
Why then would you have the shapely Janet Leigh filling out a flight suit after allegedly going off course and landing in the USA?
By the way at the time this was being filmed, Howard Hughes was panting after Janet Leigh the same way he'd earlier panted after Ava Gardner.
I think what is still with me after this is the sense of fear and utter WEIRDNESS that emanates from the movie...  And it all seemed so realistic...no hokey fountains of blood, no running into the shower, or overused cliches, just a bunch of kids that need to get some gas, meet some very odd characters (The Hitchhiker is superb) and then fall into the wrong place at the wrong time...
John Landis as a director gets worse with every outing after peaking with "Trading Places" where Akyroyd's patented anal-retentiveness played well off Eddie Murphy's con-man charm.
I had no idea who Dylan and Cole Sprouse were and after seeing this film, I was surprised to learn that they had a career in film--both before AND after this terrible movie.
Arnold disappeared soon after "Just For Kicks" begins and only turns up again in the last scene.
The film started off well but lost its touch after fifteen minutes as itloses its way gradually and one can expect only the worse as the movie progresses.
4)Relentless Horror (Leatherface RUNS not speedwalks after his victims with a live chainsaw... there's no time to trip and fall or your booty is chainsaw bait)  5)The ability the film has to scare you with almost a complete lack of gore (the only "gory" scene is when Leatherface accidently cuts his thigh with the chainsaw).
But after it was pointed out that Memento had a similar(which I believe is exaggerated, it is the SAME not similar), Aamir said his movie was better as he could not understand Memento(I could not understand what Einstein said, so I'm better huh?
One of my favourite actors, Surya stars as Sanjay Ramasamy, the rich businessman who, after an incident, suffers from an incurable short-term memory loss.
Memento portrays a handsome looking smart and brilliant guy (even during memory loss) who meticulously plans his everyday with pictures and tattoos on his body after having incorporated the illness.
My roommate rented this under the title "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits.
What else can I say, Jenny's character battles with her hero boyfriend and goes after the wrong guy, who well winds up being the villain.
(On a side note: Why would Germany be sending a passenger zeppelin around the world in 1938 - a full year after the Hindenburg disaster?)
Hardly something you'd expect after societal collapse.
What possible reason would Christie's character have for wanting to return to her dismal reality after her first time through?
It should be noted that the first Inkheart book is by far the weakest in the trilogy and after I finished it I was on the fence as to whether I was going to finish the series.
And really, after watching this movie, maybe it's a good thing because if they did the 'goofy lighthearted predictable' thing on books number 2 and 3, I would have been really disappointed.
It wasn't funny at all, it just got tiring after a while.
Leatherface's travesty of motherly domesticity as he prepares dinner, his child-like dance in the dawn light, the open door at the gas station, the van making it's slow turn off the road towards the derelict and ivy clad Hardesty residence are all images that burn themselves into your consciousness after just a single viewing.
only done with harder, crueller guests (but you now have to wonder, with all the inside exposes they do on these types of shows, whether it's all just been how they're told to behave all along...they have to move with the times, after all) who just seem utterly militant and unable to hear anyone's point but their own.
This has gone from being a 'sad' show to a truly pathetic show and it says a lot about society that six years after my first review it's still going on and it will nearly have been on air for twenty years!
I realize the main character had problems, but really... who goes skinny dipping just after meeting their fiancÃ©'s parents for the first time.
It involves one engagement and seems a bit "claustrophobic" or static at times, as you have trench after trench and explosion after explosion.
The behavior of Edward (Damian Young) after being tortured is reminiscent of Godard's acting; it cracks me up.
It's kind of like an abusive relationship: despite being hurt time after time, you can't break it off.
The title is well chosen except for one thing: they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands!
Just curious because the catch phrase on Dr Elson`s show is " look after each other and keep talking "
Besides, how do Kuntz and McGuire still have a job in America after writing this blatantly hatred-based "comedy"?
Themes include: crime does not pay; the inability to get a job after being released from prison (Travis was not guilty of the first crime); overcoming adversity to do the right thing (the hero must and does get rewarded for his efforts); and loyalty to friends vs. duties to family.
Ann Miler (as Eve) is a popular radio singer who wants to vacation after a successful season; but, her handlers want her to film a movie.
I don't remember if the Asian market crash was before or after this movie.
Probably after, but if it came before this movie I would point at that as a source of resentment towards globalization.
Bearing in mind that I am writing this review 11 years after seeing the film, I'd give it a huge thumbs down at 1/10.
Soon after arriving on the bit of land we are introduced to a lame one-liner leader and a group of passive raptors that only strike those who scream very loudly and fire their guns inaccurately.
Then, without warning after the crash, it went all down hill from there.
It has no artistic merit, and wound me up so much I actually finally got around to registering after using this site for years simply so I could post this dire warning..  Avoid at all costs.
While I can't blame MOONBIRD completely (after all, Columbia studios, Creston Studios and others produced cheap animation well before MOONBIRD), it is shocking when you compare the ultra-simple Eric Carle-style cartoon here with gorgeous MGM or Looney Toons cartoons in their heyday.
No, I haven't seen this film but after watching the trailer for it, I think I have enough reason to hate it.
The premise of the film is that evil needs five days after Will's 14th birthday to destroy the world.
The camera tries to make the movie seem like there is action about to happen, but after the third time of these "action" sequences that end in a protracted dialog that was, "Give me the signs boy!"
I first came across this sequence of books as an eleven-year-old boy myself, in 1980, 7 years after the book on which the eponymous book was published.
If after The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter, the bigwigs in the studios think that this sort of thing can pass as acceptable, then the legacy of Story is over already.
Will is your average awkward teen struggling to fit in after his father's job forced the family to move overseas from America to England.
The Rider keeps on appearing before our young hero, and sending demonic mall security guards and evil grannies who can summon snakes after him.
Did he pick them up in the end after all to ride the Harry Potter wave?
Right before the end, after he visits Mitnick, our Nakamura or so starts to seriously regret what he did.
The one thing that is obvious after watching this movie is that the egos of Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff are off the scale.
no charges were profered, nothing.. only after over 4 years of being locked in prison, sometimes in solitary confinement because they thought he was so dangerous, was he offered the plea bargain.
of course he took it.. after 4 years of prison without bail, without even a bail hearing, i think anyone would take it.
"Primeval" only just came out a couple of months ago, but it already earned itself a spot in IMDb's bottom 100 and receives one harshly negative review after the other.
I also found that character inappropriately funny given that the movie was released so soon after Corwin's death.
This made the movie boring and dull, and not what I was expecting - after all it is supposed to be about a crocodile.
The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused.
And unfortunately, after watching, digesting, and allowing this film to sink in, I can only reach the inescapable conclusion that this 'new school' consists of former music video directors who have watched Blade Runner far too many times.
Maybe Lyle Talbot, who's screen credits total nearly three hundred roles, but after that I think you'd be hard pressed to recognize another actor in the picture.
I saw this picture under the name "She Shoulda' Said No", and just like the classic cult film "Reefer Madness", it tells the story of youth run wild after falling victim to the evil terrors of marihuna (sometimes spelled marijuana as a closing segment informs us).
It'll keep you guessing til the end, but after that, you got nothing.
I was dry-heaving after the movie was over, and thought i was going to throw up.
I was going to ask for a refund after seeing this vile work, but it's not the theater's fault for letting trash like this into society.
After I had finished DBZ I heard about DBGT and I was so happy that they continued after with DBGT, I then watched the first episode of DBGT...
I watched this film after losing a bet with my fiend over who would win in a football match (log story).
So, after a lot of boring events laced with clichÃ©s that are too tiresome to think about, let alone write down, Georgia and her bestie, Jaz, split up and throw catty insults at each other during a netball game, the grand, dramatic finale when Georgia stomps on Jaz's foot.
First and foremost, it's a VERY bad idea to schedule a mainly story-driven and atmospheric horror movie like "The Garden" at 3am during a Film Festival and after exhilarating movies like "The Hills Have Eyes"-remake or "Neighborhood Watch"!
If your after a rambling collection of death scenes this is your dream DVD!.
However, if your after a serious documentary, then don't bother with this.
Just one still photograph after another, another silent video after that, all edited together randomly, with that annoying hack hairball "Damon Fox" providing an obnoxious and grating narrative.
As every other "shockumentary", "mondo death film" and the like out there "Traces of Death" also holds nothing back and pulls virtually no punches as we are treated to one revolting and sickening clip after another of people dieing and or being horribly injured in ways that no sane clear-thinking person could ever actually fathom!
On a personal note here I watched this lurid and thoroughly disgusting exercise in the grotesque a number of years back right after seeing both "Death Scenes: Volume 1" and "Death Scenes: Volume 2".
This makes the film just that much more disturbing if you ask me because when you're looking at live and in motion footage and can see exactly what led up to that person's death, one has a tendency to want to play that terrible scene over and over in their head for days after; and for me it isn't always done intentionally, it's just that it get's in your head and doesn't want to leave until you are able to focus your thoughts on something more pleasant instead until it goes away...which is easier said than done I'm afraid!
That is the type of damaging effect such films as this one can truly have on you, and if you find yourself doing the same thing as I just described after watching even one of these films I implore you: please avoid "Traces of Death" like you would the plague because ultimately all it will ever do is give you horrible nightmares and leave you thoroughly nauseated for days after viewing!
She certainly is improving film after film.
In Hungama there were two guys after her.
In this movie, there are seven characters who are after her.
Akshay was too irritating after the first 15 minutes of his intro.
One of the reasons why I tuned into this show was because I like Bruce Greenwood's work, but, after watching as much of it as I could stomach, I can only hope that Bruce was paid well.
I finally stopped watching after the scene in the stable.
I started watching this after seeing footage of devastation in the film's first 25 minutes thinking there's going to more, even it if was CGI or old archive stuff there would be more chaos--BUT I got instead was boring by the numbers human dramaÂHey this is not the Hallmark Channel; I was baited and then the emphasis of the movie switched--and I am still livid over it!
The writing is not layered with well-developed characters; instead, it is layered with one clichÃ© after another.
I already knew after watching Eat Your Heart Out that there was a love of overÂ theÂ top gore inherent in this film-making team, but a few scenes in Pink Eye took this to a new level.
Earlier, after Rudy shot the sheriff's deputy, he not only stole his cruiser but also his jacket.
This last sub plot is actually the most hilarious, since Sister Angela is hardly ever mentioned anymore after her initiation rites.
There aren't very many movies where after I've watched them I've wanted my time and/or money back, but unfortunately this was one of them!
Al I'm saying is don't make more Puppet Master movies because after part 4 if was boring, stupid, and pointless.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
Curse of the Puppet Master is worse than the five previous Puppet Master films & to be honest they should have stopped making them after Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge while the series was on a high.
It's sorta nice to see that movies can still inspire sheer, honest dislike even after being taught to be accommodating about art.
Leif goes after them with "vengeance" on his mind.
Only after viewing it, I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain.
If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember... "I told you so."
"Gass-s-s-s" is the perfect title for this film... you feel "gassed" after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a "gas" chamber for wasting your brain away.
So I came here to see what people thought, and saw one glowing review after another.
Juliette Binoche is an actress who after acting as Mary in a film about the life of Jesus is struck by religious fervor and apparently starts identifying herself wit the the Bible character.
Well, after reading the first 3 pages of comments, I can't believe anyone made it this far, but if you did, here is what I have to say....  "Sirocco" is a complete waste of time , unless you can learn what not to do in a film.
I suspect one reason why the Americans never heard about it that the American press was concentrating on Prohibition, robbers like Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, organized crime like Al Capone, labor strikes that occurred after World War I, and the communist scare of the 1920s.
The script is just a confusion of parts and after watching it again, Bogart seems to be playing second fiddle to Lee J. Cobb.
Sirocco was one of those independent productions that Humphrey Bogart's Santana productions did for Columbia Pictures after Bogey's long term contract with Warner Brothers expired.
The story takes place in Damascus after World War I with the French given a mandate by the League of Nations over the former Ottoman Empire territory of Syria and the Syrians not really too crazy about it.
Every possible stereotypical Sicilian mob element possible has been brought into this production, but instead of making the individual components work, it flooded the story line with unnecessary "Italianizations;" most of them ineffectual and out of place, clashing with one another, and rendering scene after scene nearly unwatchable.
In some cases, the filmmakers apparently tried to correct this after completing the main shooting, adding some voice-over dialogue on top of exterior shots by way of exposition.
To sum it up right away : as far as I'm concerned , the script is very lame , plot is full of highly unbelievable events , dialog is clumsy and doesn't sound convincing at all , acting is mostly bad , story is plagued with one stereotype after another , there is not enough gore , violence and perversion to justify this pathetic , unimaginative exercise in bad cinematography ...
She sends various minions, each weirder than the last, after our heroes who win through in the end, striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere.
Not long after they meet, he is testing out Ilias' bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman, minding his own business, walking along and Mace shoots him dead.
Not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the Dark Ages after all)Âit is, quite simply, very poor stuff indeed.
Fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness (after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bowÂso much for his own supposed physical strength!)
I'm glad to know that in the future cyborgs will be modeled after the band Devo.
Director Jason Kohn has no interest in exploring or understanding the issues the film purports to examine, rather pandering to the audience by prodding his subjects to tell their most shocking stories and judging them immediately after.
The reaction Mr. Kohn is after, and is quite talented at achieving, is a "Wow, that's f****d up!".
Gary, a rather bad dime-store romance novelist, soon after watching a sensationalist tabloid news show about the recent rash of people that have been dying in their sleep, is worried about his girlfriend who is having trouble sleeping (he's an insomniac himself) So when his war veteran neighbor tells him about the Sandman he's frightened (not by the vet's story, more his demeanor) add to this the fact that Gary's worthless leech of a cousin has just moved in to his trailer.
Some people say that this game is the best FPS game after legendary Half Life from 1998.
The game become very boring after a few hours, because it's all the same; you come to the island, start shooting at the enemy, enter a base or laboratory, shoot new bunch of enemies, push the button or something like that and in the end shoot some more enemies.
Far Cry is overall an average FPS game with bad story and terrible voice acting, annoying game play and after a few hours it become boring and predictable.
Again and again, one finds oneself mystified by Alex's actions: If he's meant to be a selfish man, only out for himself and afraid of commitment--leaving his wife after the wedding without a word--why, on the other hand, is he so dangerously loyal to a pathetic female drug dealer?
Ten years after brutally murdering two girls during the ride, as well as hiding other victims on or near the premises; a sick killer escapes from his cell in a mental institution.
The ride is being re-opened after all these years and the gruesome slayer wants to reclaim his former turf.
One can only wonder what the film would have been like had it been made a few later, after the advent of sound.
There's a scene mid-way through where all the characters are in the dark ride talking in panic to one another and you absolutely lose your sense of place because of the way it's shot and edited...it reminds me of the parody short films shown at the beginning of the brilliant "The Big Picture" and I actually had to laugh after a certain point, it went on so long.
Surprise who else is a killer, but then lets the girl go after she killed his brother, and after he killed a guy for facing his brother?!
A blatant rip-off of Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse (1981), Dark Ride sees a bunch of obnoxious teenagers (hot women, some studs, and a guy who looks like an unhealthy, ginger Elijah Wood) being murdered by a hulking psycho after opting to spend the night in an abandoned fairground ride.
But they end up in Asbury Park because one finds a pamphlet in a restroom that trumpets the opening of the Dark Ride, a boardwalk attraction that shut down many years ago after twin sisters got killed.
If you cannot make someone likable after 40 minutes of character development?
If their confinement was actually impregnable after the cast exhausted all options of getting out, then the terror would have been present.
The three cars travel across the long winding roads & encounter a dirty blue truck which Carl gets involved in a road rage incident with which turns out to be a bad idea since the driver of the truck then decides to go after the friends & kill them one-by-one...
To sum it up, after about 20 minutes, she kept lighting up her watch to see what time it was.
His roommate is a hilarious typical wannabe-gangsta film maker who should have had lines after the first third of the film but didn't, and they bunk with a repressed homosexual fashion major used for good cheap laughs.
I read an interview with the director (who didn't come for Q & A after this one), and he said the storyline has a lot to do with his fear of New York, along with his fascination for it.
Spoofing everything from musicals (Darktown after Dark) to prison films (3 Chairs for Lefty) to public service announcements (Buddy Hackett on bed wetting) to biker films (Skateboarders from Hell) to Charlie Chaplin films (The Kid and the Yid) and a few things in between this is a very hit or miss film.
Because she got treated badly after she "came out" there's now almost this unwritten obligation and sense of right to applaud to everything she says and does.
The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf.
I blame this soley on the poor direction of Steve Barron, who blew a golden opportunity to right the ongoing injustice of one bad Arthurian film after another.
As Frik, he delivers line after line of irritating one-line inanities.
Often after a movie, I will sit to myself and think, "Was there anything redeeming at all about that movie, or did I just lose 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back?"
We're supposed to be amused when minor characters are interviewed on TV saying how strangely Pigeon acted -- after everyone assumes his wife is dead -- but he WAS acting strangely, so strangely that you wonder why no one reported him to the police while he was staying at the resort.
I guess, after Jaws, you were trying to prove that you could be SERIOUS, and WEIGHTY - and that translated inevitably as SLOW.
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" simply does not hold up after 27 years, which is quite unfortunate.
Produced during a slew of "happy alien" movies (followed by another slew of "mean alien" movies during the '80s after Ridley Scott's "Alien" in 1979), "Close Encounters" is at times amusing, annoying, fast, long, and silly, all at once.
But in 'The Winning Season', his true love is 'Mandy' who ends up breaking up with him after believing that his true love is baseball.
While Cobb was known for being overly aggressive on the field and having a bad reputation amongst his fellow ballplayers, he's turned into a virtual criminal when he attempts to blackmail Joe after stealing the Honus Wagner baseball card.
We see him here and there, in the jacuzzi or skidooing but then, after seemingly having disappeared from the movie, he reappears, dead in the jacuzzi, right after the moment Vernon and Thorson are shot.
The plot: A marine biologist heads for Port Amanzi in Africa after his friend, Mark DeSantis, is supposedly a victim of a fatal shark attack.
They soon both find out that Marc Desantis might not have been killed by a Shark after all and both begin to investigate.
Then after a mail incident, her first husband finds her and comes looking for his wife, which of course he is still in love with.
I watched this whole story to find out the reasoning of a religious event that happens in the first 5 minutes of the movie with a sick child becoming well after a spring of water appears out of the ground, at the very end of the movie the spring appears again, when the lady who runs stops running, I don't see how the 2 relate to the story line that seemed to be full of holes, and how a woman can leave her child and have that child have peace suddenly at the end of the movie is a bit to far fetched for me!
The audience is geered to feel empathy for these mothers who are forced to relinquish custody of their babies- yet despite a few initial protests, Rose does nothing to challenge the dictatorial Mother Superior or change any of her dictums even after she herself becomes a mother!
Eventually Rose's first husband finds the family shortly after Rose has taken off with only the tersest explanation but he seems perfectly willing to leave things be.
At the end, after someone smashes her car back window, Rose has an epiphany and drives back home and while a long-dry spring gushes to life, Rose gushes about how she's now Cecilia's 'REAL mother!'
Carole Landis has a minor though pivotal role that really doesn't use her comic talents, but Charles Middleton plays the archtypical villain role that he became known for...especially after he took on the role of Ming the Merciless in Flash Gordon.
Full disclosure: I hit my limit and stopped watching the movie about a half-hour into it (right after the main character arrived in Shanghai).
So that's why I'm giving it two stars, because maybe it got better after that.
The scene where he receives all his gadgets is very funny and at that point I thought I was gonna have a good time with the movie, but it starts to fall apart pretty quickly after that.
In 1642 Puritan America, a woman named Hester Prynne (Colleen Moore) is forced to wear a mark of shame, a Scarlet Letter "A" on her chest after being found guilty of adultery after bearing a child two years after her husband disappeared thought lost at sea.
The acting was gone right after the directing and then the story, etc.
Los Angeles detective Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is on the case & catches up with the killer but loses him after being stabbed in the heart, waking up in hospital Ferguson realises that he had heart surgery & that the killer is still at large, Ferguson's captain (Steven Williams) is on his case to get results & the pressure is also on from a sensationalistic media & a worried public.
A lonely spinster blossoms after finding love, but nobly sacrifices it in the end.
I saw GO after reading a number of very good reviews for the movie, and I cannot begin to express how disappointed I was.
It's very telling throughout the picture, but I'll only focus on some of the final scenes, which is everything that follows a car chase (I mean, after all, car chases are part and parcel in crazy American life).
Here we are now in 2008,exactly 10 years after, while i'm searching strange movies on IMDb for a good laugh,that this ''movie'' appears to my memories again and a long chill goes through my spine.
I have so many problems with this film....OK; after stealing $750,000, they just cross into Mexico in the front seat of the truck??
Just one failed attempt at humor after another, with such crude and flat gags.
I liked the passage after the dog has returned from the training camp best; the way he catches one of the burglars, and his subsequent criminal career.
Anyway, I don't think this was meant as a comedy (although after the beatnik scene I'm really not sure) but if you're looking for horror this only qualifies if you're looking for so bad it's good I need to be high to enjoy omg I'm horrified I paid for this.
Maybe I just expected too much after seeing Black Belt Jones.
Laughlin gained weight after the blazing success of "Billy Jack"--instead of getting buffer like Stallone for his follow-up "Rambo"--and it shows in the fight scenes.
Amazingly enough, this was the third Billy Jack film (after The Born Losers and Billy Jack) and the first to bomb at the box office.
Nevertheless, as someone who thoroughly enjoyed the book and was looking forward to the movie adaptation, this was a big disappointment The movie adaptation came out approximately seven years after the book was published.
We were given the book and, after a dozen or so slow hours, the book was finished.
When the dog is left at home after indulging in too much of Mom's new recipe while the family takes in a movie, the story gets interesting.
The films conclusion couldn't have been more obvious and expected even after being distracted from any possible merit pertaining to script ect by the nudity which in a perverse way made the entire thing worthwhile.
I've known a few people in the past who have disfigured themselves with sewing needles and indian ink and more often than not,after inhaling model glue.
I even agreed on buying hard-to-believe situations or coincidences, such as "he's a suspected runaway murderer BUT his house isn't even looked after by a cop".
Nonsensical event after nonsensical event, the director expects to raise some interest in the spectator with a bunch of dead fish, some "nightshot" camcorder pictures painted red, or the lame acting of all the actors (who, by the way, aren't even nice to look at).
Despite this, she works for a middle-aged couple (Derek de Lint and Alice Krige) looking after their infant child but before long, tragedy strikes when the baby is also killed in a fire.
Everybody in this movie is a stereotype, but most irritating was Mark Lester himself who, after doing such a fine job in "Oliver!," here only gets to run around looking perpetually frightened out of his wits.
I saw movie called 48 weeks later, why have I never heard of this movie before?, So picked up thinking it was a sequel to 28 Days later and it even says on the DVD what happens after 28 days later which is a massive lie.
The director John Mathew Mathan had gone into oblivion after his directorial debut 'Sarfarosh' that came in 1999.
So after 5 years when he decided to make Shikhar, it's not an exaggeration to say that the same audience expected the film to be if not more, at-last 5 times more powerful and impact making than Sarfarosh!
The memory of Sarfarosh is as fresh in the minds of people as it would have been after ten years, in other words, had Mathan taken even an eternity to bring to his loyal audience a quality film, they would have welcomed it with open arms.
Not a "thriller", this psychodrama spends most of its time dwelling on the criminal mind of the abductor, the anxiety and angst of the abductee's boyfriend, and flashbacking to show what transpired from the abductor's perspective after setting up the story with the boyfriend's perspective.
The elder Tierney sounded awful and it comes as no surprise that he passed away not long after this was made.
The adaptation mostly follows the line of the book with the enthusiastic Professor Frankenstein who is determined to create life after his mother dies giving birth his younger brother.
In the scene after Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) has brought the creature to life.
This is certainly an interesting study of a psychopathic killer and of the man who sets out to track him down after his fiance disappears mysteriously at a gasoline stop in France.
I rarely write online reviews, but after reading most of the comments here my fingers couldn't type fast enough.
Later in the movie after he decides he made a mistake in "playing god", he refuses to repeat the mistake on someone he had cared for by turning her into the monsters bride.
If you wouldn't recognise the character after five minutes of shallow jokes the actor puts on his crown and the camera pans to show his long nosed profile - aka king Matyas' most recognisable picture).
But after seeing 10 minutes of the film, I started to feel disappointed.
i would think Batman would be smart enough to not try to fight Dracula hand to hand, he would know to rethink his strategy after getting kicked around a few times.
In one of the scenes, they show vampires as being invisible in the mirror and then they show the Joker's reflection after he turns into a vampire.
This was released after Candy's death, and so Canadian Bacon is notable for his fans in that regard.
I also think he realized that was his calling after seeing this finished product.
This is the original Norwegian version of a film remade in America, by the same director, no less, about a boyfriend who becomes obsessed after his girlfriend vanishes right from under his nose at a gas station.
Because I wanted to see the original after seeing the trailer for the American version and hearing the original had a far better ending, I bought the Criterion DVD of this and watched it.
I mean in one scene, where the hero is being attacked by foe after foe, ad-nauseum, you see some of the "dead" move out of the way of another falling foe!
Since they both have a common problem in the shape of Lord Shin & his men they sort of join forces to defeat him, after some silly plot devices keep throwing them together.
I guess that's just about it, Kenshiro eventually meets up with Lord Shin & after some personal angst over Shin kidnapping Julia & murdering his Father they have a fight & that's about that.
I actually liked it during the first couple of minutes during the time, when the main character, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels) hadn't opened his mouth yet, but after he spoke and revealed, that besides the looks he hadn't slightest bit of acting talent I quickly stopped liking it.
Lord Shin, the lead bad guy also played by an American, kidnaps Kenshiro's girl Juliet and leaves Kenshiro for dead after brutally injuring him.
This was so bad... so typical Hollywood low-budget, post-apocalyptic tripe, that I aborted it after about 20 minutes.
The concept of a serial killer with supernatural powers who desperately attempts to transfer his murderous spirit into a new body after his own execution is dreadfully unoriginal and already featured (more or less) in at least four movies, namely Wes Craven's "Shocker", the atrocious third entry in the "House" series, the criminally underrated film "Prison" and the overall lamentable film "The Chair".
He becomes inexplicably linked to a suicidal teenage girl whom he goes after, following his resurrection and complete bodily regeneration during his autopsy.
The film is about a killer who is hit by lightening while getting sitting in the electric chair and becomes an unstoppable killer after he's taken to the morgue in the hospital.
The film was actually shot in 1970 but the BBFC refused it a certificate - realizing, perhaps, that it was pure exploitation and not really a horror film at all; in fact, it only got released when the producers took the film to the apparently more lenient censor boards of individual towns, after which the BBFC relented!
However, it turns out that she wasn't being headhunted for a job after all, as the head of the agency wants Christina to join her witch's coven!
Then one sister decides she wants to be High Priestess after one day in the coven, using a magic spell to kill the lesbian HPs that's been hitting on her the whole weekend(she learns fast, eh?).
While trying to get you to know the man behind the mysterious disappearance of a Dutchman's girlfriend, some parts of the film drag on to no end, and then pick up finally after one specific scene, being a car-ride where it picks up and doesn't fail.
A great thriller, even after the long, drawn out parts.
A good movie usually begins with the introduction of its main character after the development.
The story's conflict revolves around Gloria adopting Nicky after Kevin threatens to kill both of them in order to recover the secret disk.
This sequel picks up shortly after the first film ends.
), after which the entire movie shows the pair bonding in coffee shops an running from armed henchman.
On the plus side, the score is kinda groovy and the naked babes (it's a French film, after all) make it easier on the eyes, though not enough to recommend.
What story was she after?
My first comment on IMDb ... after watching many IMDb Top250 ... After this I HAD to write something.
As depicted here, Bennett becoming a Communist in response to his social structure is as likely as Martha Stewart becoming a Sumo wrestler after she burnt a soufflÃ©.
There are already too many hurt kids in this world who were born so their parents could have what they wanted, then decided they weren't what they wanted after all.
Scene after scene of sitcom-level 'humour' followed by gut-wrenching sentiment.
another question after all what happen in occupied Palestine is military resistance.. so why all the media & obviously the movie maker insist on covering it from an Islamic point of view while in regard to the brutal fights like in Latin America it's about the liberty & getting red of corruption.
For example, after sitting in a warehouse for 1000 years, Harriers will still fly.
man animals as they call us) is weak and stupid and can't mine or do anything constructive, yet there is still the evidence of everything man built after the invasion.
The only good thing is this film didn't harm Travolta, because it would have been a shame to see him go down again after his resurgence after Pulp Fiction, I think Hollywood saw it as his one indulgence.
And, not only did a flight simulator exist in the city, conveniently located so that genius and his pals can train to fly those jets, it's also powered and working after 1,000 years, electrically supplied by .... umm......dunno.
Rex was really losing it during those 3 years after Saskia's disappearance, and he was no good to his new girlfriend (who says at one point that she doesn't want to be part of a menage a trois), and no good to himself.
but after the box office and critical slaughter they wake up and realize they got "Robot Monster", "Plan 9 of Outer Space", "Manos, The Hands of Fate", "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", "Terror from the Year 5000" and "Mommie Dearest" all rolled into one.
The urge of bursting into laughter after reading those lines must have being difficult to repress during the filming.
The fact that after I had watched it I felt disgusted and frankly scared that a film like this could be made in the first place made me dig a little deeper into the films background.
Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation !
anyway after a while, the sheriff (who sounds like he has a touch of the throat cancer) and his cronies discover who the killer is and the good ol boys take him out.
Ingrid is also having many  visions/hallucinations involving her mother, who killed herself after  a tryst with a strange man.
Ingrid is a fixture at church, and is  almost raped again after an attack in the cemetery.
Carl buries Frankie, makes an  incestuous pass at Ingrid, then disappears after Ingrid goes to the  sheriff.
My partner, after renting this movie from the indie rack at our local rental outlet, and sitting through all 77 minutes (I had to beg her to watch the last 9 minutes), remarked, "It is criminal to watch this movie."
Didn't gratuitous nudity go out of style after 'Basic Instinct'?
I have no idea how it ends because after an hour, we gave up and walked out.
I had a hard time sleeping after I saw it.
Haven makes one fruitless attempt after another to be clever until all we end up with is an unsorted mess of scenes thrown together in a wanna-be movie.
It's certainly not to be entertained and I hardly think anyone would be enlightened after seeing a film like this.
STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits   Karl Thommasson (Treat Williams) returns to teach at a tough school after a stint in Kosovo, to honour a promise to a fallen comrade in that war in the shape of taking care of his teacher daughter.
In a role originally written for Tom Berenger, Treat Williams here returns after appearing in the first sequel.
Heck, you'll be lucky if you remember this stuff minutes after being done.
I thought when I hired the DVD, that there were subtitles available but after a phone call to the Video shop, I was informed that if you look closer, there was no tick beside the word, subtitles.
So who winds up running things after Mr. and Mrs. Jack A-Hole kiss and make up in the fish tank?
And even though he's admittedly spent more time on his abs than on his marriage, after she runs off on a fling with another man, she'll spend the rest of the script trying to get back into his arms.
In fact, soon after this, he injected it in some poor lady--who became a crazed zombie and soon died.
And, after turning into a bad fighting machine that looks like he fell into a vat of flour while using the drug, he then insists on injecting others!
If Casey had been a bad actor, it would have been easier to understand how he descends into a dual personality after taking some of his own liver serum, which of course turns him into a rampaging beast.
There's also a fairly effective chase scene where Hyde goes after Linda in an abandoned warehouse.
The state of Japan after World War II was one of devastation.
A few years after the end of the American occupation in Japan, one of many films about this time was produced; however, Hollywood decided to give this one had a comedic twist.
Based off of the play of the same name, The Teahouse of August Moon sends many mixed messages about Japanese and American relations after World War II.
The film came out shortly after the occupation had ended, and, without the access of the current twenty-first century media, Teahouse was one of the only ways that Americans were to obtain images and feelings toward and Japanese people and their history and culture.
An aimless and uninteresting Western, showing Peckinpah's continued decline after the peak of "The Wild Bunch."
I saw Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid again tonight after a few decades.
It takes two hours for Garrett and Billy to have their final showdown; in the process they drift languidly through one laconic scene after another.
I have only seen two films that left me so scared that after they ended I couldn't even move.
A young man gets his wife out of a mental institution where she was kept after her baby drowned accidentally.
I was not familiar with Robert Pastorelli, who died of a drug overdose, shortly after the series ended.
It chased me off soon after the wretched conversation just recounted.
At the start of "Beast", a young bar patron drifts away from her friends after closing hours and is stalked and mauled to death by a werewolf.
(4) Why didn't the werewolf attack the woman in the house after finishing off her husband?
Erskine, after being rejected by other medicine men, gets deep-voiced John Singing Rock(..out of all the names the filmmakers could've come up with actor Michael Ansara is stuck with this one)to lend him a hand.
My favorite line is when after an entire movie about this medicine man, John Singing Rock goes "He got away!"
The acting, direction, and script had such an amateurish feeling that after a while I just simply wanted it to end.
This movie was one of the first made after the MPAA rating system replaced the Hayes code, and people could make porn commercially.
Kind of soaps on steroids that grind you down after a while: i.e.
good Canadian movies are a hard jem to find ( as is any Canadian one) but this one is somewhat easier to find  after watching the first one i immediately needed to view the second and i isn't a letdown in any way to its predecessor.
the story follows Bridgette after running away from her dark past.
shes completely changed except for the fact shes still a werewolf, and is now an independent woman with some "problems" but soon after passing out in a snowbank from an overdose of monkshood is taken into a drug clinic and the story begins there.
Even the background score makes us think that something is going to happen next even though nothing interesting after that.
This was part of a little Our Gang comedy series starring the "Rascals", and it is June, the month of weddings, where little Mary (Mary Kornman) has a pretend wedding to a little fat kid (who almost resembles Hardy), and the little black kid causes a little trouble throwing a black polish covered shoe after the other kids have laughed at the "couple" kissing.
Only in the world of B-grade horror can a child laugh hysterically after dragging a cripple to drown in a vat of clothing dye, or beat his father over the head with a two-by-four for no apparent reason whatsoever.
By the way, was the girl who gave this jerk a tumble just a tad too sugary and sunny for words and are we seriously supposed to believe that she would stick around for dose after dose of his whiny nonsense?
i thought this show was awful cause new york didn't win and she was the one who went back for flavor the second time when she could of had someone else her mom was right she was the only one who really loved flavor not that dumb face ugly girl he chose gross what a fat hag gross new york is way hotter and sexier she is way more than the other girl flavor you made a bad choice you just better hope new yorks mom don't come after you but i hope she does just playing but why didn't you pick new york she is all you need telling you the truth she really loved you and you made her go home again after again sad but i guess thats you and whats up with the grills at the end i think its cute but i still think new york should of been wearing them
This is true because after watching this, no woman with any self respect would degrade herself this way.
What kind of a man is HE to allow himself to be paraded around like this week after week for entertainment?
With entertainment fair like this to push onto a young demographic for alleged chuckles, I can just imagine what their next slate of shows will be like: Lassie finds a new owner via DIO and goes on a 30 city tour...or 6 Ex-Drug addict musicians are put together in a house for 30 days where they are told one kilo of cocaine is hidden and at the end after they all messed over each other to get it, it's actually baby powder...or several single surprisingly still-living 1960's/1970's era rock musicians get to vie for their own mail order bride from overseas...or Bishop Don Juan has a beauty-type contest where the winner will accompany him to the next 'Player's Ball'and get the chance to perform in front of that audience ... entertaining?
Their reactions, however, are different: while the black boy seems resigned to have joined the ranks of the undead (culminating in a predictable coda, down to the ironic closing line, as he sets out to 'infect' The Big Apple), the other resists Â especially after Ironside kidnaps his kid sister to be the blood donor in his initiation!
It's all downhill from there - the story never recovers and becomes very bland after such a good buildup.
All in all, you should go to the cinema 60 mins after the show time and for the remains, don't expect too much, just watch effects.
What I do know is that I felt cheated after it ended with no revelations about the missing daughter and without retribution for the jealous ninja who burned the place where the birthing occurred and contributed to her death.
It was as if Kill Bill ended after Volume 1 and Volume 2 was never made.
I had only heard of Artie Lange after a friend of mine sent me a clip of him at a Comedy Central roast of William Shatner.
In my opinion, after "Manos", this is the worst movie Comedy Central has ever shown.
The politically incorrect humor was diluted after 10 minutes of this film.
after watching the show, I would not want to work for him.
He seems to serve no purpose in the movie, even though I was preparing myself for a big role from him in this movie, after he made his first (and only) appearance.
We're just supposed to assume that they'll live happily ever after, though not much in this movie indicates that they really will.
I did not even know there was a third installment to the Urban Legends series, but after loving the first two, for what they were, and this one being directed by Mary Lambert (who I adored for her work with Madonna and "Pet Sememtary"), I expected a descent movie.
Why she never goes after the actual killer is never explained.
first of all it has no story to follow: instead of having a slasher who kills all the nasty rich kids one by one (copykilling after urban legends as usual), it's some voodoo-magic-zombie thing!
I respect Mary Lambert for pet cemetery, but after even watching the behind-the-scenes, I'm afraid she may have lost it.
Chasing after her, the jock tries to grab her when Mary bites his hand.
Right after I saw the second one I got confused.
The majority of the movie is people being killed one right after the other.
For example, a subplot early in the film where the jocks suspect a character of seeking revenge because of a prank just went nowhere and was forgotten after a few minutes.
Especially Ed Marinaro who apparently never learned to act after his buff body and good looks faded away.
Although, they hadn't figured out that it's not a game at all, but terrorists actually using the interface to carry out their hijacking of the American communications system (there only seems to be one that they're after) and are using the game to carry out their assassination plots.
I threw my DVD away after watching it.
I feel like I need to take a shower, wash my eyes with bleach, and watch a good movie after watching this despicable attempt at anything coherent.
It bordered on annoying as there where recurrent stupid things like the whole susceptibility to being, "ensnared within the agile grasp" of the zombies after being tapped.
The plot is simple, after many of the world's empires nuke the crap out of each other, zombies start springing up.
The beginning just cuts in after the zombies spring up, the characters know too much about what to do, and the ending just seems there.
i don't think anyone is truly scared by locusts after watching that film.
Except one person toward the end after we find out that they like to eat flesh.but no other reports of death by Locust.
Second in the monotonous horror series takes place soon after the events of the first movie, with reporter Terence Knox poking around as he tries to discover what happened in the empty town.
Strangely, although every adult and a bunch of kids were killed, no cops stick around after the first five minutes, leaving Knox free to discover bodies all over the place.
The lady goes under her house after her precious cat.
The Dr who was being nice to the children earlier on in the film gets the worst death ever, and I mean worst, luckily he gets a lolly straight after.
Even after you have read all of this... if you have not seen it.... the curiosity will get the better of some of you... and you will watch it to see how bad it really is.
To those of you who watch it after this.... you might want to prepare yourself ahead of time.
All the excitement is over after 5 min.
Finally, there's the absolutely ROUSING Music Hall finale, where half the screen is devoted to an obvious 'offspring' of Fortesque turning over a scrapbook that details the life of the main characters after the film ends.
Unfortunately Non Ho Sonno came in a lull in Argento's career coming after his widely panned Phantom of the Opera (1998) remake.
However, when Clark is eventually caught (and rightfully so--she is after all a thief), she vows to destroy a man who worked for a department store that insisted she be prosecuted (Ralph Bellamy).
The movie jumps around between groups of characters seemingly at random, and half of them just seem to appear in order to be killed off by some very unconvincing zombies; there are so many characters that at times they'd cut back to other characters after twenty minutes and I'd have forgotten that those other characters even existed.
So basically the bodies get dumped in the lake and there are a bunch of kids near the swamp and after a storm the bodies come back to life and try feasting on the living.
Why any of them agreed to doing this project after they read the scripts is beyond me.
There's also another fight scene set atop a car park where it starts out during the day & after a few punches have been thrown it's pitch black.
This was, I felt, a very touching story about a man who chooses to stay with his wife even after a miscarriage (when the whole reason for the marriage was the pregnancy).
What a disappointment after the first one.
Chuck Norris looks bored replaying his role in the first film (Col. McCoy) for vengeance when his pal's wife was killed by a merciless drug dealer named Ramon Cotta (played with surprising menace by THE UNTOUCHABLES' Billy Drago), who has been freed numerous times after being captured.
They pulled out one after another.
Was there a plot anyway, one should ask himself after watching.
The dialogue is so bleak and uninteresting, you will find yourself nodding off after about 40 minutes.
The best part of the movie is where this chef in a restaurant goes after someone with a cleaver.
I must admit after watching the first 100 minutes, the movie has an interesting twist, probably thats why i didn't give it a 1, but even the most twisted of twists could not save 100 minutes of nothing.
Kevin Harrison (Madsen) is the hardboiled, jaded detective who is retiring after this last case.
Perhaps it is just me, but after two viewings I have little idea of what was going on.
I found it extremely hard to watch and had to turn off after a while.
Being tailed by the police Ronnie leads them to Mottram's basement where Chuku is and where Mottram just came back after he offered another blood-sacrifice to Chuku, hooker masseuses and part-time dominatrix Sally,Suzy Kendall.
well, maybe i will after the movie's over.
So after a grueling hour and a half of searching we discover that it's the pianist's friend.
It was the first of director Ernst Lubitsch's dramatic films, after having started as a comedic filmmaker.
And even if he did know, he only came like a minute after the girls sang happy birthday.
They aren't paying attention to Rover, they're just randomly taking 30 second pauses after each statement.
Sharon Stone comes back to seek revenge years after the death of her father.
Holes in heads big enough to see the person who put them there and people doing backflips after getting shot were just a few of the very unbelievable things in this movie.
DiCaprio has finally proved in such pieces as Blood Diamond or The Departed that he can act, but after The Quick And The Dead, anyone could be forgiven for thinking DiCaprio came straight from a high school drama.
So, after all, the movie sucks.
Thank heavens for veteran heavy-hitter Mike Farrell, who does magnificently chasing after some cows, or was that a double?
The killer appears to his victims after the lights go out and he is able to transform into people's parents and make them re-live their worst nightmare.
And at the end after they'd killed the doctor and they were walking along a sunlit road................THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DOCTOR DRIVING ALONG IN A CAR THEY WERE TRYING TO HITCH!!!
It truly does play like it was filmed from a script assembled by throwing the scripts from classic horror movies (and some that aren't so classic) up in the air and then picking up random pages after they fall.
Let's go through our checklist of horror movie clichÃ©s: 1) Stock characters - check 2) Characters with seedy pasts that you know will come into play - check 3) A cop who has no clue what he's doing - check 4) A creepy janitor who knows the whole history - check 5) A supernatural killer - check  Yep...basically this is just yet another horror flick that will be easily forgotten an hour after watching it.
Even after they escape the building he keeps chasing them (this is strange).
This movie isn't the way it's poster shows, and I assure you that if you don't consider my comment as a friendly warning then you'll feel very sorry after or even before finishing this movie.
And how does Danny Trejo suddenly turn up towards the end of the film after being slaughtered in the first reel.
We rejoin Brigette after an undisclosed period of time.
And for God's sake, how in the earth that the vampire from the first film (the barman) resurrected after the melting sequence?
The first 45 minutes are not so bad, but after the point where LUTHER (one of the robbers) becomes a vampire it really goes down!
Of course I was wondering myself why they still want robbing the bank after they become vampires (LUTHER and Jesus).
It almost seemed that the writers were having a clichÃ©' competition, after spending a bonding weekend at a Hollywood clichÃ©' convention!!!
and asked me two questions: 1) How the hell would anyone think of such an idea, considering the fact that our world is far, very far from being perfect two thousand years after a Messiah whose name I do not need to mention preached his gospel.
So,I just put my DVD's of the series, after having delightfully scratched them, to where they belonged: to the WASTE DISPOSAL.
One of them is a woman who's been gone for 10 years and thinks it would be a good idea to visit her daughter and husband after so long.
Seeing his wife return after being gone for ten years, being abducted by aliens no less, the husband, in no more than 4 lines, tells her that 'alas things have changed for him' and adds a hasty 'sorry' as if he was sending some kids away who tried to sell him cookies.
This plays like a long situation comedy, except that after the first few minutes any basis in reality, no matter how exaggerated, is lost.
Bill Murray, as Bob, suffers from multiple phobias and, after an initial brief interview with psychiatrist Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), he becomes so dependent on him that he pursues him to where the Marvin family is away on vacation.
OK - the plot is invented (in spite of the back of box blurb), and it involves a caper to run after German loot as a side operation to operation "Market Garden".
To have the characters chasing after treasure in the middle of war time - come on please!
Sure it is an interesting caper...Nazi treasure in Holland that several different people are after.
There is so much potential in the movie that any decent script editor will kill themselves after watching this movie.
You came straight home after shooting the g-string commercials and you were unstoppable."
I turned it of when the SS officer in full uniform runs through a British platoon to get to a truck and gets away with it just after he says to his side kick we will use the artillery as cover, because artillery good for that.
It's such a shame because with today's special effects they could make a great WW2 film as special after Band of Brothers think of all the different places the battles took place.
Part of it is that the films are one sexual double-entendre after another--the sort that put 12 year-olds into hysterics but non-brain injured adults usually can't stand.
There, I COULD say something positive about this film after all!
Though Maltin's BOMB rating seems a bit harsh - it IS watchable, after all - it's hard not to notice the drop-off in quality from its predecessor, "Murderers' Row".
There aren't very many movies where after I've watched them I've wanted my time and/or money back, but unfortunately this was one of them!
Al I'm saying is don't make more Puppet Master movies because after part 4 if was boring, stupid, and pointless.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
Curse of the Puppet Master is worse than the five previous Puppet Master films & to be honest they should have stopped making them after Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge while the series was on a high.
The hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and ALWAYS scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications.
Like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season.
At least some bad movies have *something* in them that you can talk or laugh about after the fact.
Celia also saw Maren after the murders and talked to her.
The spies are after some secrets hidden in a safe.
They become the best of friends hours after meeting.
It is one stereotype after another.
5) The 'Visual -Effects' - Oh my god!If this guy finds a job after this by anyone except the same director........ it's a miracle 6) The writer- Anyone who can write this, has the total inability to find beauty in anything.
Ah, but this is not all as Dennis Quaid is also having problems with his children after a recent family tragedy What a shockingly original twist in a shockingly original plot!
You know, throwing out a psycho thriller in 2009 with fragmentary cuts, somber tone and final twist, and doing it as if it were the most profitable years of the genre (namely, a bit after the release of se7en) is risky to say the least.
The movie is too predictable, after watching the half of it, you know by 90% how it will end.
Detective Breslin (Quaid) is after someone who is killing people and hanging them on a contraption with hooks boring into the skin.
There is a mixture of Quaid's character Detective Breslin agonizing over not being there for his two boys after his wife's death and the bizarre murders cropping up all over the place.
Dennis Quade was horrible in The day after tomorrow, and he stinks this one up also.
The Ending: At the end when Aidan comes home after his son dies, he wakes up Sean and Sean asks where Alex is.
I know many people love this movie but I was bored silly after the first hour or so.
My friend turned to me after watching this on HBO On Demand and said literally the same thing to me.
During the second half of this movie the only thought in my head was "please don't let this be the twist, please tell me that writers are more imaginative than that, please don't let me have to watch the second half of this movie only to find it was what I guessed after the first 20 minutes".
Wow am I tired after watching that snoozer of a movie.
The improbability of salvation for the kingdom, the king, and the crown prince from the scourge of mental illness is forgotten and they all live happily ever after is the ultimate absurdity.
This movie about a guy who moves into an apartment where he slowly gets murderous after a dinner of rather potent 'wine' and 'yogurt' starts off extremely slow and will leave you searching for the remote, but about a half hour in it gets slightly interesting.
The film being a HSC study text probably doesn't help its cause, but soon after I starting watching I was wishing the board of studies had chosen a more entertaining text.
This is the third entry in the series after The Addams Family (1991) & Addams Family Values (1993) which were very good films, Addams Family Reunion isn't.
Maybe not his fault, after all.
They are both romanced by a wealthy and handsome suitor (Griem), who after stirring their dreams and passions, leaves them flat.
The "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" number is roundly described as stunning and chilling, and after almost 30 years, remains so.
Tom Holland's "We All Scream For Ice Cream" is one of the disappointing episodes, or, more precisely, pretty much the worst episode after Ernest R. Dickerson's terrible "V-Word".
It kind of deals with concepts similar to "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "It" - a mentally challenged ice cream vendor clown is accidentally killed after a prank involving some punks kids goes horribly wrong.
The film is entertaining and enjoyable, but also contains a haunting aura that lingers long after the picture has ended.
But most importantly is a new character named "Ghost" (presumably because she's almost like an albino) who is fascinated with the occult and death and befriends Bridget after finding out she might be a werewolf.
Now, after 3 years of rehab (exclusively Kurosawa, Bergman, Fellini, Eisenstein, Kubrick, indie, art, documentary, etc)...
The fact that, after more than 250 years of almost total isolation from the rest of the world, Japan had been forcibly opened to foreign trade in 1853 is simply ignored.
American army captain Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is disillusioned after participating in gruesome slaughter of native American Indians.
Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai is a good example of stupid writing and ham-fisted acting, typical of all his movies after Risky Business except Magnolia.
I like Japanese movies and I like movies about samurais and for some reason after I saw the ads I bought a ticket and went to the cinema to watch it.
The scenes where he trains with the master of sword remind me all those hundreds of cheesy Rambo-Kickboxer movies where the white Americans kick the asses of their Asian adversaries in the field of the martial arts after having trained those arts for some 10 minutes.
Well, I'm not obsessive enough-or astute enough-to pick out where the problem lies, but after 45 minutes of the story, I bailed.
Perhaps there is some use made of the ruined piano later, after the point at which I stopped watching, but nobody even thinks about it during the storm?
The seemingly endless confrontations and arguments between Chris and Pam become rather monotonous after a while.
We just spend the whole time watching these two people bicker and watching Pam have one psychotic episode after another.
Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is placed in a foster home after the incidents of the first film had his mother committed.
Following the bad publicity of the ÂGood Guy' doll after the Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) became public knowledge the aforementioned doll was removed from sale.
Chuck is back and still after Andy is now placed in a foster home after the tragic events of the first film since his mother was committed.
I never thought I would say this (and please note, I am not endorsing school violence in anyway) but congrats to Chucky for taking out Ms. Kettlewell after she completely humiliated Andy in the classroom in front of his peers.
Soon the viewer gets to see the swastika on his left arm and the audience stands up one after one and sings with him.
Andy realizes that Chucky is after him, but as always nobody believes the youngster.
It's only gotten progressively worse over the years after Child's Play 2.
Childs play 2 is good if you see the 1st one you can compare it but after you see the first one you will notice that don Mancini has mucked the story line up.
I recommend after seeing the 1st chuck don't see the rest up to you but if you see the last 4 you will find that the plot as gone you will get really confused about what happened to the main characters.
Plus after seeing the last 4 you will find they are boring I recommend to just see the 1st child's play because the 1st was superb
If a lesser actor took it this character would have died off after the original film.
The hero jumps in after most of the movie is over and then finally does something heroic instead of notifying the police!
At first she offers to testify, then withdraws after learning her sister (Doris Day) is married to one of the Klansmen (Steve Cochran, in a wonderfully loutish performance as the murderer).
While not fun to watch (after all, who wants to watch a self-absorbed idiot?
But then again, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film...after all, how good can a film be when Roger Clinton plays a guy called Mayor Bubba?
However, after that opening sequence the film takes a drastic nose-dive into the land of really cheap horror flicks as it becomes very hokey (cringe-worthy even) and nonsensical ultimately causing the viewer to heave a huge sigh of relief once the film has ended!
Overall, the only true highlights in this sorry excuse for a film are the few short scenes of a rather luscious-looking Solei Moon-Frye (from "Punky Brewster" fame) in a small supporting role as an occult obsessed teen, and an admittedly creepy atmosphere which seems to mysteriously dissipate altogether after the first half-hour passes.
Even after 36 years, it hasn't aged, and is as shocking and entertaining as ever.
The viewer know it after about 5 minutes but Andrew ( the Sheriff ) needs a whole 85 minutes for it.
The chemistry between Mitchum and love interest Ann Blyth is nil, the story veers from sickeningly sweet to nauseatingly real (courtesy of some actual combat footage of various people during or just after being roasted alive, etc.
He has a bit of a queasy stomach after slaughtering a bunch of civilian refugees because a few Communist infiltrators were hiding among them, but even his initially outraged girlfriend comes to see that "even a doctor amputating a leg has to cut off some good flesh with the bad," and pretty soon, this mini-My Lai is forgotten (without anyone apparently considering whether a wiser choice than massacre might have existed).
The police goes after them.
Real guards would chain his legs after getting beat up several times.
And after the killer shows great mental powers by killing all the men in his path and escaping, he realizes the movie is going to end so he lets the girl shoot him so we don't get the would-be-delicious con-mentally-overpowers-stupid-but-gorgeous-scientist-and screws her as she gasps don't, while stripping.
The beginning promises a lot, but right after the first five minutes, the movie becomes SLOOOWWW!
It is a movie that after seeing it , no one would be thinking about it any more, like plain water, after you drink it, you only remember that you drank it, but with no memory of how.
The tacky explanation of what happened to everyone after the end of the movie in the This-was-a-true-story manner of simply splashing some text is even more annoying here than in the 'true story' flicks.
And if he does want to write something...collaborate with me, I've had better nightmares after eating Mexican!
Don't even bother with The Quickening, just watch the first movie and then skip to the third one (after all, that's what the producers did).
However, this movie deserves a special place in the realm of modern disasters in the film industry, because as a sequel it is absolutely abysmal, out of place, and an utter disgrace to the first one (and to the whole series, which never recovered after the atom-bomb that this movie dropped on the plot).
Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her?
Watch her try and play down the immense physical pain she must be in after a back-alley abortion.
She's lost a good man, friends (I doubt she'll be seeing much of Fritz after the wedding), and in the end her career is in the same spot it was when the movie began.
This is such a huge letdown after the first movie, which is an absolute classic.
What was attempted as original just felt stale after the first several scenes.
Brigitte (Emily Perkins) is alone, after killing her sister Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), and injecting a substance called monkshood to delay the process of transformation in a werewolf.
The intention was probably good, trying to show the aftermath of McCloud's mistakes after winning the original "tournament", but the premise is ruined by Planet Zeist, and Michael Ironside is just rehashing the Kurgen.
after class my professor asked if i enjoyed the show.
At that moment I was at a loss for words, though I had watched the show night after night, and I fully understood it, I couldn't truly say I enjoyed it.
That distorted reflection of the audience full of Nazi, accompanied by a tense silence after Master's of Ceremonies ÂAufwiedershen' is horrible.
the story's are all boring one after another, and the outline happening is lame too.
one of the inner story's is on four girls looking for a place that they can get into, because of their young age, after failing in that, they are find themselves in the "bad part of town", well that just could be a real cool story, but that bad part of town, isn't really as you might expect, it's just a typical warehouse area.
There are lots of details in the movie - brightly exposed to us by an excellent cameraman - which create a second, historical storyline which you start to understand only after you watch the movie for a while.
In fact, after about 5 minutes into each of them you just want them to end and hope the next one is better.
I was very disappointed after seeing this movie.
and a pretty-boy playboy kickboxing expert named David (Evan Laurie- Steven Seagal is a very, VERY good actor after all- Jalal Merhi ain't bad either!)
Obviously, they don't get on very well but after a lot of male macho bonding they manage to put their differences aside, race in and save the little girl.
The main villain ringing the clueless parents immediately after and declaring 'I've just kidnapped your daughter!'
I really wanted to see this movie after I bought the soundtrack for the Broadway revival version of the Cabaret musical this summer.
So Cabaret is basically not "just" a musical.It has some darker themes about society,as well as showing us what the night life,and life in general,in poor Germany after the first World War just before Hitler came to power was like.And yes it also has wonderful musical scenes,good acting and is definitely worth the time to check out if these things interest you!!
House II: The Second Story starts with with a scene where two people are shot dead by a mysterious figure in a large house just after they hand their young baby over to someone or other, I don't really know who or care to be honest.
Some ghost or demon has been after a special skull for unknown reasons, killing the main character's parents 25 years earlier.
The main character (Gross) goes after the jewel-covered skull by digging up an ancestor's grave and ends up resurrecting his great great grandpa (Dano) as a 100+ year old zombie.
The old guy's nemesis finally shows up near the end, still after that skull.
This is a guy who just entered the eighties after being somewhat dead since the 1800s and he has a liberal left wing bent.
Jesse and crew wind up in the old west and get to bury Gramps who dies after Slim shoots him.
When i heard of this movie, it was very promising,like Bangkok dangerous or sort of.But hell no.The movie begins confusing and you actually don't get the right idea of the characters.The the plot goes even more confusing at the concert and keeps it's way of lame events all the way to the end.The boss-fight at the end is total OMG the collateral dmg guy was supposed to use some kind of sharp weapon not a kung fu pan.For those who don't know there are a lot of way cooler weapons in kung fu.By the way i've always thought that the evil mean guy in any movie shouldn't do kung fu, because it's kinda a defensive matrial art and it's philosophy is quite calming and purifying and he is a f**king psycho.The ending is lame as expected.I was expecting some kind of Big Hit ending where "main" hero was supposed to grab the girl after dealing with the mean dude, but no the makers of this had better idea:she keeps on singing some sappy pop-trash and he is somewhere.Rofl really...
If after all this you've red you still want to watch the movie better rent it from some tormented soul
I put a question mark after spoiler alert because the fact that they off themselves in the end wasn't particularly shocking.
I only recently became interested in Haneke's work after viewing Funny Games, being completely hypnotized and blown away by the magnificent work.
After scene after scene it becomes obvious to the viewer the style he is going for, eventually turning predictable.
She introduces him to all sorts of people, from riff-raff to aristocracy, including a gigolo, a Jewish heiress, and an ambiguous baron who dismisses them both after having "played" with the two of them.
Why not ask some of them after a comedy show what they thought of the hecklers?
However, after the first 15-20 minutes the film no longer deals with the topic of hecklers at all.
Even after seeing all the Scream movies, I still haven't experienced that level of terror.
I gave up on the movie within a half hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful.
Plus, after a while, it was obvious that there was an invisible guy running about--talk about a great way to maintain your cover!
Right after Pearl Harbor like Wonder Woman, Hall decides his talents are best put to use in the Allied Cause.
In addition, the film kept on using sound effects after each joke...like a drummer in a nightclub.
The problem is not that the quality of the humor in this movie ever dips lower than that of the shorts, it's that the jokes are endless, and you get tired of grunting out a half-hearted laugh after a while.
Unfortunately I'll probably have a nightmare tonight after watching this but I'll recover...
I began to watch the movie after a guy cuts the head to another one, the next story was of an Indian and three idiots that want to kill him.
Don't ever get high off a Indian's bong, especially after you just killed him and are using his trailer.
I mean, nothing actually happens to his ear after it is originally attacked, and it isn't even a fake bloody ear.
I was expecting something bad after realizing I'd been ripped off and had spent 5 bucks on "Campfire Stories" rather than "Campfire Tales" (a good anthology horror film).
I'd say it's fair to say Jamie-Lynn Singler's film career has jumped the shark after watching this "film".
Alas after seeing OUT OF BOUNDS I found myself asking couldn't one of Merlin's other scripts have been more deserving of funding ?
One really wonders what was going on in the producer's mind wasting Jeremy Brett's rapidly diminishing energy and life-span for this crude story, especially after having been so faithful to the spirit of Doyle's works before.
We, my friend and I basically figured out the whole movie out after 15-20 minutes..
Things get a little more interesting when Mort starts thinking that maybe his estranged wife's new boyfriend might be behind everything, that he might have sent this psycho after Mort in the hopes of speeding up the divorce but things have gotten out of control.
The movie never clearly explains what makes the girl so special and a bit after the halfway point you don't really care.
The movie begins quickly and the first hour is brilliantly average Â one can only help but admit there is little chance of a blockbuster after hearing zero publicity.
Needless to say, after the 40 minutes my hopes were high.
By the end you still don't know if any of that was true and what were the people after her going to do with her once they caught her.
"What he does not know, but soon learns is the knowledge the girl may be a sleeper threat to him, his boss and to those who don't want the girl to live after she arrives in America."
I won't tell you exactly what happens, that would spoil it; but I suggest that after you've seen it you'll wonder if you care.
The setting is the world in ruins after nuclear war.
This is pretty much a tiring film after awhile, and though it shouldn't have been more than 70 or 80 minutes, the damn thing stretches on for nearly 100.
But surely there's something by which to recommend Please Don't Eat My Mother, after all I gave it 2 starts & not a rock bottom 1.
Dr. Howard Glass (Sean Kenny) and his girlfriend and fellow medical professional Nurse Angie Robinson (Monika Kelly) are having a bit of a chat when after giving her cat some Lotos cat food it attacks Angie.
Soon after, somewhere else in town a woman named Annie (Mary Ellen Burke) is also attacked by her cat which bites her throat out.
The body ends up on Dr. Glass's table and both he and Angie decide to investigate after Dr. Glass discovers that a cat was responsible for severing Annie's jugular.
There is a funny sequence, and at the same time totally idiotic, when Caleb pulls a gun on Landau and forces him to pay him money that he owe's, after Landau has given Caleb the money Caleb hands Landau the gun!
The cat food makers are employing a guy who looks like the guy from "The Hills Have Eyes" to even raid graveyards for more people to run through the "grinding machine", until a woman's body turns up in a local doctor's office after being attacked and killed by one of said kitties (why did they take an already dead woman to a doctor?)
"Ginger Snaps:Unleashed" is a pretty smart sequel to my beloved werewolf horror "Ginger Snaps".Brigitte is an addict.After mixing blood with her sister Ginger she has been infected with the virus.Each day the curse grows stronger and she must increase her dosage of injections.When she is found lying face down in the snow after the near escape from another beast,she is thrown into drug rehabilitation-locked behind the doors without her life-saving antidote.
The gravedigger who's been supplying them with their food's main ingredient--freshly disinterred human cadavers--has been pestering them for monies due, and a suspicious doctor and his hotty blond nurse have taken to snooping around the premises, after the cats that consume their product have begun to turn into maniacal killers.
I have to say i enjoy most bad movies that are so bad they're good but this is not one of them.this one is really bad,i thought it would be like the classic b movie the undertaker and his pals but it lacks the style and humor of that film,the concept for this clunker is a greedy nutty business man uses human flesh grinded in a big meat grinder to make expensive cat food.which makes the cats rabid killers who go nuts after eating the cat food with human flesh,Ted V Mikels who made the b movie classic astro zombies made this on a budget of $1.98,well not really but the acting is so bad,its frightening.even the cat attack scenes look fake.amazing that this makes plan 9 from outer space look like gone with the wind.Ed Wood Jr could've done a way better job directing this.if you want to waste about 90 minutes then by all means watch corpse grinders.but as a cult movie i say it is way below its mark.Ray Dannis(undertaker and his pals,severed arm)has a very brief role.and they actually did a sequel in 2000,why?
Being a rather cheap copy of Lars von Trier's original i found this mini series annoying after the first few minutes.
At Least Riget actually exists in real life (the Hospital in Copenhagen is Nicknamed "Riget" which Means "Kingdom", Due to it's Extreme size) And to round it all off, maybe Stephen could have continued the series instead of remaking it, since two actors died after making the second one (hence why there isn't gonna be a third).
No explanation was given on anything and having a week's gap between each episode made the whole thing difficult to watch so I gave up after half season.
I felt like I was watching ER second season after ingesting some cough medicine bottles.
It just feels pointless to watch (which is why I quit after episode 5 or 6).
I couldn't continue after that.
Later we find out that he is special, and soon after that that he is a member of an ancient race.
Strangely enough Mr. perfect have no troubles killing innocent prison guards while he time after time jeopardize the mission and his crew to protect female criminals.
I noticed several times it looked like he smiled when approaching his crew after they just had great personal loses.
All in all I have a hard time understanding why many good sci-fi series die after one season or less and this lasted 5 seasons.
This show jumped the shark after the writer changes and while I liked Mr Sorbo's work as an actor in previous endeavors, his dumbing down of the show was a bad move.
Funny thing that mostly happens after watching a Dutch movie.
It's one of those movies which makes you wonder after you have seen it; Why did I even watched this in the first place?
A gun-toting evil murderer invades the hotel sanctuary of the survivors and puts moves on Crowley (who has fallen in love with Denning after knowing him for only a few hours).
Also, according to Mr. Osborne, the film was made in, that Edsel of film processes, 3D but release in regular format in 1955 after the hipe died along with those awful glasses!
The director leaves it up to the audience to somehow figure out what kind of reasonable scientific explanation could account for anyone surviving for any amount of time after all the oxygen-producing plant life plus everything else in the food chain between bugs and people bit the dust.
The Kid was supposed to have been running into dead bodies and cannibals practically every day of his life so you'd think he'd be over it after 9-10 years, but no, he manages to seem traumatized at every instance.
The poorest decision comes when the two find a friggin' BOMB SHELTER FILLED WITH FOOD AND WARM BEDS, but after a couple days they need to abandon it because they heard somebody walking around up top.
There is life after this movie!
I couldn't wait to take a look at Final Fantasy Unlimited after reading the article in Newtype magazine.
Normally I'm the type of person to stay with an anime long after it goes bad, but lately I've completely lost my patience.
In all fairness, it was brash of me to drop this series after the first episode.
From the begining this series looks like it might be a somewhat decent and entertaining fantasy, but after a few episodes you will see that this is not much better than Pokemon.
Also the constant swearing, violence and sex wore me down and got dull after a while.
Just a couple of thoughts after watching nine lives of fritz the cat.
Krantz and company just keep sticking half-baked idea after lame 'joke' until they've finished.
The film is all but stolen by Vincent Price, essaying another bright comedic part as Omar Khayyam, poet and victim of Sinbad's ill fortune after he is caught leaving the Sultan's harem.
If you seen the series you know how long it would take to wear down Goku or Vegeta, in this movie, Goku and Vegeta give up pretty easily and are left to consider their last resort of fusing very shortly after meeting Janemba.
People wouldn't want to read the book after they gutted the story for the film.
"Snapshot" is one of them; a peculiar psycho-thriller/melodrama hybrid that coincidentally came out shortly after the huge box office success of "Halloween" and thus had to be re-titled "The Day After Halloween" in order to make extra money and cash in on the success of John Carpenter's classic.
If the pacing and script don't reveal, after about 10 minutes, that she's not truly a corpse after all, then you may be able to actually get into this.
Contouri and Thornton happily wind up driving down the street in the ice cream truck owned by the stalker's (who isn't the stalker) ice cream truck, after running him over.
First thing I thought and said after finishing August Underground Mordum was "Well, that was f@ckin stupid."
The first thought after watching The Redsin Tower was "Well, that was f@ckin weak."
At best this is a poor made after school movie.
Parts are a take off of the Columbine massacre and details the lives of people involved before and after a similar event.
The film American Gun seemed like it never started far after the end credits began running.
However after viewing I promptly demanded the video clerk to return to me 74 minutes of my life.
It is about an Italian 17 year old who comes to live in the US after his mother is killed in a bank robbery.
The story line is a snoozer, the acting is amateurish, Ireland has only one facial expression, the grimace, which gets tiresome after 30 seconds, and the only interesting character in this turkey is the diner waitress.
The way Makoto was thinking after Chiaki made his confession was very irrational and stupid... and she never really sat down to think and just leaped through time whenever she felt like it, even if in the end she leaped for Chiaki... it just feels like the characters never learned anything fundamental.
even after exploring that aspect, there are many other issues brought up that makes this movie so incredibly incomplete as a story -- deliberately vague just to desperately fill up a storyline, like cheating on a long term paper in order to make your essay an extra page long by increasing the font size of the period at the end of a paragraph or something.
Like the scene when Demornay puts the cuffs on her uncooperative arrest-practice partner after sweeping him off his feet.
Is she willing to give that up after knowing this?
So we have this millionaire widow who's bank account is full of money they don't deserve and who can't keep her kids under control while spoon feeding them... and after all of that whacking it on TV so that the rest of the people on planet Earth know our lives will always be more meaningful...
Although I still don't know what's more painful.. watching this show or having the mob after you...
I actually suspected Penn of being the killer for a while- so right away, I didn't question why/how he was at the Depot- then after he was killed, I now wonder how/why he was there.
I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it, but after some of the stuff I had heard, I wanted to preview it before taking them (I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway - boy was I wrong!).
I could say that Gellar and Prinze were miscast, but after two viewings, I don't think that was the problem.
However if like me the bile that has built up inside you, days after the accursed event has reached boiling point and you feel that you must reach out to the world and cry "SCOOOOOBYYY DON'T" then this might be slightly more your cup of tea.
Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting.
Unfortunately the audience discovers after paying the price of admission, that if you want another 48 Hours, watch the original.
By sheer coincidence I saw this movie again about 24 hours after I wrote the review(purely coincidental)  I had seen this when it first came out and then seen part of it again and did not like it AT ALL.
James Coburn looks appropriately puzzled as the proverbial villain of the piece (he wants to shut the school down, and after meeting the students, any audience may come to sympathize with him).
In the end, Stanley is so naive that he is bought off by having the kid named after him, as though a businessman who has achieved enough success for early retirement is stupid enough to accept this as ample compensation for months of degradation, belittling, rejection, financial draining, and every other kind of mistreatment they could think of.
Although I'm always careful to avoid others' opinions before I see a film and make up my mind about it, I often look at what others have to say after I've reached a conclusion.
So, I stopped the movie after +/- 50 minutes.
I actually think Ferrer, last seen in this film driving off, quite wasted and frightened after seeing the blob monster, plays his role a bit tongue-in-cheek as a constantly annoyed Mayor who just wants to grow his potatoes and make his little town a wealthy place to earn a spot in Washington.
On Jackie Kong's directorial decisions come a narrative voice at the opening after a radio DJ tells us about rain showers and thunderstorms moving into the area, prophetically announces doom to the little town of Pottsville, Idaho.
She also gives us a run-down at what the surviving characters did with their lives after the incident at Pottsville is over.
It would have spoiled the film's screed to imagine that the Confederate States of America would have done so, years after the war.
(That those two would still be candidates after all these timeline changes or that there are elections at all in such a country is truly mind boggling).
while after winning the civil war they might have implemented censorship for the sake of keeping slaves quiet, they wouldn't have used such a statist policy for its own sake.
i realize that the focus on states' rights could have degraded over time, but directly after the war the south would have DEFINITELY recognized the northern states' rights to be free states.
Bond has to fall over the cliff after the plane has fallen before him, skydive to catch it up Â defying the laws of physics Â and then fly away.
Unfortunately, immediately after this shorter portion concludes, the film basically falls apart and it never recovers.
: Entertainment Television station that was intended more or less to be an unscripted (yeah right) update on the ditsy, southern-tinged, child-like and obviously obese former Guess Jeans and Playboy Centerfold-cum-plus-size Lane Bryant model Anna-Nicole Smith as she attempts to piece her crumbling and severely unstable life back together after numerous career failures, long public court battles with a former son-in-law over the would-be inheritance (supposedly worth millions) that she was supposed to receive when her *shudders* 90 plus year old billionaire oilman husband died back in the mid-1990's.
Now, after I have seen this movie I think it is necessary to warn people like me who know nothing about it: First of all this sure isn't an "awesome" and "hilarious" film to everybody.
Fans of THE HOWLING series, if any exist after the torrent of awful sequels, will also be disappointed to find that this film is taken totally serious, all the warped comedy of the previous films is completely exorcised in favour of a stone faced tale of werewolf killings.
The music played after each death is annoying too.
Imagine you are coming home from an evening out on the town with a friend, after having a few drinks together.
I saw street fighter, Armageddon, Clockstoppers, the Core and the Day after Tomorrow in theaters and spoiler is still the only movie I've actually almost passed out from watching.
My Friend and I Actually looked at each other after it was over and said that it was the longest 7 hours of our lives.
I don't like this film for it's really boring,story of a father who wants to satisfy her bride after the death of his son.like every Hindi movie the boy comes from big cities like New York or whatever & just after the entrance,he meets a typical Indian girl,they marry each other during one man still loves the girl & has dined his love to see her happy... You can watch this film which takes a lot of time of you & after it ends you are totally board.Amitabh Bachchan does the better job.as a satisfying father to do the right move whenever necessary.Salman Khan is a bit old to play a young man comes from abroad to fall in love in India.he doesn't play like he should.Rani Mukherjee is my sort of favorite actress in Bollywod,but i got to confess that she isn't prepared for such a role,Hema Malini is unused.she walks in the stage to prove she is there.
the second half is so slow that "i wanted to rip my arm off, just so i could have something to throw(at the screen)" (yes, it's joey's line)  I was surprised to find that Mr. Bacchan, and Hema Malini could actually act so badly (hema-ji, has little or no role anyways) .... and Rani Mukherji and AB Sr. have none of the magic one has come to expect after "Black."
BAGHBAN was scripted 40 years back and it was modified and it had some good emotional moments bt yet it was too oldfashioned   Here too the story sounds 2000 years old  Rani Mukherjee's role, her dress sense, her acting, her smiling is all too bad Don't know why she is boring to watch Seriously i loved her in YUVA, HUM TUM but nowdays she is just doing the same roles, same acting style, even her dress scenes are outrageous  I don't understand people praising her like hell here, she has no role just to cry after Salman dies and then get married because Amitabh says so  About the rest as i said the story is like PREM ROG(1982) and the handling is not at all convincing  The all hoopla done about the clash of titans between Amitabh and Om is just 5 minutes talk  Direction by Ravi Chopra is outdated Music is outdated  Amitabh once again demonstrates his acting skills and overshadows everyone but he is getting monotonous with such roles Salman does well in the first half, nothing new but he is more lively and less animated then in most of his films John looks sick(he was suffering from jaundice those days) but fails in his acting here Hema Malini is just there in the movie, her role lacks substance In fact the director doesn't at all care for women's wishes in the film supposedly based on women role improvement in society Rajpal comes does some usual gags and is forgotten Parmeet Sethi has no role Om Puri is too loud
Especially in an year where really good different movies were being made ?Those who are against widows remarrying will continue to do so even after watching this movie.
Of course since the Code just came in it is abundantly clear this will be platonic and annulled the nano- second after Romero's capture.
I was outraged and started seeing red after watching this show.
Of course, after 4 murders, it never occurred to the old codger to hire an exterminator or maybe even move.
Shortly after, he meets Rae-Down Chong, not necessarily a good thing.
Shortly after the meeting, he becomes instantly successful..
I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).
Not only does this device show an astonishing lack of creativity, but it also grates on your nerves after an hour and a half.
The first episode premired and after the challenge Kutcha went.
Food for thought: The USAF command and control authority kept the largest arsenal of weapons in the history of mankind under perfect control for decades--without a glitch--until it was no longer needed after the Soviet Union's collapse.
It is a very enjoyable show to watch and I know everyone that will start to watch it will become hooked after a few episodes.
The second part of the "Ginger Snaps" trilogy picks up after the first one.
- The inmates, overjoyed that Burke killed their companion, decide he's not such a bad guy after all and let him leave the prison.
The script seemed to have been written on a chalkboard - interchanging cliche after cliche though lacking a satirical or retroactive temperament.
Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe.
It seemed to me that they had completely lost the point; Dorian Gray is almost never independent in the book, but in the movie he suddenly feels like taking control and arrange a party right after the death of his former love.
Make sure you check your blood-sugar level after watching this one.
after the first 15 minutes the story seemed to turn in circles- which actually was a good thing for a friend of mine, who got out of the theater to buy some drinks and returned 15 minutes later: I didn't have to tell him what was going on while he was gone, because actually nothing happened at all.
Seasons from best to worst (I haven't seen seasons 3-6)  Guatemala- It was really great after the merge, had great players, and Steph and Danni were the best Final 2 ever (I wish they still did the Final 2).
James Franco seriously needs to redeem himself somehow after this heinous contribution to the cinema canon.
What I expected of this after seeing the trailer, I'm not sure.
Once again the pets somehow get left behind just after the plane takes off, so Shadow the dog (voiced by The Bodyguard's Ralph Waite, replacing Don Ameche), Chance the dog, (voiced by Michael J.
We're at a point where the family is preparing to go camping in Canada, but after a paranoid Chance cocks things up by thinking he's being abandoned, the animals stupidly run away from the airport and find themselves down the back streets of San Francisco.
Ignoring the strangeness of the main character as some bland and psychotic looking teenager who decides to get drunk and travel anywhere--literally, anywhere--after his failed wedding (to lose his virginity, nevertheless), the audience is subjected to a pointless movie that flip-flops between numerous clichÃ©s and blatant ripoff of more superior films.
Most especially why after being taught several lessons about trusting strangers earlier in the film?
We know nothing about them after they are introduced except that Chris lost his wife and child in an car accident.
At the end when the bad guy drives his flaming truck into the manhole after his men have pumped the sewers full of deadly gas, you're like, great - New York is gonna blow up.
Beyond the obvious "Christians are mean-spirited, busy-body, judgemental kill-joys" theme, and the rest of the plot is a total clichÃ©: feel-good, rich-boy-meets-poor-gold-digging-whitetrash-girl ...and they really fall in love, only to have him cut off by his rich father but they marry anyway and show THEM by living happily ever after.
I enjoyed the stephen king tale, i thought it did a good job from adapting from the book and it was creative, but the second story, was the most god awful thing ive ever seen on film, it was just horrible, i was in pain watching this, do your self a favor turn this movie off right after the first story, the second one is so bad.
I don't expect everything in a movie to be completely correct, after all it is entertainment, but at least once in a while something should work in theory in the real world!
(His end was pre-ordained; he was, after all, French.)
Do NASA-trained pilots often abandon the controls immediately after they've established that the autopilot is incompetent- A WIZARD DID IT.
So to prevent herself from changing into the beast she injects monksblood into her system, but after an overdose she wakes up in a rehabilitation clinic.
(some spoilers) I saw this annoying and pointless film yesterday after few friends told me it was great.
It gets tired after a while.
This is so blatantly annoying that after you've met the cousin, you just don't care anymore.
I can't put into words why I didn't like it after that point.
Having realized after the first 10 minutes that this movie is going to be relentless in its pursuit of unfunniness, I was half-hoping that Travolta would once again introduce the concept of "leverage" into the plot.
It gets tired after a while.
This movie despite all the strange violence, deviant sex, and the sadness of the main character.... i actually feel kinda warm and fuzzy after i watch it.
Now after a stint in the hospital, he plots revenge.
It's David's first day at school after having recently moved to the area.
But after seeing how the bullies treat various other students David has none of it, and in fact tries to befriend and help the picked on students.
The bullies go after David and in an 'accident' David's leg is crushed, crippling him.
Tony Lo Bianco plays a Latin cad who meets women through a dating service, happily strings them along and marries them under an alias before taking off with their money; after meeting Shirley Stoler's possessive, mercurial Martha, he almost reluctantly allows his deceptions to turn into a series of murders.
Of course, no prison can hold Quinn, who meticulously engineers his escape in one brilliant sequence (the best one in the entire film, in fact), teams up with flamboyant arms-dealer Yaz (Color-me-bad former San Antonio Spurs basketball sensation Dennis Rodman) and together the two go after Stavros, who has kidnapped Quinn's pregnant wife and is threatening to kill her once the baby is born and then raise it has his own.
I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD.
Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that.
But as soon as he arrives at his destination the film degenerates into one boring setup after another in which various combinations of people talk a lot about whether they are in love or not or which suitor will win Gish.
The actors, the storyline and the governing VISION of this project seem to be dis comfortably stuck in the feeling of average German 90s television bonanza (no matter how successful it must have been at its time) - and this doesn't add a sense of missing aura and charming feel to the flick...  And finally: the producers really ought to be warned for their slated upcoming productions: if you tailor you next films after this model DON'T EVER ATTACH THE KIND OF CREDITS WITH FEELGOOD BACKSTAGE FOOTAGE AND BLOPPERS ... it's simply downright embarrassing, period (I had to cover my eyes).
The guy who once was the Clown has retired after his girlfriend was killed in action, but now it's time for him to take his costume out of the vault, put on the smelly rubber mask again and kick some bad butt.
You could zap into this crap every time, stay with it for five minutes and change the channel again, without the feeling that you're missing something before or after what you just watched, it has made-for-TV written all over (Afterwards I even had problems to summarize the story at all...).
A friend supports helicopters (yes, several of them, because they are wrecked one after the other).
I have seen student films that are better than this, after just a couple of minutes the complete amateurish production is obvious.
Now, that's not to say the movie doesn't make us laugh, because there are several sequences in the film that are down right hysterical, proving that a movie can be successfully made about an imaginary six foot rabbit, but most of the funny scenes accrue during the first twenty minutes, for the one joke this film has gets stale after a while.
And finally, after the laughs die down and the movie's insanity begins, it follows a steady path going down hill into ludicrous-ville.
The poor man must have got the script only after signing the contract.
The DVD has finally been released in 2010 after years of dithering by Optimum Releasing.
This movie proves my point that Greta Garbo was one of the smartest movie stars to ever live - Mae West, unlike Garbo should have wisely retired from films after her heyday in the 1930s.
Apparently, Miss West wasn't too keen on having these four stealing her limelightÂ However, she did approve of her leading men who, of course, are requested to still be lusting helplessly after Mae Â an aristocratic Timothy Dalton (who gets to sing a duet with Mae and whose remarks are frequently misinterpreted in the press!)
Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, everybody loves Raymond) died after this movie!
I only pray that Martin Short and the rest of the brilliant actors can get their careers back in order after this film.
In scene after scene one of the main characters, Sandy, falls asleep in the middle of meetings.
Except perhaps for O'Hara, he seems to have a good grasp on his role, and can be excused for perhaps turning in a lackluster effort...after all, it is very difficult to not be affected by having to share scenes with Dorkk.
The drawn out slapstick gags come one after the other, each more unfunny than the last and all accompanied by the cast laughing uproariously to their own stunts.
More people will claim said body than fake parents claiming that little Natural Redhead "Annie" after Daddy Warbucks offered a reward.
Ah, but this is not all as Dennis Quaid is also having problems with his children after a recent family tragedy What a shockingly original twist in a shockingly original plot!
You know, throwing out a psycho thriller in 2009 with fragmentary cuts, somber tone and final twist, and doing it as if it were the most profitable years of the genre (namely, a bit after the release of se7en) is risky to say the least.
The movie is too predictable, after watching the half of it, you know by 90% how it will end.
Detective Breslin (Quaid) is after someone who is killing people and hanging them on a contraption with hooks boring into the skin.
There is a mixture of Quaid's character Detective Breslin agonizing over not being there for his two boys after his wife's death and the bizarre murders cropping up all over the place.
Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid.
Dennis Quade was horrible in The day after tomorrow, and he stinks this one up also.
The Ending: At the end when Aidan comes home after his son dies, he wakes up Sean and Sean asks where Alex is.
You feel a bit different about Heather Grahm after seeing this movie, since 9/10 of her screen time she is having sex with Ryan Phillipe.
My friend turned to me after watching this on HBO On Demand and said literally the same thing to me.
During the second half of this movie the only thought in my head was "please don't let this be the twist, please tell me that writers are more imaginative than that, please don't let me have to watch the second half of this movie only to find it was what I guessed after the first 20 minutes".
This has "fortnight old turkey, should have been chucked in the bin after Christmas", writ large upon it.
This is one of those movies that is so obviously thrown together to make a quick buck that anyone stuck watching it is bound to feel embarrassed after sitting through, say, the first ten minutes, wondering why they have chosen to waste their time in such a way.
Costas "sneaking up" on character after character while making all kinds of noise, the enemy compound so sophisticated it controls top secret space satellites, but such shoddy security that the marines' walkie-talkies go undetected as far a underground subs and Costas runs around without any surveillance picking him up.
The question you have to ask yourself after sitting through this turgid piece of utterly uninspired cinema is "why did they bother?"
Maybe I'm getting carried away, after all it is for kids, but even when compared to the Elizabeth Taylor Lassie films this just doesn't cut it.
It's something that if you saw it on tv, you'd flip the channel after a few seconds if you even have THAT much patience.
On a more cheerful note: Most of the cinema-goers that evening managed to sleep some time during the movie (myself included), so after the movie people were well rested.
I nearly bought MYSTERIOUS OBJECT, but after reading some reviews I decided to pass, as it sounded rather too strange and a little boring.
This had to be turned off after about 15 minutes.
I felt ill after 5 minutes.
I turned it off halfway through and I don't even wonder if the pitiful protagonist played by Ritter got to live happily ever after - he certainly didn't deserve to.
He enlists an unwitting Sal Mineo as an accomplice, robs the legation of $600,000 after murdering a security guard, then tries to pin the crime on Mineo by bumping him off.
The blend of horror and mystery is a cool combination, but that simply wears out thin after you see it the first time.
I went in with an open mind, after reading all the reviews in IMDb.com and I must admit, much better than I had expected.
It was a waste of money and time and the character you think may be the normal character I was talking about hardly ever comes up or does anything the rest of the movie is just about stupid people doing stupid stuff that gets on your nerves after a while.
Michael Cera's sketch though actually had me laughing for a few hours after I had already watched the movie.
Other than that, Jamie Kennedy's sketch made me went to take a shower after watching it.
Surely 50 years after the event we can have some intelligent films about the Second World War.
All of this after a totally unbelievable scene where she is rescued by him after he comes out of nowhere to overpower an armed and dangerous killer who was about to blow her away...I didn't believe it any more than I believed her manhandling several 6 foot 2 inch 200 lb thugs throwing them against the car and handcuffing them like they were match sticks.
This film provides the most biased and unapologetic endorsement for killing children with disabilities of any ever produced.It should not and cannot be appropriately be compared with the so-called Nazi euthanasia films of the 1930s, such as Wolfgang Liebeneiner's Ich klage an (I accuse) (1941), which was shown at the War Crimes Trials after World War II.
It is important to remember that the inquest after Katie Lynn Baker's death ruled that she died as a result of homicide but that the BC crown simply decided not to prosecute because "there is no likelihood of conviction" (BC Ministry of the Attorney General, 2 December 1999).
Much more money....I have the figures somewhere......Anyhow both these movies have gone into the memories and archives of "Chop Suie' or karate pot-boilers.....One of the many things I admire about James Ryan is that after these two big successes for him in the USA, he was offered many more roles like that and could of happily gone on making them ad nauseum, going for the money and fame.
Only after they have smashed headlong into a tree and done permanent damage to their 4X4 Jeep Cherokee do they discover the critter.
Suddenly, an angry momma bear emerges and comes after them.
There's one scene in particular that stunned me, it's just after the first attack when Rich is killed & as Wes drives the jeep away next to a sheer drop & Sean grabs the steering wheel & they have a struggle which sends the jeep over the edge of the small cliff & causing themselves all sorts of problems.
It's just such a stupid scene that makes no sense & after Wes & Sean don't even argue about it, no offense but I would have killed Sean myself.
Three guys and one girl in some woods with a bear out for revenge after them.
The first maybe 30 minutes or so are actually pretty decent, but after that the movie just sort of meanders around and nothing happens (I don't mean in terms of plot - no plot is fine, but no action?
In hindsight, I should have expected this - after all, how much can really happen between 4 teens and a bear?
This film is about when 4 teens (Wes, Shaun, Ritch and Lauren) go wild after they graduate from high school, brake into private property, and kill a grizzly cub whose mother goes on rage to kill them.
I started to watch Grizzly Rage (titled Off Road in TV guide) on TV last night but it was so bad I had to turn it off after 30 minutes.
Girls tops can magically sew themselves back together after being ripped open.
This really made me mad because, after Stan, Richie was my favorite character.
(Saying things like: "Yeah, hilarious for me too, after we blow your f***ing head off, baby" to It taking the shape of a huge Paul Bunyon statue.)
But Steven King's "It" handcuffed me and after two weeks I completed the book.
And it's OK that they cut out the kids being lost after first believing they killed It (definitely because of the made for TV movie... hell, even a theatrical movie...
And after forcing myself to finish the abortive The Forest, by the same director,(and yes, I foolishly purchased The Forest, curse my hide), I have no idea why I wanted to see this.
But after In The Heat of the Night, The Defiant Ones and Lilies of the Field - to name just three Â then why did it have to come to this?
Well, after seeing it, Mom and Dad obviously had to ask what I thought.
Seriously, Don Bluth should be ashamed of himself for the whole mess, and after watching how bad the effects are at the end it's almost impossible to remember the rest of the movie.
To prevent this, the Duke sends his clumsy (and unfortunately not very funny) nephew, Hunch (whose vocabulary mostly consists of rhyming with the word "annihilation") after the animals.
It also suffers from the problem of a major identity crisis: on one hand it tries to be a simplistic fairy tale, on the other it attempts to be a musical parody of Elvis (Chanticleer's rock star persona and his songs are very closely modeled after the legendary singer, from the slick hairdo to the deep voice and the mannerisms).
You can imagine how obnoxious this can be after awhile, what with all this random singing on the farm with no farmer.
Normally, this would be bad, but after five minutes, it's pretty obvious that they'd probably be better off dead.
7) The climax: after going on this "amazing adventure," it all comes down to a stupid climax of convincing Chanticleer to crow, but he doesn't feel like it.
The Boston Tea Party is entertaining although the singing after it is unforgivably Disney.
A previous review mentioned the same thing... by not allowing the character of Rab Silsbee to die after the Battle of Lexington, the entire perspective of the film disappears.
In recent years, story lines are dragged out f-o-r-e-v-e-r and clearly the only motivating factor working here is to keep the addicted viewers coming back day after day.
This movie is pretty much the sane as The Day after Tomorrow but even more predictable (and worst effects).
Wait, if that's not enough the retarded guy who was killed actually killed the girl after all.
I watched this film after i had seen Fiza, which was absolutley brilliant.
Morris chases after her.
The dumbest part of this was his falling for an ambitious and talented Lane and then insisting, after they are married, that she drop everything to be his stay at home wife.
He doesn't answer a call from her the night after her folks leave so from that we are meant to infer I think that he is cheating or something so she just ups sticks and moves out after her folks.
While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was "Matoaka" not "Pocahontas" (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not "tree-hugging hippies"--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).
what kills it, and grates on my nerves like a cheese to a shredder was the endless, and by endless i mean, scene after scene, nonstop clichÃ©'.
It was like watching an "80's" after school special.
Poor Tommy Yates (Brian Presley), one of the heroes of the Iraq war drama Home of the Brave, has fallen so far after his return home that the best job he can get is (shudder) working the box office at a movie theatre.
Director Irwin Winkler started out as an accomplished producer, and bore that credit on many good films (Raging Bull and Rocky among them), but he has yet to direct a good film, after many tries (The Net, At First Sight, De-Lovely, Life as a House).
****SPOILER ALERT***The almost anti-climatic ending has the mole, who was hidden among the hostages,come out of hiding and after almost having the city of Bucharest, together with the US Embessy, blown sky high has a change of heart giving Mitchell the secret code to stop the Atomic Bomb from detonating and turns from villain to hero in a matter of minutes.
This is a low-budget film based on poor directing, dumb script and unbelievable story line (after 9/11, but even before that, it is more clear who would blow up a US embassy).
b) Daryl Hannah, still looking gorgeous, but no sexy scenes at all, just farcical groping and snogging, and c) Tom Berenger, a great guy to have in an action movie, and d) Romanian women, the second-best looking women in Europe(after Slovenia).
Apparently he is MORE than able to star in crappy films after all!
If it's 19th-century fiction you're after, a Jane Austen dramatization would be a better choice; if it's historical accuracy you like, you won't find it here.
This movie fails to redeem itself, even after that possibility became miraculously available.
Wee see Jones envisioning being at a church in order to free himself of this curse of being a vampire and his fate is left after that scene.
The woman on the other hand is the wife of the man that committed suicide and ends up staying at jones place and finds her husbands body in the freezer and finds out that after she has fallen in love with Jones that there is more to this man than she cares to know about.
I took a chance on this film after reading a couple of intriguing reviews of it.
Duane Jones ("Night of the Living Dead") gives a marvelously languid performance as a doctor who suffers from an insatiable desire for human blood, brought onto him after being stabbed with an ancient cursed dagger.
Shortly after, when his assistant (played by Bill Gunn, the director) commits suicide, Dr. Hess comes into contact with his widow Ganja and sweeps her along in his strange and depressing 'vampire' universe.
Montalban's detective solves a difficult crime with finesse, always doggedly pursuing one clue after another until he arrives at a solution.
That goes nowhere so we're then supposed to be impressed by Diamond's use of a lie detector after Brown agrees to be questioned.
The only clue he has to go on is 'Alicia'--the name Brown's girlfriend blurts out at the hospital after a suicide try.
Betinni, an associate of Brown's former boss, disappeared after a warrant was issued for his arrest.
Diamond has no idea where Batinni is, but lo and behold, after being 'tortured' by Brown and his minions and dropped off at his boss's doorstep, Captain Peterson, it turns out that Peterson knew all along where Betinni was hiding.
Alicia is about to remember who Brown murdered on the yacht but goes back to the looney bin after Brown shows up and says hello to her.
Anyways this movie's about a jewelery store holdup that goes wrong leaving Ned (Caruso) hospitalized after his lover/ co-hort in crime Jude (Kelly Lynch) leaves him bloodied and sore after she pushes him out of there speeding getaway car.
Eye Candy: Kelly Lynch offers T&A (it's very early in the film, so after that scene's over cut & run...trust me)   My Grade: D-
Look closely and you'll see him shift a little bit after Mitchum puts him on his horse, if you can stand getting that far in this movie.
Right after he loses his fire, the sun starts coming up, and weeeeeee!
Goodnight God Bless was much better than I expected after seeing the preview that appears before the film on the VHS version.
The opening of "Goodnight,God Bless" is quite unsettling and memorable:we see a priest with a rosary walking near the school before murdering a young school teacher with a butcher knife and then shooting 5 school children on the playground and wounding countless others.This sequence is shot in chaotic and hand-held style that certainly packs the punch.Unfortunately after this nasty beginning the film quickly goes downhill.First of all it has more to do with dull cop drama than slasher flick.There are a couple of thrills including the scene of the woman chased through the forest,but the acting is so-so and the ending is abrupt and comes out-of-nowhere.It's a crying shame that "Lucifer" is so terminally boring.4 out of 10.
Like for instance how Geena can claim that she loves William after spending, oh what?
But, after I thought of it as the same theme with a similar story, I started liking it more.
Moreover, she and Karaman clearly developed a sense of mutual trust, so she logically would show Karaman the missing key and let him do the investigation (after all he's a police).
I don't object to the animations, because they're thematically unified by always being connected to travel and cellphones and they create a sense of link with the 20-somethings, the generation after the director's that he's focusing on here; the fact that they're glib and kitsch just fits with everything else quite intentionally.
We've all seen the softcore pornographic films that are aired on Cinemax and Showtime after dark, and they're terrible enough.
Vic Rondell the new fire chief has just arrived, and when one snake attack after another occurs.
Shortly after a tyre on the truck blows & causes the truck to crash, after killing the two men the venomous snake escapes... Jump '20 Years Later' & the to the small American town of San Catalano & the new fire chief Vic Rondelli (Harry Hamlin) has just arrived to take over from his retiring counterpart George (Beau Billingslea).
I was intrigued to see this movie after I found out that it was one of Keanu's earlier film debuts.
After all, this movie was made nearly ten years after "The Andromeda Strain."
Call me old fashioned if you will, but I think part of the beauty in animated children's films is the innocence they portray, and in Thumbelina the constant battle for the girl was not after her heart, rather after her body!
Finally, Senta is a ridiculously deranged young woman (wouldn't you, too, hear the stylus skipping across the LP if someone said they loved you and that you were the person for whom they had been waiting forever, after one afternoon of sex?
I left before the film ended, just after director Schnabel shifted to the technique of reprising a scene with different outcomes.
Left in tears after thirty minutes.)
The portrayal of the English soldier as some sort of hero is utter crap and after reading other peoples comments on this film its pretty clear that they are motivated by their political beliefs rather than how bad the quality of acting really is.
Every time a Hollywood writer can't figure out a clever ending, he or she decides to turn the baddie into a CIA "agent" so he can get the girl and live happily ever after.
Avoid, or if you must watch it, be ruthless and promise to turn it off after 15-20 minutes if it doesn't really grab you.
Fell asleep 15 minutes after it started.
Scene after scene is misdirected and lacks effect.
Though this movie is to some extent, demanding on the audience, a little patience and decent memory will leave you spellbound after the movie.
What do you know; those kids had a conscience after all.
It meanders through one half hearted empty skit after another, dislodging us from any sincere interest at all.
I was not expecting a super production as "The Day after tomorrow" if not a kind of 10.5 or something like that.
The plot is as thin as the earth's crust after these dweebs drilled.
The dude from Galactica needs to rethink his career choices after being pitched as an overzealous government type.
The movie never gets scary or interesting after the opening scenes again.
i am so angry after watching this, a film that shouldnt even have been made.
Later, after she visits briefly with Blood, she sends Angus out to round up Blood's old crew.
What little action there was just showed people falling down after a few gun shots fired.
Was the "brutally realistic view," as you so elegantly put it, before or after the exploitation of porno shots from Latina girls parading around on the beach shore?
But after doing that I found myself puzzled.
It's such a sub-par movie that it's action becomes forgettable soon after viewing, leaving only the flaws to remind me why I should never watch anything stamped with the sign "Hollywood Action Movie".
Was amazed and awestruck that how was Hollywood capable of churning out such amazing stuff with such amazing consistency...but after seeing "Bad boys" and a few other disappointing movies, I realized that Hollywood too, wasn't perfect.
To begin with, if you see the 2 movies one after the other like i did, you'll save a lot of your valuable time playing it in fast forward, since this Part 2 has about 40 minutes with footage from the first one.
So, as you could imagine, it is pretty boring and even after that, when Ricky explains what happened to him after the ordeal at the end of the first one (in which his brother is shot dead in front of him), it does not get much better.
By throwing flashback after flashback of the first film within the first 45 minutes (were half-way there) and having Ricky, the brother of the original Santa killer provide the voice-over.
But after that slog out, it still has a 'few' amusingly stupid merits throughout its shoddiness and vapid moments.
We learn about Ricky's brother, who the first film is about, then after half the movie flashing back to the first film, we get to know Ricky and how he became so psychotic.
But after Ricky escapes from the room he's telling the story in, there's gonna' be trouble for whoever gets in his path.
You'll figure out the scenes that make this film a classic among "bad" movie lovers, but other than that, I see no reason to watch this film (or even the rest of the series) after the conclusion of part 1.
The most inventive kill comes when he attacks bookie with an umbrella that opens after being thrusted through the stomach.
They take the best clips from the series that most people have already seen and place them one after another out of context, thus stripping them of any of the original comedic value or suspense.
I was looking forward to seeing this film, but completely lost interest after only a few initial shots.
So predictable and ridiculous that it's one chuckle after another, so I guess I enjoyed it a little, but most likely not for the same reasons the film was made.
Thank the lord that he didn't resume retirement after it.
Dolph takes a break from directorial duties with this one, which is just as well as the poor chap needed one after the varitable trio of The Defender, The Russian Specialist and Missionary Man, although according to the trivia page he took over for most of the time from director Samuel Dolhasca.
It is a shame that after a brilliant first two films, full of cameraderie and a great comedy element as well as a plausible plot, this one just ruins it all.
Sure, there was an obvious sense of inevitability about a first sequel, and it pretty much followed straight afterwards, just restoring Murphy's stock after one less than stellar box office feature (The Golden Child).
That said, the move away from comedy and into action also doesn't help, Murphy getting his final "huh huh huh huh" after seeing himself and his friends shot and bleeding to death.
What they made was a movie so horribly unfunny that five years after seeing it, I still use it as a measuring stick for movie futility.
But after Beverly Hills Cop III, I can't remember them.
I came to the conclusion after 90 minutes that even the most incredibly shocking twist ending couldn't make up for the hour and a half of dreariness I was subjected to.
De Wald secretly leads a complex money printing scheme within the park and Foley, still seeking revenge for Tood's death, defies the wishes of the FBI and goes after him in his own, unique way.
The story is about a famous but reclusive film star (obviously patterned after Greta Garbo) who lives on an isolated Greek island.
Craig Sheffer delivers a bland performance as the hero, a former airplane pilot who became a technician/engineer after a flying accident and now has a chance to redeem himself.
Also on any list of brutal '70s revenge-westerns would be The Deadly Trackers, originally planned as a Samuel Fuller movie but completed by Barry Shear after Fuller quit the project.
Irish sheriff Sean Kilpatrick (Richard Harris) looks after the Texas town of Santa Rosa and has made a point of solving crimes and capturing criminals without resorting to violence.
For example the mother in law refused to look after the children when the main character (Owen) had a business trip to make.
The girlfriend refused him when he asked her to look after the kids for a few days.
The son couldn't look after his younger brother yet could get himself from Australia to England alone.
Too Sweet ends up in prison again because he violently pummels a boxer to death during a boxing match after his drink was spiked with some sort of drug that made him crazy and more violent.
The music was catchy the first two or three times you listen to it but can also be repetitive and annoying after a while.
So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase.
I was giddy with girlish-glee when I found out about this movie shortly after seeing Spirits Within.
Well, I was gonna rate this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while righting this, I'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better.
they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest.
Character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end.
Nutrition-ed with radiation while in outer space, wasps mutate into giant wind-up toys that mimic a groaning sound like motocross bikes after being sent into orbit on a V-2 rocket during an entomology experiment.
I'm not one to usually comment on a film after watching it, I rarely do so.
The very notion of an Irish university named after a British royal is insulting.
Note to the writer/director/producer - many Irish people are a bit tetchy about the subject of the British monarchy and would really not appreciate our main educational institution named after their queen.
The car that hit Rani's character was being driven by Tabu (in a special appearance) and she is married to Shah Rukh Khan (another special appearance) whom she races home to tell what she has done, after fleeing the scene of a crime, leaving Rani at her own mercy.
It has been pointed out before that after Jacqui McDonald retired from the show for reasons that have been lost to time, Somers' ego began to run rampant.
When the authorities track them down and grant them all leave to stay, it's seems it will be a happy ending after all.
Unfortunately this shoddy scriptwriting cripples our interest in the second half of the film, with one 'outrageous' revelation after another resulting in a forced tragic ending.
Perhaps the film have been better if the movie had been about their reintegration into a new culture after surviving a traumatic ordeal in a war-torn environment.
4) Kuki becomes rugged after protecting her property from wild animals, preparing the ranch for a disastrous sandstorm, and teaming up with friends to rid her land of evil poachers.
The idea behind Saathiya is definitely a new one - what happens after the lovebirds marry?
I watched Alaipayuthey more than 10 times and remembered every scene and dialog in it after the first viewing.
He is, after all, the best movie maker.
At one point their jeep gets stuck in the mud (of course after Mom warns her) and she steps out into a puddle and wrecks her new gucci's.
This filming and editing effect is so subtly handled by both the highly experienced cinematographer and the editor so that the viewer's eyes move with the camera so effortlessly, and after a short while, get accustomed to it.
Nothing is interesting and nothing could stop me from walking out after an hour and a half.
and furthermore, there's nothing really interesting going on in africa, unless you like seeing pointless deaths and lots of crying after.
'oh, oh, now the kid goes to play with the poisonous snakes after his mother just warned him about it!
The story is of course about the rise and death of Rudolph Valentino (Rudolf Nureyev) and after his sudden and tragic death we see the woman in his life reflect in flashbacks about his life.
The impersonations of real-life players in Valentino's short life are grotesque caricatures, and the flashback conceit of female admirers recalling their associations with "The Sheik" after his premature demise is flabby and tiresome (and fails to pay off in any sort of narrative context).
so i said hey why not it's only $11.00, but after viewing it i think i should have waited a little longer.
when the corpses of fellow boarders come back to life they do what "kill" which isn't much of a climax, after a few die only two are left to leave and fight off the dead (which is choppy by how the camera is moving so fast to catch all the action)none the less once they leave on the dirt bike which was left there they meet the pact leader to decide there fate.
It seems to be unlucky for a movie about a evil child killing other people it might spoil people watching this people please do not watch cause after the day I watched this movie, it gave me sad dreams about Patty McCormack's death I almost started to cry after I dreamed and it might upset you a very sad movie and spoiled movie...
A far more effective and subtle choice -- both for an actor and a psychopath (all psychopaths are actors, after all).
"The Bad Seed" couldn't work today -- or even a few years after it was made.
Presumably so the presumably terrified audience can presumably return to their normal lives after the presumed shocks of this presumed thriller.
Her only friend after relocating to the States is a religious nut who used to be a prostitute, and thanks to her influence, Eunice is slowly pushed over the edge..
i am a James spader fan, but after seeing this movie early one morning suffering from insomnia i question his ability as a person.
compared to the TV series,this thing is crap.i couldn't get through it,i was so bored.it's just not exciting.there's no real suspense or excitement,at least up to the point i watched.that's really surprising,given the quality of the series.it takes place after season six,and before season seven,so i guess it's a season seven prequel.if you can get through it,i would recommend it,as it does fill in some gaps between the sixth and seventh season.i only know this,because in some scenes they allude to events that must have happened in the movie.for me,though it was just too difficult to get through.my vote for 24:Redemption is a 4/10
That he would give up so easily after being a fugitive for more than a year.
I wonder why this flick get R-rating.Yes,it has two nice sex scenes and nothing more.No gore,no real suspense,no intresting plot-everything here is so boring and lame,that after watching one hour of this crap I felt asleep.Please,I beg of you,if you find this title collecting dust somewhere, don't rent it.I give it 1.5, maybe 2 out of 10.
In short, this is yet another horror film that you'll have completely forgotten two hours after seeing it.
The day after watching it I paid a visit to my local Waterstones to try and solve the mystery once and for all.
From the title and what little I knew about its subject-matter, I was expecting a BELLE DE JOUR-meets-JACK THE RIPPER kind of thing but imagine my disappointment when, after an intriguing start, this is forsaken for boring political machinations which ineffectively breach thriller territory towards the end.
Still, the often-nude Weaver is nevertheless quite good in her role but the film is certainly no BELLE DE JOUR (1967) and it is easy to see why Bob Swaim's career went downhill very quickly after having made the excellent French policier LA BALANCE (1982).
Sorry I saw it only after 2 years and it was still running full, and I din't like it.
Many of you are familiar with the feeling when after watching a film (or midway through it) you think that this was a complete waste of time and money.
I almost got this feeling after watching this film.
But, as I was coming to grips with the compassion the producers had to cast Gary Grimes after this flick, lead me to thinking about those good IL' days of Watergate and the dis grace the Republicans revealed themselves to be.
Hmmm, to totality of possibilities seem endless of a John Wayne double feature at the Drive In, especially after sneaking in to see 'The Harrad Experiment' the week before!
However, soon after, there was an announcement that the show would be coming to America with a new cast and new Kitchen Stadium.
Six months after I saw this movie I saw Chalte Chalte.
But soon after getting married, marital problems creep in and soon both Oberoi and Mukherjee think they have made a big mistake.
Andrew McCarthy has exactly one brief scene as an assassin--he does get special billing, but it's neither a cameo or supporting role, just a straight-up bit part (I hope he fired his agent after this).
(Read: Imperial Reckoning, by Caroline Elkins on the treatment of the Kikuyu after WWII.)
Most of the "settlers" in Zimbabwe didn't arrive there until after 1945.
A shame to be coming out on DVD so quickly after his triumphant academy win, Whitaker's questionable Canadian-esqe accent paired with the boring, underdeveloped character he is written here just proves too bland for lead role material.
While the movie isn't wretched in the fashion of pap like "The Majestic", it is indeed painful to sit through as one scene after another drags the stale plot through the French countryside.
It begins with Charlotte sitting in a railway carriage rolling up a cigarette with a type of paper that wasn't on the market until after the war (i.e.
Still in the carriage she then talks to a complete stranger who is obviously after personal information.
A short while later comes a scene (after said airdrop, of which the enemy had got wind and ambushed it), which shows that the Germans have left bodies of resistant fighters lying unguarded in the middle of a field.
Ashwarya Rai's voice over after a while becomes boring.
However, after watching Chocolat, I wanted to know a lot more about the Mayan heritage of chocolate and about the folklore behind the 'magic' - the film just inspired that romantic imagery and magic feeling about both Vianne and the chocolate.
Chances are you are going to hate the movie even more after reading the book.
I'm sure the intention was to give the audience the sense that they were the camera, watching this story unfold, but the effect gets tiring and irritating after a very short time.
Surprisingly the movie ends on a high note and after the terrible hack-fest in between I really like how the movie was resolved.
With the exception of Inferno, the direct-to-DVD sequels were cinematic crap; even Disney has the sense to stop making DVD sequels to good movies after 1.
Anyways they party in the house after meeting ''the host'' played by Lance Henriksen.
Two years after the tragic suicide of their friend Adam, a group of heavily addicted Hellworld players receive invitations to an exclusive party for Pinhead fans only.
as usual, being a big hellraiser fan i was looking forward to the next episode; after seeing hellworld, there is only one conclusion: this time the really f...
I wonder why Doug Bradley even accepted to play that part after reading the script!
We're in a perpetual state of not knowing what we're supposed to be concerned about until 80 minutes into the film, when instead of revealing the answers to the mystery by making connections in our mind for ourselves, we're dealt a five minute scene of the villain saying, "Let me explain my dastardly plan that's been going on for the last 80 minutes, that you as an audience were completely unaware of, while you watched random scenes that still don't make any sense or have any connection to the plot, even after I've explained it."
It's one of those lines of dialogue that they always put into movies like Hellraiser 8 that are impossible to avoid sounding like they were written and re-written and rehearsed and re- rehearsed and then finally they just give up trying to make it sound natural after 30 or 40 takes and, exasperated, just drop the best bad take into the movie.
After years if deliberation about what it takes to make a good horror movie and what is missing in a bad one, after countless theories (the presence of teenagers or college-age kids being near the top of that list, by the way), I have finally discovered for certain the exact point at which a movie stops being scary and good and instantly becomes stupid and bad.
When someone in a horror movie does something that stupid, it is generally because the filmmakers need to have the character killed off but can't think of a really clever way to have it happen, so they just have the character do something monumentally stupid, but the problem is that this places the blame for their death on themselves, and in a horror movie, it's not only not scary when someone is attacked after doing something as idiotic as putting her hand through the crack in the floorboards because she thinks she sees her dead friend down there, it's satisfying, and not in the good way either.
and wife struggling to reach out to her husband after they elope -- is top notch and clearly deserving of an Oscar.
It does not give a good feeling after watching it.
Judgment is a low budget Christian film on the days after the Rapture and before the Second Coming as some Christians conceive them to be.
The human characters are two teams of scientific artifacts treasure hunters (sort of an aquatic version of Raiders of the Lost Ark), and they're both after the same artifact.
I feel a nasty lump in my heart after suffering through this film.
Rather mundane, unless Sylvia is topless; not much happens and the film never seems to have anywhere to go, except to the predictable ending - after all, the film is based on a true story.
The chief interests (the hazy, early-morning ambiance and cinematography, the quaint Winton Flyer which gets traded for a racehorse) nearly salvage the rest of the production, which was reportedly troubled after McQueen and director Rydell butted heads.
He realizes he doesn't "love" his bedmate; he doesn't need to meet for business on Christmas Eve 'cause it takes him and his executive assistant away from their families; he needs to spend quality time with his son (who shuttles between Mom and Dad after a divorce); he needs to be aware of his brother and dad; and he needs to make it better with his former wife.
I was intrigued by the fact that the girl has 2 boyfriends and they all live together, but I wish I would have moved on after I watched it for 5 minutes and it did not become interesting.
Her first artist name was "Lady MacLeod" after a supposed lord father, and it didn't disappear from the posters until 1912, when the real MacLeod (her former husband) sued her.
The scene where Yehia(Ahmed yehya) is angry and shouting at his mother Ginger(yousra) after finding out his real father is Egyptian (his looks aren't exactly American or Caucasian either) is just another example of cementing notions in the psyche of the audience.
It's a feast for the eyes (with nary a morsel of food for thought) as masterly cinematographer Gregg Toland captures the poetry of Young's huge, soulful peepers and full promising lips with one lovestruck close-up after another.
Its twist ending offers the only true moment of horror, after a long, obvious set-up.
As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion?
What's sad is that in some ways this comes off as some sort of after school special regarding the evils of tequila use or something.
In the meantime, Miles shows his true colors as the "repentant" thief by violently going after the guy who stiffed him out of a job $200 grand.
After the hot waitress gives him a date and even shows up at his place of work (junkyard), Miles is hooked and stalks her after she doesn't return his phone calls.
But wait, Frank must go back to his crappy hotel down in the city to "pick up a few things" leaving Dora alone in her dark hills home after they have done some horrible misdeed.
But the main reason I thought Insurrection was fun was because I kept my expectations low (repeat after me, this is not Star Wars) and I was open to sci-fi that has some thought behind it.
Why doesn't the holodeck simulate the collection after simulating the collection sequence?
Picard and a woman with a charisma by-pass talking about nothing for minute after nauseating minute  3.
1 out of 10 and such an utter disappointment after First Contact which was a fantastic film.
And then Ken Lay and Ellen and Portia De Rossi all live happy every after on Coney Island.
The characters and relationships most enjoyable in this movie were fleeting in nature; components remarkably and conspicuously absent after introduction for most of the film.
There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his ex-girlfriend, the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack, but only after her.
And, after a while, I didn't care.
Face it, you may have a sentiment towards this series, but ... A Polish tank team being friends with Russians, four years after Russians invaded Poland, that's weird... Something isn't right, and it's only one example.
From an ill-placed and beyond confusing opening in the Middle East, the film runs through scene after scene practically thrusting the viewer right in the middle of the action, and hoping they will completely understand the motivations of all of the characters, or even why we should even care about them in the first place.
Which after a while became quite boring, once you realize that's the only point to the movie.
The thing that bugs me the most is that Rodriguez's character was able to run home after literally murdering his best-friend in the face, make-out with Eva Longoria, and pretend like everything was going to end up fine.
I thought having the community discussion after the film was really important too because the film leaves you with a lot of hard questions and you want to talk about it.
I also found Daguerre's jester irritating after a while.
And Claire Trevor, so wonderful in "Dead End" and "Key Largo," is wasted here and one's heart goes out to the Oscar-winning actress for having to do such pot-boiling dreck as this a scant five years after winning that Oscar.
I can only assume the movie is so far rating at 7.3/10 after 30 votes is because every single member of the cast voted 10 for it.
The phantom-parenting of Dexter/DX and the fact he still cares for DX's mother is a conundrum in the view that Gene is married to a white woman (Who does not wash her hands after using the bathroom, nasty!
Then there's the red neck who gets ripped off by one of the call girls and goes after her at the head call girl's house and asks for his money back and they all seduce him instead.
You fly through a hanger and, after much confusion, leave.
This movie portrays a woman lusting not after the greater good, but after the celebrity that accompanied her work - irregardless of whether or not her family suffered consequences of her actions.
He lust after Sofia (Ulving), gets to have his way with her and then finds true love with another girl at the end.
This movie is kung fu crap.It's campy,corny,cheesy,and just appalling.Anyone who can enjoy the random,badly choreographed,slow paced,ridiculously amateur martial arts fight scenes is clearly off their rocker.The storyline screams bad and the plot barely progresses at all.The unbelievable cheesy storyline involves a martial arts student receiving a video game from his grampa in which he and his father get sucked into they then realize that in order to escape they need to beat all of the fighters in the game.Wasn't this on an episode of something like Kim Possible.Hard to believe but the film actually started out OK but after 15 minutes the film becomes a steaming pile of crap.The dialogue is like taking the dialogue from the Mortal Kombat Films,Power Rangers,3 Ninja's,and the English dubbed version of Japanese anime Naruto and creating a hybrid of them all.Don The Dragon Wilson sucks at acting just like the entire cast of this brutally corny film.Stay as far away as you possibly can from this direct to DVD piece of garbage rent something better instead don't waste your time.
But we're getting carried away now, as we all know this completely stupid and nonsensical plot is just a thin excuse for fight scene after fight scene.
Its a story thats mainly centered around the events that take place after a young boy is shot in the head, and the effort of one community member to create a support group against the deaths of young Black males in the city.
The story, which might have started as something worth telling, is ruined by appalling direction which jolts around unfathomably with characters acting out of character and for cheap laughs to the extent that after half an hour the amateurish crassness of the whole production isn't even funny any more.
After winning tickets to the premiere on local radio, I was looking forward to the event, but after reading up on the film's history was sceptical about the film.
I have to say, after watching A Winter Tale, I'm considering a career change.
Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film.
There is just one question (ok I am lying there are many questions, only one that matters) that pops into my mind after watching this: Why?
John is satisfied after this, but the devil (referred to as `M') wants John to go on with his killing spree.
Curse your Oscar grade acting and damn you for still being sexy after all these years!
Set in Toronto's Parkdale community, the story opens with a social worker named Gene (played by Peter Williams) and his attempts to "get the black men in his community to talk", after an innocent 12-year old takes a fatal bullet meant for a drug dealer.
Still, the film itself is a bit of a mess anyway: Dracula Snr., depicted as a Max Schreck lookalike, is killed by Jonesâ Baron Frankenstein â the villain of the piece, with evil dwarf Skip Martin for an assistant; Price, on his last legs, turns up as Van Helsing (the film, in fact, was clearly shot in 1972 but released after his death) and Leigh is his luscious secretary â who attracts Nilssonâs amorous attentionsâ¦so much so that he decides to renounce his vampiric ways (except that with it goes his claim to immortality!
He had his favorite aesthetics and he saw no shame in going over them film after film until he got it right.
Unfortunately, after about five or six times, this just seems like a lack of imagination and new ideas, which is exactly what sinks "El Retorno del Hombre-Lobo".
The only thing innovative is the complete absence of a secondary male hero to carry the heroine off after she slays Daninsky out of love.
Meanwhile in unrelated footage Richard Harrison runs around trying to look like he's part of the movie after a girl he picks up on the side of the road (after she flashes him her breasts) dies spewing orange ooze after a failed murder attempt during sex.
Nai Bonet's NOCTURNA with it's sleepy boogie scenes and breathtaking bathtub scene by it's star doesn't seem like such a bad movie after suffering through VAMPIRE HOOKERS again.
This absence (of dialogue) stood out for me for two scenes in particular: (i) after the shooting of the boy, one of the men returns to the eatery to tell the grandfather that his grandson is dead.
(ii) Gene (social worker) crying in bed after the shooting of the boy, his wife's long, white arm reaching out to touch his turned back.
I know this is a common complaint about sci-fi adaptations, and sometimes seen in artistic circles a churlish and unfair criticism - after all, these are "creative people", not "cold-fish scientists" (as the stereotypes go) - but this film is scarily Luddite to the point, as I said, of embarrassment.
She suffers silently with the shocking news of her adoption until one night, after an ugly (by her standards) meeting with her natural mother, she stays out late and when she comes home her father asks, "Do you know what your mother has been going through?"
However, one morning he picks up a stranger - or, more specifically, a criminal (Tom Arnold) who may or may not actually be such a bad guy after all.
As it is, one long car chase, punctuated by the kids thinking Arnold isn't such a bad guy after all while dad Paymer insists they "stop being nice to the criminal" (okay, I liked that part).
Then again, maybe the public has forgotten after four years.
The first time I watched this movie it made the life of what is emoral become heartfelt, but after a few other times the movie became mundane.
When both the director and the writer have their careers stalled for three years after a movie, it is a good indication that you will be viewing a truly staggering mess.
Even after "Scotty Farkus" had been burned hard by a casting agent he still believed that a shady guy from "back East" was going to fund their movie and were shocked when it turned out he was just snowing them.
Figuring this just had something to do with ratings--after all, how many straight men routinely watch shows about fashion?--I decided to see just what all the hub-bub was about.
If you're after a Nielsen comedy, don't bother.
For example, Marconi, often credited with the first radio transmissions, didn't accomplish it until several years after Tesla demonstrated a radio controlled model boat.
And it's after he's already demonstrated an AC generator and built a powerhouse at Niagra Falls!
What I got, however, was a rushed and complicated mess of scattered scene after scattered scene.
I mean, The creepy "Angels", the forgettable protagonist, the girl he's after and all that other stuff... aren't they beginning to get a little... erm... boring ?
The series should have pointed out that years after this dispute, the lift rates which the unions so flatly condemned as unsafe and impossible were being achieved by the very same workers who were fired once they had been reinstated.
Bastard Boys should have been about how the workers, the unions AND Patrick's did the wrong thing, and how after all this fuss it was worked out in the end.
DARWAZA BANDH RAKHO is Chakravarthi's 2nd directional film after the flop DURGA and a small story in DBR  The film is a comedy fitted in 1 house which is novel but sadly the film falters as it progresses  The film starts off well but several comedy scenes are dragged and too chaostic  Yet there are several interesting scenes but the romance could be done without The film gets engrossing in the second half where lot of game plans are revealed but the climax is a bad joke  Direction by Chakravarthi is decent Camera-work is good  Aftab Shivdasani is in good form and acts his part very well though he doesn't get much scope to display histrionics Isha Sherwani annoys at places otherwise she is good Chunky Pandey is relegated to the backseat, Manisha Koirala is okay Snehal Dabbi is adequate Zakir is superb in his role Ishrat Ali is the scene stealer, he excels in his comic act He mostly is seen as a loud politician in action films but here he is superb Smita Jaikar and others are good
Darwaza Bandh Rakho was touted as a comedy coming from RGV's factory after a string on action/scary movies.
Ruggero Deodato's Un Delitto poco comune aka Off Balance (1987) is an Italian thriller about a wealthy and happy pianist (Michael York) whose life turns upside down after the doctors find a very rare and lethal disease inside him.
But ultimately, after the first half or so the film loses its fire and becomes slower with plenty of talk and things that don't make too much sense, mostly involving the killer and his (absent) motives for his vicious acts.
The film tries to make the audience understand how important it is not to let your life pass by without living it, as there may come times in the future that you start regretting it as life after all would have offered something interesting and worth living.
It's what actually transpires after the prison break, so you need an imagination.
Dolph Lundgren stars as Jason Price a NSA agent who after losing a witness in his protection agency investigates the leak and finds out that there's more then what meets the eye in this mediocre thriller which is definitely a nice looking feature but the plot is just too hard to follow making this for Dolph Lundgren fans who will ignore the plot and just enjoy the action.
It is also inaccurate to call this show "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever", because after it was released at least a dozen more "awesomely bad songs" appeared on the radio.
I do think that there were some good comedies in the 1970's, though, and these include Dad's Army (although after James Beck's death these were considerably weaker, relying on slapstick from Clive Dunn and to a lesser extent Arthur Lowe) but of course, this was really a 2060's comedy; altogether a different era of quality.
As is the usual the initial snatch goes off like clockwork, but the plan after that just doesn't come off.
The doctors throw away Belial after removing him from Duane's side, but Duane picks his brother out of the trash bin and they go on a revenge murder spree, killing the doctors who separated them.
This is when you think it can't have been a True Story because it starts to get into the realms of fiction with plots and subplots based on the storyline of a woman lusting after her lawyer who tells her he's happily married.We find out later he DID once have an affair which nearly destroyed him.
It just seems as if the plot is being added to when the woman employs a hit man to bump the lawyers wife off after arranging to have his nightclub torched.It gets too silly I was glad when it finished the film overstayed its welcome by about an hour
Peter Coyote is a kind of smug defense lawyer who gets Lesley Ann Warren off after she murders her husband.
Alan Rickman commented that he didn't view Hans as "the villain", but more as a guy who "has made certain choices in life, wants certain things in life and goes after them."
I'm sorry I can't tell you about the rest of the film, I switched it off after that...   NOT because I was offended or repulsed, but because the big 'surprise' had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with what had gone before it.
For instance, at one point one of the characters talks directly to the camera (and of course, by extension, us); at another, one of the characters when the victims rise up (as one would naturally expect after they KILLED THEIR LITTLE BOY!!!)
John McTiernan has proven to be a solid action director over the years, after the breakthrough with Predator he made this classic action flick, that never seems to be getting old, even now.
Just after they arrive for an extended stay, a young man in a tennis outfit stops by.
The movie sucks one in by being unconventional, but the movie made a mistake in that it aimed to be unconventional without having a clear idea of what to do after convention was broken.
Already there lies pretentiousness in the idea of remaking your own movie only ten years after the original, with practically the only change being the language.
This is a movie that famed director Kiyoshi Kurosawa made by demand for a TV company, after the success of Ringu.
When I saw KÃ´rei I've already seen the very interesting KaÃ¯ro, also by Kiyoshi Kurosawa; after that positive impression had someone told me that Mr. Kurosawa was capable of clumsiness when dealing with a fantastic story I wouldn't lend him or her ears, but unfortunately that would be true.
I rented this movie and shut it off after the first twenty minutes only to return to find out if they ever cleaned up.
If you like fantasy or something like that, check out 'True Blood' on HBO, a fun, light-hearted show that leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction after each episode.
I really wasn't expecting much, but I suppose its possible that subconsciously I had my standards too high after watching the pilot for Studio 60.
This show does what I will call "reluctant killings" as they introduce character after character just for the "villain" to kill off so that they actually have a body count.
Patton II could have been a decent movie in the hands of a studio if it had been done shortly after the original.
Even though Patton was killed shortly after the end of WWII, it is hard not to notice that in The Last Days of Patton, G.C.
Think about it for a moment, just days or weeks after the end of what happened in the movie Patton ended, the general was critically injured in a freak auto accident.
This movie is based on a book by the same name that was a blatant character assassination on Patton rushed out after the popularity of the original movie "Patton" threatened to resurrect Patton as an actual American folk-hero.
One of the best action thrillers ever made, Die Hard still rocks like a thunderstorm nearly twenty years after it was first released; often copied and arguably never, ever equalled, this film introduced the set-up of the lone cop/soldier/tough guy against a team of terrorists who have taken over a secured area.
Years after that horrible night Curt Duncan, the crazed caller, is back out on the streets after a lengthy stint in an insane asylum.
He ends up in a bar where he meets Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst) and promptly receives a heck of a beating after attempts to ingratiate himself with Tracy brings on the wrath of a beefy bystander.
Apparently, the actor who played Duncan, Tony Beckley, died shortly after making the movie.
After his shoes break in the last game of the year, he quits after the game even though the team made the playoffs?
Not to talk about the camera work (probably a first time operator, at least I hope so), although the "day for night" they invented for this movie is shockingly interesting (I understood this only after the first half of the movie and when I mentioned it to the others watching the movie I could see that no one had understood the purpose of this strange color effects before).
Maybe he shouldn't commit felony after felony and maybe he shouldn't POINT A GUN AT THE POLICE!!
I've seen over a dozen wuxia films, but the only ones that are worth watching were released after the new millennium: House of Flying Daggers (2004), Hero (2002), and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000).
Family reunions around the big table, presents for everybody and the kids playing all night long after Santa Claus' visit.
McClane is first depicted as a mildly-reclusive, word-avid cop, but he quickly becomes wild after the terrorists' takeover.
Some people gave it a chance, then fled after seeing how worthless it was.
The ending was like a slap in the face after a punch in the stomach.
Last time I ever walked out of movie disgusted and ashamed of being an American was after watching "Freddy Got Fingered", but at least that movie was trying to be a bottom of the barrel movie.
I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over.
I saw its episodes dubbed in Bulgarian so I can not tell anything about the acting but I really hated D'Onofrio after I saw his character.
A sequel was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter and grandchildren.
Pray for Morning is a dull supernatural teen horror slasher that doesn't satisfy on any level really, never mind pray for morning I would suggest that most audiences will be praying for it to finish not too long after it has started.
It must be so easy to maintain an indoor pool, after so many years the water is clear and the pool is still full to boot, I have a hard enough time keeping mine clean on a weekly basis!!
Then along comes the Mighty Giant (Ollie) from the bogs, looking for anybody's wife, and after seeing the new law, he says he get any amount of women he wants.
The father can't throw it, so the Giant comes along and does instead, but ends up throwing him over the cliff as well, but after tumbling, it seems it worked.
Die hard 2 was OK but not as good as the original, I wish they would have stopped after 2.
The worst acting ever, actors contradict their parliaments time after time.
I watched this on TV a couple of months of ago and then recently after the trial was over, I watched it again because a friend of mine had a tape of it.
Typical idiot writers portray it as though it's the hysterical women (Laci's two friends) who think Scott is guilty and the cops who are after Scott.
Two guards are walking out of the lab after a frostbite experiment.
Oh, and this is after he watches the same thing being done 3 times in a row before this with no expression at all on his face.
I thought after having seen the movie.
The male equivalents focus on equally infeasible breasts, after all.
A few minutes after getting settled, twelve gun-toting Eastern Europeans take the entire 30th floor hostage.
Nothing was too wrong or inaccurate, after all, there are as many incarnations of witchcraft practices as there are shades of green.
Ryder is found unconscious, after being thrown from horseback, by a boarding school student (Haas) who takes her to his room (yeah, right), instead of the obvious choice, the hospital.
Now after more than 25 years, the waiting is over.
My hubby was one of the few guys in the Jordan High School Drama club that was chosen to act in this movie, they weren't even going to pay these kids until one of them found out and left after the filming had already started and they had to refilm all the stuff he had been in.
Then any movie you see after that won't be too bad.
This somehow is to explain why he keeps harassing the main characters in this movie, despite the fact that he defraud them and disproved their false claim, he STILL went after them.
Maybe Fellini had had a great satisfaction in this tribute since the theme was his childhood obsession; however I found it extremely painful to hear and watch after thirty minutes.
fight after fight leading up to big boss man) and lo and behold something happens to distract the main character from the tournament (just like DBZ or G Gundam or Naruto chunnin exam arc).
Andrew Stevens is not a dislikable actor, he's actually pretty competent - but that Tanya Roberts proves again (after "Inner Sanctum") that she's remarkably untalented.
A very small company, Night Eyes Security, composed of two Griffith brothers, is tasked with guarding the Beverly Hills estate of a British pop musician, Brian Walker, and his wife Nikki (Tanya Roberts) but after she discovers her husband making the grade with a young woman during a party in their home, Mrs. Walker files for divorce, following which Mr. Walker hires Night Eyes to supposedly protect his soon-to-be former wife at their Malibu residence, although his true purpose is to obtain damning video tapes from surveillance cameras that he hopes will record Nikki's own sexual misconduct, thereby crystallizing his courtroom defense for their looming civil trial.
LONELY HEARTS: a piano tuner hits the dating scene after his mother dies.
So, this is important as a preserved record of their culture, but honestly, to me it became awfully dull and ponderous after a while.
the acting was truly awful and the script sounded like a teenager had written it after watching a few old movies.
A basic understanding would mean knowing the name of the ship he's associated with the most (Queen Anne's Revenge, which was a French ship he captured and renamed), he's associated with the then English colony of North Carolina among other places, that the governor of the colony of Virginia sent Maynard after him because the governor of NC was to friendly with him.
In that they could have used practically any pirate to be alive at any point after Kidd's death.
For that matter they could have set it at just about any time after his death, even today.
This film is complete and utter garbage, I found myself watching it after seeing an above average review on a horror forum.
So if you enjoy MST3K, frequent the IMDb's Bottom 100, and love to make fun of Norris, Segal, Van Damme, and Stallone than this movie is worth a look on a Sunday night, possibly after a few too many beers.
You'll be checking your watch after ten minutes, thinking an hour has passed, wondering if your time would be better spent doing something else.
the plot in the movie spins around a serial killer going after three girls in a house.
I actually feel a little bad reviewing this because I feel I'm only advertising it somewhat...like a lot of people curiosity got the better of me after reading the reviews...I have to say though it's a work of genius from the director to film a LOW low budget film and then come on here and deny he knew what the final cut of the film looked like...that had me on the floor...what great directing that is...
It was nice to see Satana up there on the big screen again after all these years (but then again, I wasn't around for the first time, so why not just rent another classic Satana flick and leave this one behind?).
Let's be specific: The opening sequence wasn't that bad - very evocative scenes in the dessert, camels, Bedouin, a group of Eastern European women, a campfire, lots of Russian and Arabic chit chat - OK, "expectations build": Next scene (after the first obligatory rape scene): auction of the Eastern European women as prostitutes: very noisy, not sure who the English-speaking (French-accented) person was - a buyer or a seller: couldn't make that out.
Next scene: in a nightclub (after the "hosing down" of the prostitutes - a highly contrived scene, calculated to make us think of Holocaust victims in the showers - come on Amos, what are you really trying to say?
Sutekichi is essentially responsible for the deaths of their parents, but his ulterior motive is re-entering the life of Rin(RyÃ´)who was once his lover and partner in the slums, with them separated after their thievery leads to possible trouble for the troupe when a man comes seeking revenge for what they did to his family after stealing jewels.
Masahiro Motoki Â whose other starring roles include Miike's exceptional The Bird People of China as well as a tryptich of Rampo adaptations named after the author Â plays the doctor and his evil twin.
I'm not a hater of Pauly Shore by any means, he can be a very funny guy and I rather liked Biodome which came after this film.
How can one man continually create such irritatingly grating roles one after another and still be allowed to make more movies ?
Yukio is also recently married to a young woman he met by the riverside and who is suffering from amnesia.Soon a dark figure is lurking about and after Yukio's father dies under mysterious and unnatural circumstances things begin to take a turn for the worse.
The otherwise luckless Mr. Busey had once enjoyed the pleasure of Ms. Tilly's company, after a street encounter.
The picture revolved around a metalhead-type loser (Jake Busey) whose dream of being with a porn star (Jennifer Tilly) leads him on a strange road trip after he is dismissed by his girlfriend (Natasha Lyonne).
Watson did not look like he had retired because of health after a long hitch in India.

Well, after being jerked around through most of the film by Winfield and Waite, Mr. T becomes a tad perturbed and goes on a killing spree that is basically brainless entertainment.
I do get a kick out of the comments left for these films by IMDBers who take these genre films seriously and are shocked after watching them.
The burlesque sequence offered a lot more tease than the actual dance show, with a lesbian pursuing a hot conquest and a dirty old man type getting worked up enough to attack the first young lady he sees after the show.
I'm hesitating to call LEATHERFACE TCM 3 the worst TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies because I watched TCM 4 after this one.
Made in 1990, over 15 years after TCM, this is just another case of poor, unnecessary sequels hoping for a quick buck and destroying the good name of the original film.
I would have thought that the Texas Rangers would have completely investigated the Sawyer family and discovered any relative who may have taken in Leatherface after the events of the first two movies.
And I'll be damned if it doesn't even get better after that.
Best way to cool off after some ecstatic dancing!
This film must have been a great after midnight third feature in the drive-ins when folks could look at the Guna men and Wongo women if they needed a little extra inspiration for the night's fun.
In fact the film actually has a piece of music thats straight out of the soundtrack of the film "Plan Nine from Outer Space" that was released a year after, in 1959, in it.
They all live happily ever after with Mother Nature as usual correcting herself from the mistake she made when she at first created the incompatible, to each other, men and women of Wongo and Goona.
The story of the Ark was gibberish to begin with but after so many transformations its just ludicrous.
Five practical lessons for self-defense are explained by a narrator after we see mild-mannered "George" brutally attacked in an alley.
Linda Blair has undergone quite an amazing transformation since the first "Exorcist", but this inconsequential, goofy, utterly predictable comedy is easily forgotten a few hours after it's over, because it has no plot and no weight whatsoever.
I expected a mindless and moderately funny comedy, kind of perfect after a hard days work.
Gets pretty dull after the, erm, 20th time?
I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started.
I should have learned after to Date Movie that these were the two worst writers from Scary Movie, but I didn't.
I'm not entirely entitled posting here because I turned it of after about half an hour.
I absolutely will not be attending another movie from these guys until after the first few weekends.
I'm not sure if my expectations are set too high after watching "HOT FUZZ" (which is amazing by the way) but it didn't make me laugh.
Not a single joke works, and the only surprise of this movie is that these two hacks keep getting funding to produce flop after flop.
I had to leave after 30 minutes.
In other words, after seeing this you can't help but try and remove the stain it left on your very soul by vomiting out the experience onto others.
This was one of Scott's last leading roles after a career of over a decade and it's actually a shame he didn't get to do more of these, improving on the formula.
The scientist was kidnapped at the opening of the film by several accountants in a huge car, set to a bouncy tune that gets on your nerves after about the first five minutes of endless repetition.
Morever, its soundtrack is maybe the best part in this silly film, it is heard after and during the cheesy fights.
Now, I admit that I could tell that this was supposed to be the story of a movie fan named Jerry Harvey who was involved with the first pay movie channel, but that was about it--and I think I should have known more after half an hour!
Only James Woods (whose Salvador performance was highlighted during Oscar season) and Paul Verhooeven (who claims he got his Robocop job after a Z channel marathon of his films) show a career boost from Jerry.
It seems that Sonny's childhood friend is going to be attending what is evidently a very coveted military academy, and after briefly celebrating, Sonny becomes sad, knowing that his own parents can't afford to send him to the same school, and that the news means that he'll be losing his best friend.
Just person after person pontificating about absolute nonsense.
Unless you are interested in twenty-somethings spouting nonsense which they consider profound, you will probably be bored after 10 minutes.
The point is well-taken after only a few of these interactions and new digressions.
There are continuity problems galore too--notice how Goddard and his goons look pretty clean after being pelted with tons of fruit.
Jump forward to the present & now the teenage Angelina (Paydin LaPachin) & her mute brother Norbert (Rocky Marquette) decide to head back to Las Vegas after going from foster home to foster home with Dummy to find the fame & fortune as a ventriloquist act their late poor mother never did.
Over the next few decades it would develop a small cult following and after seeing it for myself I can see why.
"Triloquist" centers around a sister and brother who are taken in by their abusive uncle after the death of their mother, a famous veltriloquist.
It seemed to me that the filmmakers filmed the movie after the series ended and just used poor actors posing as fans.
The worst were the uncomfortable moments when Joe Don whooped it up after knocking innocent, unassuming competitors into walls, off of cliffs, or out of focus (each ending in explosion and emphatic death).
The plane is hijacked quite early in the film and even after the passengers decide that they must act they spent another half hour making calls, you can't help but think that if they had organised themselves earlier that they might have had more success retaking the plane.
If this was a fictional story, then Stephen Segal would kick everyones ass and all would end happily ever after!
The current definition of heroism now encapsulates twenty guys rushing one teenager with a box-cutter and a fake bomb, and after discovering the bomb to be fake, still beating the teenager to death Â heroically, of course Â with no trial.
It was proved shortly after 9/11 that flight 93 landed and was evacuated to a NASA base and the supposed crash site had no debris from a commercial jet, no bodies, even the coroner was quoted as saying, "I stopped being coroner after 20 minutes.
They only called to tell her about her husband's call after a full working week had elapsed --- Monday morning to Friday night.
I got the sense that one of the goals of this film was to exculpate the federal government for its complacency, which after all is almost as much to blame for 9/11 as the hijackers.
About ninety percent of the movie plays out like an after school special, focusing on the troubled life of the aggressive pretty boy, Dwight (Brad Pitt).
But later, possibly after another day has passed, he manages to get up and walk all the way home and then scold his daughter for not being in class.
Of all the ridiculous scenes that this film has in it the most inane has to be where the one (and only) black actor throws in the towel and becomes a Hare Krishna to forget disco music and roller skating after learning that the roller boogie contest is going to be canceled!
"Cutting Class" is easily one of the most awful slasher flicks from the late 80's.Brian returns back to college aged 18 after spending five years in a mental asylum for killing his father.He tries to worm his way back into the lives of his ex-best friend Dwight and Paula his old flame.And suddenly a bunch of people start dying,in the most bizarre and stupid ways in slasher film history.There is for example death by pottery kiln,death by photocopier,but my favourite is the old classic,flagpole under a trampoline so the fascist Gym teacher gets impaled on the American Flag.
Roddy McDowall has an amusing minor role as the high school principal, Mr. Dante, who lusts after Paula..who could blame him for that?
Right after Brian is released, the D.A.
You got the beautiful couple that survives the killer's attacks and manage to defeat him after following some hints.
As Brian returns to the schoolyard after a period in a mental asylum to treat his Violent Schizophrenia Syndrome, bodies start piling up as well and naturally he becomes the prime suspect.
Brian Woods, a quiet loner who has just been released from a mental hospital after being there for the mysterious death of his father.
Killing it is a funky 80s soundtrack that you don't want to purchase after hearing it.
The MASSIVE plot holes should have sank it after episode 2.
Sad that this show was renewed, and Firefly died after 13 episodes.. shame on CBS for not keeping to there guns after canceling, and shame on FOX for pulling the trigger too soon...
And after episode 7 I gave up.
These are the only things that came into my mind after watching the first series...but don't get me wrong i loved the story and the whole concept of the post-nuclear atmosphere.
The idea of exploring what would happen in small-town America after nuclear weapons seemed to have devastated the major cities seems brilliant in its simplicity.
After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans descended into a kind of hell only 24 hours after the storm...looters, gunfire, rapes, a REAL struggle for survival.
The concept of life after the big one is an interesting premise, but perhaps there has never been a show about a serious subject on the laughable scale as this embarrassment.
As for characters, I do not see a male character I like enough to want to be...And though there are some attractive females none of them seem very desirable after a short while.
The main character who mysteriously returns to "Jericho" after an unexplained five year absence is so heroic that in the first episode he saves an entire school bus load of children, including making a makeshift respirator for one of them with some straws and a pen knife!
For the trivia-consumers: IMDb informs that Eva Dahlbeck has recently filed for divorce, after, ahem, 67 years of marriage.
Great idea for a TV show and first and 2nd episodes were watchable, but after that it turned into the worst sci-fi soap opera.
This show develops too slowly, and why are all the girls still so pretty with their hair done so nice with their make up and collagen lips and plastic hips after a nuclear holocaust?
Spoofing everything from musicals (Darktown after Dark) to prison films (3 Chairs for Lefty) to public service announcements (Buddy Hackett on bed wetting) to biker films (Skateboarders from Hell) to Charlie Chaplin films (The Kid and the Yid) and a few things in between this is a very hit or miss film.
And, there is absolutely no comedy in the film at all, just one depressing scene after another.
Just picked up the DVD after years of growing up to the movie.
Seems the devil worshippers in Rural Backwoods USA have a tough time of it when they are beset by Tom Skerritt and Eddie Albert, who vow to destroy them after Satan-izing innocent people they hold dear - who happen to include William Shatner and Ida Lupino....
Bad like morning breath after a night of eating garlic.
(if you wat to see a much better melting scene go to the ene of "Raider of the Lost Ark", that's melting).Then they made it much worse at the ending scene.They just kept on showing us scene after scene of all of the bad guys melting.On and on,and on ad infinitum.Two minutes or so would have been plenty.Oh yeah, and only the bad guys were melting.
Naturally, I wasn't pleased and after drying it out, I hoped it would still work.
Here's the premise of the film: years after Eddie, the tempestuous and dumb (can he spell Rimbaud?)
I just picked up the soundtrack CD last Saturday, and after more than twenty years the classic Fifties-style songs with the unique Beaver Brown sound still hold up.
One after the other.
The 'evil' guy in the film isn't such an bad egg after all, he is an honourable Japanese Yakuza warrior who only kills the target he is assigned to.
A personal observation: when I first looked this up after watching it, I could not believe my eyes when I found out it was made in 2001.
Plot of this somewhat engaging loincloth romp: girl beats boy, boy beats girl, enlightenment, happy ever after.
After a long-time employee weeps uncontrollably after losing his job, Callew unsympathetically condemns his lack of self-control.
Three months after the incident, he attempts suicide and is revived just before fully ascending into the "white light".
Abe realises though that after saving the people he did, days later they commit an act that kills many others, so he knows that Sherry must die also, but in the end, he ends up dying himself and saves her as a spirit.
Bottom line, don't watch this movie unless you're trying to ruin your night/date/relationship with your in laws etc , because after seeing it you'll feel like you wasted your life, and the people watching it with you will wonder if you're on crack.
Finally, after spending a terrifying night alone in the morgue covered over with a white sheet, the coroner notices something that immediately tells him Cotten is very much alive.
The drunk waiter routine is likewise very filled with tedium after the 10th visit to this situation.
The movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them.
For the remainder of the movie Ranger Jake, who put himself in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers!
All they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires.
Sure, it's an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all you're after.
- because I really wanted to like this after everything I've heard, my love of French cinema, and the fact that John Turturro is one of the best actors out there.
An assassin who phones his analyst after killing someone and who quotes Homer as he cleans his bloodied knife after garroting an Italian agent.
I remember after viewing this movie when I was a kid I always wondered where I would run if the Shrews came running after me.
Eventually, the daughter and scientist start to tell the captain about what is going on, but not after the first mate becomes the shrews' dinner.
The basic plot has a white ninja battling a dark ninja group because the bad ninjas want to take the land where they think their secret wealth was hidden after it was stolen many years earlier (this doesn't take into account the fact the bad ninjas kill the good ninja's wife because she can't tell them where he is).
Unfortunately,after twenty minutes the laughter begins to wane because the movie is just so bad it over whelms any unintentional humor.
Dr. Allen is ambushed in the streets right after his friend is killed, he has the secret potion blown in his face, and stumbles on the streets whispering "don't bury me, I'm not dead", truely creepy.
The anticipation builds every second after that because of what the director has shown us what happens to those who have been given the potion, and we fear for Dr. Allen.
It is so sad (I mean as in pathetic) - death loses its sting after an episode of this, and it is so awfully predictable and unfunny that you feel insulted.
It just pretty much got worst after those season!!!
They made a movie five years after the show was released.
I remember thinking Spongebob was the most stupid thing in the world when it first came out, but after my friend convinced me to watch one episode I found out that it actually was a decent show.
Each episode was fresh and new, while still keeping it's old charm; but after a certain point things turned for the worse.
Somehow I thought the letter kid had forgotten to add the T after BUS thus making it a rude duo.
Stop me if you've already heard this one before: Six extremely annoying and unappealing college kids -- sassy blonde Rachel (Catherine Wreford), obnoxious, insensitive, and spineless musclehead Mark (a supremely terrible and insufferable performance by Alan Ritchson), sexy libidinous lesbians Atlanta (cute blonde Ashley Hawkins) and Liz (foxy brunette Tiffany Kristensen, who at least bares her breasts prior to getting bumped off first), bumbling nice guy Adam (decently played by Tom Nagel), and token black Sophie (Myiea Coy) -- on a cross country road trip run afoul of a vicious family of deadly and demented hicks after they get a flat tire in the middle of some nowheresville sticks.
And then, after she splits in half and all the characters are on the run from the big, bad killer, the guy in the Stifler role ends up in the killer's barn looking in his fridge for a tall, cool one!
6.why were these supposed young people so winded after running a few feet.
But what was the deal after having grabbed the sheriff's keys and running right passed a perfectly good escape vehicle?
I give it a three because, well it's a horror movie after all, invite some friends over and watch it with pop corns in a boring Saturday afternoon.
Indian men are ready to wash dishes and be a waiter, drive cabs, sweep the Airport premises to keep it clean Âall this just to be in a foreign land as they get paid in dollars - which when converted to Indian currency makes him a rich and sought after groom in India.
Now dear Indian they must have also got marriedÂ.what does one do after marriage Â but of course !
Âits night there Â its only here (with me) that's broad daylight) Heart broken she joins as a nurse to a multi billionaire who is Akshaya's (hero's) actual father actually Â had humped his mother and later had settled down in foreign and was living happily ever after with wife and child.
Twitch after twitch after twitch.
She then writes him that it's all off, after a cozy little female smoldering with Jill.
My girlfriend asked me after the film - Did the characters actually change their dresses throughout the movie?
Too many ludicrous things happen that made me ask questions while it is happening, not after it's all done when you would get the Hitchcock "refrigerator moment".
There was tons of controversy over it which immediately disappeared after the series aired (people saw how boring and pointless it was).
Anyway, after the Judge of Hell's bizarre uttering, we switch towards a remote countryside setting.
A sophisticated exchange then takes place after he accidentally places himself up her anus, then loses his erection.
I was so angry when I watched this movie that I threw it in the trash after I broke it in a million pieces and cut the tape to shreds.
When they get to after they meet the eagles I though they had skipped a part of the movie.
How anyone survived the water for over 10 minutes no one knows, but it is true that at least 6 person's were pulled alive and stayed alive, after this time though originally 150 were pulled out still alive but died and were buried at sea by the rescue ship Carparthia.
The main note of a person surviving the water was Bakker Charles Jorgen (1888-1977) who was kept alive for more than 2 1/2 hours in the water before being pulled onto Second Officer Charles Lighttoller's overturned Collapsable B lifeboat after 1st Wireless Operator John Jack Phillips froze to death on the boat minutes before Boat No.
Russian spy's on-board the Titanic after it is raised, MIA.
Lovely stuff, but after taking forever to set the scene the raising itself is made to look about as tricky as lifting a toy submarine from the shallow end of a swimming pool.
The Byzanium ISN'T on the Titanic, after all.
Later, Alec Guiness gets to put the old flag on the cruise ship after it is raised.
Well let me go say this because i love history and I know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and Julia Stiles became my #1 favorite actress after seeing her in "The '60s" and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history!!!
Now, Mr. Houseman's performance is fine Â after all, he was a stodgy and imperious professor at Julliard for twenty years before this so playing a stodgy and imperious professor at Harvard was hardly a stretch (as Neal Gabler jocularly hinted at during his opening remarks) Â and he has a lot of snappy, quotable lines of dialogue.
The film gets off to a shaky start, I initially thought that I had sat down in front of an adult movie, after about twenty or so minutes the film picked up pace and with some very good editing it became very good and dare I say engrossing, the most striking observation at this point is that there is little if no dialogue and each scene is cut to bare minimum in length.
If this had been the first film by the Quirozes I believe it would have been a good attempt, however, after more than ten films apiece the product is very poor.
And if Larry Cohen is thinking of doing a sequel to ISLAND OF THE ALIVE showing what happened to the mutant youngsters after they`ve grown up he should come to the Isle Of Bute .
The next chapter, doesn't start where the last one finished, it starts some time after, giving us a little mystery on what happened.
This movie explains why the writer hasn't done anything after writing it.
You knew that president of course was going to live and that everyone else lived happily ever after.
Well after telling him that she rubs her lip just after touching the level four virus.
For dealing with a level 4 hot agent the doctor was not very intelligent seeing as she touched her mouth with a gloved hand after handling the dart that contained the virus.
No movie would be complete without the terrorist falling off of the roof after being hit with a portable tunnel, the bomb being turned off with two seconds to spare, and a bit of romance.
No sir this is the president of the United States after all , he`d rather dissolve than give in .
Isn't it nice to have a friend who convinces you to call up a prostitute with whom you fall in love after you spent the "wild" night together?
And after you've been robbed, car chased and after your dad's car ends up in a lake, there is still a good chance everything will be fine, with no serious consequences!
Yeah, I realize Risky Business is trying to be over-the-top, but watching a really boring Tom Cruise character crumble into moral decay after a long sequence of idiotic events doesn't do much for me.
He went through a type of religious conversion after traveling through Europe in 1784, not spontaneously as a result of study.
His opposition to the slave trade did not come from a childhood friendship with John Newton but after meeting James Ramsay in 1783.
He consulted Newton later in life after his activism.
He did not become completely committed to the cause until 1786 after some urging by the abolitionist society known as the Testonites.
I actually turned the movie right off after about 20 minutes...and I've never done that with ANY other movie.
Lommel's explanation, I guess, is after the girl has killed the guy she puts the heart, liver and something more on a grill and walks around, her "father" has dialog... he died from *some* disease and has written her letters.
We get a whole new segment of story driven by the financial travails of only two of the previous five characters, who can't face being poor after having had the whole city to glean from and decide to freeze everybody again so that they can rob them.
In other words, this movie has a moral after all.
As to grooming, the family of the former apparently spent more time applying cologne (even to the kids) after showering, than the latter group might be spending on an entire week's total grooming.
Like Trading Spouses, the families are completely different, but the problem is that instead of simply having the wife living with a new family the show tries to start a fight by getting each wife to read some sort of manual about the other family and then after a while to set rules.
I guess that Randolph Scott likes girls after all.
It is no surprise that her career gravitated back to France after this.
While Porter purists will retch over this film (which was probably what his reaction was after seeing it, especially the added songs), it does offer up a period glimpse of Hollywood choreography from the mid-50s, along with the previously mentioned duet.
There's some history with the commander of the current mission, and despite the fact that he should be focusing on the crew's survival, all he can think about is getting back together after her divorce is final.
I imagine the creatures would be queued in right after the couple promises to survive for one another and hang on no matter what even though they fought non-stop for the first 100 minutes of the movie just like Bud and Lindsay.
But I feel it is my right to bitch after watching it, so here we go.
Repeat after me: They do not go for the story.
This piece of tripe is not a CHICK FLICK, nor is it a kids film, it's a horror movie, that resides in your brain and destroys it after watching it.
What I saw was a totally empty theater (zero people) just two weeks after the movie's release.
However, after I saw this- I felt violated.
Rainer255 shot himself after 5 minutes of viewing Bratz.
Indeed, after hearing the mangled arrangement of her trying to sing "I Get a Kick Out of You," I actually stopped the movie and played a Frank Sinatra version in order to get the bad taste out of my ears.
It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.
I can't even think of an adequate adjective to describe it... No wonder there are countries that want to see our way of life crumble... after seeing this movie, I almost agree with them.
I actually lost the ability to breathe after about 40 minutes of this film...
Two Came Back is a nifty little movie about some young adults who find themselves at the mercy of the ocean and sun as they float on a life raft after their ship goes down.
You're gonna be red as a lobster, there's going to be white residue around your lips... the fact that the movie depicted the young adults as merely whimpering for water after days and days of no shade or drink is highly unrealistic, and even still they would've been in worse mental states and other bad physical conditions.
Yes, Churchill did spend working time in the bath but after the third bath scene I was beginning to think I was seeing out-takes for a new production of Marat.
The friction between Eliza and the rest of the girls seems to disappear quickly into the movie for no reason, and after that, the whole team is pretty uniformly uninteresting.
The Toros are champion cheerleaders, but soon after being named captain, Torrance discovers that their team has actually been stealing cheers from a poor, inner-city school.
The plot: A 5 time national champion cheerleading squad has to redeem itself after it is discovered that their award winning routine has been stolen from a much more talented inner city cheerleading squad.
The young characters are so absorbed in cheerleading that you wonder how they plan to make a living after they graduate from high school: they barely acknowledge the fact that they have classes to go to.
My friends and I sat stoney faced as one liner after failed one liner dropped limply from the 'clever and witty script'.
At one point, after asking her if there's not a specimen that she would like preserved, he urges her to remember her most painful memory.
It's a film that you definitely have to think about, and you'll appreciate it more after repeated viewings.
During the Q&A after the film, Rick Morris asked a Temple University Grad Student if she was great at Final Cut Pro, that was the only time I laughed during the film!
Unfortunately, during THE most unconvincing lightening storm in cinema history, the robots go crazy and begin killing off teens that sneaked in after hours to party.
The overly familiar "Friday The 13TH"-type premise (with an extra Sci-Fi note thrown in) is better executed here, but the movie still amounts to a complete waste of time after it's over.
The movie opens with this sales film detailing how these new robots will patrol the mall after it has closed and harpoon any burglars.
Then there's a live demonstration in front of an audience, with real tension that the robot is going to malfunction and blow the guy away right on stage, a la the opening scene of RobocopÂ and now I see that Robocop came out a year after this one.
The movie basically revolves around a group of eight teenagers who are hanging out in a high tech security mall after closing time.
I left the cinema very happy and with a feeling of a still lingering fear and intense joy that perhaps could come close to what you feel, still running but just having escaped unharmed after three hours of torture by a sadistic lunatic.
When it eventually does (after what seems like an eternity), you only see the first 5 seconds of the sexual encounter then you fade out to the aftermath.
I just wonder what made the actors choose to be in the film after reading the script " two sentences.
For an after school movie might have been nice, but the synopsis, and other comments supporting this movie on Netflix were misleading.
Yes, well what can be said...a seemingly normal woman (Laura) goes completely insane after giving birth to her first child, a girl, if that matters.
The film follows Iris (Olga Kurylenko), who moves to a port town after cutting off the tip of her ring finger in an industrial accident.
I had to seek medical attention after watching this movie.
A young woman has her first baby after moving from the city to a large home with her husband.
Thirty years after Roots, it's time for white and black viewers alike to forget this tripe and read a few history books.
They do office work...except they don't retire after 30 years...for some of them it goes on for several decades.
Sadly, after making so many great films to this point, Stone was forced to rebuild his career after creating this crummy film.
Expect to experience almost immediate regret (less than one minute after the credits end).
So overall very gay, I was honestly hoping that after the gay beginning it would start to redeem itself, and it did... but then it came back with heaps of gay that just plain ruined it.
Instead, sophomoric humor and one bloody situation after another seems to string us all along to the end credits.
The movie is so busy and cluttered I have no idea what the story really was about even after two viewings, and that might be telling.
It passes the time well enough and fans of late 80s/early 90's teen horror will be well served, but after wards the one thing you will probably want more than anything are a couple of aspirins and a nice quiet well-lit room to sit in for a few minutes so you can catch your breath.
You'd think after Margaret Thatcher this wouldn't be such a shocking premise.
I can imagine the store's clerk broke into riotous laughter after he unloaded this bomb.
And what about his dragging a shark onto his motor boat after having previously pursued it on foot?!
.PT Cruisers, than after they throw there prey to the ground, they simultaneously, and inexplicably turn there backs and look at a wall for no reason.
Makes you want to go after the Nazi's yourself.
Unfortunately it fails miserably and my girlfriend stopped watching it after about 5 minutes.
14) Did the lab geek take Kendo and firearms lessons after organic chemistry and before theoretical mathematics?
** spoilers follow **  I found it difficult to imagine that after the death of his fiance, Joe, would continue to live with his fiance's parents.
But, what a shock, the parents of the murdered girl seem to like Joe much better after he weakend the case, it was almost like, they really appreciated seeing the case weakend, not very realistic.
I had to bail after about 30 minutes, this thing is a terrible assault on ones sensibilities.
This film doesn't rival the top offenders in this category, thank God -- the worst being "American Buffalo" (which made me run screaming from the theater after about fifteen minutes) and "Wonder Boys," both of which achieved a false, theatrical quality strictly because of this annoying tendency.
For me, this movie was something of a one trick pony, very tiresome after the first few minutes.
Such goings on could not have occurred in this film had it come out a year later--after the toughened Production Code was enacted.
Woodbine spends most of his time running around saying the 'F' word as many times as he can while Paul just looks bored, standing around with too much powder on his face and a glazed expression on his face, delivering every line with a dead-pan approach, it gets very tiresome after awhile.
I have already lost some respect for the Academy after giving Russel Crowe the Best Leading Actor for Gladiator, but if anyone from this movie wins even a nomination, then the whole organization is full of it.
Still, at least after being bludgeoned around the head with this one note message for the best part of 3 hours, I had stopped noticing that the acting consists of just reading lines and not tripping over the furniture.
I am someone born over a decade after the war ended, in a European country not really touched by the ravaging of the Jews.
There are a couple of nice ladies to look at but beyond that it's all pretty far fetched stuff that manages to be somewhat entertaining but wears thin after a while.
  I used to be a hugh fan of the original Harry Enfield show on english television, but after seeing the apalling excuse for a movie of "Kevin and Perry" last night, I'm definitely having second thoughts.
The erection jokes weren't funny the second time, and got decidedly boring after the 20th attempt.
Acting is below substandard, humor is absent in every scene and the script should have been burned after the first reading, after the scriptwriters had been shot that is.
== Spoilers == Tanner (George Hamilton) and Lansing (Suzanne Pleshette, who's about as much like a professor as last month's centerfold) are at the lab after hours.
Or why Melnicker's erstwhile dancing partner gets up after everyone has passed out, puts on the record and starts to strip.
Part of the plot called for Reagan to be shot after a prison break by the big boss.
It was at fairly close range, but it turns out Ron was only wounded and after being dumped into a lake with the getaway car, he swims away and the next minute you see him without a scratch.
Not too long after this came out, I decided that movies were getting too expensive (and my time too valuable) to waste on crap like this, and I became a little more discriminating about what I paid to see.
Van Damme made a couple of terrible movies after the success with "Bloodsport", and this one is without doubt one of them.
Damme's character is after the bad guy who killed his family and the film follows his quest to capture and vengeance the ugly baddie and his thugs.
As an avid fan of JCVD, I was devastated after watching this film.
It broke my trust in Van Damme as an actor (only to be renewed after watching Bloodsport-immediately after).
Well Van Damme's acting is robotic, but he still gets to kick butt in human form as he goes after a cyborg woman carrying vital information that could cure the plague that affects civilization in the 21st century.
Story: Gibson(Jean Claude Van Damme) is out for revenge after a gang of punks lead by Fender(Vincent Klyn)killed his family.
He ends up having to look after a cyborg that holds a cure for a disease that has wiped out half of the world.
It happens often, so you'll probably be toasted after one full episode.
Blow-darting monkeys...fish swimming up natives rectums...getting worse...and the cherry on top: a vomit inducing 'happy ending' whereby all characters seem to find some form of happiness after parading around the jungle like a prize set of ignorant s**ts!
Thats the part I meant was pinnacle of stupidity, however straight after that you discover its the protagonist with a wig, that caught me off, perhaps i was laughing too hard to notice?
I switched off the player after 15 minutes of uncontained stupidity of characterization, plot, and amateurish film-making.
The entire plot is one clichÃ© after another.
And, after all, remember that it is on the SciFi Channel, not the Discovery Channel or the Science Channel.
It's not often I can't be bothered to finish a film after starting to watch it but with this film is happened.
This is some counsel: Boris says Zoe's husband must be gay because if he wasn't he would want to have sex with her every day (this is after 10 years of marriage).
Agent Novack tells captain to keep it quiet after finding the body but he acts just opposite, running like crazy all the time and screaming at people.
I decided to see this after reading a review stating that "it was a great movie".
Or even he died in the ring after he beat him, and had millions cheer him on or mourn him as he went.
it was ,however, extremely disappointing because after all those years of grueling training montages and hard work, Rocko loses all of his money because of Paulie's ridiculous gambling habits.
On their way back home a drunk Peter, after being a jerk, gets left behind & is murdered.
Sean was allegedly a great writer just like his dad, but decided to give it up after his dad gave told him that he lacked talent.
Why would anyone want to make more after seeing the pilot?
When they aren't fighting killer robots they fight themselves, but at least the writers showed nicely how people crack in a confined space after a disaster.
The writers deserved none of the pay for what they scribbled for a script after the writers strike.
I enjoy because I think that most of us who started watching televised science fiction (When there were really only three channels, when the creatures were usually enlarged garden denizens, large bug-like sculptures, or just some guy wearing something that looked like one of your auntie's failed quilting projects, and when any sci-fi tended to be broadcast long after our parents had been safely tucked into bed and Johnny Carson had signed off.)
The "Oh Gosh, they're really just like us, after all!"
It shows when Adama and Apollo --his son-- embrace after Apollo has been out on a dangerous mission.
From the very beginning there were lots of things that didn't add up, but we let them pass, such as full-election process in a refugee fleet, including public debates and such, as if anyone of the 48.000 survivors could care about politicians after their worlds, friends and family had just been killed.
I thought it was the worst kind of movie junk, the kind that leaves you feeling soiled and unfulfilled after the final scene.
"12 angry men" was really a disappointment for a guy like me who waited for 1 hour to watch a story in the film...but after an hour i have realized that how wrong i was to download such a film..i was so much desperate to watch dis flick and in the end it disappointed very much.
11 were in the favor of GUILTY for the kid, while one was saying the kid on whom the blame was to kill his father was NOT GUILTY and after more than 1 hour of distracting and boring discussion the alone juror who feels the kid was not guilty was successful in changing the mind of other 11 jurors and in the end saved the life of the kid.
Soon after discovering this, the group is introduced to Mario Montenegro--who lives in a Western-style home on this completely primitive island!
Less than a minute after some bad guys appear out of nowhere to ambush Emmett, Mal pops out of nowhere to ambush them.
A few seconds after we see Jake riding out after some villains, he's in a bar getting into a fight over a girl.
As another reviewer has already said, there is nothing wrong with remaking series, but in this instance it wasn't needed so soon after the Joan Hickson performance, generally regarded as the definitive.
Mia Farrow is a very frail, timid woman who moves to a very large, built to be haunted house after her daughter dies and, surprise, it turns out to be haunted by a young blond girl who (gasp) looks just like her daughter!!
The story is rather derivative of many other films and focuses on a woman who has moved to London after losing her child.
Well, after sitting through the indescibably awful first two hours, I needed to see how this mess ended.
We saw this movie for free as a promo video, and after watching it we all vowed to never speak its name again.
I watched this movie yesterday and after it was over I couldn't believe I wasted any of my time watching it!
I know getting acting gigs after teen idol stardom is tough but Jesus Christ what was he thinking?
I really can't say much about the rest of this show, but after the 5 minutes I saw of it I can't bring my self to ever watch anymore.
Even after Bibleman demolishes these embodiments, he is just as human as everyone else, and would succumb to the same evils.
He went back to the Veggie Tales, & The Pond, after only 15 minutes of watching BIBLEMAN.
One false move after another renders what could have been a passable thriller into being little more than a violent soap opera.
Knowing that thugs are after him, Tom still walks to work alone along miles of desolate country roads.
There isn't even a film if you remove the violence; it is one contrived and phony situation after another, all made to build to an act of gore.
In summary, from the moment Viggo's family crowded around the little girl because she had a nightmare and all were there to console her (in Cronenberg's hackneyed attempt to show Tom Stall's initially perfect existence) to the end when Tom/Joey/Michael Myers comes home to find his family tensely sitting at the dinner table and little girl Sarah pulls out a plate to show daddy Tom/Joey/Jason X is still part of the family, the movie was a complete package of one terribly directed clichÃ© after another.
In one particular scene, the wife of Tom Stalls, after finding out he was actually a gangster in a previous life, tries to push him away.
That women really harbour after bad boys???
People were re-acting their favourite poor scenes in the lobby after as a homage to the level of crap it reached!
i didn't realise this was a Cronenberg movie until after it had finished.
in fact, i didn't know much about the movie at all, but after some good recommendations from friends i was quite looking forward to it.
Linnea Quigley is in it, after all and that helps.
The plot is a predictable yawner about a gay guy after a straight guy.
I'll simply ask viewers to compare it to the delicious twist at the end of "Condor" in which Redford is given fatherly advice by his own would-be assassin after the killer was instead ordered to murder the man who wanted Redford dead.
I was about to walk out the theater after hearing that.
Penn, now expecting her to finally come clean after about 2-3 previous meetings like these (where he uncovers another one of her lies), and the best thing that Kidman could say isÂ..get thisÂÂ'that's not me'.
Only after more pressing from Penn does she admit that the woman in the picture (her) isn't the type of person she is now.
- Who was the assassin who was after Kidman working for?
The day after you watch it, you won't remember any of it.
There is a sequel, not so sure I'll give it a chance based on the huge flaw of this script that is specifically due to one character..a character that could be had by anyone after enough liquor on a Saturday night.
First the good: Scott Lunsford is great as Caleb, the straight college student who lusts after Gwen.
Before and after the film, when the director spoke, he seemed like a nice guy, and was certainly very cute--so, I wish him well in the future, but this is really bad first feature.
I got this movie yesterday, after read several comments of this movie being really bad.
No much to see of Caleb(Scott Lunsford)questioning his sexuality, or even face the fact that he might as well being a bit confuse after all.
However we could see that in fact Caleb feels a bit for him after the party they got together and the scene in the video store where Caleb confessed to Marc 'You are just awesome in the piano"....Certainly this is something that if I was directing the movie I would like to explore more.
The main premise is simple: after a hunkish straight guy (who shares an apartment with a gay roommate) is suddenly dumped by his kinky and sexually insatiable girlfriend, he turns his interest toward another girl who happens to share an apartment with a gay (male) roommate.
To make things "complicated," the straight boy's gay roommate is lusting after the girl's gay roommate.
As for the rather abrupt ending, I find it a bit of a stretch that the geeky self-hating boy would, after one horrible dinner in which he basically pouted the whole time, land the ferociously hot, model-esquire party boy Marc, who apparently instantly forgets all about his major crush on Caleb and acts as though he's been pining away for Kyle all this time.
I'm not sure I understand the shirtless makeout scene between Kyle and Marc after the credits roll, either.
However, not content as a spectator, Wimpish Man soon joins in the action and after shooting his bolt, starts to cry for reasons known only to Franco.
Cyclone's plot features a group of people stranded at sea after a cyclone rolls through leaving them with little water or food.
The second half begins after El Topo is shot dead.
Lots of moments stolen from other "High School movies" but no clarity and the movie is completely ridiculous and unrealistic; moments like Charlie (and shortly after the whole school) going completely ape on what was supposedly a LOW dosage of ritalin were very frustrating.
First of all, high school is not like this at all -- this is the Hollywood stereotype high school that we have all become so familiar with over the years in movie after movie, most recently with "17 Again".
Another sequence features Charlie visiting psychiatrist after psychiatrist to obtain prescription drugs.
I rented this horrible B movie last night before checking out people's comments first.I will never make that mistake again.I couldn't even get a credit for another DVD after asking for a one at the video store because it's just their stupid policy not too because it's a renter beware thing or something.I thought the opening scene was a bit funny but knew from there it was no horror and could not get into it because it dragged on and was boring as hell.It was filmed in the same cheap same format as a daytime soap opera.I trusted the stupid cover art when it said nothing but good things about this movie.Even Fangoria gave it praise.I'm not sure I wanna read Fangoria anymore after being mislead.I don't understand how it could win anything.The idiot who made this film has no taste and it never should have even found distribution.
Although I do come on this site a lot to check things out I never ever registered for an account, but after watching this movie I made an account just so that I could post this comment.
Anyone seeing even a few minutes of this lousy excuse for a horror flick will quickly note the BLATANT theft of plot device after plot device from "Jacob's Ladder," right down to the head-swiveling demons -- although this low-budget turkey obviously didn't have money for special effects, so the demons just shake their head from side to side accompanied by sound effects that resemble someone shaking a tin of peanuts.
There was supposed to be a Q&A session with the director and one of the actors after the screening, but everyone who'd watched fled the theater as quickly as possible ... because nobody cared what those involved with such a TERRIBLE film would have to say about it.
It is not easy to find a right way after diving too deep.
but after watching it I just have to know... who the hell are these poor poor mislead souls that are giving this movie such high praise!?
although i've used IMDb as a resource for years i've never felt the need to chime in as a reviewer or post on the message boards, in this case i felt absolutely compelled to, especially after reading the false glowing reviews posted by others...which is just as fraudulent as this movie winning any recognition, a DVD distribution deal...any of that.
i felt completely ripped off and i felt like a sucker after trying to watch this garbage.
i haven't been so angry after trying to watch a movie ever.
This film doesn't even have the common decency to try and titillate the audience after forcing us through the 100 minutes of torture.
I couldn't watch it and actually got physically ill after Lisa Lampernelli's "performance."
I'd always heard (don't know if it's true or not) that Dylan himself did not want EAT THE DOCUMENT released, and after finally getting to suffer through the entire thing, it's not hard for me to understand why.
Eat the Document would make a good, but probably unwatchable, triple feature with Neil Young's Journey Through the Past and The Stones' Cocksucker Blues, a sixties triptych painted on broken windowpanes after a night of very bad drugs.
Here, barely three minutes after Wall-E is introduced, he's dreary little headcase pining for love, which is a limp idea dramatically for a kids film, and forces half the problems that ensue.
Even younger audiences may become bored after 1/2 hour although the visual stimulation may be sufficient.
Spoiler follows: The ideas of planet ruin via garbage and humans becoming fat, technologically catered to, isolated in space, and thus unmotivated beings after 700 years is interesting but each of these is not original and I, at this time, cannot clearly describe why the film failed to engage me.
My town is a small one and we can only have the chance to see the big Hollywood productions.I had to wait for months to see this movie and I found it at Blockbusters yesterday.The cast is a dream cast for me I always liked Peter Mullan after My name is Joe.Milla Jovovich is an actress which I really find passionate.When the film was over I could not believe how bad it was.Meaningless details,bad picture quality and unbelievably bad story.
James Marsden (X-Men, Sugar and Spice) is a high school student who is forced to transfer to a new school in a small town after living the big city life in Chicago.
Shortly after arrival, he learns of a community plot to surgically brain wash all the teens into perfection.
The kids are pretty useless- ignorant, petulant, spoiled and unappreciative they elicit no sympathy whatsoever, especially after the turning point of the movie.
The chief problem is the disjointed and unconvincing plotting, but Michael Brandon's insipid performance as the passive unlikeable and uninterestingly passive musician being blackmailed after accidentally killing someone shows up just how rickety this one is without a charismatic or proactive figure to hold it together.
The cast includes Robert Forster (who probably wishes this dud wasn't on his resume after his success in "Jackie Brown") & Bo Hopkins, who both phone in their pointless cameo roles.
The only good part was after the credits when they show an out-take of an actor actually being injured, but you have to sit through a poem that sounds like it was written by a third grader.
Sam's coffin is delivered to Jody's home three years after the fact where Sam's widow and his sister-in-law plan to hold funeral services.
Or it could have been something to do with a rivalry that started after many death threats between the two stars.
After watching Seraphim Falls with Pierce Bronson, a hardboiled western set after the civil war, you can tell the difference in the quality of direction and writing, and it was just so much more fast paced.
The remaining 90 or so minutes that ensues is devoted to events before and after the war, and there is a hint that perhaps the protagonist didn't survive this trial by bloodshed.
While I didn't care for this movie, I appreciate it a lot more after having a conversation with Mr. Adams.
In most of the episodes the over-the-top Stoat has his mind blanked after discovering the Martians.
)It seems as though this show was scraped together after Invader Zim was released and when Jimmy Neutron was in production back in 2001.
And they lived happily ever after.
As for weaknesses, the story lags a bit in the middle, but it can be forgotten after watching an exciting climax featuring Flynn shooting it out on a burning train.
And that's not a surprise, after seeing this bad film.
A year or so after George C Scott was spooked by a cadaverous child in 'The Changeling', Devere decides to try and keep up with her ex-husband's career by inheriting an Old Dark House from her deceased aunt.
Whilst it is fair enough comment to make that no-one (probably rightly so) took Devere seriously again after her split with Scott, she at least here proves herself a capable enough genre screamer for the undemanding.
long after the joke has been made.
A woman suffers mental trauma twenty years after being raped - at least that's the most obtainable synopsis for this bizarre but entirely unengaging drama.
When a man claiming to be her son - stolen from her arms at birth after the rape - appears out of nowhere, knowing an awful lot about her, it releases the trauma she has kept hidden for so long.
Their after a town called Acheron which apparently everyone died in.
In Dodge City the legendary duet of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland is reunited once again under direction of Michael Curtiz after Captain Blood, The Charge of the Light Brigade and legendary Adventures of Robin Hood.
Originally budgeted at $20,000 ( I was told ), I refused the project repeatedly but finally agreed to lens the film ( my last favor for anyone, ever ) after meeting the cast and hearing the filmmakers detailed cinematic vision.
Of confounding interest to other filmmakers may be the fact that EVIL CITY sold to distribution with almost no effort a few short weeks after availability of screeners; DVD's hit the chain store shelves in the U.S. so fast that a star of the film found out when hewent in to rent a movie and saw his name on a film box he didn't recognize ( the working title of EVIL'S CITY was THE LAZARUS SPORE, and then CROSSING ACHERON by wrap of photography ).
But after the war, it's amazing that Hollywood czars like Darryl F. Zanuck would denude their movies of their Technicolor --- often using Technicolor previews as if to slap the faces of ticket buyers.
I don't hardly EVER *EVER* turn off a movie, but this one definitely went off after about 30 - 40 min.
This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark."
This isn't a criticism Â after all genres are built on clichÃ©s, and there's no shame in that.
If you're casting Errol Flynn in his first western after audiences have accepted him as Robin Hood and Captain Blood, you're not going to make something like Stagecoach.
Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand.
The acting isn't all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's Chevy Chase comedy.
are spectacular and beautiful to look at...the couple's relationship gets to be a drag to watch...one, no nuttier than they other...if he cared about her he would've come up with a shrink or something...i felt, after awhile, the thing was too contrived...i heard one reviewer say Betty Blue is great and Million Dollar Baby was lousy and i wished i hadn't read that dude because he told the ending...at least this is a spoiler...i think Betty Blue is OK but Million Dollar Baby light years more enjoyable and moves along telling lots more in the time alloted...this is a pretty film, a slow film, well acted and put together...the story is contrived too much...a different, but same, Cuckoos Nest...it's a comedy at times cutting itself up i think...some of the characters , at times , 'over acted'...i enjoyed it though.
Flynn is the cowboy finally willing to clean up the town after the death of a boy.
Before and after that scene, everything else is just flat.
In "Dodge City", we find ourselves in Kansas, 1866, right after the Civil War has ended.
This puts a damper on the relationship between Wade and Abbie but after she takes a job as newspaper writer and spends more time with Wade, the two fall in love.
If you want to see this produced correctly rent the original that is finally available after 20 years of petty arguing between the writers and PBS or read the book.  
Unfortunately, so much has been stripped that there is no tissue left to connect him to what little plot remains after the producers and directors finished their hatchet job on content and context.
I read it after I saw the first "Lathe of Heaven" on PBS in 1980 and realized that considerable liberties had been taken with the story, although it was much closer to the book than this latest endeavor.
Though everyone laughed, the joke was on Ernest Polk when Andrew slammed into Morgan City after taking out south Florida.
If you lived in a trailer before the hurricane, you lived in a shelter after it (residents from Patterson to Amelia, at least).
But judgig that, after the fests, it only lasted a weekend in already limited release, the gimmick does not work on audiences.
The people see Hatton as brave and honest, and want him to accept office as their new Sheriff; he is at first reluctant to do so, but eventually accepts the challenge after a young child is killed in a brawl.
I just registered for IMDb today right after I saw this nonsense so others won't be led astray like me.
I'm glad that Drew Barrymore didn't seemed bothered by it, maybe she was relieved as she might have felt this guy wasn't a potential danger to her after meeting him.
This film   But after 50 min we just stopped watching in order not to lose our good mood.
When Flynn and his two buddies return to the town after a long absence, they are shocked to see that cattle tycoon Cabot has practically turned the town into his own private hellhole.
Flynn gets a telegram after he cleans up Dodge City begging him to now do the same for Virginia City and he and Olivia and his friends all announce their intentions to head there.
i watched this film after Christmas and did'not expect it to be a masterpiece like Lord of the rings.
i admit the fist 15 minutes of the film where quite good but after that i struggled to keep watching it.
This movie is a prime example of people being too messed up from the 1960s after taking too much LSD.
It's importance is that after this film Ms. de Haviland began to let it be known she was very unhappy with the roles the studio was giving her.
It is so bad, so mind numbingly boring and dull that I found myself losing large blocks of memory and suffering gaps in time as I drifted in and out of semi consciousness as it dragged by minute after stupor inducing minute.
When they do finally meet after a long 55 minutes or so, they fall in love in a matter of 5 minutes.
Eventually, after the males finally make it to their destination and meet the females, Carl and Melissa soon fall in love.
However, Carl and Jimmy's friendship gets awkward after Jimmy accidentally has sex with Melissa one night in the dark while she is asleep and he feels something soft!
Ten years after "Dodge City," cowboy hats came to resemble ordinary fedoras with smaller brims, sometimes twisted upward in odd ways, like a vaudeville comic's.
The penguin footage had so little to do with what the comics were saying most of the time that it just got stupid after a while.
Although it wasn't meant to be taken seriously (it is, after all, a comedy) the laughs are few and far between, and most definitely NOT original.
Unfortunately this was made on the downhill slope that Candy's career became, after 'Planes, Trains & Automobiles'.
But poor Harry may just goof his way to the truth after all.
Answer: so bad that it makes you want to turn it off after only the first 5 minutes.
To describe the list of people who took part in these two series as "Z" list is not accurate;if any person one day finds a new letter (or letters) to come after "Z",then that will be clearly apt.Currently,there are 26 letters in the English alphabet;if we ever get to the 1,000th,then you'll have reached that trough as far as this programme is concerned.
ITV are genuinely insulting the viewers intelligence by actually allowing this piece of meaningless drivel to be broadcast.What person decided this waste of time to be deemed fit for public consumption?Surely after the rock bottom ratings for the first series it would have acted as a dose of cold,hard reality to ITV and make them execute this monstrosity but alas it was unleashed on the poor public again.
One long shot after the other.
It looks like you should start being scared about what's going on, but you aren't... and after that plane scene the overlong style is still killing this movie more and more, slowly until its end.
It starts quite well, but after the murder case which leads Frady into his investigations, in other words: after 15 or 20 minutes, the movie is getting bumptious.
There are dozens of more informative conspiracy movies...after having seen this one you just ask yourself: What have I been told by this movie?
Instead of simply reviewing the plot, which you can read on this page already, here's a PARTIAL list of glaring implausibilities and ridiculous plot occurrences that I worked up over drinks after the movie.
3) The boy's militant father (in one of innumerable flashbacks) makes his son shoot his own dog after it gets hit by a car and breaks a leg, because he won't take it to the vet.
the delivery also gets real annoying after awhile.
It was probably funny when they first met on the set after all that time.
Back then Crenna had more of a name, after all he was Trautman.
Everyone's skeletal structure is 100% cartilage or something... after years of watching anime, despite the quality of the animation, it's actually embarrassing to watch.
However, after months of bliss, the crew must return to the ship, and depart for England, a placard promising death to those who may seek to desert.
I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).
Without her I would have shut it down after fifteen minutes.
If Pukowski were a real man, after revealing the truth about Katyn, he would probably commit suicide.
On the way home after seeing this, I figured out why it wasn't so funny: It had too many regular actors doing semi-improvisational roles.
You could tell in one looong scene in particular where he was with the bald(er) guy with a beard--a highlight he was--where he was given set-up after set-up but came up blank.
At a Q&A after the movie (at the Tribeca Film Festival), the director made a point of immediately stating that the poker was real.
I saw it after reading all this reviews at IMDb.
I'm guessing Pakleppa got brought in after writer Odendal botched the job; it appears to have been edited by a lumberjack with the spins.
Actually copyright 1989, which is important: not just because this is exactly the kind of film that sits around for four years before it gets released, but because it means that this South African production was completed before, not after, Mandela got out of prison.
Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones.
Therapy may be needed after viewing.
Scene after scene begins with an exterior shot of `NASA'.
The producers must've expected a big demand for Nukie merchandise, because every time the word appears it has the little `TM' after it.
The movie crushes Barney's foolishness 30 seconds in, stomps Teletubbies in minutes, and after that, it's home free in the race for cerebral vacuum creation.
I understand they want to make money but after watching this movie I want 2 things back.
Why would Fenrir and Bellatrix waste their time chasing 15 year olds around a fen and setting a house on fire (after luring all the inhabitants out of course.
The 5-minute "Attack of the Psycho Tree" (aka Whomping Willow Workout) scene they put into the third film seemed rather random too, after all.
There is no words strong enough to express my disappointment after seeing the sixth Harry Potter movie!
I have never had too much interest in Daniel Radcliffe after Goblet of Fire, but he's never been a bad actor.
It is an investigation show after all.
Since they felt it necessary to not shoot the funeral I guess they felt it would be fine to end with our three heroes together instead of Harry walking off after breaking up with Ginny.
Glen Morgan and James Wong came up with a great teleplay here - after a darkly humorous teaser, where we discover that the seemingly priggish, uptight-about-swear-words members of a PTC in New Hampshire are in fact a bunch of Satan-worshippers, the story begins as a worthy entry in the bad-things-happening-to-teenagers-in-the-woods genre which was especially popular in the first two seasons of the show.
It was the first time I have seen an audience actually fall asleep during a Harry Potter movie and after the ending, only two people clapped.
There were a lot of very disappointed people after the movie ended.
Consider me highly disappointed in that this is by far the weakest film of the series, and that's saying something after the extremely dull Order of the Phoenix.
And can someone please tell me how they are going to explain Dobby and Kreacher in the Deathly Hallows movies when they have essentially been omitted from the subsequent movies after being introduced?
(One suspects Caffaro demanded that the producers not allow any naked women less attractive than her after being horrible upstaged by the delicious Jennifer Brooks in her last outing The Abductors.
Seeing this movie after many since it hit the screens, I can only say that I am glad I did not pay to go and see it in the cinema - caught it on a free DVD recently!
Thirty some years after its release, it is now clear that The Eagle Has Landed was a plucked raptor when it fell out of Sturgis' respectable aerie into 1970s theaters.
He was probably remembering what had happened three years earlier to his Captain Clark character in "The Eagle Has Landed" -- defeated by hoakum even as he assumes command after Larry Hagman (doing a Yank version of a Pythonesque/John Cleese kind of military idiot) gets a slug in the head by a tea and bisquit matron.
This is such a creepy episode for me even years after having seen it the first time, which is rare for me as most of the episodes I used to be creeped out by are now pretty mild.
First you got the kid being grabbed by the FBI after trying to escape through the window then the girl screaming her head off during pig dissections and then suicide and a python and the teacher disappearing.
That's the impression you get after viewing this self-important bundle of cliches that is as tired as it is arrogant.
Above that a year after initial filming when I knew a little more about acting they called me back to shoot two pick up scenes (easy to spot as my hair was much shorter--it went from '79 to '80 nuff said).
There's some white guy who thinks these women should die - kind of like that real life case that we just learned about of the guy who killed prostitutes after he had sex with them.
Towards the end, you find that the overall story was after all quite weak.
The problem with "Sometimes They Come Back...for More" is that it falls downhill terribly after a cool beginning, typical for quality B-movie standards.
"Sometimes They Come Back...for More" is a fairly routine and forgettable horror film that offers literally nothing new.The first half is actually interesting,but after it the film goes quickly downhill.Two military officers(played by Clayton Rohner and Chase Masterson)set out to investigate a remote Antarctica based governmental outpost where a mysterious occurrence has killed crew members.The only survivors are a medical officer(Faith Ford)and a tech officer(Max Perlich).Before long,the bodies are discovered all over the place.
This whole thing probably started as a bad joke among friends in a sinister bar and after having too much to drink already?
Perhaps this movie is simply hopelessly dated, but after awhile, I just wanted it to be over so I could crawl up to bed at 1:30 AM.
After great recent films like "Uzak-Distant" and "Hajar," it seemed like the Turkish industry had completely divorced itself from its infamous past and Cuneyt Arkin's films were ones in which people could only watch after a six-pack of Efes Pilsens.
Apart from the fact that the 'shock' of the fight wears off after a while, having a battle scene that takes up 75% of the film's run-time leaves no room for character development - and hence you could not give a monkeys who lives or who dies.
I, too, was a fan of the radio and TV series (via recordings--I'm was born after the movie was made).
In fact, everything after the apartment is not only unfunny; it's actually downright boring.
A James Bond who stares questioningly at himself in the mirror after killing a bad guy, in a "what am I turning into" kinda way?!
Bond kills a terrorist after chasing him.
Then there's the so-called character development and horrid romantic sub-plot that feel like they were tacked right after shooting began.
On the bright side, maybe you can sneak into "Up" after suffering through this bland, over-hyped vehicle.
If I wasn't with a bunch of other friends at the theater, I would have walked out after the first ten minutes and got my refund before it was too late.
It's easy to see when a comedian becomes so full of himself in a movie after a history of exceptionally funny ones.
It wasn't exciting, the jokes were groan-worthy (although after a while I even gave up groaning), the plot was.. well there didn't seem to be one, being more a selection of scenes thrown together with no reason behind them.
Mark (Chad Allen) has issues with drug and alcohol addiction and was sent to Genesis House after a suicide attempt.

I couldn't wait til this movie would finally be released and when I got it for my birthday I couldn't wait to go home and watch it, but after seeing i felt like i wasted my aunt's money.
While not exactly gripping or engaging, this is an entertaining little film to be viewed after midnight on any sleepless weeknight.
While this makes for funny TV (sometimes) after 2 or 3 episodes it becomes completely expected by the viewer.
Maybe I should have read the manga after all, because after reading other reviews I think a lot of blame for this poor film goes to the director and screen writer of the film.
One has to wonder if working with such a poor director is what finally made Dolph decide to step behind the camera (his directorial debut was the film made right after this).
OK I was devastated after I had watched this movie.
The world is still rotten after this movie.
Right after that, there comes more comical moments: our little rodent friend Jerry is in the picnic basket, throws a tomato and a banana peel and eats salami from a few sandwiches.
It's the equivalent of dangling food in front of a starving dog only to pull it away after only letting them lick it.
In a short introduction by a festival host, i learned that the film was shot on all digital film in just 8 days immediately after filming The Grudge.
There are some very funny painful tricks played on Tom, but they do get a little tiresome after a while.
Beautifully shot, atmospheric in places and all that, but artistically inert after the first twenty minutes and no more enjoyable than countless films that cover similar ground with much more panache and cinematic touch.
This "Debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am speechless" I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work.
At one point, Bon Jovi goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow (and has done so on other occasions), he says "I am not trying to hurt you.
One thing after another goes wrong, but Tom, to his credit, remains upbeat.
Many times I questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark.
He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left...  ...avoid this movie.
His 14 year old daughter Angela acts like a snob, but she just happens to be hiding her real feelings after losing her mother and her little brother Nicky is just your average annoying little brother.

I had a hard time staying interested after the first 30-45 minutes.

"The I Inside" is an excellent psychological thriller which will linger with you days after you see it.
Simon saw "Mr. Travati" walking down the passageway of the hospital, hooked to an IV bottle, when he was brought after the car accident.
But I had a different feeling towards him after watching this movie.
and ryan phillippe did a great job - i somehow didn't like him to much after cruel intentions, then in way of the gun he was pretty cool but now I'm a real fan of him!
The Hour is too egocentric and what bothers me is that the CBC wastes valuable money and time on a show that at best belongs after midnight with all the late night time filler shows.
It's got some nice acting to begin with but unless you're a little slow you'll see what's coming after 10 minutes and after that it kinda feels like an insult to the viewer's intelligence.
The story is ludicrous: it centers around two ex-roommates/friends who meet again after six years.
I don't like giving overly negative reviews, but to tell you the truth, after seeing this, I think I will pass over anything with Ken Girotti's name on it.
The plot is halfway decent, but don't even try to fit it into the DBZ timeline...apparently this is after Frieza, but Goku can't go Super Saiya-jin.
I'm so glad that the voices and the type of drawing changed after this movie, I'm not sure if I could have taken another one after this sad little movie.
I am a huge fan of Dragonball, love that stuff, but after watching "The Tree Of Might" Pioneer's Dubbed version I found that it wasn't anything special at all, I mean don't get me wrong there were a lot of good fight scenes here and there, but yet again, the ending was SOOO predictable!
I actually thought they were making an arthouse movie like PI down to the use of B&W photography at the start of the film but the makers seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD .
The boy doesn't realize that the warehouse is stuffed with illegal alcohol and after the police get a tip, they raid the place and jail the boy.
But he didn't enjoy much of a screen career after that and, on the basis of this, I can only assume it's because he's really not a very good actor.
When Simon(Ryan Phillippe:Cruel intentions,Gosford Park) awakens in the hospital after a near death experience, amnesia has erased the past two years of his memory.
Dudikoff refuses to let his wife go as he takes off after her.
I remember one time reading a remark from Robert Mitchum who was discussing how he came to play a certain part after several of the leading men of his generation turned it down.
Anyway he's after her and not particularly concerned about how he gets her back.
Since Alex has written, for therapeutic reasons, a not-for-publication autobiography, her supervisor, after learning of the opus, determines that she must be eliminated, and during her flight from homicidal pursuers, she unites with a discredited demolition expert, Will Rickman (Scott Glenn), who is fighting a lawsuit originating from two accidental deaths within his most recently demolished building and the pair exchange sexual bouquets when not avoiding being killed.
They discarded the whole premise of the story after the first 15 minutes, the tape if you're wondering.
If Samara was that powerful, why did she wait so long to come after Rachel & Aiden?
Like Keith and Elliot wouldn't know each other's political orientation after a year together?
It concerns loosely a tracker going into the wilderness after the "missing link" to earn 100,00 dollars.
The acting is nonexistent; the lead reads his lines in scene after scene, including a trek thru the forest, from a clipboard he holds.
Oh, and there's some other fine upstanding campers in the area, and the girl, after a fine show of cellulite, dresses up in a red frilly skirt and shorty top, yecch....and I think she's also got on patent leather shoes and white knee-socks.
You can also find Piper Perabo in "The I Inside" but I doubt you'll be interested after all I've said.
I've read some posts, I didn't have time to read them all, and I did have some questions, but after writing them down, I've made my thoughts on how this story makes sense.
If this were the intended interpretation, theoretically, what the spirit chooses becomes the choice made by the ego, and this only being realized by the spirit after manifesting the ego in all possibilities.
Amanda Blake had contracted AIDS and she later died from the disease 2 years after this film.
Robot Wrecks should have been a great Our Gang entry--- the basic idea of building kid's robot slave in the days soon after the World of Tomorrow sounds pretty cool.
People came from apes and we scratched some bones against some rocks and after a few years viola--Chevrolet Suburban!
The music sounds like a theme to some crappy kids TV show and just makes you want to bury your fist through the TV speakers after hearing it for the 1000th time.
I gave up counting after the 6th repeat.
Simon Cable is a reach guy who wakes up in a hospital after being poisoned by his wife.
Somehow he travels back in time to the next day he last remembered, and finds himself in the same hospital after being involved in a car accident ( this he learns in course of the events).
I could only finish this after twenty separate attempts.
Lets just say after I watched the first three minutes it was already off.
I can summarize this simply, with the event that transpired after the film completed.
At one point in the movie he felt he was lost in a never ending confusing void and the one doctor who was also his father was telling him he died.The spooky thing about the ending is that it gets you thinking about what lays ahead after our own death.
It's as if, after years of these young men and women being scolded not to overact and "be natural", that now they do nothing at all, besides "mood act", which is an instant cure for insomnia.
Wheras Pixar create original characters, stories, settings and music, Dreamworks repetitiously offend by piling on clichÃ© after clichÃ©.
I guess that the car looks better after they are done, but that isn't saying much.
Overall, they might as well just show some before and after shots of the car for a few minutes and open up some time slots.
I would much rather just look at the car after it is done and not waste a half an hour of my time.
It's about a guy who, after being a successful mountain climber, came home and in a daze killed his wife and children, then hung himself.
So, what better way to celebrate Halloween years later than to have a internet-camera view of every room during one night when a bunch of teens have sex in nearly every room for paying customers on0line to see (after, you know, conjuring the dead back to life in a wedgie-board set-up)?
We have seen this theme before, and even after this film (The Butterfly Effect), but that does not give any reason why Cooney should not take his stab at it.
You'd think that after the whopping that WINTER MEETING took from the critics, Bette would refuse to work with stage director Bretaigne Windust again.
Impossible to believe that someone put up money for the Tv series after seeing this, yet surely this is the first time that a TV show is better than the film that inspired it.
I really wanted to give it a positive rate as I really like Jackie Chen, but unfortunately, after watching it I can't, if being objective..
I wanted to turn it off after about 30 minutes, but I was a glutton for punishment.
She gets scolded for this, but it's no skin of her back, as she's got bigger fish to try: She's gonna move in with some Hasidic Jews after she suspects someone close in the murder of one of their own (in a corpse reveal scene so hilariously obvious I think my 8-year-old niece could have found it).
(I guess Chasidic corpses don't start to smell after a couple of days like the rest of us.)
They show up a few days after Emily goes undercover and try to force a protection racket on the store.
Emily's cover is blown after the very public chase, and the case is supposedly closed.
I mean I can't believe that the Swedish language/accent hasn't change since 1150-2007Â The lines was empty and when the accents was so poor, this equaled in very low performance, and I sometimes felt that I was watching Swedish Big BrotherÂ I think this is because Swedish actors has not yet understood that acting is with whole body, eye moves, body-language, etc, not just standing there like a jukebox and saying your lines one after other.
The significant thing is that he was in the same hospital in 2000, after the (rather unintentional) murder on his brother, and the car crash he got involved in together with his nearly dead brother (presumably while on the way to the hospital).
Because of the car accident, he was able to cover up the murder, but got blackmailed by Anna, his future wife, who is after his money.
The road to the cliff vs. the road to the hospital: As we can see, originally Simon takes the road to the cliff after his brother's death (well, near-death).
But instead they needlessly overreach in style, substance and amount of plot points, and I left the theater feeling two things I haven't experienced after a movie in years: Palpable relief it was over, and wanting my money back.
Those people are greatly disappointed when they after a first introduction action scene, are turned back to calm scenes in the description of the Arn's childhood and youth.
they drove the car to the farm house  3. why have the man chasing the brunette, after it is revealed to be the blonde girl?
It's very hard to say exactly what happened in the movie because after that revelation, it is obvious that 99% of the movie must be dismissed as nonsensical.
He takes a bite from his fishing rod, and a big wave comes toward him after a few minutes of trying to pull in his line.
It's not very funny; Lloyd and his collaborators seemed to think that there was no place in a sound film for Lloyd's remarkable acrobatics and physical comedy antics, the things that made his silent films so much fun, but they don't replace them with anything but scene after scene of sluggishly paced, wooden dialogue.
Composer Rod McKuen attended this weekend's American Cinemateque screening and revealed that the title character was a thinly autobiographical substitute for the director himself (Joanna's surname is 'Sarne' after all).
That aimlessness is certainly a part of what Sarne was after, but almost certainly not to the degree portrayed here.
Kane and the restless spirits of his cult wish to have Carol Anne back after tasting what life was like with her presence, not ready to go into the light.
Suffice it to say, I find this movie very depressing, mainly because of Heather O'Rourke and her untimely death after making POLTERGEIST III.
The poor family from the first Poltergeist film think they're safe, after having moved and thrown out the TV.
All talk about how the family must stick together feels strange considering that one of the kids from the first film isn't in this one, and no explanation is given either (yes, I know the actress was killed shortly after the first one - but still...).
There are some lively action and some mildly evocative and intense moments after 45-minutes or so.
Although it's a well documented fact that the actress who played her, Dominique Dunne, was murdered shortly after the first film was released, I still don't think it would have trashed her memory to have explained her absence; quite the opposite in fact.
It has a few okay moments whenever the main monster shows up (He first appears after Coach vomits him up!).
They chase after the car as the credits roll.
We begin by meeting the freeling family after the events of the first movie (homeless and living with jobeth Williams' mother), after an absurd opening featuring shamans and Indians and excavating... until carol Anne sees a mysterious figure at the mall, which turns out to be Reverend Henry Kane, who wants Carol Anne.
Simon Cable is a wealthy young man who wakes up in a hospital after some kind of accident in 2002, supposedly due to wood refinishing fumes.
So after he accidentally kills her (in a ridiculous way), he chooses to bring her back with the help of the incantation books she conveniently owned to mixed results.
Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakens in the hospital after an incident where, at least according to his physician, Doctor Newman (Stephen Rea), he was having convulsions and had to have his stomach pumped.
You cannot warm to any characters in the film, the Emperor looks like he's piled on the pounds after taking over the galaxy, and glued some green weetabix to his eyebrows in his megalomaniac rage.
A technically superb thriller about a man that after an accident loses memory of the last two years.
2) India and China are not emerging economies because of communist protectionism (as mentions Cliff Cobb); on the contrary, they boomed only after they opened their markets.
Two poms with bad comedic timing bumble around with a plank, encountering stereotype after stereotype including an equally bumbling Constable Plod who is more interested in picking up than anything.
2/10 for its quasi-charm (though even that was more annoying than charming after 3 minutes!)
The problem with this production is that after you take the time to solve the puzzle you realize that you've been been conned.
But after another night of drinking, it appears that Lionel just may have pulled it off after all.
The good news is, there are greener pastures ahead for Scott (as well as all of his costars here), because after this, there is definitely no way to go but up.
The climax is the end: after a cop coldly kills a teenager, all his friends start to break public phones, burn cars, until a whole police unit come for the "final fight".
The story itself takes place after an expedition into the Himalayas to find living proof of the mythical Yeti.
Back at camp with Professor Lacombe and the expedition, after Waldemar fails to return they decide to try and find him.
They die one after one, some of them were killed by lonely alien, and others by human enemies.
A young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by Satan, where they run from and into one after another of an ill-assorted crew: a lady in distress, an ape, an ape-man, a midget, various odd-looking people, and (for some reason) two Chinese.
i don't know who's idea it was to make a third movie after the fantastic flop of the second, what did that sell?
The movie had me in such an engrossing manner that after completing, I dreamed all the night about it, about the characters.
But after a while, I desperately felt an urge to get out from it & eventually it took quite a few days to get back to my normal system.
By telling you all this nonsense childish stories, I'm trying convey here if one movie can create such a profound impact on a kid like me back then {I wasn't even the only one, after doing some personal survey back class, my friend-circle & the courtesy of some movie magazines}, It can not be just a movie; it has to be more than that.
and a battle is lost at some secret planet somewhere (its top secret so we aren't supposed to know either) The brass flees from the planet and ends on some other secret planet due to a flat tire, after which Rico has to go get them.
These 3 bank robbers forsake an easy escape to chase after the most nefarious outlaw since Black Pete of Micky Mouse fame whose spurned girlfriend, who's part of the gang, vows to kill the poor young captive widow.
The Akash-Shalini love story was touching too,as these are two people who never intended to fall in love with each other,but did.Akash,who does not believe in love, and Shalini, who is engaged to her surrogate parent's son.The scene in which her father tells Akash, "please look after her, as she is my daughter" was very emotional.But the best part was that it was not "over-dramatized".The emotions of the moment created it's own drama.
True, after 9/11 it is hard to watch a disaster movie happening in New York as reality unfortunately exceeded everything fiction script writers ever imagined.
Especially after watching the first 20 minutes or so, I was preparing my "you don't know what you're talking about" speech.
My final thought: I just watched "Death To Smoochy" and "Pumpkin" back-to-back and after doing so I can't decide which was the bigger waste of time.
I didn't even know that they meant it to be a comedy until I watched the theatrical trailer on the DVD after the film.
This monster has quite a threshold, as Kirk and O'Brien flood the sewers with gas hoping to corner it after sealing off escape routes.
At least this is what we are told as Kirk and the Professor's assistant Jane always manage to find the bodies after the fact.
Well after watching this movie and loving it, my intial thought was : was this film great because it was different and a break from the cheesy nonsense that bollywood has thrown my way before.
I was hoping that Traylor Howard will bring something new to this show, but after few episodes she became just a simple replacement.
In act two, after the break, he can start to cry.
While "Psych" is a clever and original show that does fresh and funny things every week, "Monk" is an unintelligent show that ran out of fresh and funny things after the first few episodes.
On first viewing, I thought this film was intriguing, but after several viewings in the interim years, it becomes more laughable and comedic than worthy of intense reflection or serious attention.
The central character, vividly portrayed by Mimi Rogers, leads a very loose lifestyle in the initial stages of the film and converts to an overly rigid lifestyle in the latter stages after becoming disenchanted and seemingly depressed with what was transpiring in her life.
just saw the movie, and after viewing it i must say i found it to be utter garbage.
And the script- they have taken the seedy, turbulent life of Darby Crash and turned it into an after school special.
Actually, after school specials were more interesting than this.
I knew the movie was being made after reading some articles on various music related web sites that referenced it.
I was actually squirming while watchin it repeating "no no no"... And finally just had to end its misery after the first hour.
After all, I love science fiction, and decided that it was worth a rental after Roger Ebert, as well as JoBlo's Movie Emporium, reviewed it favorably.
And then after a decent setup, he proceeds to turn the whole thing into a brainless action flick in the style of his "Escape From" movies, or maybe a modern day Mad Max.
So after about 4 minutes into the movie, we already know that she's the only survivor.
The girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while.
In this scene, the heroine, if you want to call her that, holds a small dog by the fur up to her face, holds a double-barrel handgun point plank from its forehead, and after we see it whimpering with its eyes closed, she blows it away, stumbling backwards from the impact of the gun.
The actors are all terrible with the exception of Kimberly Oja as a newbie who gets initiated into the team after a freak accident gives her the power of... making things cold... oooooh!
As a huge fan of Aamir Khan, I can't help but be biased in saying that this certainly was one of Aamir Khan's finest performances ... and to me personally, I think this was his best performance after Lagaan!
I also became a fan of Dimple Kapadia after watching this movie.
It's usually fairly clear why he uses each of these; in fact it's too clear, as every cinematic point is laboured to death, such as the over-the-top montage reflecting April's troubled mental state after she finds out what her mother does for a living.
Scriptwriter Suparn Verma was a Rediff.com critic and after you watch Qayamat you'll surely understand that critics don't necessarily make good filmmakers , and make horrible screenwriters .

The following year after this film, Brennan made a memorable appearance in Fritz Lang's "Fury," and shortly after that he began his memorable run of character performances for Hawks.
There was lots of mystery, lots of intrigue about the lights in the water, but it just dragged on and on, nothing ever happened and after 12-15 episodes, it wasn't worth the bother.
I just finished watching invasion a few days back, i saw the show on DVD, and to tell the truth i was expecting an excellent series after reading all those positive reviews, but i was quit disappointed with it, it wasn't good at all, in fact most episodes were boring.
I found the movie pace lagged a lot in the middle, and I found the events after the in-bank theft scene unpleasant (the movie as a whole was darker than I had expected).
Yet, I am just wondering it would take how many years for the mainstream (like Hollywood) center to "digest" Indians after taking in Chinese like Jacky Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung.
You know, I thought I had seen it all--San Franciscans protesting going into Afghanistan after witnessing the devastation of the 9/11 attacks, the daily drum-beat of every metropolitan newspaper blaming the US for all the world's atrocities (led by the fanatical liberals at the NYT), the Cindy Sheehans of the world blaming our president for war crimes, and on, and on, and on-- but I will never understand the likes of people that claim they "love this country," "support the troops," and believe in national security, meanwhile stabbing our leaders in the back every chance they get with the daily gratuitous, ad hominem attacks and movies like Death of a President.
Imagine how this puerile rubbish was pitched: "Hey there's this guy, right, and he loses his wee-wee, and gets a new one... and then we can do these jokes about Viagra and 69s and poo and farts and other stuff that we came up with after six beers and a whole stack of old comedy tapes.
Newly-skinny young man returns to his parents' home after a ten-year absence to attend his sister's wedding (to a man he has always harbored a crush on); relationships in the household are sketchy, however, as the man remembers his childhood as an overweight kid who once attempted suicide (and was apparently rescued).
This movie was released in the year 2001, the time when bollywood seemed to be in doldrums, producing one trash after another, the same year when another masterpiece "Lagaan" was released from bollywood and the year I finished my college and entered my first job and wow what an experience - it was just like a fresh breath of air.
She didn't even know she was going to be out there by the train tracks - after all the original plan didn't involve driving out to the fort.
So after a major fallout they realize many things separately, and learn about their own relationship in turn.
In 1972, MGM was in dire financial straits (like most of the major studios, after trying to come up with another "Sound of Music," and squandering millions in the process).
The A-List Chinese-cast could not save this movie to get bored after one hour.
There was so much potential, even after the last three seasons of pure garbage, and it was squandered.
The lone gunmen I could have handled, as Mulder's absence from their funeral was crass and very unheroic - but after Krycek & X, this felt contrived - pandering to the audience, and ultimately not respecting their intelligence.
I had to shower after that atrocity - not to mention the $$$ that must have been blown.
Even after 7 years or R&R, he has learned nothing.
Make a smart movie, without elaborate dance pieces set to a sweet soundtrack that remains in the top 10 a year after the film's release.
The Kickboxer franchise missed its superstar Van Damme after Kickboxer.
Terrible fighting scenes.They should of left it alone after the first.Making 2-3-4-5 was very disrespectful to the original.
If there were two bumbling burglars were after me, I would be really scared.
Just watching the movie for the first time is an extremely painful experience, and it's only after multiple forced screenings that some of the gags have started to become even mildly amusing.
And this was the 2nd horror/comedy vehicle for it's co-star, Bernard Menez, for whom this was a 2nd try at mixing vampire thrills with a sex/comedy twist and starring a former Hammer Films bigwig after 1974's even more obscure "Tendre Dracula", with Peter Cushing in his only screen appearance as the Count.
It's impossible to really judge it based upon what's left to see now after 30 years of neglect & abuse.

SPOILERS:   In fact, in the end of the movie, after finding out Rohit didn't die after all and they all go back to their village, Nisha's the only one missing.
The first film already established that Rohit was completely normal and he even looked that way after Jadoo gave him powers.
Then we come out at a campsite at night where, after the elapsed time of 57 minutes and 31 seconds, we finally catch a glimpse of the alien of our film, which looks more like the lovechild of Alf and the Elephant Man.
Get right to the movie review by skipping the first paragraph  After watching a movie like this I lose faith in humanity but after watching MST3K bad mouth movies like this I regain a little faith in humanity.
Even after Home Alone 2's sadistic effort, there are very few laughs -- in fact, many young kids will be frightened by what they see, while only the nuttiest of adults will laugh.
I HATE J.P. Simon, I don't care what other films he's directed, I'm surprised he could find work after directing this film.
In the end Trumpy is abandoned in the woods by the little kid, after the kid pretty much worked his a@@ off to save Trumpy the entire movie.
I was hoping for something new after the first Home Alone, which all my friends begged me to go see, and my reaction to it was "Uhhh, "The 3 Stooges" were funnier and I can watch them for free on TV."
So do not, I repeat, do not watch "The Pod People" without Joel and the Bots of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," because after watching the MST3K version, I couldn't imagine what this movie would be like without the funny commentary!
Nosy body Emily Pollifax wants to work for the CIA after she is widowed.
I must give the movie makers a little credit for "misting" Dr. Jim and Laura after they allegedly got out of the water.
"OH MY GOD, I'm sitting in my car and there's ants on my legs, I think I'll flail about on the gas pedal and crash instead of getting out of the car and going somewhere the ants are not" "OH MY GOD I'm in a helicopter and there's ants on me, I think I'll flail about at the controls and crash into a cliff instead of getting out and jumping into the river 20 feet away from me" "OH MY GOD I'm surrounded by ants, I'll just curl up and pray instead of running over them, after all they are just ants, they cant jump or run as fast as me" "OH MY GOD I'm surround by ants on a beach, but I don't think I'll wade into the water where ants cant tread" "OH MY GOD there's ants in the town, we gotta flood the entire town" "OH MY GOD the ants will reach Anchorage in a MONTH yes a MONTH, its not like we could organize a few hundred gallons of Raid in a month."
Surely there are goofs, like the motor bike helmet back on the bike after the kids threw it earlier, and the teacher being a crack shooter loading a shotgun with bullets inside the sheriffs office.
Suddenly the wife is being pulled into the hill (after she was clearly tired of being photographed, no less), and when the husband tries to come up to save her, he gets dragged under too.
A helicopter picks up a guy after an 2-second earthquake knocks him off his feet, and he rolls down a hill to land atop some dynamite he just lit.
These one- dimensional characters are plain senseless and seem to forget too often that there are killer ants around, after battling them just a second ago and they don't seem to know ants can climb!
Then again it is happening into the day of the Christmas, then again Kevin is starting the scuffle after the provocation of the brother, then again he is being told off by the mother, then again he must leave home together with the family, then again is getting lost this time getting the aeroplane mixed up which was supposed to get on then again...
I rented this flick after viewing part of a cut version on the Sci-Fi Channel.
Personally, I don't know why they have to make sequels (for the record, there was even another sequel or two after this one; fortunately, this was the last part of the franchise that I ever saw).
it all comes down to poor programming and it was probably a rushed job cos it was not long after that the playstation died and the black box (ps2) was born they would be trying to get it out quick style so as they could get it sold before the enevitable happened.
Mary storms out and Tom chases after her, to no avail.
Unfortunately, Corrupt Cop turns up as well and after a standoff, both cops are dead.
Why, oh why, would that dear boy whom everyone had such high hope for after the Sixth Sense be in something this truly traumatizing?
I was banned from the movie selecting for months after this one!!
He is wealthy so he wears nothing but a very out of style suit for the first part of the movie (the same one day after day).
Although director Able Gance became world famous after producing his four-hour epic film NAPOLEON, everything he touched was not cinematic gold.
ILLEGAL IN BLUE   Aspect ratio: 1.33:1  Sound format: Ultra-Stereo  Suspended from the force after making allegations of corruption and impropriety, a disgraced cop (Dan Gauthier) moonlights as a cabbie and becomes involved with a beautiful young woman (Stacey Dash) implicated in the murder of her husband.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
Its amazing they're still breathing, much less walking after the things they go through this time.
They even fall off the top of a building with no apparent after effects.
And yet it has a certain something: Allen Garfield is one of cinema's great overlooked villain actors, his crazed bugging expert gave me nightmares after seeing THE CONVERSATION for about the hundredth time, and what's funny is that the movie actually has no problem with his high school teacher being a satanic pervert.
The perfidious witch switches from Nick because, as she puts it, she wants to know "where we go from here" after a five-year-long love affair.
Father of "earring bully" decides "I don't want you hangin' round new kid"...shortly after this point we learn that his mother died...father raises him alone...blah...blah.
The fairground scene equally predictable and nauseating as we see the "romantic interest" blossom, while bad kids steal fireworks, and you just know "sumthin' bad is gonna happen" There's even a "bridge crossing" reminiscent of SBM, at which point "bad earring boy" falls into lake, is naturally saved by boy, just before they all go over the waterfall that wasn't there 2 minutes ago, and the dog has disappeared only to make the customary reappearance at the end of the film when everything turns out happily ever after, the good and bad all become friends, and while playing chess (the way new best buddies always do), along comes baddies daddy, with a peace offering, and a hearty welcome and along comes doggie to be greeted with absolutely no emotion by kid, and they all lived happily ever after.
Then we have the great Vivek Oberoi, who had a bright future after the movies company, Saathiya and Dum.
But now the Plaza hotel staff is after him, but he outsmarts them with "Angels With Even Filthier Souls".
They soon climb down the kerosene soaked rope after Kevin and find out why it was dunked in kerosene.
It has a big star cast as usual in such comedy films where they have so many characters and sub plots that you get more confused  So here we have The once funny now boring Johny Lever and Paresh Rawal(who is loosing his touch now) Shahid Kapur just after VIVAAH perhaps he thought of getting a hit as a comedy as those days before VIVAAH he was going bad in his career Ayesha Takia need i say anything ?
comic thriller about everyone after diamond/s.
One of the wishes gets wasted mistakenly turning a bigot senator into a black man, then another wish spent to turn him back after he learns his lesson and his attitude gets adjusted.
It absolutely amazes me that the studio didn't pull him off the project after the first few weeks.
It became unbearable after a while, I must say.
I had been looking forward to seeing this film for about a month after I saw an interview with Ben Kingsley talking about it.
The book must have been written in his "Human Stain" period, after he lost his sense of humor.
Nobody really cares about a tacked-on movie tragedy after two hours of monotony.
So, "Curse of the Pink Panther" might work once, but not after that.
the original home alone spawned 3 extra movies, this being one of them, the next one being a colossal make, the one after that a colossal failure made only for TV.
This movie was obviously intended as an attempt to put new life into the Pink Panther series, after the death of Peter Sellers in 1980.
In hindsight, if Blake Edwards really wanted to wrap up the series after Sellers' death, I think it would have been better if he combined the "using deleted Sellers scenes" concept from TRAIL with the "searching for Closeau" concept from CURSE into just one movie, and left it at that.
Blake Edwards directed three panther-films after the death of legendary Peter Sellers (1925-1980) - the original Clouseau and a master comedian.
I was strongly tempted to switch it off after the first 15 minutes, but hung on until the end in the hope that it would get better.
Like in the original film, Kevin wishes to be lonely after another fight with Buzz.
Now Marv nicknames them as the "sticky bandits" after stealing some money from a Santa Claus.
They go ashore on this deserted island and everything begins to happen, one thing after another, really FAST, as if to prevent the audience from being bored because a scene lasts longer and is more revealing than a Head On commercial ("apply directly to the forehead!").
I wanted this film to give me more, and if I now want it to I have to put in the hard work which after having viewed the film I don't particularly want to do, and to do it this way around isn't as much fun either.
What we are left with after that is a weak attempt to recapture the audience that IV, V, and VI enthralled.
If he made the 3 films that were supposed to take place after Return of the Jedi, he would have had no real creative restraints.
Kevin is not forgotten (like he was last time) but hops the wrong plane after he puts fresh batteries in the family camera right before he gets to the gate at the airport (his family had all the bad luck with high winds knocking out the electric - and the alarm clock - twice).
He mistakes a man with the same coat as his father and after Kevin reassures a flight attendant he's on the right plane, takes his seat ... in a plane heading in the exact opposite direction the rest of his family is going (naturally, no one realizes Kevin's missing until they're in Miami and he's in NY).
You might weep as much as I did after suffering through this sci-fi fantasy turned horrendous pile of steaming poo.
The acting was wooden and rubbish, Yoda saying everything backwards, (which he didn't do in either Empire Strikes back or ROTJ), gets horribly boring and annoying after a while.
Supposedly there's something dark and ominous about the Anakin character that all of the Jedi council can see, after all, he's gonna be Darth Vader, right?
The doctor hardly talks accept the usual clichÃ© psychotherapist babble - how does that make you feel, do you want to talk more about that, this show is like real life in a doctors room, boring repetitive slow, the dialogue is immense however nonsensical in every way, nothing sticks in my head after all the talking is done it's plainly a snooze fest.
Are you still with me, OK stay tuned it gets more and more hard to follow, the family also have a sister who was locked up in an asylum after she murdered her father, except she didn't, as the truth the doctors told them would be worse for her mental state.
Now getting back to the random killings, one of these guys rapes the mother, or was it sister, daughter, I don't think even the director knew, but yeah this girl gets raped and then he gets murdered and the sister who sleeps with the same guy after he raped her mother then gets upset because of his demise.
Watching this movie makes you want to drink a whole bottle of Maalox for your upset stomach after tasting that concoction named adobo.
This came out in California months after another Fil-Am film, The Debut arrived in Los Angeles.
From the gay addition involving a son flying back to the Philippines to retrieve inadvertently sent photographs, to the eternally single "old maid" who married the fireman who saved her life after she trashed her apartment, the story lines are incomplete, dragging, and with the multiple plots make for a very confusing follow.
At the over-acting, at the storyline (the lead actress ends up with an Anglo fireman after years of self-imposed virginal solitude), at the gay subplot that could have actually made a better fim on its own.
I am not sure when the era of "respectable" medium budget horror started (right after CREEPSHOW 2, maybe) but it resulted in a decades worth of uninteresting no-scares and no-offense meant horror efforts.
We are asked to believe a very attractive, stylish young woman would, after a few dates, agree to marry a much older, lonely man who apparently does not have much personality.
I happened across this film on the 'World Movies' channel, coincidentally the day after I read Murakami's story (in 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Women').
So much so that after the first half-hour of the film, I was reading it again, trying to use the book to block out the TV screen.
Recently, after watching Bullets over Broadway I re-watched part of Mistress to decide whether my more favourable recollections of it were justified.
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more.
He's pretty bitter about his disbarment, after all.
Anyone with half a brain knows that no sane kindergarten child, let alone a teenager, would wet the bed on purpose and subject himself to all that crap day after day.
We get a view of a man who is simply all alone, out-casted by a film community that once embraced him, and sullen by the fact that people don't care about his movies after a while, or the kinds of stories and characters he wants to portray.
My all time favorite scene has to be where Lee takes on a gang of transvestites in a steam bath, after kicking their asses he leaves with the line "See you in hell kid!"
); somehow the elves were content to live in the SEWERS after they had won the war and signed a treaty that humans should have the cities and elves the forests...
Prince Nuada's reason for returning from exile to wage war on the human after several centuries is week, there seems to be no strong reason for him to begin the war again!
The team agrees to go after the Prince to save HellBoy, which he is by his father , the Angel of Death(which seems to be just to add a plot for any future Hellboy movies).But even after he is saved they just want to give us more action, so they go after the Prince!
I felt embarrassed taking my friends to see this and felt like I should apologize to them after it.
Hollywood great Michael Curtiz directs Boris Karloff in this middling thriller about an ex-con, just out prison, who is framed for a judge's murder by racketeers; after he's convicted and killed in the electric chair, a team of scientists revive him.
Later, fast talking reporter, Terry Lee (Douglas Fowley) and his ditsy girlfriend Jane Cornell (Joyce Compton) arrive after intercepting an attempted call to police from the house.
Doctor, who seems to have his office and clinic in his house, is being blackmailed by a strange woman who disappears after the first five minutes...or does she?
And after hearing him say "Lilly Bet" about 20 times, you'll want to smack him upside the head.
Bella Lugosi, (Prof. Leonide) visits his cousin Dr. Van Ee after many years of not seeing each other and they both do not like each other very much.
Somewhere after what may, or may not be, the second act, there is a 20 minute motorbike, "chase", that simply serves no purpose, other than to show off some "special effects" and explosions, and even they are so cheap, it is embarrassing to watch.
During the Q&A after film writer (Alice Bell) could not answer the question asking her whether she liked her main character or not.
I was very excited to see this film after all the hype, i was also looking forward to a funny, insightful portrait of 'SUBURBAN MAYHEM' especially having grown up in a place like the one depicted in the film.
I am actually in this film, I went to the "premiere" screening tonight in Newcastle (after the film had already been in the can for several months now).
It was by no means up to the quality of the other films in the festival and there was a great deal of shock after the screening from audience members who were really surprised at the less than average quality of the film.
This show "died" after the Woodcocks (played by Eddy Kaybe Thomas and Kat Foster) disappeared without a warning...  Not that it was amazing, just a good 20 minutes of a properly made low key sitcom.
But after the Woodcocks were cut off, the show just tried to take other directions and if of course failed miserably (who would have thought replacing half the cast could have an impact!?)
Guillermo Arriaga, writer of Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel, returns to Mexico to deliver what can easily be called the biggest disaster in Mexican cinema in years, The Night Buffalo, with Diego Luna in the leading role and a plot involving a schizophrenic man (Gabriel Gonzalez), who commits suicide after his girlfriend (Liz Gallardo) cheats on him with his best friend (Luna).
So yeah, there are artistic ways of showing nudity and some scripts need it, but this movie didn't need any, it had an interesting plot itself, but it didn't move an inch from the synopsis, nothing interesting ever happened in the film and even after the rushed and ridiculous ending, I was still waiting for something, ANYTHING, to make my time spent on the theater worth it.
If Guillermo Arriaga, that snob who specializes on writing pretentious and stupid screenplays where the characters seems to be total idiots with no common sense whatsoever, wanted us to realize that 'love make us do anything' he accomplishes nothing but an endless line of clichÃ© after clichÃ©.
Unfortunately, saw this right after enjoying Syriana on a widescreen Multiplex.
Ajay Devgan is one of the most improvised actors in industry esp after Company.
In my opinion, this is Neil Simon's best after The Odd Couple.
The first time I started to watch this movie was after drinking two beers pretending they would be enough to send my stressful day at work into the past and help me indulge in the simple pleasures of idleness.
The bad is a somewhat dumb cold war plot, that assumes that a reporter sent to a cold war country is likely going to be arrested, put on trial, and brainwashed (as opposed to merely deported after a careful search).
It's really a straightforward plot, with a man (Jack Lemmon) and his wife (Sandy Dennis) going on a business trip to New York and running into one problem after another, leading them from their plane to a train to the city streets.
Line after line, he delivers, and the jokes get funnier as the movie goes on.
I have not tired of it after seeing it many times.
Then the group lands at an airport after someone warns them not too and disappears.
And, as Dinah Washington once said in a song, `Now it begins--' In this case, one cliche after another, all falling into place like dominoes during a tournament in the park.
Right after these shots, which look made for a promising movie it cuts to the Wisconsin (or Canadadian?)
They communicate with the unseen aliens and gradually make it back to civilization after much discussion.
He looks after orphaned teenager Sarah(Debbi Pick)as a fatherly figure.
Well, I was amused until I remembered that theme was stuck in my head for weeks after LSF and now it will be stuck again.
They decide after FAR too much sitting around and talking that aliens have launched the virus.
early seventies style, bad acting, desolate location make it worth checking out on a snowy winters night.College students on some sort of field trip are trapped in their guides cabin try and figure out why they can'receive any outside communication,after much speculation they figure it must be an alien invasion.after two attempts to get help (one gets blown up in a plane the other just disappears on his snowmobile ) the rest brave the elements and try and make it to safety.In a confusing ending the remaining two make it to a town see a flying saucer and turn back into children .
He gets to his NYC hotel six or seven hours late, and his room is gone, because as his reservation CLEARLY stated, after ten o'clock if they don't hear from you, the room is then open to anyone.
The Porcelean Birds episode in particular put the entire 18-35 demographic on suicide watch for a half hour after it first aired.
Try watching "New York Ripper" right after an episode.
Strangely banned in the UK until 2002, I picked this up in a bargain bin for Â£1 after thinking it looked dreadful and fancied a night of junk viewing.
Jaycee Chan (son of Jackie Chan) makes his first and only appearance to date in a film and after seeing his poor performance I recommend that he stick with music.
So now, I hope my infuriated disappointment is understandable after seeing this film.
They expect to have a nice time, but as soon as they leave home, things start to get very hectic and go wrong, basically one thing after another.
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
I watched this after taping it from an episode of IFC Grindhouse.
Aside from the fact that I have never smoked pot and never will, maybe the fact that I saw it 72 years after it was made would explain why I found zero entertainment value.
The year after Reefer Madness was released, Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Stamp Act which made possession and/or use of marijuana a criminal offense.
Why no one changed their name after appearing in "Tell Your Children," aka "Reefer Madness," I'll never know.
I would have done it right after this film.
The film definitely shows how outdated it is in several ways - like when two characters are discussing a third one and indicate he's a bad egg, after all his parents are(gasp)divorced!
On the way there we see some really funny overacting and the way that middle America thought people behaved after smoking pot.
A single puff immediately has you in hysterics, after a couple of minutes it's down to pre-marital sex (hey, that's enough to get me hooked!
The movie ends rather abruptly, after Letty's friend remembers some incident or other from the boy's infancy, saying something about how cute he was.
Clive Owen, as nice looking as he is, was slimy in going after his sister, and his sister was even slimier for giving in.
All I can conclude after drifting through this mess is that it is a story of arrested development in a trio of unbelievably childish adults leading fantasy lives in chic settings.
I also hated the ending, I mean after killing people, stealing cars, threatening people at gunpoint, taking part in an armed robbery where innocent people are killed & breaking every rule in the book McHenry gets off scott free & even gets a vacation out of it!
We even get a glimpse into Darth Vader when Anakin slaughters Tuskan Raiders after they are responsible for the death of his mother.
When I looked at imdb after the first few nights in theaters, read about Jar-Jar being almost totally gone and how much better this part was, I was really excited.
For instance, the two opening fights during the plot setup are explosive, impactful and a lot of fun, but after that nothing really happens action-wise until 20 minutes later.
And come on some FBI guy tells you to stay put and you keep running after him, I'm thinking, not.
!If those of you, who's still having life pumping through your veins,are going to watch this worthless pile of crap, be prepared for a couple of scenes in particular that is probably some of the greatest comedy ever put on screen; the scene with "evil" genius getting angry at woman for having a dog, the scene in which "evil" genius and woman is attending a concert together, and right after, the scene in the carriage.
Starting with the circling around the airport, I remember once circling an hour and a half at Newark Airport because flights were backed up and that's after an hour delay from Rochester.
Later that morning, after being kicked out of the church where they were praying, George Kellerman goes on a tirade in the middle of the street "YOU HEAR THAT NEW YORK, WE DON'T QUIT!
This second film together, made 15 years after the more well remembered drama, is an obscure action comedy which didn't get enough attention to even rank a nice ad in the New York Times.
Why is it that after the nuclear holocaust, every city in America turns into a car breaker's yard!
The name "American Cyborg Steel Warrior" makes you think of an non-serious hardcore action science fiction comedy, with clichÃ© after clichÃ© after clichÃ© after another clichÃ©.
All this comes out as Wheeler & Woolsey (who look after Dixiana) have been invited to stay with the Van Horns.
We got some nice gore at the end but it wasn't really very thrilling or satisfying after the boring, mostly pointless lead in.
Also of note were the sweeping helicopter shots of the forest stuck in randomly at the end, making us think there was some kind of ghost or presence after them.
Some are good but most get tedious after the first half dozen.
However, oddly, after he and his lady love profess their love, the film continues for some time and seems to drag.
In hindsight, it probably would have been best to end the film shortly after he finds love, as up until then it was a rather decent (if "boobified") film.
One bad clichÃ© after another corny joke, with bad acting thrown in cannot make a good movie.
Lemmon's shear repetition of wanting to get everyone's phone number and address is hysterical, because through his fatigue in trying to cope with one problem after another in The Big Apple, he still finds the strength to take down everyone's name and number, and promises to retaliate at a later point in time.
But after watching the movie I really felt like tossing it out again as quick as I can.
He tries to talk with McCarthy, who Campbell thinks Jenke will go after.
The original writer/director David Blythe was fired after a few days and special effects man James Isaac was brought in to replace him.
The things they broadcast are not professional or smart or funny or pertinent or, really, interesting in any way, and after fifteen years of it they have a nation of fans.
I must say that after seeing that "Legacy" film, I'm a bit confused; I find myself wandering what the hell did they saw in that shallow script devoid of suspense, unexpectedness and more importantly of defined characters.
I was drawn to this movie after reading all the Lemony Snicket books to my children.
I don't even who who the hell this Lemony Snicket is (and after watching this movie, i don't even care)!
Right after the film boosts off, we can hear the gentle voice of Jude Law whining annoyingly about some kids, we don't even know yet.
But after this point, everything changes.
Thus ensuring that a few Doors fans like myself would give it a try even though we were well aware after his awful LA Woman interpretation that Ray Manzarek had the directing talent of a half drunk chimp on crack.
Others may find themselves resisting the urge to blow their brains out after about ten minutes of this.
So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications.
but this is after the party is already destroyed by a giant atom bomb growing from the earth up into the house.
The plot doesn't have to make sense (communist boy-scouts sending crystal-clear broadband hostage-killing footage out of some dingy village and patriotic fervor that would make Rambo 3 blush), as long as the lead dude is kicking bad guy after bad guy in all the places it's supposed to hurt.
Even cheesy songs are allowed (this is Asian cinema, after all), as long as they're during the love or the grieving segments.
This dude, on the other hand, should've been dead after the first 30-45 minutes (which became the most infuriating plot hole).
Worst part is, they absolutely tried, which brought the whole movie to a comedic pitch not too long after the mayhem started.
I am probably being harsh, but just like all kinds of white rappers showed up after Eminem took the world by storm, so has some other wannabes trying to become the next Tony Jaa, (even though his success here in the states has at the very least been limited) Granted this kid did O.K.
All the excitement is over after 5 min.
While Strange Planet is hard to dislike, it leaves you with a sickly feeling, not unlike after eating an entire packet of jelly babies.
For the first time in my life I had the urge to leave after having only seen a quarter of it.
One theory even puts forward the view that he actually was a Roman who'd remained in Britain after all others had departed.
Sean Connery was not a good choice for playing Arthur, they got a Scot playing an English King and even though I'm a Bond fan, Sean Connery is a particularly good actor after that.
Not only does Godard torture the viewer on purpose, beginning right after he questions Allen about his then recent release of Hannah and Her Sisters with abrupt recurring title cards meant to scoff at Allen's film and segueing without direction into random and exasperatingly repetitive moments where music swells to the point where it drowns out the clearly uncomfortable Woody and displays inexplicable freeze frames of indeterminable screen time.
At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures...Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him.
It marked Boris Karloff's return to movies after three years on Broadway and touring in Arsenic and Old Lace.
And, when I watch a horror movie (with the exception of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA), I tune in to watch horror--not see song after song after song.
The plot begins by taking the viewers into an old theater, where Karloff is shown coming night after night.
The end result is that the viewer is not deeply interested (after awhile) in the fates of these characters.
It does not help matters, to the fans of Boris Karloff, that one year after this color-film flop, he gave one of his greatest performances in Val Lewton's THE BODY SNATCHER as Grey the Coachman - in a black and white film with a meaty script.
He makes friends with Roddy Piper after he watches Rodddy break a guy's nose for pestering a woman.
They don masks and go after anyone who doesn't submit to their will, which seems to be no more than one or two people.
It's not quite a sequel, but it does follow young Aussies thru the period just after college.
A classroom full of kids with Bryan masks is probably the most effective scene in the movie, but after that, well, there's nothing to hold one's interest.
The story involves several red herrings - the protagonist's ambiguous relationship with his "mother", whom he's intending to spend his honeymoon with, looks to be one of those mysteries that we'll understand in the final reel, but after a very mysterious telephone conversation (in which we learn that "mother" is male), it's left to dangle.
The director is called Tom Shell, which is quite apt as you'll feel like a shell of a person after submitting yourself to this drivel.
It's probably started filming even now, after all it shouldn't take Mr Shell too long to muster up the 7 new pence and half a packet of wine necessary to complete production.
I thought after the opening attack on the feuding couple that we'd have some laughs after that but it never gets funny, at least not intentionally so.
It didn't sync up with the action, it seemed to be off by about a half second, so you see people keep talking after their lips have stopped moving.
It embodies the every-kid experience: "one night my friends and i decide to go after this girl our one friend likes, which is great cause we hate the only other girl he ever liked, and along the way all this crazy sh*t happens."
Maybe it was the complete lack of humor (This is straightforward Poe style moralizing), the video quality that reminded me of a Canadian television movie, or the fact that after watching companion feature Devil's Experiment anything looks good but this little film wasn't all that bad.
I saw WWHTKB pretty soon after production finished.
I wanted to take a shower after I watched this movie, I've never felt so dirty.
No chance was missed to play up Spelling's (limited) sex appeal, in scene after scene she gets hit on.
Either way, she's lucky to have worked in Hollywood again after her abysmal performance this film.
The action offers a good mix of martial arts and large-scale battle scenes, and the story is (after the first 30 minutes) engaging and at times even inspiring.
There wasn't enough suspense or action to keep my interesting after the first hour.
After the girl is finished jumping rope, an older woman passes by and proceeds to drown her husband in a tub after he has had an amorous interlude with a younger woman.
Like I wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after viewing, what has possibly taken place in the film.
At least I wouldn't have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels.
exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the Polish brother's paean to Ingmar Bergman.
Northfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation.
I saw this movie after running into the director at a bar during a film festival (and going to a strip club with him).
All the 'comical' bits are contained in the first three minutes, after which they are repeated ad nauseam.
The movie takes over an hour to even get to the "House of Death", the characters are under-developed and not memorable, and - not to give away the ending - I was staring dumbfounded at the screen for a good six minutes after the credits rolled.
A group of teenagers attending a carnival are stalked by a mysterious, hidden in the shadows psycho who proceeds to stalk and kill them after they leave the carnival and party at an old run down farm house.
I had friends over while watching this movie, but afterwards I think they considered me their worst enemy after putting them through this trash.
At first he was a bit of solvent sniffer and then just hours after trying a bit of coke he is raiding a medicine cabinet just to get high.
Actually, I finally broke down and watched this film the other night after passing it by for years on the rental shelf.
Someone compares this movie to an after school special.
): Completely devoid of "acting" - it was more like watching those animatronic dummies on the stage at Chuck E. Cheese writhe and jerk around after they're 1,000 hours overdue for their scheduled maintenance.
Try not to throw yourself over the nearest highway overpass after watching this.
But, is it worth seeing--after all, some bad films are so stupid and clumsily made that they are fun to see and laugh at--especially with friends.
Jackie likes only signing jazz and, after his father beats him, he runs away from home.
That is probably true, but I would have to re-watch this "horror" to verify that this is true, and I will do that the day after they remove both my eyeballs.
I so wanted this film to be good after watching the trailer - it certainly had some potential seeing that it was British, promised to score high on the gore/violenceometer, starred ex-pop star Luke Goss (not an indication that one should anticipate a film of any quality, but in the trailer at least he appeared promising) and on top of all this featured none other than jolly old bonkers Matt Lucas for good measure.
This becomes most apparent when after around about 70 interminable minutes enter Matt Lucas, with an almost (I said almost!)
This is only his second film after "Everybody Loves Sunshine", starring David Bowie.
They do get married, but Fonda's father Donald Crisp comes running after his son and gets the marriage annulled.
It's informative, all right, but after a very short while you realize that all you're watching is a bunch of clips of junk exploitation pix & mostly fatuous comments on them.
After a battle against a group of Lycans in a subway station, it appears that her Lycan rivals were after a human named Michael Corvin, and following humans is not something they usually do!
One victim can be seen breathing after being killed.
I watched "Me and You and Everyone We Know" after this, and that is more along the lines of something I like to see in an indie film and films in general- an alternative point of view, some subversive humor and symbolism you're not beaten over the head with.
I gave up hope for something to happen after about an hour, switching to something more fascinating (doing the laundry).
Attention was somewhat lacking after twenty five minutes of this film.
The whole premise of this film is during a party, the convict that escaped after the transport vehicle was destroyed escapes and hides out on the rich slut estate.
The boyfriend cheats on his girl, and in the end it's the male and female main character, the slut, and the cool horny guy who stay the night after a couple of party goers get killed.
Here the action scenes are just one after the other quickly edited chaos and carnage.
And why did he go after Milla?
Its really a big screen version of the now-classic Playstation game RE 3.It takes place right after the first.Things start out okay.We're introduced to Alice,Jill,Carlos,Nemisis,etc.But after the opening 10 minutes it is all downhill from there.
Case in point is when Alice, after blasting away some zombies, spins her two guns, a la John Wayne, before putting them back in the holsters.
Soon after taking the case, Church is on hand to see a man named Zarini acquitted, only to fall dead before he can leave the courtroom.
Detective Jerry Church returns of Rio after a year and immediately finds himself embroiled in the Dr Rx murders.
As the sixth victim falls, in the court room seconds after being acquitted Church finds himself pressed by the police to aide them as well as the defense attorney responsible for most of the acquittals (he fears the end to his career because who would hire him if you win only to die?).
Although never heavy-handed, it forces your head back and twists it's way deep into your psyche, sure to rear it's ugly mug after the lights go out.
Eric Roberts stymies the kidnap attempt after being shot in the knee, continually whacked by an aluminium pole, scorched with a flame thrower, falling down the side of a skyscraper and again down a lift shaft.
Add pieces from Alien, Day after Tomorrow, X-Files, recent gore films, even Prince of Darkness plus a reporter on drugs sub-plot, and many other things that have no place in the story.
Let's review the original 70's movie (since i haven't read the book, which i'm gonna read after this): An infectious but nouvelle agent menacing mankind, a special team with the ultimate technology gathered to solve the problem, the US government eager to finish it the fast (and not always)the smart way.
It's amazing for me to see how a number of good pictures, series, miniseries are continuously destroyed year after year during the past decade.
Anyway, after watching this wretched thing, I put in my DVD of Andromeda Strain and actually enjoyed "The Andromeda Strain".
I don't normally think twice about movies that are this nauseating, but after realizing just how lame this is, I am forced to share my opinions.
Scene after scene was humiliating on the actor's part.
The english title for this Movie is "Love Sucks" and I have to say after sitting through this garbage I must agree with the title.
for example when johnny is chasing the ex presidents in his car after they had robbed a bank why did he not call for backup to cut them off?
lastly, how did johnny know where the robbers were going after the final robbery?
I did enjoy the introduction of Paige to the show, but I got the feeling that they ran out of ideas after season 4.
Safe to say that Charmed wasn't always quality entertainment, but after season 4, it became quantity entertainment and I start to think that the producers and writers knew this.
However after the third/fourth season, It just went downhill and it became apparent that the writers started to grasp for storyline ideas.
It had a strong storyline, good characters, however after 4 years the writers ruined the show with cheap ideas and ripped off story lines.
The stories became bad after the first years.
Especially after adding the other sisterÂ The unwell undeveloped characters and bad story lines and the bad, bad, bad copying of everything -the last few years especially!
If I had watched this film in a theater, I would've definitely walked out on it after 30 minutes or so.
In fact, after writing this review, I have become convinced that I am deeply stupid and have missed something, so if anyone out there understands what i don't get, please let me know.
In a nutshell the movie wasn't that great, and it was disappointing to see Cerina Vincent try to out act the bad storyline, after a first class performance in Cabin Fever.
Or the contrived love scene (after a bloody discovery) designed to show off the lead actress's exquisite breasts?
Where it completely lost me was after Peter and Ock left the cafe.
The focus on character is nice, but the material just wears you out after a while, and there is no real driving force to the plot.
It is hard to believe that they made more in the series after this one.
Then you think, well maybe he's still alive, after all, in the first movie you thought Lou Gossett Jr's character was killed and yet he turns up alive and well at the end!
Alas, the very next scene after you see Gedrick's plane explode, they cut to a military guy saying "No, the kid's dead and buried..." thus removing all doubt that the entire rest of the picture will be without him.
this is without a doubt the second greatest movie ever right after frank Capra's Mr. smith goes to Washington its the best highly recommended if you have not seen it buy it great movie awesome scary awesome adventurous cool love this movie great acting great plot great movie buy this movie for real got to buy dis movie for real it is cool love it is awesome highly recommended a don cascara classic everything you want in a movie is right here a horror classics better than all Hitchcock movies better than everything (except Mr. smith goes to Washington)it is a great movie cant explain until you see it a must see great movie
Tony goes on a cargo ship to take a job, but after a crash his legs are trapped underneath a large metal structure, and it seems only Felix can help him.
So they don't like the dinner their foster mom makes them, so their dog is a stray after 3 years because these kids are irresponsible, so what?
But after a while I began to enjoy my children's involvement in the movie and reaction to this which was no less than enjoyable.
Deciding to look after their newfound family of dogs, Andi and Bruce join forces with two employees from the nearby pet store (Johnny Simmons and Kyla Pratt) along with nosey Mark (Troy Gentile), to build an elaborate self-maintained shelter for unwanted, abandoned and stray dogs.
Clearly this film wasn't designed for me, but the trite dialogue (Kevin Dillon mutters the stale line, "We're in deep doo doo," after falling into an enormous animal waste bin), the predictability of Bernie's role, the sappy ending and the Kill Bill music montage (Tomoyasu Hotei's instantly recognizable "Battle Without Honor or Humanity") are huge distractions Â especially when one just wants to see some adorable dogs running amok.
We see scene after tedious scene that we've witnessed filmed FAR more interestingly in hundreds of other films.
after seeing a few .gifs, i decided that renting The Stuff would be worth it.
I think Larry Cohen was basically trying to send a message to consumers who constantly eat and drink the same bad foods day after day (Starbucks coffee, donuts, burgers, french fries and of course ice cream).
Most likely, of course, no movie should have been made in this series after the two-part ending of 1981... but it was.
Aaargh, but then his daddy's been killed in the army, so maybe he's not so awful after all.
To pep things up, director Llosa (who henceforth shall be known by me as 'king of the over-sized B-movie', after directing this AND "Anaconda") spends more time than is strictly necessary on a gratuitous sex scene showing Stone (yay!)
What struck me upon looking this film up after seeing it was the director.
For the brain-impaired this is a treat: one explosion after another, and a whole bunch of "tough" guys snarling and threatening each other in almost every other scene.
I also hate The Specialist as well, luckily after both this & Anaconda tanked at the box-office & were critically torn to pieces Llosa hasn't been allowed to make an American film since, there is a god after all...
Donatello determines that the staff's powers will only work for 60 hours, and after that time, if the Turtles don't come back, they'll be stuck in the past!
The plot of TMNT III deals with the ninja turtles going back in time after finding a device that takes the turtles all the way to 1800 Japan where a war is going on.
While I was glad to hear Corey Feldman's voice as Donatello after his absence from the first sequel due to the drugs along with seeing Elias Koteas as the crazed Casey Jones, the film wasn't the same.
The costumes are just as freaky like puppets that you'll probably have nightmares after watching this movie.
Jody's friend has mysteriously committed suicide and after his funeral Mike, hiding in the bushes, sees the undertaker, a sinister Tall Man, heave the coffin out of the ground all by himself and dump it back in the Hearse.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III is just a big insult to the the fans who had been waiting two years after the first sequel for another Turtles adventure.
Well after the amazing first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and the second not quite amazing but still good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2:The secret of the Ooze the turtles return to the big screen for the unlucky third time where in the first 2 films they had a great opening sequence like in the first we had never seen the turtles on the big screen and really alive before so they kept that suspense going for about a awesome 10 Min's we finally see them all together right after there about to jump at the main titles and in the second one the turtles all jump up and the main title goes right there it was pure awesome and everyone couldn't wait for them to come up.....but in the third there is no thought no imagination its just the turtles dancing witch couldn't even succeed at being funny and brings me to splinter witch if you think splinter was an undeveloped character in the second...wait until you see him in the third splinter is supposed to be a main character that teaches the turtles but in this movie he just stands in his under ground house and at least the first two films he looks really cool but in this film he looked like a puppet behind a wall and only appeared in a few scenes witch was pointless so lets get to the plot April buys a some sort of time warp thing and warps the turtles in time and this movie would have been good story and have something that fans wanted such as shredders return and the debut a krang if thats what you are hoping to get......your wrong...instead you get 2 weird stupid undeveloped characters that nobody cared for why?
In San Diego, the powerful Bill Templer (Dale Midkiff) leads a governmental defense agency, and after the explosion of an expensive satellite, the government intends to shut-down his agency.
It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here.
The previous year had seen Bud and Lou reach the top of the box office after a slump in the mid-forties, with 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein,' arguably their best film ever.
If this was truly a great comedy it would have integrated the two halves instead of lumping them one on after the other.
Or okay, how about the part where McCrea gets in the car with the kid and it goes tearing down the street out of control with the van chasing after them.
If you're looking for a classic screwball comedy (And after watching this I wouldn't even classify it as such, but that's what I heard going in.)
There was a song after every 5 minutes.
There is one phony plot contrivance after another.
Kane wins after an amazing choke slam, the only notable thing of the match.
Match 8) Undertaker Vs. JBL, after a good lengthy match JBL wins via disqualification, but Undertaker isn't done pummeling JBL yet.
not the best match, but in the top 3 of the night 8/10   My Overall Grade:C-  DVD Extras: 11 Summerslam Promos; Behind the scenes of said promos; 3 clips from the Sunday Night Heat before the PPV; Evolution reacting to Orton's Victory; Eddie Guerrero consoling Benoit after his match; The Diva contestants being interviewed; and Trailers for the Gamecube game "Day of Reckoning", "Cheating Death, Stealing Life: the Eddie Guerrero Story", & "Vengence 2004"
I was totally convinced by his performance as the lonely teen, desperately chasing after his older brother and displaying just the right amounts of anger, confusion and frustration, yet never giving in to panic even as his world spins out of control.
Bill Thornbury as older brother Jody seemed mysteriously detached, yet after repeated viewings, I realized how correct this was in light of the twist ending.
You never see them eating anyone, so you'd think that after 28 days of not eating anything, they would have died.
Well, the story is nothing new here: two girls wish to join a sorority and are asked as their final pledge initiation test to stay in a house known to be haunted(after licking sandals with chocolate sauce and being spanked with a big paddle labeled Daddy).
Music is boring , and starts to annoy after 15-20 minutes.
Damn I would not be scared if they were after me!
Best gag: When a crowd of holidaymakers lose the seat of their pants after sitting on newly-painted chairs, site owner Kenneth Connor promises a thorough investigation: "I'll get to the bottom of this - I feel a complete arse!"
Sid James didn't want to, Barbara Windsor was away, and Charles Hawtrey quit the Carry Ons after Abroad, so no wonder it was doomed to be a repeat of Camping.
Today, just after having seen "And Then There Were None" (an excellent adaptation of "Ten Little Indians") Birkinshaw's version came on and I determined to sit through it all the way.
No wonder why the director did not direct any major film for over 8 years after this piece of silliness.
The story begins on the day after the killing and, except for occasional flashbacks, moves forward, to chronicle the aftermath of the event, from the viewpoint of the town's residents.
The Only question that came to my mind after watching this film was - Wowwwwwwwwwwww how can someone make such an awful film and still get 9.5 rating in IMDb???????
i turned it off after watching the first hour... shockingly POOR!
If you still think your discovery holds after you've gotten a good scientific background knowledge, then you should have also gotten to know some people with whom you can discuss it...
They all have ridiculous names after historical persons.
These animations have been used, reused and used again during the movie and look always the same, starting annoying the audience after a while.
If you can't guess how the movie will end after watching the first ten minutes or so, you just aren't trying.
The only redeeming part of this movie is after he rescues the Indian from under the floorboards with the key, and then the rat jumps out, as if from nowhere!!
Poor De Sade, persecuted and imprisoned in his lifetime, misrepresented after his death, and unlike one-time-fellow-prisoner Laclos, author of Dangerous Liaisons, is persecuted and tortured on film.
Romina Powers spends the duration of the film like the vacant window dressing that she is as Justine, a nubile young virgin whom after being cast out of an orphanage and into a depraved cruel world, in this muddled adaption of one of Marquis de Sade's writings.

A love story about two people (James Earl Jones and Lynn Redgrave) who end up in the same boarding house (run by Margot Kidder in one of her best performances ever), after being rejected by society and the people whom they have counted on for support.
The dialog is empty, the characters unlikeable and after an extremely slow pace, a mediocre point is made.
I could definitely see these two in a sequel where the fisherman goes after Rebecca and slays the people that gets in his way.
Yes, this movie is groundbreaking after all.
It repeatedly rips off one horror movie after the other, all the while setting new lows in acting, shooting and musicianship (yup, the score was awful to boot).
The then poor guy (Oh how things change) had to walk home after all.
The acting is some of the best I have seen in years and I'm really surprised that none of the actors received any Oscars after these convincing, truly inspirational performances.
Oh, wait, that one guy killed his dad 13 weeks after the little girl drowned, which was 13 months after someone else died...????
They flee to Seattle one day after Jack sleeps with the owner of a pool he cleans and her husband's friends ("Miranda's Pandas," Jack and Pilot call them) come after him.
Meanwhile, Miranda's Pandas learn from Jack and Pilot's stoner friends where they are headed and set off after Jack, intent to break his feet.
The most exciting thing about this movie is the alligator boy and after that and before that, the movie is a completely boring and a major waste of time.
Residents of a lawless, three-horse town in the Old West are paralyzed with fear after psychopathic stranger Aldo Ray arrives and starts shooting people and setting fires; time passes, and lawyer turned mayor Henry Fonda helps rebuild what's left of the community, but when Ray returns, Fonda has to confront his own fear and morality.
One plot gimmick after another is thrown in, evidently just to fill up some screen time, when more time might have been spent developing the characters of the townspeople.
Most of the time, of course, this doesn't matter, because Kennedy thinks he's directing a musical, a sort of Seven Whores for Seven Miners, as a result of which one scene after another has dancing girls a-dancing and drinking men a-drinking, all of this to the accompaniment of a music score that if not played by someone tone-deaf was certainly written by one.
Script felicities are many and varied, though none is more rewarding than the scene where Fonda is told that the mine -- upon whose fortunes the town depends -- has just closed, after which he immediately begs his adopted son to settle down in this selfsame place of doom and earn himself an education instead of playing around with guns.
When it's not being burned down, the town -- a tent and two wood-frame buildings whose Nouvelle Vague minimalism is echoed by a cemetery with just one grave -- is regularly assailed by Janice Rule's hilarious Irish accent, though she certainly gets her just desserts (as indeed, do nearly all the cast, shot down either accidentally or deliberately in a climax so stupefyingly barmy that you wonder if Russ Meyer assumed the direction after Kennedy took an errant slug.)
Another one of Kennedy's "symbolic" attacks on our nerves comes shortly after Fonda (finally) kills the "bad man": Fonda brings the body to the Irish woman who was bent on violent revenge all along.
Legend has it that Fox studio head Winfred Sheehan wanted the Stooges without Ted, who was angered and stormed off taking the boys with him, signed to a long-term contract and that's why Shemp went out on his own after a brief split soon afterwards.
So they become human (or wear human masks anyways)- why do they just stroll down the street after?
He's the taciturn, muscular guy who can be thrown into an empty elevator shaft by three hoods, save himself after falling down a few floors by grabbing a cable and sliding to a halt, haul himself up to a doorway into an empty warehouse, and deck the three armed goons who still pursue him.
For the years after, we have seen this on the two home mediums of VHS and DVD, and it was even great then!!!!!
But the documentary quickly fell apart after that.
Johanne Nail plays the mother, and she goes through so much that in any other film she would have been dead after the first reel.
Any normal person would, after all, need massive pharmacological intervention to keep from crying tears of laughter at the horrible, stilted lines the characters are required to speak.
Meanwhile, a car full of joy-riders seek refuge in the hospital after their fun results in a fatal accident.
Yet if you're willing to laugh at it (there's no opportunity to laugh with it), it comes across as a classic in its B-movie genre, instantly forgettable but watchable after 1am.
Trust me because after seeing this "film" you may want to seek remedial attention.
But it's not enough to save the entire movie from being an embarrassment: the writers & director have overemphasized the comedy, casting not only a lame Richard Pryor (who lost his sharp wit after he almost torched himself), but also a typical blonde bimbo as the villain's mistress, and the guy who plays Lana's drunk ex-husband.
Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the "masterminds" behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up.
I may have to re-think that now, after  having to endure watching this one again.
For years, many fans wondered about what has become known as the "hybrid version" of Superman II, which was half directed by Richard Donner and half directed by Richard Lester after Donner was unceremoniously dumped from the project.
The guide-dog would not run after the other dog, they are specifically trained not to.
The photo-booth would not take pictures so quickly after having money put in and most take money from the inside of the booth anyway.
I just watched this in my horror film class (the professor didn't show it willingly, but after the suggestion of a fellow professor) and my classmates and I were laughing our heads off!
I felt like reading that screenplay after watching this, because as horrible as I think it is, it can't be as horrible as this movie.
Satire is more then merely naming something after Georg Romero or having a chainsaw weapon after Bruce Campbell (shouldn't it be 'Ash's Righ Hand' anyway).
If you pay attention to the movie, you will discover that the cigarettes come from a discarded purse found in the trash pile that Jackie Lawrence (Portia de Rossi's character) hid in after escaping what is referred to as "the vault" in the movie and which turns out to be some kind of makeshift lab in the basement.
I ended up walking out (after the dumb guy in the ape suit wrestles the plastic shark in the pool scene) near the beginning and got a refund.
The plot is not important, really, and the film gets right down to brass tacks after about 2-min of backstory.
He's just another man in a monkey suit smashing cardboard sets and doing battle with a toy-tank army while clutching the pretty blonde heroine (Joanna Karns of "Growing Pains", then going by the name Joanna De Varona, and who can blame her for changing her name after this one).
What boy in 1961 would suspect the Scoutmaster of having designs on him after watching this?
One should feel deeply sorry for the amount of Gay or confused teenagers who were shown this film after its release (as it was distributed for over twenty years).
After watching this, I have two conclusions: the time period in which this was made, immediately after the 50s, was not as idyllic a society as many seem to grieve.
The lead girl is too naive and impressionable - after one talk with her "head cheerleader" she decides to cut down on her calories and ridicule her friends - even drop them for acceptance.
I need to wash my eyeballs and earholes after seeing this rubbish.
Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple.
A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple.
It seems the writer and/or director was going for something prophetic in the name of modern relationships, but got horribly lost along the way by throwing in cliche after cliche plus a disjointed meaningless script that went absolutely nowhere.
Not long after Imogen (Stiles) and Al (Prinze) shack up, the anxieties of living together take a toll on the 'tingles' of the true love that they felt when they first met.
Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles appear to be stooping in "Down To You" after scoring respectively in winning comedies such as "She's All That" and "10 Things I Hate About You."
First of all, let me just say that after viewing this film, I seriously thought about writing my own screenplay, because I know I could write something ten times better.
Full Moon pumps out sludge better than this all the time... although after seeing "Gingerdead Man", I can assure you they also make much worse.
The script by David S. Goyer who has since gone on to write massive Hollywood films such as Blade (1998), Blade II (2002), Blade: Trinity (2004), Dark City (1998), Batman Begins (2005) & the upcoming Ghost Rider (2006) film was amongst his first & after this it's a wonder he was ever let near any of those films.
If your after a good, fun & entertaining killer toy film then check out the Puppet Master (1989 - 2003) & it's sequels, Dolls or the Child's Play (1988 - 2004) films instead.
He is a man sexually obsessed with her looks and her age, not her personality, which he complaints time after time in the book.
I thought this movie was good at the point when i hadn't read the book, but after i read the book, i thought is was a failure.
His father was (also played by Christopher McDonald) an archaeologist too and wants to finish his father's work (finding a tomb of an 10- year-old prince who sold his soul to a demon for eternal life) after he finds the map in a book cover.
This is in fact one of Seagal's best movies after "Exit Wounds".
Steven (who is the star of the movie) looks like he just woke up in Bangkok after weeks of binging on milkshakes and vodka, with no money and no change of clothes.
I am writing this review from the inpatient psychiatric unit after being made to watch this movie by my three year old.
I was in pain after watching the seemingly never ending mess that is Pariah.
i rented this after seeing American History X and almost laughed at how this movie attempted to tackle the race issue compared to the brilliant AH X.
I was quite shocked to then discover that it had been made a recently as 1998, after both American History X (AHX) and Romper Stomper.
I told my friend to put Pariah in a new category of "C" films after suffering though it.
However, Marina and Lola don't get on and are forever trading insults and then tragedy strikes when local girl Heather Babcock (MAUREEN BENNETT) dies after drinking a cocktail laced with poison.
However, just a few years after this, she would achieve great success on television in the long running MURDER SHE WROTE as the mystery writer turned detective Jessica Fletcher.
I actually walked out after Andy threw her cell phone in the fountain.
Frankly I'm surprised after watching this thing that we've made it this far.
Thankfully, the scene of these VIPs cleaning up after discovering the hoax was left on the editing room floor.
We get a divorce subplot between Van Johnson and his wife which in turn generates an ABC after school special segment with son Davey, who is so upset by his parents' impending separation that he...um....gets into an unguarded plane on the tarmac and takes off.
The MST coverage is mildly amusing (as always) and helps you pass the time until the pilot winds to its inevitable close and everyone lives happily ever after.
Months after watching It's The Rage, I'm still not sure what the director and writer were trying to accomplish.
Look, I'll put it bluntly, its like an after school special that tells you what 45 % of the other ones do, be nice, hang out with the right crowd, blah blah blah, its not different, its not "cool", its not nice and happy but serious, its like the town they live in is perfect, thats it.
We turned it off shortly after this and explained to our kids that if anyone they know is ever hurt or in trouble, they are to dial 911 immediately or ask an adult for help.
However this movies sets where so cheap and the plot line was so bad that you honestly will have trouble remembering what happened in the movie the next day after seeing it.
But this was obviously not true, since there were no more hints made after the first season.
I know it was shot one a canon xg1 after watching the "making of" documentary (another one of these low budget films with a "making of" documentary that acts like they've just finished making Citizen Kane).
The townspeople subdue and stake the husband, wife/daughter, and baby after a fierce, but one sided, gun battle with the husband, and a tortured child birthing scene.
The soldiers are thus shown as ultimately superior intellects in warfare, and while they may have been, Te Wheke was taken so easily, almost casually so, after months of successful evasion.
failing to mention the clue of the two needle holes after she goes out on a limb at the incident review conference, and we are given no clues as to her motivation in taking that risk at that point or in her failure to follow through).
But I left this movie after seeing the scene after the sex scene, where the Moco clone somehow managed to find out, with nothing but Selma Hyak's strange performance when he gets to her bookstore, that El Mariachi is in the book store being hidden by her character.
Quite frankly, after ten minutes I couldn't care less.
...okay, so it was a crisp, foggy, rainy, windy San Francisco Sunday morning....one of those mornings where you awoke, looked outa the window and immediately knew you would deservedly luxuriate in bed after a loooooooong week....this was the perfect time to catch up on some old movies I had been meaning to watch/may have missed....I had passed by Bram Stoker's The Mummy on guide listings, each time wondering, "why haven't I heard of this before?"
Legend of the Mummy starts in Egypt 1947, the Vally of the Sorcerer where a young John Corbeck carries out a bit of tomb robbing... Jump forward to the Present Day, Marin County California where Egyptian artifact collector Abel Trelawny (Lloyd Bochner) reads some ancient incantations from a stone tablet, he is attacked shortly after & found in a coma by his daughter Margaret (Amy Locane).
And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie?
It is best watched while drunk at 3am after the clubs have shut and you just want something on in the background while you and your mates finish your pizzas or you want something to fill the awkward smoochable pauses in the conversation between yourself and the latest bit of skirt/trouser you picked up.
Years and years after I saw brief fragments of this absurdly grotesque Spanish "Superman" knock-off on TV, during a special about the worst movie productions ever made, I finally the full film for the first time!
Billy denies the charge of murder & tells Adele a fantastic story about a large metal ring which transported an alien shaped woman named Keena (Penelope Miller) into his basement, after teaching her English within two days Billy's problems really started as his friend Jimbo (Greg Thornton) steals the magical ring...
in fact,it's your typical action/crime drama.the characters are stereotypical for this genre.i also found the movie slow and depressing.i was quite disappointed.i was expecting a much better movie than this.the action is slow,and there really isn't much originality here.Andrew Davis directed this one.he also directed The Fugitive,Under Siege and Above the Law,all after Code of Silence.but it's not all bad.for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys,although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a 4/10
The kid in question is swinging single Arthur Barlen (played by future Oscar-winning DoP Joao Fernandez who has surely had one of the strangest careers in the world, encompassing both the mainstream and hardcore pornography, having shot most of Gerard Damiano's classics as "Harry Flecks") who turns up after a long absence at the door of spurned fiancÃ©e Mary Thorne (the deliciously named Sandy Eden), only to fall under the spell of her dangling gold earrings and choke her to death !
His uncle, who's also a police detective, goes after him using Arthur's address book as the only lead.
This was my fourth movie directed by Doris "Sultana-of-Sleaze" Wishman (after "Deadly Weapons", "Double Agent 73" and "Let Me Die a Woman") and she never ceases to "amaze" me.
I got interested in this movie after watching Oscar nominations, getting recommendations from friends, and listening to an NPR interview with Viggo Mortensen.
Thus, we have to sit around and twiddle out thumbs while the director comes up with scene after scene of boring filler.
But after this film,at the beginning of his career,how could it be possible somebody trusts him to use him in other films?
Zeus was looking after him!!!
I doubt any of them had careers after this.
SB is a real step down for director Cunningham after making the now classic FRIDAY THE 13TH.
At two hours long, it is a true endurance test, particularly considering that I would have gotten up and left after 10 minutes (or, rather, not gone at all) if I hadn't been dragged to it by someone else.
Eddie's cockiness and stupidity just wore on my nerves after awhile.
The shot of the subject wandering aimlessly through the mountains in hopelessness defines this movie...and is ultimately passed off to the viewer after watching - hopeless to get time or money back.
What those cheap blue contact lenses Adam wears after coming back to life mean?
And Vick's repetitive killing of Adam actually gets funny after a while.
The fact that it's a filmed play isn't a problem, nor is it being an incest comedy (after all, David O. Russell made a pretty good one with SPANKING THE MONKEY).
There is no way the doctors who diagnosed her illness would let her roam free after she shot her brother!
The low battery and illness of CJ7 and ET after the battery wears off.
Shot almost entirely on a single Abbey set in Pinewood and the woods surrounding the studios in the heart of Autumn, this demented no-budget British spaghetti sword-opera Â a sort of would-be A Fistful of Swords Â pits John Terry's virtuous hero against his evil one-eyed brother with a taste for Darth Vaderesque headgear Jack Palance after the latter kills their badly dubbed dad Ferdy Mayne in a squabble over "The power that is rightly mmmmiiiiiiinnnnnnneee!"
Other reviewers have cited some fine examples of utterly embarrassing lines, but my own personal favorite from this movie comes after an attempt is made on the hero's life, and he flees to the home of The Wise Professor to explain his plight.
This movie is a great example of a movie that was done so well that it holds up even after over 50 years.
Because thereon after, every agonisingly cheesy clichÃ© from teen slasher movies right through to low budget horror farce is played out here and it is ultimately the fault of the banal script and utterly horrendous direction.
The concept of the Donkey Punch - a sex act involving aggressive contact, applied to the back of a chick's neck whilst performing anal copulation - was interesting, but that was really IT for the "thrill" aspect after that particular scene... We start off with the standard group of pea-brained party-girls vacationing in Spain, who meet up with some guys with a boat.
If only "Donkey Punch" had SOMEWHERE to go, plot-wise, after the first 30 minutes or at least tacked on a bit more T&A and a lost LESS of that hair lipped-meth-head and overly forced "alpha-woman" BS, it might have been able to hold my interest a little better.
I've been a little curious to see this one for a long time, and after finally getting to see it.... it's one of the most puzzling movies I've seen.
In watching material like Shaun of the Dead, I usually get used to accents after a short time, but with this one, it started reasonably understandable, but by around halfway through it, I started having a very hard time.
The surviving women Kim and Tammi want to report Lisa's death to the authorities, whereas the men want to throw her body over the side and pretend that she drowned after falling overboard.
There are a few moments of genuine tension immediately after Lisa's death, but thereafter the film simply descends into gore and mayhem; the only tension is that involved in playing a game of "guess who will be the next to be killed, and how".
the film actually had an interesting start -3 young woman on a girls holiday meets a group of lads on holiday in a rented boat, drinks, drugs, flirting and banter... at this point you are still awaiting the film to really kick in, however up until this point, the film is still more than just watchable, which i thought had potential to continue in its tracks... suddenly, the whole film changes direction, they 'lose the plot' so to speak.. after a perfectly filmed porno styled orgy scene where the infamous DONKEY PUNCH DEATH occurs and the the carnage begins... words cannot explain how unrealistic the rest of the film plays out.. completely idiotic unbelievable murderous acts coming at you like flock of seagulls until all but the 'good girl' is left.. it was laughable.
The whole thing left me thinking, maybe "Steel Magnolias" wasn't so bad after all!
The story revolves around three troubled sisters in a Southern town, who reunite when the youngest, Babe (rather a bizarre character), gets herself in a jam after shooting her husband.
While there were a lot of "jokes," almost none of them was funny; it was just minute after minute of unbearably awful dialog and sight gags revolving around "old people shouldn't have sex."
Even 1 is far too much of an accolade for this steaming pile of horse manure The film is just plain terrible its like they took gross out clichÃ©d clips of jokes from other films and ran them one after another on here.
I wanted to leave after the first two scenes.
Frankly, I was bored rigid after the first 30 minutes, and couldn't wait for it to end.
I'd seen Golden Boy (1939), The Setup (1949), Champion (1949), The Harder They Fall (1956), and much later, Rocky (1976), followed by Raging Bull (1980) Â and all of them only a few years after each was released (except Golden Boy).
When she tells the news to Mark, he surprisingly discloses to her after three months of relationship that he is married and has a son in St. Giles, Cornwall, and he loves and will stay with his family.
Giles' (actually Polperro) - witness her horribly 2-D efforts to comfort Martin Stephens after his nightmare.
"Body and Soul" released by United Artists in 1947, was apparently made after actor John Garfield got out of his Warner Brothers contract.
My title refers to how this viewer's intelligence felt after watching the show.
I know that initially after the credits started rolling, I thought to myself, "did I miss something?
Jackson plays a marine officer who is charged with murder after ordering his troops to fire into a crowd of civilians outside the U.S. embassy in Yemen.
The pictures of the crowd after being massacred are terribly frightening, and audience members actually start to question their loyalty to Jackson's character.
When it isn't daft, it's risible: a couple of weeks after being machine-gunned and having one of her legs amputated, the six-year-old victim is out of hospital and miraculously adept with her crutches (whilst other victims of the same blood bath still lay in their hospital beds with the same bullet holes and blood stains).
Lawyer and hero have a Wayne/McGaglan-style fight after the lawyer realises how indefensible his client truly is, and then having rolled around smashing each other up and the studio set, bond together in macho male laughter.
They're political appointees, after all).
I rented this movie just after it had come out on video.
This time, the entire ship's passenger list is Jewish and they suffer crisis after crisis.
I don't want to mention this but Erwin Rommel was a member of the Nazi party and he was the most respected German general by the allies because of his code of chilvary while many Wermacht non party members committed war crimes every bit as brutal as their SS counterparts so don't be fooled that everything is as black and white as seen here , as the caption at the end shows Schroeder himself was questioned about crimes against humanity after the war   There's a couple of other flaws with the script .
The film concludes with an intertitle stating "all's right with the world," never mind that Unity has committed a pointless murder and suicide for Stella and the supposed prince, who apparently has never heard of the concept of a divorce, to live happily ever after.
The direction in the two important fights, first with the fabulous African-American actor and former pugilist, CANADA LEE and then the final fight, were so well wrought, filmed and edited that it utterly destroys any movie made before or after which dealt with boxing.
Not a horrible movie, but after i finished watching it, i felt horrible, Im a bit tired of movie producers thinking 'it will be more meaningful if we deprive the movie of a happy ending'.
Practically every scene faded to black after 30 seconds, like the movie was a compilation of TV commercials or something.
Think Storm Rider's special effects in the creation of its world, there is no improvement in the refinement of graphics in The Promise after so many years.
Maybe they fell asleep after watching a certain in-flight movie.
The unknown government official jumping on the plane at the last moment after it lands , and ordering everyone to leave was pure class.
Madhuri Dixit was not bad, but certainly nothing to talk about especially after her performance in Lajja.
Rag and Skip together with Morrie and Dotty break into Dr. Myra's lab and force her to gave the girls and antidote to give them back their minds after having Dr. Myra lose her with the same gas she used on the girls.
Shocked after the fight to find out that Ben was in no condition to fight Charlie feels that his title, in knocking the already brain-damaged Ben, is tainted.
Putting Ben on his payroll as his trainer, because he feels that he owes Ben something after what he did to him, Charlie defends his title a number of times but now he's up against a much younger and more formidable opponent then those he fought, Marlow.
I liked the wasps and there was a centipede and a giant chicken too, but after the wasps are destroyed there is nothing else but the stupid rats.
And while most people would agree it seems to have a happy ending, it is possible the ending could be somewhat different after the final dialogue between Garfield and Lloyd Gough where Garfield says, "What are you gonna do, kill me, everybody dies."
It becomes hard to care about anything shortly after the film starts, and that doesn't get any better as it moves on.
Confused gamer crashes into a tree after playing a role-playing game.
Leonard reminded her in telegrams after each victory that he was "bringing home the bacon"--earning far more with his fists than he ever could as a fiddler.

But after he turns down an offer to sell to a shyster for $10 million, the laser bullets begin flying in his direction.
It is kind of like what Beverly Hills Cop 7 would have been after they had started to go downhill after the first one.
To complete their task they have two and a half day, then a 100-feet tall giant human-eating monster will be sent after them.
It wears think after a fairly short and then gets downright annoying.
Only thing is I don`t believe the audience were actually meant to identify so clearly with the bad guy, it was only after being battered over the head as to how well educated and well off the heroes were that I found myself cheering for the baddies in a film that feels like it was cross bred with GOLDENEYE and BEVERLY HILLS 90210
However, any resemblance on this Argentinian piece with Brewer's book were declared like purely coincidental, as the author declared having knowledge about the movie five years after writing his book.
But anyway, Leigh Lewis does a good job in her role of the women anchorperson who sees the light after losing her grandmother with the believers going back to heaven during the worldwide disappearance of souls that happens right before nuclear bombs are supposed to explode in all areas of the world.
I have most of Freddie's DVDs, and I have several Freddie flicks that aren't available on DVD permanently stored on my TiVo for repeated viewing (Sign of the Cross, Death Takes a Holiday, Executive Suite), and I even have some ancient flicks of his on video tape (True to the Navy, The Wild Party, Dark Angel), and what did I do after "I Married a Witch"?
From the story "The Passionate Witch" by Thorne Smith and Norman Matson comes a teasing, silly romantic comedy which begins brightly but flags sometime after that.
this film would define "mediocre" except that some mediocre films are at least watchable; so I guess this is just a really bad film, after all.
And not only did I walk out after 50 minutes, but it was my wife (a "chick-flick" aficionado) who suggested we get out of the theater before she became physically ill from this turkey grande.
Equally to blame for the film's ultimate failure is Stuart Cooper whose direction is pretentious to a fault and, unsurprisingly, he too faded exclusively into TV-movie limbo soon after; for what it's worth, many years ago I did get to watch two of his TV ventures Â A.D. (1985) and THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM (1988) Â both of which were large-scale productions.
And her chasing Gravey down the street begging him to take her back after he reveals he has some title was just plain ridiculous(though I guess they had to make something up to set up the final scene).
Mary was the mistress to King Francis of France she returned to England with Mary, Queen of France after the death of the French King Louis She became Henry's lover.
They married (after he split from Rome) and were happy.
She did live a quite life after the death of her sister.
In the closing "write-over", we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy; in fact, her family looked down on her and even rejected her because she brought down their status.
She does not "settle" for Percy only after Mary has "stolen" Henry.
Gregory is taking a huge risk here by suggesting that the allegation levied upon Anne and her brother George was indeed founded in truth, borne out of Anne's desperation to get with child after her miscarriage.
It became hardwired in me after watching Anne of the Thousand Days as a young girl.
But after watching this hack job, I have to say I am looking forward to the new season of the Tudors on HBO.
For example smoking wasn`t the social crime it is now , only white people were allowed to be catholics , commies existed and wanted to drop atomic bombs on the USA , young teenage boys could be looked after by priests without any suspicion and teenagers swearing was a certain sign that there were demonic forces at work .
I watched this movie at eight o'clock in the morning after being awake for two days.
She immediately has a "delayed" orgasm (only that piece of fiction could be written by a clueless male fixated on a fantasy that doesn't exist in real life), after which they suddenly decide they are in love and oh, by the way, it is six months later all of a sudden because it has been established for the sake of the story that he is so neurotic that he can't remain in a relationship longer than, what is it?
She puts on a costume that brings him out of a coma and all live happily ever after, or so you are supposed to think.
Donald has just released a preternaturally cunning and spitefully ferocious black leopard to hunt and engage in a battle of wits; a creature that wastes little time going after Nancy's half sister...
The purpose of this revived hunt will be for MacGregor to expunge a newly found emotion within him: fear (although his high-powered scoped rifle should be of no little assistance in that regard), and after giving his servants two weeks off with pay, loads his weapon with nine rounds (for the fabled number of lives), frees the creature and limps off alone in pursuit of it.
The three females are escorted by a transplanted Texan, a tour guide in the Thai capital and a former lover of Georgia, and he becomes romantically embroiled with her sister immediately after the group's arrival at the vacated MacGregor estate, while the title character is only seen as he threatens the visitors, the big game hunter seemingly having been swallowed by the encroaching flora as he seeks his hardly elusive prey.
Filmed in 1978, this is actually one of the "When Animals Attack" vein of thrillers made after the success of crowd-pleasers like JAWS, FOOD OF THE GODS and GRIZZLY.
It's no wonder after a history of playing heavies in many 1950's mediocre films that he finally escaped to the sanctuary of television, and found a much needed success in either a courtroom ("Perry Mason") or a wheelchair ("Ironside").
Or how about this one after Cleopatra has failed in an attempt to have Luciluus assassinated the previous night; Cleopatra (to Lucilius); "Perhaps your heart Lucilius is more fickle."
It's no wonder William Lundigan wound up selling Westinghouse refrigerators on television commercials after films like this.
But after watching the movie i didn't understand a single thing.
But, all of the pointless nonsense hurled at you scene after scene in the name of creativity actually drives you beyond the threshold of tolerance.
Well, for the headache you get after watching this, you may actually want to puff off a whole packet.
Too bad that after the smash success of films like LIFE WITH FATHER, Irene Dunne was so desperate for good parts that she agreed to settle for a film like this--tedious, predictable, banal sort of comedy that struggles manfully to be funny by putting her through some slapstick paces that are about as funny as a stubbed toe.
Scenes just go on forever and as good as Sidney is at some of his own comedy Belefonte needs to be put in a Troama movie with comedy acting like this, and after the half way point it practically becomes Belefonte's movie as his overacted and underfunny mugging pushes Cosby and Poitier out of the way and the movie goes into the toilet.
And it is a funny film occasionally, but it also annoys with its constant attempt of being the hippest movie ever made, and partly seems like an overlong rap-video, which is more than tiring after a while.
John Woo was a brilliant filmmaker in his Hong Kong days, with great titles such as "A Better Tomorrow", "The Killer" or "Bullet In The Head", but at the latest since after the passable "Face/Off", his name is connected with blockbusters that barely reach mediocrity, such as "The Big Hit".
I feel better for writing this review, that ghost of watching The Big Hit may finally leave me alone after four grueling years.
After the first 10 minutes I was like "well OK they just need to get some action started and then the movie will be worth watching" and then after 15 the first action scene came, and what a load of crap that was.
So after seeing the first action scene (app.
It is not long after that Amy becomes attracted to Lucy, but Amy is a "cop" and Lucy is the "villain"!
It was a pleasant surprise to see the great Jill Clayburgh return to film, after being away for a while, in a starring role.
She only refers to Tripp in terms of the job, so when after about half an hour we have to be told Paula has feelings for Tripp, it is a surprise.
There is no chemistry between any of the actors, the writing is on middle-school level, and any movie that dares to invoke Katharine Hepburn in one scene and then drags its characters through one contrived and pointless and flatly-acted episode after another is indeed crud.
A chipmunk attacks, a dolphin attacks, a mockingbird bites the guy's nose like in a Goofy cartoon oh - and a lizard attacks - and after he does - they show him snickering - thus making the snickering lizard more three-dimensional than any of the supporting characters.
The idea of teaming Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould together in a movie must have seemed like a good idea after their success with MASH.
I have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie.
The feared and effective Gestapo act like a bunch of buffoons as their knocked out and disarmed by Eric & Co. after they first disarmed and arrested them.
That's fifteen years ago, with Soavi having done lots of TV work in the meantime -- maybe the reason why "Arrividerci amore, ciao", his first big-screen venture after more than a decade, is exactly looking like a professionally executed RAI Uno television assignment.
The biggest problem of "Amore" is the script, working moderately, occasionally even quite well for about an hour, after which the story is rapidly mutating from a pretty tight, at intervals hard-hitting crime flick into an extraordinarily boring wife-murder yawn ultimately dissolving into lukewarm air, the end being one of the most awful letdowns in Italian thriller history.
Unfortunately the film can't even be relied on for classic one liners; the closest we get is after Arnie's wife throws a cake against the wall to which he replies   "NEVER DRINK AND BAKE..."  Go watch Total Recall, or Predator again instead!
He finds himself in danger of getting in over his head with this role-playing, especially after getting involved with a woman.
Critique -- Not long after I popped this one in, I could see why "Raw Deal" is one of the star's least-regarded films.
He rolls of classic line after classic line, there is one instance where him and his wife have a argument - she throws are cake at him after she has had a few drinks, he says  "You shouldn't drink...and bake"  how cool is that  this looks surprisingly low budget for Arnie, but you have to watch it for its comedy value
It also addresses the reality of life after divorce in our culture.
Some examples: fight in the snow, dividing the film in chapters, the kill list, the cartoon (images in Lady Snowblood, anime in Kill Bill), the extreme education both the Lady and the Bride had to suffer (and while we're comparing: after seeing "Lady Snowblood", Beatrix's education looked like kindergarten), the big fight in an establishment (okay, the opponents weren't masked, but the next scene was set at a masked ball)...
Many have stated this before, but pray tell me, in case you wake up on your hospital bed after years of coma, how on Earth are you meant to grasp the whole situation immediately.
The chances of my seeing part 2 after this are 0 to none.
Then, she battles the "board leader", and after sufficient scenery changes, she wins again.
Barry pulled out after a few days shooting due to creative differences.
That's because, after all, he's a guy in a cumbersome robot suit.
The dog getting killed, Harvey Kietel's hand being chopped off are part of the fun gore that is in this movie, and the robot is clearly the most convincing actor of the movie, at about 45 minutes in you'll realize there just isn't too much to this movie - after Kietel's character is killed off, that just leaves the two creepy ugly idiots in love (fawcett and douglas) to run from the robot for the rest of the movie.
It takes its sweet time to build up the situation, after watching the characters lounging about aimlessly and eyeing each other off.
The entire thing involved 2x humans and 1x robot running around after a dizzy blonde, each trying to get her into the sack.
Farrah Fawcett had abandoned Charlie's Angels after just one season to better herself as an actress and move into the world of movies.
Still, having come back to it after so long, I was expecting to be greatly disappointed but actually I enjoyed it for what it is: as a sci-fi epic, it certainly brought nothing new to the table (borrowing the plot's essential life-on-a-space-station element from SILENT RUNNING [1971] and its sex-starved robot, an appropriately menacing creation, from DEMON SEED [1977]) but was nonetheless fairly engaging - with a stylish enough look courtesy of cinematographer Billy Williams and production designer Stuart Craig (though Elmer Bernstein's score is curiously forgettable) - and, thankfully, did not overstay its welcome (running for only 88 minutes).
The cast is populated with some of Warner Brothers' best character actors of the early 1930's but the result is more outrageous than funny and after a while you just want someone to kill the family and be done with it.
Craggy Morris Ankrum is just one of a number of familiar faces that populate the still engrossing after all these years Earth vs the flying saucers.
The "comedy" evolves from the actors after a few sketches, however after a while even their performances become tedious and predictable.
And after a droll 15-20 minutes of interaction of absolutely no worth, we finally get to see some zombies.
You won't be anymore after you watch this trash.
As an avid fan of Zombie movies I checked out this one after reading the positive comments on the box.
The film is supposedly camera footage shot by different groups that chronicle their tribulations after London is overrun by walking dead.It mostly ended up being a film that featured a lot of bad actors standing or sitting around trying to emote the horror of fighting off zombies while talking into a shaky camera,ala "Blair Witch",while not being even close to as good as "Blair Witch".
The thing that annoyed me about this film was the shaky camera movements, it was tolerable at first but became a nuisance after a while, the storyline is very confusing, it even at times felt like there was no storyline, because the characters were never really developed enough for me to care about any of them, they actually bugged the living hell out of me, it also never really built up any suspense, at least not for me, because given the fact that I didn't care for any of the characters the film just bored me, plainly put.
There is no way in hell anyone (drugged, insane, undead etc), could state such at thing after seeing this "movie".
3 questions you most certainly will ask yourself after this movie:  - Why oh why?!
No mystery there: thanks to the spread of information on the internet in the late 90s and, soon after, the film 28 DAYS LATER, common moviegoers finally caught on that there was more to horror than lame slasher flicks featuring an endless succession of bemasked murderers.
Thankfully, the film is only around an hour and a half in length - whereas most of the other titles in "The Bible Collection" ran for something like twice that running-time (as does, after all, John Huston's THE BIBLE - IN THE BEGINNING itself).
I sleep after watching half of the movie.
even after you are allowed to realize that half of them are merely characters in ANOTHER movie ABOUT a movie.
In the thankless role of a father who returns years after deserting wife (Bainter) and their frothy daughters, Papa Rains is so charming that he manages to make believable their ludicrously swift forgiveness of him.
I attended the film with seven other Burners merely two weeks after returning from BM '03, and we all agreed: What a disappointment!
I ordered this movie on rental after hearing quite a lot of praise for it.
I decided to watch The History Boys after firstly seeing a trailer depicting a seemingly innocent story of the quest to academic excellence and secondly hearing that it was an excellent adaptation.
You'd think he'd know better after starring alongside Ted Theodore Logan in Dangerous Liaisons, but no.
He does, with his new girlfriend in tow after being MIA for days.
My comment to writer 'hhy203': I strongly recommend you watching this movie again (after 20 years).
-the dialog is cheesy: remember when they talk about their past right after a murder with the beast out there ?
Rinse, repeat, show after show.
Its very existence will depress you like a rainy Sunday after the funeral of a close friend.
Even accounting for a low budget you cannot but flinch from the attempted suspense which soon becomes repetitive, after 30 minutes I was wishing the unseen alien would just wipe out the motley bunch in one swoop.
He sends his daughter Sara to a British boarding school for girls after they tour Europe.
All this happens in a totally random fashion.. and after that Mr.
It's amazing that audiences of 1956 didn't riot after being charged admission to watch this excruciating exercise.
If you take a look at the credits of Chester Morris's career, you'll note he did a lot of television in the Fifties and Sixties after his Boston Blackie series came to an end.
He does, after all, sport the archytypal villain's moustache and black cape - so often found in the ripest stage and film melodramas.
maybe I should come back to write my comment after I see it.
ComÃ©dia de Deus for me is the only movie that I ever ran away from, after some short debating with my two companions, leaving the other two spectators the cinema to themselves (I still sometimes wonder whether they managed to sit it out).
And you'll also see a lot of strange "games" with food - befor and after having been eaten...I know i didn't understand the deeper sense of this movie, but it just was to strange for me...Don't!
And how could anyone not know after even the most superficial first-date small talk that he was getting involved with his boss's grand-daughter?
accidentally kill one of their own in a birthday prank gone awry; they struggle to keep their deed a secret even after a nerdy student discovers the truth.
The camera actually dresses up the area, and while there is a union hiring hall nearby, and the area is less than a mile from police headquarters, the site of two white men standing on that corner meant that it was either just after daylight or an optical illusion.
Antonie Kamerling went to Hollywood after this movie but the only person who cast him there is Renny Harlin...ha-ha not exactly a good sign!
the two makers were present to answer questions on the film, not after the screening as one would expect but before it saying that they couldn't make it after the film.
- to have secretly been part of some big coordinated scam after all.
The cinema MUST surely have taught us all enough about the lives and work of conmen by now for us to find it ludicrously improbable that either of the two main characters would be willing to expose thousands of dollars of money already "in hand" in order to secure the alleged "sure thing" of a deal that is to net them many thousands more (after all, it is the endemic idiocy of such greed and of the general greed-driven tendency to forget the "bird in the bush" principle that is the very basis of a conman's livelihood).
Well, at least I'll be spared hours of head-shaking incomprehension when I read on here in a couple of months rave review after rave review of a new mafia movie which features a scene in which the rat receives with relief and unconditional enthusiasm the message from the boss: "Sure, I know you helped set up the hit on my kid brother, and I'm not too happy about it.
This is just after he screamed at his wife Julia (Cherry Jones) for putting the jars out in the first place.
This is a pretty boring slasher in my opinion, as I was quite disappointed, after reading lots of positive stuff about it.
This is a pretty boring slasher in my opinion, as I was quite disappointed after reading lots of positive stuff about it, and I say avoid it.
I think they cast Vinnie Jones in this after seeing things like Gone In 60 Seconds, Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels and the UK remake of The Mean Machine.
Only 5 minutes later does it dawn on him (after his ex asks for his location) that he should find out the co-ordinates for the island i.e.
The executives probably had to have their eyes checked after watching the daily rushes.
Lot of HDTV's probably get returned to the store after watching this.
Response was so positive, that after the author Frances Burnett had adapted it for the stage at the turn of the century and called it "A Little Princess," she re-wrote the book version, adding length and detail, and calling it "Little Princess" as well.
A movie like Dodgeball moves slow because the characters, after they come into the scene and give you that one laugh, like the gym owner or the pirate guy, don't seem to have any more steam and the viewer is suppose to enjoy it for what it is.
I always liked Jimmy Edwards' style on TV, but it doesn't translate well after 50 years.
Sara and her story remain compelling and attractive after a lapse of more than 100 years and this filmed version remains so after 20 years, but can we not find so compelling a version of what is perhaps Francs Hodgson Burnett's finest tale childhood?
So, in summary, if you've never read the book, you're in for a nice surprise: comedy that is still funny after a hundred years and more, but don't let this film put you off.
And after this he becomes, well, not any kind of ancestral hominid but rather an ape-headed hairy monster whose idea of decorum is to smash furniture and tear cops limb from limb during his blackouts.
You see, after becoming a monkey-man, he would later turn back to himself--with no memory of his bestial transformation.
If so, I suppose he began ingesting brain numbing substances after the success of his first movie.
IN KARGIL, it was General Musharaf who initiated the conflict because of his fear that India and Pakistan might FINALLY sign a peace deal (Bhajpayee going to Pakistan as a gesture of goodwill and meeting Sharif............after Kargil Bhajpayee said he felt he had been stabbed in the back).
I know this is Canada's first attempt at top model, but you would think after 6 seasons of ANTM they would have taken some notes.
Perhaps the funniest moment in the film comes when Torn tells his sob story after he puts himself on the stand.
or i guess they were just making fun of themselves and others..  watching the title of the movie i thought that it would be some good ship movie but after watching the movie i was really disappointed..the acting was terrible..the main villain in the movie was so dumb and was thinking as he was the God..means he was so over acting at several points...  i could not understand what they were up to before and during making this movie..there is no story the action scenes are lame and cheap.. they could have done better in many ways like acting and other points..but they have to fail to do so and make a piece of crap...  never ever watch this movie under any circumstances... i wished i could give this movie 0 but that is not possible as the lowest vote is 1
When the Âhairline' crack in the baggage area wall is discovered, one guy says to the other, (this is after they are done shining torches into each other's eyes) `The vault is on the other side, if we can get in there we may be able to fix it.'
Yet the two scenes were meant to be right after each other.
The script is one abysmal clichÃ© after another and the direction and editing are horrible, too.
Andrew McCarthy plays the misguided fool who is torn between the insincere bimbo (Kelly Preston) that he spends the Christmas holiday at a tropical resort after being dumped and in a drunken haze, travels there with his new companion.
Kids at the age there after (1-3) are constantly learning, and a brainless TV show like this, ware the characters constantly talk rubbish and the narrator keeps naming nonexistent things and creatures.
I was somewhat interested in seeing it, after all I did enjoy "Enter the Dragon" and wanted to see some more of Jim Kelly and Bolo Yeung.
I was looking forward to seeing this movie after seeing Jim Kelly in 'Black Belt Jones' and 'Enter the Dragon' but I was disappointed with the fact that Jim Kelly's voice was dubbed over by someone else.
We WALKED OUT after about 1/2 hour of watching this drivel, and demanded our money back.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS:the screenplay is not that much strong,and the suspense is not really here.The first hour is boring and what remains is a spate of clichÃ©s:best/worst example:the killer,leaving "clues" on the dead body ,I've seen it (and read it) so many times that it leaves me amazed :how can a writer ,fifty years or so after Agatha Christie and co,still think of a such hackneyed idea?Giving the killer's identity or the key to the mystery half an hour or more before the ending can be rewarding (such was the case in "vertigo" (1958)),but here ,it destroys any fear:who could reasonably think that the hero -and his girl-could be really in jeopardy after that?Only a whodunit could sustain the interest till the very end.
That the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up.
Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large, luxurious home she shared with her new husband.
It's easy to sense bad writing when stories falls flat after the setup or the first act.
Apparently, she made a consecutive series of bombs after gaining fame from that debut role.
I watched FRAT FRIGHT (also known as HAPPY HELL NIGHT), NIGHT SCHOOL, SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE and this film, HELL NIGHT, one after the other during the span of an entire week, and I have to say that all horror films in academic settings pretty much suck.
If you're after an entertaining horror flick it would be best to skip Hell Night and watch something like American Gothic or Scalps instead.
Violent Cop is somewhat styled after the classics of the ultraviolent genre a la Clockwork Orange (SPOILER: the opening scene here closely relates to the infamous opening sequence from Kubrick's deviants' study).
But one thing is for sure: by the time (SPOILER WARNING) Kitano gets hit by the 15th bullet or something and still doesn't fall down, it was clear that my second experiment with his films (after the equally awful "Brother") will probably be the last.
I was tricked into seeing it after seeing the positive rating on IMDb, and the positive comments, so I guess enough people like this kinda movies.
I'll concede that the ending was a little exciting but after waiting an hour and a half for it, it just didn't seem worth it.
Full automatic fire in the Guggenheim Museum with no security or cops appearing until conveniently after the "action" -- and 10 minutes after the 1st bullets flew....
  Average sci-fi thriller movie back in 1973.But today due to numerous improvements on the ideas presented here,this movie is only likely to be enjoyed by the most avid sci-fi movie completist.The special effects here was ripped off by numerous 1970's sci-fi TV series like those countless Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman shows.If one has seen those TV shows before seeing this movie,nothing comes out new or fresh.Come to think of it,the Six Million Dollar Man pilot episodes came out before this movie!So actually,the special effects here were not too original after all.Also,they were not content with the Six Million Dollar Man rip off,they even stole the actor who plays Dr.Rudy Wells in said TV show!No sirree.They can't pull a fast one on a guy like me who has seen a lot of movies and TV shows so I am NOT IMPRESSED at all and do not buy into the hype.So now what have we got?Story?The story looks to me like a reject script from a 1960's Twilight Zone episode.The story was too full of plot holes it's not funny.Yes indeed.
The problem may also be that there were some of the clichÃ© Hollywood scenes that seemed to be built in after the fact for the sake of wider audience appeal, leading to less audience appeal.
I purchased a copy of this long, boring slow film after talking to a member of the Memphis Grizzlies NBA basketball team (who will remain nameless) on an airplane trip from Denver back to Memphis.
This was part of Channel 4's Lost Generation First World War season, and it was a huge mistake to show this so soon after their own very good drama-doc about the Somme.
Pluses are some good performances, most notably Daniel Craig and Paul Nicholls, the latter improving after a bland start to establish a credible screen presence.
In fact, such a film could not have been made after the Production Code was strengthened in 1934, as the behaviors of the characters in the film would have violated the new standards of the film industry.
Apparently, 1932 audiences agreed with me; Olivier was persona non grata at RKO after this film lost $250,000 at the box office.
The film skips what happened in real life after Jordan hit that jumper.
(10) Chicago, 1986 - Jordan is completely bald, for reasons undisclosed; in reality, Jordan didn't actually start shaving his head bald until around 1989, after about two years of showing thinning hair in spots; Jordan inherited his father's follicles.
(19) 1993 Eastern Conference Championship series - The film has an announcer claiming that the Knicks have just defeated the Bulls in the 3rd game of the Eastern Conference Finals; this is wrong; The Bulls trailed 2-0 after 2 losses in New York, and came back to win the series 4-2.
About ten minutes after this "movie" began...I stopped taping and turned off the television.
What is this, after all?
I, unfortunately got this as a gift and after about ten minutes of watching it I was ticked off.
It seemed like an okay movie at first, when they showed the black/white clips, but after that it went downhill and hit the bottom hard.
The acting strikes all the right emotional chords, but unfortunately the material is weak - one of those Doomed Romances where the plot contrives to keep the lovers apart through one calamity after another, and some stupid, unnecessary sacrifices made by the Heroine.
She could've waited a bit before taking such a radical step - after all, he was only missing & presumed dead.
And after the poor guy struggles repeatedly to get back to her, how is he rewarded for being so brave, clever and loyal?
Uncredited but recognizable are Gino Corrado as a chauffeur, Nat Pendleton as Giovanni's soldier buddy, and Greta Meyer as the Italian-German woman who nurses Giovanni back to health after his plane crash.
It's actually pretty distracting and ludicrous after the fourth or fifth time.
Just after having lunch, we walked by the theater and they had big signs announcing that Warlords of the 21st Century was only $1!
So, after watching it all the way through once, I have decided not to watch it more than 5 times.
Wilson has a tough time getting this one started, and it does manage to improve after a strenuous first half-hour, but the film's underlying emotion is just as fraudulent as the witticisms.
Herbert Lom (obviously desperate for work) plays a gay man who lusts after Dorian.
Lom said in an interview many years ago that he never saw the movie after reading the reviews when it came out.
The choppy continuity (Dorian falls in love in the first three minutes...he "changes" after twenty minutes...and so on) renders the story shallow and meaningless.
In my 'alternative' scenario, Kit is found out at the end and 'exposed'; she falls from grace but is redeemed after her final article exposes a team of con men who have been preying upon the good members of the community.
Since they are a bunch of clumsy fools (buffoons), Kit easily figures out (with the assistance of her young buddies) that they're the one's who framed poor Will; he's soon exonerated and the police now arrest the magician and his buddy after they are exposed by Kit and company.
Also, are we really expected to believe that after so many police officers and civilians have been killed, and so many buildings in the city have been blown up, that the only person making any decisions as to how the whole situation is handled, is Joe Spano's beleaguered captain.
The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof.
Glad Segal did better movies after this one .... hence all the actors did lol.
It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.
It was, after all, pretty easy to spot the doubles used for the actors in over half the film, as well as the bad looping accompanying it.
And if I didn't feel like an hour and a half were stolen from my life beforehand, I felt twice the impact after viewing it with the audio track.
Especially after watching "Out for a kill" which I did 2 weeks ago, this one seems to be much better.
Walk, not run or jump, even when men firing their guns come after him, he takes his time to get some cover.
We the audience obviously see the killer, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), and takes a while for them to realise it is him, but when they do, after about one or two more victims, including Jennifer's good friend Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks, Tom's son), Jennifer finds herself the next, and eventually last victim of the deadly traps.
But after letting us know how brilliant the FBI team is we quickly find out how incompetent they really are.
However, unless you are a glutton for punishment like me, I don't recommend you try to watch this film--after all, you've got to take care of your brain better than that!
Also many of the deaths occurred decades after this movie was made and most of the actors lived into old age.
I kid you not:  John Wayne: lung & stomach cancer, Susan Hayward: brain cancer, Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz: suicide, after learning he had cancer, Agnes Moorehead: uterine cancer, and John Hoyt: lung cancer  Tose were main characters.
I guess Powell learned his lesson with this one and stuck to twentieth-century wars after this, leaving the ancient history alone!
But what made it most incredulous was the editing; since the story is filled with many a clichÃ© (dying man gives his long monologue to teary-eyed hero, longer monologue from a disgusting creature about what is to come in the rest of the story, sex scene between hero and girl after a heart-to-heart, final duel, et all), the editing should at least try for professionalism of some sort.
But worse are the montages- aside from Bratz, which is in a league of its own, this is some of the just, well, inept editing I've seen in many a moon, particularly at the beginning and end where it seems as though nobody even watched the f***ing last 9/10ths of the movie that came before or after it!
This movie marks just another disappointment in a long line of disappointments after the great first Highlander.
The writers should be shot but only after many long years of heinous torture.
But if you thought it couldn't have gotten any worse after Highlander IV, you're in for a big surprise.
I loved the first Highlander movie, loved the series, and have found every movie after the first to be pretty awful - but I watch them anyway, hoping against hope that they'll prove me wrong.
The director is called Tom Shell, which is quite apt as you'll feel like a shell of a person after submitting yourself to this drivel.
It's probably started filming even now, after all it shouldn't take Mr Shell too long to muster up the 7 new pence and half a packet of wine necessary to complete production.
I thought after the opening attack on the feuding couple that we'd have some laughs after that but it never gets funny, at least not intentionally so.
It didn't sync up with the action, it seemed to be off by about a half second, so you see people keep talking after their lips have stopped moving.
You'll know who the killer is in the first five minutes, so there are only two questions to be answered: will the killer get Laura, and will Baldwin get Swanson, who continues to remain nudity-free after 55 films.
The only thing one could hope for is to see Kristy Swanson get naked, which she didn't even do (three years after her Playboy shoot she has packed on a few more pounds which is probably the reason!)
Director Mikhail Kalatozov and his loyal companion, cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky, two years after the dazzling visual tour-de-force of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, venture into the frozen wastelands of Siberia for a harrowing adventure on loss, purpose and redemption.
"-themed, war-mongering movies made after the Vietnam War in order to cash in on the newfound pseudo-patriotism of the average American citizen (just like what happened after the September 11th attacks).
This film is pure action based, as the movie went on, it was action sequence after action sequence and personally, I was fed up with too much.
He died almost immediately after swinging it around a few times.
My biggest problem was the fight choreography, especially after seeing it executed so well in Versus.
If you thought Tarkovsky was a one-shot in the Soviet Union when it came to beautiful yet haunting images, you'll definitely think again after this movie.
Read the Weekly World News and you'll soon find out that feeding on fear is such a silly idea after all.
I would recommend this movie for an early evening appetizer leading up for a better and scarier horror movie following after.
Everything in this movie is obvious and after 5 minutes from the begin, we easily know what it will happen in the rest of the movie.
Yet, illegally bugging the engaged couple's apartment, with the help of an adolescent Gomez Addams, after innovatively teaching some other kids about the Ten Commandments?
I've lost a great deal of respect for Robin Williams after seeing this movie.
This couple is getting married after being together for six entire months.
I wish everyone who wants to get married after six months should go through this guys program and then not get married.
Maybe Frank can pencil you in after two years.
John Krasinski is horrible in this movie, which is a shame (after seeing this movie, I almost immediately played The Office on my Tivo to forget his embarrassing and crappy performance).
To pass the course, the couple must agree to be abstinent until the wedding night, take care of two fully operational and anatomically correct mechanical infants, and undergo various forms of trauma that even Sigmund Freud himself would have trouble undoing after years of reparative analysis.
I walked in rather neutral with my expectations, and after the first 10 minutes realized that this ball of cheese was not for me.
It took him thirty minutes just to leave the village after he decided to go.
Third, you kidnap an evil man and feed him caviar and get him prostitutes--even after he shows no submission and most kidnappers would have just worked him over with a rubber hose or applied some electric shocks to various and sundry parts of his body.
If you're after the nudity, there's far better in just about every other movie, so there's no way you should buy this just on that.
I don't see police officers chanting USA after giving someone a speeding ticket.
Best part is: The hero is escaping, after a few "let's blow the villain's drug stash" and "let's blow the villain American dollars stash".
It's like they took some of the best lines of good classic american action movies, and made the actors recite them, one after the other...
It started off well enough and held interest until about the halfway point, and then pretty much completely dropped the ball after that...  A famous sculptor's young daughter comes from her home in London to visit him in Venice.
The storyline gets confused and redundant after the daughter's murder, characters are introduced who are thinly explained, and the "resolution" is dumb and forced as though the director couldn't find an adequate way to tie the film together.
It's nothing more than an annoying children's choir that grates on one's nerves after awhile.
As the most recent installment of Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies I have seen (Parts: The Clonus Horror doesn't count because I've already seen it) I immediately went out and rented this movie after I saw the show.
And, after seeing this movie twice, I have come to the conclusion that this movie wasn't so terrible.
Boy those two quotes really made that one episode worth watching because most of the stuff after that wasn't really that great.
I want to shoot myself with a crossbow after watching this mess.
If not, I'll spell it out for you Â it's an incredibly bad movie with one ridiculous set-piece after the next.
Of course, that plan backfires in the mother and daughter's faces shortly after their new adjustment due mostly to the racked-up guilt that the young woman has for not being a real mother to her child, and instead having her own mother build up a facade around the actual truth of the situation just to save face of both her mother's and her own, also for not telling the baby's birth father her reasons for running out on him was that she was pregnant and scared and finally because of the interest a childless sex-education/sociology teacher (played by Jane Krackowski), herself trying desperately to become a mother with little luck, takes in her seemingly odd situation eventually forcing Panabaker to reveal the truth behind it leaving her character wondering if putting her baby up for adoption wouldn't be the best answer to her and her family's pressing problems.
however, after an hour, the plot became so garbled and stupid, I just began to laugh out loud at all the cliches and poor acting and towards the end I could pretty much guess ahead of time what they were gonna say.
Seriously, folks, it's jaw-dropping misfire after misfire, as Lord David Warner chases David Warner the Taupe with an army of vikings, ay-rabs, pirates, and various castle types who thankfully have very short attention spans, because they never chase Warner and his ward for very long... or maybe Warner lost 'em at the inn/whorehouse.
Plus, after a while the quantum-fractured wasteland this film takes place in starts to grow on you... a giant hand shaped rock made sense after the tree village (elevation: 3 feet) of cretins, the goon squad dressed as vaguely menacing knights, and the endless rolling hillocks and groves that made it undoubtedly clear that this movie takes place in...Europe... somewhere... or other.
I'm not even sure this can be called a movie, maybe it's just an after school special on the middle ages gone horribly wrong.
He meets an Orlando Bloom wannabee in a tavern, after getting hit on by a tavern whore.
I'll admit, I didn't even want to see this movie after reading the synopsis.
So much is his fondness that later when he sees her standing in the middle of the street (she had wondered out of the house) he decides to take her back to his mom's place (where he lives, mom's in the hospital after falling out of a taxi) for some nookie.
When these 'criminals' weren't slaving in the field, they were rockin' the house, although you'd think they'd be exhausted after all that physical labor.
I'll try to be kind: my little sister could sing (and dance) rings around Mamie after 3 years of voice lessons, and my sister never made a dime singing or dancing professionally in her life.
I know I will in hopes I'll find a laugh but after tonight I have my doubts.
I always try and write encouraging comments on English films, after all, there are many things they have going against them.
I must admit that whilst I easily forgot about it straight after seeing it,it wasn't hard to class this poor man's Long Good Friday as one of the worst films of 1997.
Despite this,however,there was one good joke in it which I still remember after all this time,about the squirrel in the forest.
Frankie Fraser says the son I never had; humour among thieves nonsense and his two partners after displaying strong affections for each other gladly accept to do the hit on him... only he susses and here's the only twist worth mentioning.
For instance, it spends more time on the wife after her death than when she was alive.
And I still can't figure it out even after seeing all these times, aside from leaving a bitter aftertaste.
And, after the end credits finish, the main question persists: What on earth was it all about?
The fact that (with a few exceptions that ran 2 episodes), each story was limited to less than 30 minutes (the commercial breaks which accounted for the "less than" were surrounded by fade-outs of some new terror arising - which, even the youngest viewer realized after a few breaks, would be a false alarm when it resumed) rushed the plots of stories I laughed and fascinated over in book form, giving no time to absorb the scares, other than the phony ones resolved in 60 seconds while the camera dimmed and returned.
The plots of these left on a cliffhanger after one episode and there was usually a better twist at the end.
I loved seeing Jane Krakowski in something after Ally McBeal, showing her definite talents as a dramatic actress.
But now and after watching various episodes, I finally discovered how stupid a show Goosebumps is.
Even the books, now and after growing up, I found them to be poorly written and totally lame.
Interesting from the viewpoint of seeing an early De Palma effort and also applauding his courage in making a film so critical of the Vietnam catastrophe, but the film lacks focus and ambles from one scene to another, lacking the incisiveness it needed to make its mark among the several really good anti-Vietnam War movies that came after.
If you're going to see it, please turn it off after the first ten minutes.
There's not much to say about this one; every single gag falls completely flat - even though it's parodying a lot of the same flicks that Not Another Teen Movie went after.
Half the audience walked out after 5 hours of bad movies.
What little dialog the film has is added (very, very, very poorly) after the fact.
Only after this does she go back to the car to get Pearce.
As you see later on in the movie, from her younger sister's home-video's, Jacey, in her hospital bed after giving birth, just can't part with her baby boy.
Only about 10,000 survived to return to German after the war.
Of course, the big guy is prone to sea sickness, Frankie and Tad may get booted off the team because they're spending so much time coaching Herc that their grades have slipped, their girl friends have fallen for Herc, their coach loses his glasses, and Herc has a secret that's discovered only after the team wins.
But after all, maybe that was an asset!
Quillan, as Queen gets involved with the mystery after he meets the owner when she arrives in New York by boat.
Unfortunately, after the first ten minutes or so it's too late to recover.
There was not a single character that made an impression, in fact to be honest I forgot most of them shortly after I saw the movie.
A new half breed mineral-animal mutant creature is born, fed by poisonous gases etc...and Godzilla is there to fight it before humankind gets destroyed...although the new monster has 3/4 time the upper hand...in the end the idea of the child characters saves the day after many ups&downs.
In response, Gojira discovers that he too can fly (perhaps after listening to that Seal song), which allows them to take their battles all over Japan.
When Godzilla flies after Hedorah then brings him down and begins ripping him apart was pretty cool.
This entry into the seemingly never-ending Godzilla series includes an irritating little boy who says 'Papaaaaaaa' a lot, a storyline that feels as though it was put together with very little thought, occasional silly cartoon sequences showing Hedora doing nasty things, slabs of tedium and two almost identical endings, one after the other.
So, the audience does not understand that Mrs. Paradine, after having attended the first trial day, is shocked that her attorney tried to put the whole guilt on the valet.
Revelations fly one after another, while tears and sweat pour down grimacing faces.
Every scene in this movie is done so horribly that I don't know how this movie actually made it to a theater) Christian Malcolm is such a great action hero like when he chases after his truck and has to jump in the back with the cult right on his heels.
The guy playing the villain seems to have modeled himself after the Tall Man from "Phantasm" (not a bad choice, really), but instead of having the Tall Man's menacing rasp, he seems to be choking on a throatful of phlegm.
Nope, still haven't found it after watching this.
Take the bad guys timing in coming after Troy.
Anyway, after Zap and Troy reach a gas station another hilarious chase scene ensues.
after every single line.
A cult of guys in ski masks, led by Satoris--decked in a trench coat, suit, and tie while riding around in rusty GMC trucks--want the map and run after the kid.
Evil cult members in ski masks and tank tops come after Troy (the nerdy kid), because they want the map (which is to a supposedly lost city, but really a map to a great big pop-up book).
But this cult lead by Garth Vador is after him and wants him dead and wants the map, but Troy outsmarts them by getting on his ten speed bike to out run them.
I cant believe that after such a wonderful debut Benito Zambrano hasn't gone on to make it big in the film world.
All the reviews here were so glowing (many remarking how this is Danny Kaye's best), that I convinced my own family to sit tight after "White Christmas" was over to make sure that we wouldn't miss this unexpected treat.
Let me put it this way -- I was videotaping it because after reading the IMDb.com reviews, I felt sure this would be one movie that I would want to watch again and share with friends.
But then after the movie was over, I rewound the tape so I can re-use it to record something else.
The story: Nightclub comedian Buzzy Bellew (Danny Kaye) is murdered by gangsters after witnessing a murder committed by their boss, Ten Grand Jackson (Steve Cochran).
"The men in black are after me," Edwin tells Sazall.
All Edwin has to say in this scene is "Gangsters with guns are after me.
The script, in fact, never delivers any information about Christine or anyone such that we could even intuit what she finds so spellbinding about the Phantom (after all, he is a murderous sewer ratboy!)
Just if you are going to name it after something, try to a least make an attempt to make it like it...
The movie has a bleak and depressing atmosphere: MarÃ­a has an alcohol addiction, she becomes jobless after working as a cleaning lady, hospital scenes with MarÃ­a's not too friendly father, Seville has never looked worse.
A photographer strangles homely models after he photographs them he then meets a ugly girl who strangles bums.
just a narration added in after the fact and a lot of canned background music all jumbled together, and some of the dialogue is barely decipherable.
She dies first, and he dies shortly after.
Two of the most humorous things in this mish-mash (and there are many) are: (1) Lugosi playing an Oriental with that heavy Hungarian accent; and (2) after trying every type of torture to make his arch enemy crack under pressure, Lugosi kicks him in the shins.
Fast forward to his 18th birthday, and after a broken family, a move to New York with his mother, and a change of schools; he falls into a group of people who live as "Hackers".
If you think your kids hate vegetables now, you'll never get them in the little tykes after they see this nonsense.
Roger Ebert is one of my favorite film critics, a guy who does not normally hold all films against the requirements for excellence, but after I finished viewing the recent low-IQ comedy "Old School" for the second time in a row, I was disappointed that Ebert hated it so much.
I was playing my Game Boy after 15-20 minutes in the film and was shocked to see the ton of sudden blood in a few of the scenes.
Lastly, the only reason why this film gets a 1, is because they are after some rare diamond (although the plot is still pathetic) and the beginning titles was actually decent (like showing the 7 ninjas individually).
At times feeling like Airport '77 without the plane or the all-star cast, 1978's Gray Lady Down came out in the dog days of the disaster genre when Charlton Heston's career as a big screen leading man was on its last legs, and there's a sense of tired routine to this tale of a sub stranded on an unstable ocean ledge after a collision with a fishing vessel.
Lily eats a big piece of swiss cheese after removing dozens of live ants.
But I did find it somehow compelling enough that I watched it all the way through (after falling asleep a couple times because there are long stretches with no dialog or "action").
I've read that John Travolta after he came back to life by the force of (Pulp Fiction - 1994), he was agreeing to whatever Quentin Tarantino strengthened to him !
OH it's a complete waste of time with a lot of "after the strange success of Pulp Fiction's ego or false confidence" which produced very empty movie like this.
The plot: A man sells his house to rich snobs and, after being tricked, changes his mind.
U.K. actor Roger Rees plays Nat Banks, a Virginian farmer who even after living his whole life in the South still hasn't been able to stop speaking with a British accent (seriously, he does, and without explanation).
Parallely her monther meets Ana's neighbour-a man in his sixties as well who is as "solas" as Maria even after being married and Ana even after doin what she wanted.
Buy a calendar of the coast of Maine, if that's what you're after.
(Even a secondary character who finds herself pregnant after a brief fling with the film's villain opts to "keep her baby.")
After she arrives, she starts crying with loneliness because she needs her boyfriend - after one day in a vacation hotel with her girlfriend!
You know you're in for a heap of trouble when a movie starts out with a man driving a Jetta drinking out of a bottle of Jack Daniels just after being paroled.
I know animals are better looked after nowadays when in a film and there are stricter rules to protect them.
The combined effect these two incongruities drove me the online Cliffs Notes, 16 years after the first time, to remind me of the mythic and Christ allusions again.
All of the dramatic tension is relieved after forty minutes, which means that the film wanders aimlessly and pointlessly for another forty.
An unmarried woman would have been bad enough, but when it s a married woman, that IS in fact an act of adultery and so is lusting after a married woman too.
When a helicopter crashes, for example, you only see the the tail after the explosion.
I know that after WWII, Bud and Lou had some serious tax problems and lost their fortunes, but I would have assumed by 1952 and with a lot of films behind them they still didn't need money THIS badly!
It's like one clichÃ© after another.
Tom Selleck is bland and completely uninteresting, and his character speaks entirely in "clever quips", ALL the time, which really grinds after a while.
Valjean is somehow able to buy a pottery plant after his "brilliant" idea to have everyone work on what they are best at.
The townsfolk come gunning after them without any belief that they didn't know that the war had ended.
At the core of this film lies the profoundly disturbing revelation that can be best expressed by the following: I looked into it, and after a few minutes I realized that it was too deep for me.
But then after surviving those feats of endurance Ursus suddenly tells the ministers of the Kingdom about Zagro's army waiting in the forest nearby.
Even after the women make life-altering changes, they still look weepy and pathetic.
I eventually became a Tom Hanks fan after films like "Philadelphia" and "Forrest Gump," but for several years I was leery of anything with him in it, because of this film.
I should not feel like a did Hollywood a disfavor by supporting a movie, which is how i felt after seeing it tonight.
spellers, good luck in life, because after this movie, i'd be surprised if you were in a hallmark commercial.
This has to be the worst idea ever, a story being told with a bad beat that seems so improbable, unbelievable and pointless that it makes no cents after chapter 3.
To spoil, slightly, the start of a very early plot line: Kelly is threatening to shoot an innocent clergyman whose wife he has been sleeping with, until, after much suspense, said clergyman is discovered to be GAY.
I came across this series after having read an article by Alex Petridis, a pop critic for The Guardian, a UK paper.
There is no movement to the music after a chapter ends, he rhymes the same word several times in a row.
There were spiders at each side of the rift and after a spider bit one of the actors and he suddenly started to be in love with one of the other actors they got to set up a theory.
I was confused reading one after another so laudatory reviews; I began thinking that I really wasn't paying attention when they aired the show.
Too many episodes around some dumb tw*t doing something stupid after being asked not to, thus costing time, food, supplies etc, then rescuing them."
From what I gathered it seems to play a few years after Don Quixote's fight against the windmills and all of his adventures and the movie is to about 50% about Sancho's Donkey (thus called Donkey Xote).
And he seems to be the kind of guy that believes the best way to make you leave a city would be to make everyone else disappear so you feel unwelcome, then block all the rivers and burn all the food so you'll have to leave after a while instead of say throwing you out directly... and while that might have some sort of style it's illogical and this movie is riddled with similar stuff.
Also there's some of his minions that want to kill some of the protagonists at one point and after the heroes managed to save themselves, there doesn't seem to be any grudge and both parties just walk away.
Though out of his league as the usual grade B actor, Woods succeeds here in the part of the first husband, who walks out on Russell after 10 years of marriage, 4 children and a life of hard times.

No, nothing happens to her, as she kills an attempted rapist with a straight razor, and chops another with an axe after he fights her for about five minutes.
Writer/director Frederick R. Friedel only made three films, turning to comedy after his failure at exploitation horror.
Frederick R. Friedel's Lisa, Lisa (1974, more famous titles include Axe and The California Axe Massacre) is among those weird and twisted horror exploitation films that were made in the US and elsewhere especially in the seventies after Herschell Gordon Lewis had "created" the "gore movie" term with his Blood Feast (1963) and other similar films of his.
A murder takes place after which an escape from police to the farm areas.
'This is the place that I belong', Ting-Yu (the child) said when her mother was holding her in her arms, crying, wishing they could live together happily ever after.
They didn't give us anything new or interesting, just the same old stuff we've grown used to (and if ANYBODY thinks TPB is the same thing season after season, you're just dumb).
Long after this movie's release, the term "Slice of Life" was coined to describe films such as this.
And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop.
The movie was just one bad musical performance after another.
O'Bannon & Ted team up, after some investigations they uncover sinister military experiments, conspiracies, lies, murder & an egotistical madman who wants to take over Earth using radio controlled killer cockroaches!
Louise Randall Pierson went from a childhood of privilege to almost poverty after her father died when she was still a girl.
The plot is awful, the dialogue is poor, the acting is dreadful (even Buscemi's 3min role is pointless with no real relevance to the story)-I can only assume they needed the money-and to top it all it looks like that the whole thing was shot by a 7 year old after sneaking out in the middle of the night.
Meanwhile, a younger friend of Laura's, Sid (Paul Dillon), is down on his luck and she does her best to look out after him.
The only reason I rate this above a 1 is that it was just good enough not to make me stop watching after the first episode.
Everybody will root for poor Kate to get her life on track after a bad relationship, I couldn't help but feel it all tied up a little nicely for her.
This plot line, though can be used once in a while if it's done once in a while, gets tiring after a while.
Even after he shows support of his son, it's all about "look at me, look how supportive I'm being!"
Maggie's intentions are noble but we don't feel for her, not even when her son becomes aggressive after learning of her new job.

I can't really answer that, but after watching it, I can't blame everyone for wanting to hide behind a pseudonym.
The cannibal tribe and obligatory grossness only kicks in after about 40 minutes and comes across as totally ridiculous.
THE FLINSTONES wears out its welcome after the beginning musical score.
It is truly awful  The script is responsible , the opening episode features so many coincidences in order to bring the characters together it looses all credibility , but after the first episode it gets worse , concepts like the NDs ( They`re the bad guys from another dimension I think ) polluting the water supply and kidnapping humans in order to carry out experiments on them are underdeveloped and badly explained while entire episodes are padded out with the subplot of a Second world war army officer`s journey through the galaxy with a race of good aliens .
The fight scenes are very bland and boring, and the only good thing about this movie was the opening, and after watching that, i was thinking to myself "hey" this might not be so bad, was i ever wrong.
But after developing her character, and her relationship with Maggie, she is abruptly tossed aside.
Not to mention after murdering about 2 dozen people, he doesn't even kill the archvillian, just kicks him in the chest.
It's important to stay cool right after killing fifty weird-funny looking men in pidzamas.
PS: Three days after seeing it, I still couldn't stop laughing...
I rented this and Dirty Deeds on the same night, and although I didn't think much of Dirty Deeds, it's looking Oscar-worthy after seeing Crime Spree.
It's bad enough our star blindly follows order and kills everyone who wasn't killed by the six monster fish, but after he kills the fish, the Government blows them up.
Veber, after all, is a veritable master of the screwball and romantic comedy, having birthed such modern gems as the original BIRD CAGE, THE TOY, THE DINNER GAME, and THE CLOSET (amongst many others that were sometimes even able to make the transition to American adaptation).
The few action scenes that are in there are so bad it's a relief when they're over (usually after 5 seconds), and everything in between is just unbearable to watch.
All I could say after watching this was "I waited 15 years for this?!"
She is such a stunning and beautiful actress and without her appearance on screen, I would have had no recollection of this movie whatsoever after I watched it.
F--, see me after class.
And even though his Irish(yes, apparently Bison is Irish) parents died just after he was born and he was raised on the streets of Bangkok with nothing but Thai people, adult Bison somehow managed to retain a spot-on Irish accent.
And after it's been drilled into our heads that Bison put his soul into his daughter and that's his ONLY weakness, Chun Li kills him by snapping his neck 180 degrees.
When Tom(Kevin Bishop) chastises Maggie after he discovers what mom has been up to, for the first time, do we question her sense of morality.
The opening fight was the best through the movie, after that the rest just are plain.
Oh, and if anyone EVER defends Chris Klein as an actor after this film, they lose all credibility...not just as a film critic, but as a human being with ANY opinion whatsoever.
At one point one of the main characters complains [in the midst of cavalierly blowing away Black cannibal one after the other], "This place is INFESTED with 'em!"
Thought-provoking -- my husband and I were talking about it hours after we'd seen it.
It is here that Maggie finds she has a talent much sought after by the clientÃ¨le of the shop.
OK, so I was settling down for 2 hours of fun nonsense, I love a good samurai flick... but i had to resist the urge to dump this movie after an hour, but i stuck with it hoping maybe for a great finale.... but it never came.
They shot each other shortly after the opening 5 minutes of this show.
The screenplay, if one can call this one note monstrosity that, was written by Shore and some guy named Kirk Fox, yet it all smacks of being a vanity project, laced with bad one liners where the B listers try to recall who Shore was, after his 'death', then rail against him when exposed.
Unfortunately, Shore gives very little reason why he would be idolized to the extent of John Belushi or Sam Kinison after he dies.
This is where the synopsis ends and the movie begins, shortly after Pauly Shore's sitcom "Pauly" (originally aired on Fox) premieres.
dumb guy shtick may have gotten old after a while.
Of course Shore's career fizzled after 1997, but did he really lose his house?
The concept of the story - the harsh reality of life after 15 minutes in stardom - is not bad, but the angle the movie went to portray it was terrible.
But as I write this I feel I am being too generous after looking at Friel her not wearing a bra for most of the filmÂ  Before you ask - no we do not see anyone strip nor are there any notable dirty moments.
She performed really good, especially in scenes like the one where she tells Sunil Shetty that she will only be a dame for him (after the song 'main na mil skun jo tum se') and towards the end when she tells Puru Rajkumar that she has forgiven him and the scenes that follow and many more.
The songs, though melodiously rendered, are far too many in number and get on one's nerves after a while.
Mr Robert Louis Stephenson himself once wrote..."Sometimes it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive" - words to consider if you are to avoid disappointment after deciding to watch this version of "Kidnapped"
Within the first five minutes, I already knew exactly what would happen in this picture and stopped caring immediately after.
The Bad Guys brutally rape Gaily Morton and get away with it, leaving her brother Albert Morton (who conveniently is working on Artificial Intelligence) to seek revenge after her suicide.
Watchable for the group of familiar 40s character actors, but after a reasonable crash sequence, this movie quickly loses its bearings.
(Yes I do realize it did become more like an 8 year old's driving after that, but the beginning was funny.)
By killing off Jim immediately after (or during, it's not clear) his sister's first experimentation with sex, the cast and crew of "Rain" come across as a bunch of holier-than-thou moralists.
Whatever the case, Jeffs ought to have had the sense not to kill off Jim right after Janey's encounter with Cady.
Instead, Jeffs rips the focus away from an uncomfortable subject by drowning Jim, after which she tries to tidy up the movie with a quick funeral and another cliche, the "driving home in a car after a tragic event" scene.
"And after that summer, I was never the same," we can almost hear Fulford-Wierzbicki saying during the film's final voiceover.
The characters and screenplay are your typical American soap opera clichÃ© after clichÃ© thing.
As far as Carmen Miranda, she's Carmen Miranda; you either like her or after a while she gets on your nerves.
It is as though the writer came up with what he thought was a good idea, and then after writing a few pages realised that in fact he still had writer's block.
The taboo of engaged couples "cheating" on one another is stale and the premise that Bening selflessly gets on with her life after her accident is implausible in today's world.
Our friend picked it up at a video store, and gave it to us after he watched it.
Lower production values (a large percentage of the movie obviously took place in one, large, circular room that was redressed for different scenes) For me, Farscape is about tight plotting: building tension, keeping focus on the characters and the situation, and tightening the screws as one thing after another gets frelled.
right after they made love), Enzo Milioni's effort has a reminiscence of Jess Franco's early 70's works (The Bare Breasted Countess or Lady dracula) but with no talent shown.
Because after all, we're supposed to laugh with this one, and when it comes to the humor, it is as dumb as it gets.
Those bloopers are likely to kill off any braincells one might still have after viewing DEATHSTALKER II: DUAL OF THE TITANS!
The first thing that you are gonna think after you watch the film is: where is the warrior dress that Monique Gabrielle has in the cover box?
Because GALLOPIN' GAUCHO appeared after these two other films, it is less interesting from a historical viewpoint and also, unfortunately, isn't quite as entertaining.
The usual odd Ub Iwerks style of animation is there and it's quite charming, though as I just saw it immediately after PLANE CRAZY and STEAMBOAT WILLIE, it just didn't seem as entertaining or clever.
Still, it does hold up reasonably well after 80 years.
The way the film is portrayed is not funny at all, mainly because after the gimmick is introduced we receive more and more of the same unfunny marital.
He takes Minnie away to his abode and Mickey quickly decides to go on after her.
Yes, there was some semblance of a story but after the "there and back again" storyline, it kind of gets a tad repetitive.
Well, yes, we get this rather soon, and then we suffer through the restÂ Perhaps slow movies are not exact equivalents of slow food, after all.
In the late 1970s (a few years after Miss Crawford's death), New York Magazine ran excerpts from a forthcoming book called "Mommie Dearest," written by Ms. Crawford's adopted daughter, portraying her mother as the ultimate witch-from-hell.
There are limits to anyone's patience and even for the sake of a few laughs (or chuckles, to be more exact), this is such a poor imitation of the book that it's no wonder Dunaway had any professional reputation after making it.
Let's face it: after "Batman and Robin," the Batman movie franchise needs help.
I've heard that "SubZero" went straight to video after "B&R" bombed, despite plans to release it theatrically.
I might be wrong on that, but this film has the only graphic sex scene which I actually felt *wrong* after seeing.
Worse, the life lessons she is supposedly learning clearly aren't sinking in if,after realizing her love interest is nothing but a lecherous, perverted, no talent, broke, lying loser who preys on naive, helpless girls when he exposes his intentions in LA at his former 'collector' friends' house, she happily goes along for the ride with only a little tantrum.
Soon after, he is given an eye roller of a group photo of the exes, and before he dies Harper describes the afterlife (purgatory?)
A plot anyone could have filled in after the first five minutes Dialogue that would have been embarrassing in a 70s movie (the old art vs commerce debate - please!
Unlikely, weird scenes get slapped on, one after the other, without any progress in character or conflict.
Why would you beg a hitchhiker to get back in your car after 20 minutes of driving?
Why would you reveal such incriminating details of your life story after knowing someone for an hour?
This came on after some other movie, on TV and it ran for awhile in the background until I got up to look and see, was it really as bad as it sounded?
They also seemed to miss a major plot point after all of their study.
If it weren't for this imperative facility, we would never buy the innumerable stupidities the fun-makers throw at us: sound in space, life after death, faster-than-light travel, teens investigating pitch-black basements without flashlightsÂ.
Apache started off ok enough with some good action and an interesting story, but after about the midway point it declined into a ridiculous affair.
A man is risking his life trying to find his wife after an explosion, seemingly not caring if he dies right along with her.
He could have been contaminated himself just anytime of the long time before he sealed the house off but after he made his late decision to seal the house off he won't let his wife in and there is no question anywhere around that he might even consider dying with his wife that he seemed so devoted to just minutes before.
I'm not a film buff of any sort but after seeing 'Right at Your Door' I feel the need to say some things about it.
Soon after she leaves for work he hears reports on the radio of multiple explosions in Downtown LA.
So after a bit of walking about the house frantically,causing me to have a headache as the camera was all over the place, he gets in his car to attempt to reach her.
They Ciel the house after waiting a bit to see if Lexi will come home, but, oh dear!
She comes home little after they've ceiled the house.
He suddenly shows up at their back door (after a "scary" flashlight scene), and the next thing you know, him and the guy's wife leave to go to the hospital.
Who put the alarm on after he got in?
Merle Oberson, rich San Francisco socialite, goes out for a nightcap at a jazz joint after a classical concert and flips over pianist Dana Andrews in Hoagy Carmichael's combo.
Dick's wild motorcycle ride after Freeze's van is definitely worth seeing.
Meanwhile, Clare coerces her bimbo friend Julie (Andrea Brooke Owneby, who apparently is "America's Dumbest Stripper" after her IQ score came back near the mental retardation bracket during her appearance on The Howard Stern Show) into helping her break into Dr. Xander's lab to steal his zombie blood.
Julie wusses out (and promptly disappears from the rest of the film despite her star billing on the DVD cover), but Clare gets the vial after the doc is killed by zombies.
I felt that it was trying to show what would happen if women end up taking over the world (especially having Elizabeth I (a powerful queen) go forward in time that was 'futuristic' when the movie was made right after the women's rights movement of the 60s).
My roommate and I gave The Colbert Report a fair shot, coming on as it does after The Daily Show, one of our favorite shows.
On second thought, given the quality of the writing, missing half of what is being said may not be such a bad thing after all.
This thing, however, appeared to have been thrown together by a bunch of Delta House rejects after a night of waaaay too much tequila.
The show jumped the shark after their greatest episode, Space Gate World aka Carl.
You know, I look at stupid people and I think, "I could never be them... not after experimenting with a massive amount of mind-altering drugs over a long period of time."
But after seeing this movie, I was stupid... at least during the drive home.
It becomes down right hokey near the end when  (SPOILER WARNING)  the main character's father suffers a heart attack and is being rushed to the hospital and the young man is chasing after it...Then we have the zoo incident.
Winner of a record-setting 13 Genie Awards (Canada's "Oscar" equivalent), the film was the directorial dÃ©but for Jean-Claude Lauzon, who received a standing ovation at Cannes in 1987 after the picture's showing there, the audience obviously of the belief that there were more than enough artistically positive elements within it to counterbalance its patchwork plot.
As action begins, Marcel (Gilles Maheu) is being stripped of any dignity that he may have possessed by being forcibly sodomized within his prison cell, and soon after we watch him exit from the prison after completing a two year sentence for some type of narcotics violation.
Marcel returns to his apartment that he somehow has managed to retain during his absence and is immediately after visited by a pair of dishonest police detectives who demand $200,000 in cash that he "owes" to them and which he apparently has secreted in too cunning a manner for them to uncover.
The fact that it came out after Shcumaker's Batman & Robin, is a shame, due to the fact that this movie, an animated movie, blows the big screen movie out of the water.
After several delays and reshoots, the movie went straight to video after an aborted theatrical release.
There is vegetarian zombie that they keep around after.
after watching his zombie-mother be splattered by a Humvee one character remains in a rather jolly mood), and painfully clichÃ© stereotypes (the token "gangster" black guy wielding a makeshift bone saw-taped-to-a-broom scythe with ninja-like precision) defying the laws of physics.
There's plenty of gore but I honestly couldn't give a toss because I'd lost interest in the film after 30 minutes and just wanted to watch everyone die.
As an avid zombie film buff I feel sick to my stomach after watching an hour and a half of worthless film.
I knew it was going to be bad after a zombie scaled a hospital ceiling for no apparent reason other than being some type of crazy generation x zombie...not to mention zombies later on poking air conditioner ducts with crutches and floor sweepers (apparently not blessed with the gravity defying before mentioned wall crawling) in order to get at non zombie flesh crawling to safety.
Why in the world didn't he go after that punk rock band that was keeping him up all night?
And at the end, i don't know if this was a glitch of somekind like a bad transfer or something, but after he kills his ex girlfriend's new boyfriend, she begins to call for him because she doesn't know he's dead, and then the screen turns red for about 3 minutes and you can't see a damn thing.
You're appreciate it a lot more after seeing some of his 90's films.
It tries to be some funny silly comedy but I didn't laugh one time, the jokes are so dumb, maybe if you are like 5 years and under you will find it funny, anyway I didn't watch the whole thing, after about 20 minutes I wanted to rip my head off it so terrible...YUCK...  1/10
Boy, I never knew how bad a movie can be, but after watching about 20 minutes of this piece of s&%#t I do.
And, shortly after arriving, she naturally is severely injured and is dying.
This was a major disappointment, especially after the profound "La Vita e' Bella".
Nathan (David Leon) is the heartbroken teenager who accidentally kills himself after making the mistake of witnessing the love of his young teenage life, Jessica (Irish pop sensation, Samantha Mumba) in a compromising situation with his school's Lothario.
Things start to get a whole lot worse for him after last night's attack starts a chain reaction of killings, each spawning a much more vicious version of Nathan's condition.
The over the top gore (which was my whole reason for viewing) was good but the movie ended very quickly and after such a long set up I was a little disappointed.
I used to like Will Ferrell..but after this, I have my doubts about his quality.
The group that was watching this flick were all Ferrell and Reilly fans, but after 20 minutes most had left the room.
But after a few hours of letting the experience stew over in my mind, I find myself utterly unfulfilled.
It's like something you'd read out of a tabloid newspaper column after you've already read through everything worth reading.
I have enjoyed both men's comedic and dramatic talents in the past, but after their most recent effort together: Talledega Nights, a movie that was tiresome and largely unfunny, who thought it was a good idea to bring them back together?
It is small consolation that one of the egregious scenes in the movie takes place after the credits roll.
One supposedly funny situation after the next that the boys find themselves in, barely connecting to form a plot at all, let alone something overly funny.
Anyone wanting to see Knight Rider after Michael Knight should see Knight Rider 2000.
You know after the success of the first installment there was going to be a sequel.
It still feels funny and true after almost thirty years.
What I will say though is that as a teenager, on the first couple of viewings, I lost interest after Carol turns up instead of Dorothy to tell Gregory she's not coming.
Rex Reed gave it a zero and went after Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Caine, Susannah York and Margaret Leighton with a vengeance.
Twenty minutes after the credits roll, it's unlikely you'll remember anything about him.
Her fight with Christy Chung for example is extremely tasteless, as Lui imitates martial arts stances and goes through a bumbling slapstick routine, mere minutes after a young girl watched her mother machine gunned before her eyes.
So after seeing Lost Highway and finding it brilliant I wanted to see more of Lynch.
The deaths, when they do arrive, are uninspired, consisting of one tedious, unconvincing stabbing after another, leaving one longing for something a little more creative (is it too much to ask for our killer to make an effort?).
But it's all there, the bad 80s hair and outfits, actors that can't annunciate, and a killer that doesn't die, even after repeatedly being stabbed, punched, and hit with a shovel.
The money shot occurs when the murderer is coming after the sorority girls, falls two stories off a ladder, then is able to spontaneously crash through the window minutes later.
Given the fact that our Canadian population is 10% of the US population, I'm left in disbelieve, that my chance's are twice as high to become a victim of a mugging, shooting, robbery, fraud or whatever in a City let's say Toronto, after I had to fend for my life in Atlanta, where I got lost in city traffic: I had to evade carbage on the streets and duck behind my Cabriolet Steering wheel evading an angry mob throwing objects.
Buffula looked pretty grim to me, after I traveled through there.
Burned out buildings after an alleged Gangwar.
Yes, I lost money after the Morgage and Loan scandal too.
Because after all, different opinions are what makes America great, and Michaels Moores different opinion that different opinions are wrong is why he hates America and doesn't deserve his opinion.
I even felt, after the shop door incident, that he was trying to do a "Cops" episode.
I came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the "making of" interviews on the dvds.
Favourite bits - probably the little moments that you only spot after repeated viewings; when the teachers spot Gregory weaving across the empty playground when he's late for school - "does he think he's invisible?!
How is it that this alien species which has never experienced men have all the female bits that men lust after?
Sixty-some years after first seeing this movie as a child, I remembered only how cool I thought the bed in the wall was.
But, other scenes make it appear that the devil is after Faith herself.
Soon after she leaves Howard is killed by what appears to be a red light (don't ask).
programme and recognises him as the man he has been after for years.
Sterne agrees to look into Weiss's claims but eventually admits there is nothing he can do, especially after Weiss gives him some newspaper cuttings from 1944 which appear to show Olivier but since the paper is over 30 years old and Olivier would now be in his 60' or 70's and the guy on T.V.
The nightmare however does end , but only after you've suffered a wasted 70 or so mins of this mess .Fans of bad films will enjoy this , it could also be used as an example of how not to make a film .
I liked the idea that Elvis was expanding his range as an actor and maybe he might have done more westerns after this if Charro!
The special effects in this one might hold one's interest for five minutes or so, but after that, good luck!
Nice looking artistic girl after three years still suffering from the dead of his over-self-confident boyfriend, who was cheating on her with her best friend.
I first saw Gregory's Girl shortly after it was released, when I was an awkward and shy teenager myself.
The two warriors both die after the dragon spear gets lost and the good guy gives his blessing to a little baby he just left out in the desert nearby, perhaps to watch the battle and cheer him on.
Yeah, after sitting through 90 minutes of this, the joke's on me.
Next shot (this is after he passes out and people are surrounding him), he's on the ground clutching his chest.
What I enjoy about the film is that on the surface it may appear to lack depth but the depth is there if you want to find it and admirably Forsyth leaves profound moments like Madeline's words of wisdom understated and ,for me, only joyfully discovered after repeated viewing.
Scenes like where the old rich gal tells Baldwin to marry the hussy after Sarah got drunk at the elite high-societal gathering and made a twit of herself in front of everyone ... really rankled my chain.
So anyway I got the chance to watch this film last night and after seeing the trailer I basically presumed that it was going to be another one of those rom-coms.
After 2-5 minutes onwards the film the girl already met the guy and became close friends and after 10 minutes or so they kissed and slept with each other?!
Sarah Michelle Gellar does not help at all with her artificial performance.I have been a big fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer,and I think that there was a perfect combination of character and actress in there.But,on all the movies she has done after Buffy,she seems to be lost,like we can see on this movie.Besides,she does not have a good chemistry with Alec Baldwin.In summary,her weak performance damages the movie pretty much.
The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.But this is not a movie.Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC* with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music says "...I will pray".The thing is not about religion actually.But it ends up with this.How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.The lights are already shining on the truth.Its just that nobody wants to see it.
I first saw "Ceremony" after my friend and I rented it at Blockbuster.
I made the mistake of watching this disaster two days after watching The Passion of the Christ, arguably one of the most powerful religious films ever made, so when I saw Jesus with fangs in this movie I almost fell over backwards at the sheer, overwhelming dumbness of it all.
I saw this movie at a film festival when it first came out and, after skipping over it at the local library for the last nine months, finally borrowed it on loan to see what my younger roommate would think of it and to view it again myself, nearly a decade later.
From her scene walking in to the divey apartment "Fabulous" to her scene walking in to roommate Marc's bedroom after he first has sex to her nervous breakdown or crying during the "grand gesture" to the whole cluelessness of her New York existence - it just was about four feet too much over the top and ruined what little good there was in her character or her performance.
Likewise, that the nerdy nebbish (Woody Allen without the fixation on the adopted children of his mate) gay guy -- who, unfortunately for him, was ten years ahead of the gay geek hotness era we find ourselves in -- and in any event, hot gay geeks are not Broadway musical fans much less piano players, would be in love (in classic Hollywood romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s fashion) with the gay hunk best pal and, ultimately, the hunk would (for no reason at all, without any real basis, after turning him down because the neb was clearly not the hunk's type, and after lusting in love with a guy who's only real thing in common with the neb is that they both have a musical background?
Sure enuf, you "go see" and then, after 15 minutes, you just want to "go" period.
Nicolas Cage and airhead Sarah Jessica Parker headline this misguided slapstick as a long-standing couple who finally decide to tie the knot after years of hedging on his part.
If not, you will probably turn it off after a few minutes.
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath).
There is some entertainment to be found, but you may find after you finish this, you'll be in desperate need for something intelligent.
While there are adult characters in the film (most notably the coach, who is himself awkward and hardly authoritative), and while we meet Gregory's dad briefly, they come off as backdrop, and the overall impression is that this is like a live-action, Scottish, adolescent version of Charles Schulz's 'Peanuts' movies, where kids run about on their own seemingly at whim after school, but aren't necessarily concerned with being full of destructive mischief given that freedom.
If you watch it right after the first movie, you'll notice clearly that the CGI is a lot worse in returns.
This film ran on the Sundance Channel last night, and after watching less than ten minutes of it, i knew I was in the presence of yet another poorly written, embarrassingly acted piece of TLA crap.
There was no passion between any of the actors and the main thing i could not get to grips with was how everyone "fell in love" with someone else after seeing them for two seconds.
But of course there's a heavy-handed moral to the story after most of the running time has been used up basically showing a bunch of guys parading around naked, useless subplots that exist basically to show even more nudity and people spitting out laughably angsty dialogue (a part where one character compares love to 9 miles of intestines in the human body is about the worst attempt at "deep" dialogue I've ever heard).
This is exacerbated as the film goes along by the director's apparent refusal (in some sequences, at least) to move the camera in any way; I don't know if this was an attempt on his part to satirize the TV medium (given that it is, after all, a TV crew which impounds on the Baron's home ground) but I'd be surprised if the thought had occurred to the director in the first place.
Why not try your hand at an electric guitar, Herr BaronÂafter all, we're in the age of Chuck Berry here, aren't we?
First, in the prison, the (unseen) orchestra starts playing and Jolson sings verse after verse of "Why Can't You?"
In this 2-parter, David Jason plays the character of a old WWII seaman who is called in by the Navy when his submarine re-emerges after disappearing in the war.
You may ask?...well obviously it wouldn't be much of a drama if they just found it and put it in a maritime museum :p)   Anyway after the recent hype about the drama I did have high expectations but was disappointed.
I wouldn't attack the plot too much because after all it is called 'Ghostboat' and so you expect it to be a little far fetched/supernatural so that's fine BUT... at the end when the Navy and the Russian Navy (or whatever they're called in Russia) closed the case on the strange goings on, there was no mention of and never any mention of, all the other boats they blew up along the way...and as for the hostile German aircrafts...well I can only assume that they were imagined?
There were glaring anomalies in the story line and the original theory of how the sub had reappeared after being missing for forty-odd years was completely ignored at the end (apart from a brief display of mysterious lightning).
Immediately after insulting her by telling her that she's a packaged commodity being exploited by all of her p.c.
I came away with a bitter taste after having watched this, surely the actors read the script before even agreeing to appear in this film?
Gregory loses his position and is demoted to goalkeeper after the team lose eight games in a row; of his potential replacements, only Dorothy shows any talent, much to the disgust of the sexist games master Phil, who feels that the sport should be for boys only.
I would watch it again if it ever came on TV, Just so that I could make another judgment after all these years.
Were this the only film made in the 60s about the subject, perhaps it would have played better, but the late 60's and early 70's were jampacked with one movie after another about the same suburban ennui, and by comparison "The Arrangement" with its rather misogynistic undertones and off-puttingly distasteful protagonist, comes off as REALLY old-fashioned.
Poor Deborah Kerr is really wonderful as the wife, but she spends most of the film chasing after the disinterested Douglas.
His death is seen as the end to a certain kind of male prideÂafter seeing him smack around his wife and tear up the son's college application, death seemed like good riddance to me.
But after a while I got the impression she was just glorying in her martyrdom as the long suffering wife.
Douglas even knocks up his mistress Faye Dunaway and even after she gives birth and the child is thrown in her face, she won't leave him.
Even though I thought I knew all the funny bits after seeing it so many times, each viewing finds me laughing at things I hadn't noticed before, as well as at all the other bits that never seem to grow stale.
But despite a solid performance here, my sides remained unsplit after the opening episode.
The story is about a letter that is found in the first class airport lounge after an international flight has taken off.
In a nutshell, this film is one clichÃ© after another, but viewers might be able to feel the emotion and anger towards the characters, and that is what makes it a little more interesting.
Harrison Ford plays a slimy, self-absorbed lawyer whose life takes a drastic turn after he walks into a liquor store being robbed.
The one clever item was the deal with "Ritz" and trying to figure out for a moment how someone found Henry after he took off by himself.
Everything about this movie is one clichÃ© after another -- the overworked cop, the inattentive spouse, the "renegade cop," the manipulative shrink... oh, what a waste of time.
and the bit where Robert Stack promises to show Danny Bonaduce round his cockpit a few minutes after threatening to spank him.
And a beloved local landmark, be it a church, a park, a movie theater or high school hangout is being threaten with closure or is in shambles  7) the ending either consist of the person being captured by police in the case of the criminal, after saintly best friend turns him in.
And they all live happily ever after.
The following conversation took place in the men's restroom after the movie:  Me: "That was bad".
Luckily young master Ryan is able to get a few days off school to persuade the Russian Premier and the President of the United States that he knows better than either of them and after some jolly tense moments the President grits "Stand down to Defcon 3",thus earning young Jack a Gold Star.
Especially after 9/11, the Israelis are extremely careful about what goes on in their state.
Evil, after he experienced the convenient cinematic "crisis of concience".
It was only after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was discovered, and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse the situation(no pun intended).
It is primarily set after the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the nuclear arms race with the Russians, however it's also a prequel with a younger, cocky Jack Ryan (plug-in flavor of the month Ben Affleck) and with the principle villains being Nazis.
A character from "Clear and Present Danger", is almost adopted by John Clark after being rescued, and they work as partners.
and the bit where Robert Stack promises to show Danny Bonaduce round his cockpit a few minutes after threatening to spank him.
Someone got a decent idea to start with, but then they were lazy about every other aspect of the production after that point.
The main character 'Jake Sawyer' is so bland that all he seems to do in this movie is tattooing people and then following them to a club/party whatever to meet asshole after asshole after asshole, seriously nearly every person he meets is an asshole.
A gypsy girl who has recurring rape-nightmares of some nekkid guy on horse, comes to live and work for a rich, secluded, and sex-starved female artist after her previous female employer banishes her under mysterious circumstances.
Chico eventually joins the ladies at the house after some nonsense involving trampled flowers, lost necklaces, breech loading shotguns, 19th century figure painting, and the film's iconic dream image of the gypsy girl crouching inside a life-sized horse model.
In an idyllic Scottish village, poor collie dog Lassie fails at sheepherding because she's afraid of crossing through water; a crusty old doc inherits Lassie, but he doesn't much want her either, even after she warns him of a collapsed bridge down the road.
says the elderly woman slyly after Uncle Charlie introduces himself, and believe me, you will know every sundry detail of Uncle Charlie's hard knock life, even though it's probably better that you didn't.
*   Zoltan(named, I assume, after a Hungarian ruler in the 10th Century) isn't so much Dracula's hound as he is the hound of one of Dracula's servants, Veidt Schmidt.
Yet he has immortality and can regenerate after death, all while walking in daylight and not needing blood.
I mention this because it's odd for them to have done that, as it's clearly established later that the victims DIE after being drained of blood.
The characters may be boring and idiotic, but they speak in a natural manner(Michael's first thought after learning he's a Dracula is that he's going to get rich on royalties for all those movies).
Veidt and the dog, after dispatching the unlucky tomb guard, leave the crypt just as it conveniently collapses.
The film's intent is to get Branco and Drake together in an even more isolated cabin (no, nothing indecent is going on) so that they can be threatened by the pack of vampire dogs by moonlight (a full moon that never shrinks, even after about four nights!).
Afterward, we learn that the mother of our heroine died after she gave birth and the dad married the Evil Queen.
and the bit where Robert Stack promises to show Danny Bonaduce round his cockpit a few minutes after threatening to spank him.
Charlie Band, who ran Empire, called me the day after we wrapped and said he just read the script and it was too dark for his liking.
Soon after this incident Sister Gertrude senses Dr. Poirett is becoming suspicious and talks to the director (Daniele Dublino) of the hospital and convinces him to fire Dr. Poirett.
Unsurprisingly, the film is most memorable when it goes over-the-top Â such as the irate Ekberg crushing an old patient's dentures under her feet (with the latter expiring soon after!
Very sad, that people make the exact movie twice, with the same script, and that only a few years after the first one.
In addition to totally unfunny comic relief, the film suffers from the notion that the only way to hide the fact that Rodman is no actor is to throw over the top stunt after over the top stunt into the film--sort of like 4 or 5 James Bond movies' worth all shoved into one film.
Words cannot describe the feeling i had after watching it....total waste.
Its another one of those monstrosities that you have to force yourself to watch only so you can brag to your friends about how you were able to "watch the whole thing", and to see their shocked expressions after you say that.
Danny Bonaduce, one of the passengers, leaves a package in the boarding area and after he gets on the flight the package starts to smoke.
The location and the action are very good but the silly charactures spoil it, by trying to compete for the main role after "Simon".
after 5 mins, i realised that i had found a film even worse than Carnosaur.
Saving graces: sealed windows, i didn't rent the film but watched it on cable...though i am tempted to unsubscribe after this, and, finally, this "film" got my mind back on doing some out of work reading on the financial markets.
On TV they showed people leaving the cinema crying after watching this, I think I know why!
Seriously I`m certain he has because the sound mix after this scene is all over the place , when someone speaks the volume of their voice increases/decreases from shot to shot and there`s also plenty of scenes with obvious overdubbing , and not to mention bizarre background noises .
Pretty in Pink is basically a cinderella story with a laughably unbelievable ending, apparently re-shot after the studio reacted in fear to what was originally there.
Basically, in Hell's Kitchen, New York, after being blinded by a toxic waste chemical, which increases his other senses dramatically, young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) loses his father Jack (David Keith) to an unknown man dropping a rose.
The "dark" edge to this movie has such high gloss that viewers might need contacts after a sitting.
Wow this movie was a total head scratcher.Firstly I'd like to point out the cast is a bit off.Not only in who is in it but who the star is!And after watching this and checking all the names in the credits and checking here and yes googling it.You know what I have no idea at all!But it's not Carter Wong or Lau Ka Wen aka Chia Yung Liu aka Lau Kar Wing.It's the cop in Turkey yes Turkey who's a karate expert but no names in the credit fit?Anybody see this and have clue who he is?Anyhow the director of this movie is probably the worst part of it.The action is decent in fact some fight scenes are pretty good.However the story is choppy,the acting weak and the speedup of the final fight scene didn't help at all.Although I give it 9 out of 10 for location shoots!The director was intent on spicing this one up with romance and fun in the sun.And hey watch Bolo run run run!Actually there's too much running in this movie entirely.This really could have been a good movie if not for the director I think lol.Oh and don't miss Carter Wong's extended cameo in the lead role!
What makes it even more remarkable is just as the first punches are thrown Jaeckel senses something is wrong and follows his buddy into the bar, only arriving there after 10 minutes of non-stop head cracking action.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
The first time Claire sees the ghost in the bathtub, before Norman runs in after her scream, it takes what, 5 seconds for the whole tub to drain!
And what faucet do you know that will cut 80% of the water supply after only a quarter turn?
If that wouldn't work, how about just writing to Claire on the mirror after every shower each day??
Not to mention the confusing side crime story that I'm still attempting to decipher three hours after seeing the movie.
Also it leaves you with asking a lot more questions after the movie than before seeing the movie.
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DEAD GIRL, YOUR THE SICK ONE-- has got to be the funniest line that was not intended to be funny in the whole movie- I laughed, along with the rest of the theater, for about 2 minutes after that-- and then when the Voice Over comes on and its SCARElett's voice repeating it again, I just could not contain my laughter anymore!
Will the Black Dahila murder be solved, will the good guys prevail, will Josh Hartnett learn to act, will the scenery hold up after Aaron Echardt's chews threw the movie- acting docile one moment, then out of control in the next-- find out when you see the Black Dahlia.... on video of course, after your friend buys it.
However, after the introduction, my mind slowly turned to mush and my eyes de-focused.
The last time I checked, police revolvers hold six rounds, so unless Bleichert was planning to fight off one of them as he reloaded I can't imagine what he thought he would do after his sixth question.
As those movies go, after a few confrontations everyone works together to become champions.
It dares not stray from the tired but true progression of, "a small team of misfits is matched up with a reluctant savior, who inevitably leads the team to victory only after learning a valuable lesson."
I mean after all, haven't we ALL had someone come up to us and say, "It's the WORST motion picture I've ever seen?"
While I can't quite say that this is the worst horror film I've ever seen (after seeing literally thousands of them, that honor I give to "Rat Man" with "Beast in the Cellar" ranking a close runner up), it certainly does rank up there in the top bracket of lameness which I usually reserve for older films (for some reason I expect modern day direct-to-video horror movies to suck).
Here we get an endless 100 minutes of an unappealing actor trying to hide he's a psychopath (a character as supposedly smart as the woman in this movie should have been able to tell after her first conversation with him, but like the rest of the movie, she remains stone still with a concerned look on her face while he has any number of freak outs), mixed with clumsily directed murder scenes, and an ridiculously repetitive and drawn-out final twenty minutes.
Another classic part is when he tells the woman that he has "feelings" for her after 3 hours of knowing her.
), the late Michael Jeter, the late William Hickey who passed away shortly after this film wrapped and who's memory it is dedicated to in the end credits, and Vicki Lewis.
There was a simple recipe in the late 1980's early 1990's for the common action film:  Take one part flawed hero (preferably divorced, a heavy smoker and drinker), Mix in their defiance for authority figures, Add one part tragic family history (the loss of a child works best), Add corrupt politicians, Stir with mix of gratuitous violence set to a heavy electric guitar musical score, And serve with plenty of one-liners preferably after a death or tense moment has passed.
Now, Sylvia is the secretary and love object of Dr. Kessling, who is the man who is responsible for transporting the sarcophagus to a museum, and he also seems to have discovered the secret of its occupant, who manages to change places with an incoming professor and take his place, that is, after that particular poor soul is run over by a steam roller, egad.
A serial killer is going around slaughtering young blonde strippers and removing key body parts, after tattooing them with things supposedly from the bible as interpreted by someone who's never read it.
As for the movie itself, 65 years after it was made, and considering the social and political atmosphere of that day, it's hard to fault the writers or director for what was considered standard fare back then.
This film rotates around 3 young men, stranded on a strange island after their plane goes down.
Now I do NOT recommend people avoid his films--after all, throwing out his films would do a disservice to his talents and living in a 100% politically correct world where we cannot allow evidence of "incorrect thinking" is a scary prospect indeed.
He states repeatedly that a man who lives off his wife's earnings is no better than a rat, and after he's killed her he complains that since he's become a "man" once more it's entirely unfair to punish him for it!
And so the two kiss and live happily ever after!
OK I'm 15 and i saw this movie one night after band.................i thought it was the worst possible thing ever i mean i have seen SO....many movies because my family are movie freaks so ya.......There was no music thats was it sounded like all together, the scenes were god awful and the whole movie was all together fake looking and u can tell it basically looks like a slide show thats animated and was photo shopped it was a disaster.
The plot is basically a kid and his father move back to the town after the death of their mother/ex-wife, the kids makes friends with another kid who's dog dies and they bury it in the cemetery, well I think you know the rest.
The dog is then buried, a little later, freaky police officer turned into freakier police officer after being bit by a zombie dog... ooh... ah... scary... Not!
Why would Gus bury Clyde in the sacred burial ground after he killed him?
I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all.
This movie really sucked bad.It was just too much for me to believe that the beautiful young women would have sex with the oozing nasty owner for all the money in the world.She was so hot she could have found a much cleaner and less repulsive sugar daddy.The sets were lousy shots of tents and the Ferris wheel was shown over and over.There never seemed to be any people at the circus and all the workers just sat around slurping beer from bottles that somehow came with no labels on them.And the sound track was the most irritating soundtrack of any movie I've ever seen....one after another of bad fakey attempts to recreate old scratchy songs like they sounded on records made in the 20's and 30's.On and on these miserable songs went until I was nearly mad.
They devise a plan where Lucy seduces Lan, gets him to propose to her & then kill him off leaving her to inherit all of his money so she & Lee can live happily ever after, simple eh?
I will not ruin this awful movie for you, but I will let you know that I will NOT rent or buy anymore Asylum movies after this rip-off.
That's probably unfair, she's not bad and does bring a sense of panache to the role, but she raises a problem--why would the main character still be interested in his co-worker after getting a gander at Ms. Hurley's cleavage?
We never empathixe witth the bad guy and they don't stress enough that Spike is after the bounty.
From Ellyn Bache's novel about the feisty mother of seven boys, most of whom are now grown and out of the house, still worrying after them, concerned over their health and safety, which eventually puts a strain on her sanity.
Finally after trying for so long, i have watched this movie.
Example, Dewey Cox is in a hotel room living it up after his first taste of weed, he is on the phone with his wife.
However, after seeing it again I really found the film wasn't nearly as mediocre as I remembered(it was a lot worse)--especially in the way it created caricatures instead of real and believable people.
How could Mike Figgis, after creating a masterpiece like "Leaving Las Vegas" create something so disjointed with this movie?
The day after Wesley flies back home and his life changes...the most interesting part of the movie by the way as the dog smells something...!
Why did Dan always look angry - especially after his enlightenment - whenever he approached an apparatus?
Indeed, the gang is made up of members from nearly every different race (must not discriminate after all when it comes to male sleaze balls) and all the guys in the film who seem to be actually able to fight seem to also be totally ineffectual as males for the most part, wearing pink t-shirts or sweatshirts, doing aerobics and basically anything our leading lady Sandy asks them to do.
Sandy hires a new guy (Sam) to help out at her place and after the attack finds out he knows martial arts (umm i guess you can call it that).
You should be able to pick up the rest of the film, he teaches her and then they go after the gang.
No doubt if that's the first film of the set you watch you'll be disappointed, but if you watch it (like me) after such atrocities as "Death Run To Istanbul" or "Flight To Danger" it seems comparatively better.
Granted, they are doing stupid and idiotic things on purpose, but after finding out that they were lying to each other, all is forgiven!
Thank god I wasn't watching this with a rug rat cause I could turn it off, which I did after about 45 minutes.
"The Great Northfield,Minnesota Raid" is a Revisionist Western(a genre popular just after the Sixties),and is greatly at variance with the true facts surrounding the event.However, for 91 minutes of escapist diversion - it will fit the bill nicely.
Yet the Hollywood system somehow works to keep this Cleopatra's barge afloat, long after it should have run aground.
Maybe we're supposed to remember here that Liz Montgomery also played Lizzie Borden in a TV movie several years after Bewitched tanked and she was renovating her image as a Now woman.
Not surprisingly, the volcano does blow, and Gilmore along with a host of others escape to higher ground after crossing a rugged obstacle course.
Well if you witness this cinematic monstrosity, you will see existing proof that bad disaster movies were indeed churned out after "The Swarm".
What I find most extraordinary is how these veteran actors couldn't see this bad career move they were about to get themselves into after reading the script.
Olivia De Havilland admits that she only signed on to "The Swarm" after her good friend Henry Fonda joined the project.
One of the most hilarious scenes actually happens in the town after the volcano erupts.
Three years after their reasonably entertaining version of H. Rider Haggard's classic adventure 'She', Hammer Studios produced a sequel, 'The Vengeance of She'.
Saddled with these two uninspiring main actors, the film further digs its own grave by having all the characters from the lost city speak line after line of the most dire mumbo-jumbo imaginable.
Unfortunately after a strong start the film has a very saggy middle, turning into a second rate Raiders of the Lost Ark wannabe.
Here's the biggest example of what I mean:   The whole freaking premise of the story is that Michelle Yeoh and company have been trained generation after generation to be super-acrobats so that they will be THE ONLY ONES able to perform the near-impossible series of acrobatic feats necessary to get to the secret magical medallion.
But wouldn't you know, there appears an unscrupulous nasty guy Karl (Richard Roxburgh, a fine Australian actor out of Moulin Rouge, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Oscar and Lucinda, etc) who causes no end of problems at the site and initiates the reason for making this film: an extended martial arts dance on pillars above a CGI fire in the tomb - a place where nearly everyone in the cast is cremated after gallant swinging and flying!
Perhaps most disappointing were the performances of the two lead characters, who after promising roles in "Crouching Tiger" and "Birthday Girl" seemed to have settled for whatever script was tossed their way.
No, Jack Arnold made this film right after all the aforementioned winners; in the year 1958.
"No, I've got a better idea..."  Then after adding about 100 swear words and tons of gore we got Rockstars Manhunt.
Stockwell was a young teenager and after such films as "Gentleman's Agreement," and "Keys of the Kingdom," he deserved far better.
One of the problems is that the original "Dracula" with Bela Lugosi was so perfect in its thingness that, after only a few viewings, it's practically a self parody.
Brooks revisits classic horror territory after Young Frankenstein; this time itÂ´s Dracula who gets the Brooks treatment, but this poor spoof is evidence that lightning doesnÂ´t strike twice.
Young Frankenstein still holds up after 30 years.
I saw "Mr. Goodbar" at a film festival screening, several years after it's initial release.
i had to write this after having viewed no more than 15.5 minutes of this.
Supposedly based on this Paganini document, the band produce a new (and equally awful) song, and decide to make a video-clip in Paganini's old mansion - The mansion in which the famous violin virtuoso had once signed a pact with the devil... Sound cheesy, and it is, but not only is it very, very dumb cheese, even though the film is only 80 minutes long, the temptation to fast-forward becomes bigger with each passing minute after a while.
It's not a surprise that Luigi Cozzi, after this movie, never shot a film again (except for two documentaries).
The script seemed to have been written on a chalkboard - interchanging cliche after cliche though lacking a satirical or retroactive temperament.
Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe.
The young woman travels to a graveyard and is killed not long after by a figure dressed in a monk cloak.
But, the story takes a turn for the worse soon after.
As is the case with this type of movie, the youngsters very quickly forget about their comrades after they've been killed.
The characters are generally annoying or boring, there is absolutely no suspense after the beginning, and the movie is not even funny in the so-bad-its-good way either.
And here is one of my two rejects, "One of Them", some low budget ca-ca about some teens that were on their way to see where one of them grew up and crash after a bug invasion.
Called one of the most "disturbing" screen-shots in ALL of cinema history - that's right, not "Lifetime" history - CINEMA history, the famous "Luminol" scene will stay with you long after the movie is over.
The beginning of the story is absolutely confused, without any previous development of the characters or situations, and only after fifteen minutes running time it is possible to begin to understand the plot.
Is there life after Friends?
This movie's script is terrible (cliche after cliche), and it's doubtful that even appropriate actors could have rescued it.
I sure hope Menjou's constituents were watching this movie and sent him packing post haste after the next election.
The show returns after the break to see the broker as a self-appointed King.
Why not just start off after the movie like those other series?
It also showed what families go threw when fighting for a child where a husband has killed his wife and tries to get custody after he has done a horrible crime.
Shortly after this the film bogs down and begins to drag.
Sonny Landham plays a man who is locked up in an asylum after he leaves five people in the desert to die as his way of winning an argument.
And, the more serious problem is that although the people are exposed to the elements in the desert, they seem amazingly healthy even after many days there.
Of course he was tried and committed by white folk so therefore when he escapes he goes after them, and takes them out to the desert for...either tribal justice or revenge, you can decide.
I very much wanted to believe I had found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes!
Maybe that's okay & maybe that's what you're after, but I was looking to be entertained and during this movie it simply did not happen.
Can I ever trust IMDb user reviews again, after seeing an average score of 7.7 for this most awful of movies?
And can I ever enjoy listening to PHC on the radio again, after suffering through the two most tedious hours I have ever spent in a movie theater?
I sought out this movie after reading many glowing reviews on IMDb.
Big Monster on Campus is set ion Los Angeles where smart science student Frank Stein (Matthew Lawrence) has ideas about bringing the dead back to life, while at a party local nerd Karl O'Reilly (Ryan Reynolds) is confronted by cool high school dudes Lance (Justin Walker) & Tuttle (Christian Payne) & after an accident Karl ends up dead at the bottom of a swimming pool.
I had to apologize to her after making her watch this.
Mr Todd is the famous barber that chops up people into hamburger after slitting their throats and selling said hamburg to a local meat pie shoppe.Some of the sets and street scenes seem solid and true to the period but the whole mess is overall (forgive me) ham-handed.
Virginal innocent Indri finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless pimp MG. Indri winds up incarcerated in MG's private prison after she refuses to make love to him.
They should have stopped after part 2 - no more craziness.
I think the only reason people sat through the entire movie was because there was a Q&A session after the film with Dame Dash and Kevin Hart.
I don't think anyone even asked about this film...people mentioned the Woodsmen more than this mock-umentary...The only time it was mentioned was because the events in the film actually happened after filming them....
The family is making their way home after a trip when their minivan falls under the glare of a bright light..
The family wakes up some time after, not remembering what had transpired, but later suffers from nightmares, alluding to alien abduction.
Soon after some mysterious men in black pay them a visit and questions them.
Near the end, after the battle with the aliens at Stockwell's home, the family and Stockwell leave in Stockwell's car.
Cheesey family, bisquick-filled villains, horrible dialogue, even worse acting, cliche after awful cliche, large plot holes, non-attention to some details, over-emphasis of other details....  ~Avoid~ this movie, unless you want a good laugh and/or are in the mood to MST.
Cinematographer Carlo Di Palma did his best to make the house look interesting, but that yellow and orange lighting scheme became oppressive after a while, and I was longing to step outside and see some daylight.
He cheats on her, has several affairs, and when she returns from Acapulco after the honeymoon, she has already been physically abused.
Diane was originally played Maureen O'Sullivan (Farrow's real-life mother), Howard by Charles Durning and Waterston was only the third choice for Peter after Christopher Walken and Sam Shepard.
In the end nothing happens, we find ourselves after an hour and a half of murky bore at an abrupt end that took us nowhere.
Then the "drump-drump-drump" sound when the mad man was coming after a victim just got on your nerves.
But a hallucination would be an even bigger cheat - because the audience sees an actual transformation after Edward is unconscious.
Not only could a child still in the womb predict the outcome of this movie after only watching 10 minutes but the last half of the movie was just one big gun scene.
She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his.
The documentary looks at the impact PLAN 9 has had on our culture, and the events that led to its "re-discovery" years after its rather uneventful debut at movie theaters and drive-ins.
For a few seconds in the Ciro's scene after Darren McGavin gets a phone call, it looked like, maybe... this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film.
When the title came up on the screen, it actually had an exclamation point after it... CENTIPEDE!
If you think their daytime programming is awful, you should check out what they wait until after midnight to air.
I went to the cinema to see this one, but I left after almost an hour.
I learned my lesson after watching Orient Express and I did't stay for the whole thing again.
Sergiu Nicolaiescu should have just remained silent after '89.
Director should retire after this movie even a foreign director can do a better movie about the Romanian so called revolution.
Today, after eighteen long years, Elwood Blues has finally paid his debt to society and was being released from prison.
Unbeknownst to them, the Illinois state police and the Russian mafia were after them.
Now it seems that they will get married after all, but who knows?
I know - it's so sorry to comment a series after it's of the air for like 10 years, but I have decided last week I will give it a try for two or three episodes, and I didn't make it...
This is to help reform her after a fire-starting incident involving Heather and an evidently irksome forest close to home.
The way this show presents it, you're only a nice person if you believe in a personal god, NEVER touch alcohol, NEVER swear, NEVER smoke, and --of course- have sex only after you marry.
I grew up missing later seasons after Mary went to Buffalo to be with her grandparents.
I mean, I agree with the main point of the reviews, that is to say the extraordinary performance of Hannelore Elsner as the main character, a leninistic writer, smoke- and sleeping pills-addicted, who just after the fall of the wall decides to leave the capitalistic Federal Republic of Germany and to move to the socialistic East Berlin.
The accomplice appears in the middle of the forest soon after with a bandage on his head, as it appears that he planted first aid kits in the wilderness .
One of the abusive guys gets strung up by rope after he attacks a woman, and attacked with huge shears and a sledgehammer.
Otherwise, if you're easily offended, avoid at all costs or else you will die of a heart attack after the first 10 seconds of the film.
Promising start, but after that initial scene, this film decides it's a junior high school production, and degenerates into unbridled silliness.
Military grunts come in talking all big and bad about how they'll blow this thing to smithereens, then run like little girls after it starts ripping them to shreds.
they never got as seriously type-cast as Stanwyck did after her best known villain role.
But after that film's success the three stars had different trajectories.
Jack Overton decided their marriage after ten years was becoming boring and wanted a divorce.
This is a miserable, squalid movie about miserable squalid characters - even the minor characters, even those who only get one scene, even those who only get one scene and don't even TALK - and the story is one damned miserable squalid thing after another.
At first the doctor sees no reason to pay her at all; after a while, he offers a token payment of "a few shillings" a week.
And who's the woman Harmon is going after?
I had the opportunity to meet with Jane Fonda soon after I was released.
This is the type of film where, after nearly an hour of playtime, someone walks through the screen and you wonder: "Wait, who's he again?".
I mean how DID he work that out 75 years after the event?
Why, after going to all that effort, they didn't manage shoehorn in a small kitchen somewhere is beyond me but if they had, the crew wouldn't have got to drink great Science Fiction Chocolate Flavoured Smoothies for the whole trip.
But after a few moments I came to the realization it wasn't.
Yes, my beloved WETA, who impressed me throughout the years but completely stole my heart after the masterful rendering of all things Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
Maybe someday, someone will make a film about how McG got $200 million to make two movies after directing a couple of popular music videos.
There was too much obvious work in front of the blue screen and the situations were so preposterous that I eventually gave up on the film after enduring too much of a particularly ridiculous chase.
In the incredibly predictable and crappy end they save the day and they all give us a constipated smile to suggest that they live happily ever after.
He threatens to blow up the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a dud, and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated.
One thing I can't really comprehend is that how they dared to shoot such film after GORA.
That movie was the second worst thing happened to Turkish image after 'Midnight Express'.
The director (Kartal Tibet) should not feel comfortable after this movie.
Quarter a century after that was released ,we get a sequel -"Dunyayi Kurtaran Adamin oglu" (Son of the man who saves the world).
She was not dedicated to her fans, (it was even written in the Amarillo Globe News the day after).
The low point of the movie comes your way during a hospital scene - our hero "re-loads" her energies with the help of a new-born which happens to be the product of a Serb having raped a Bosnian after which she abandoned the child.
We're half an hour into the film before she has a line of dialog -- and not many after that.
she is swearing and lots of dumb people laughing her.this is not a comedy,not even a black comedy.i could resist the disgusting jokes only for 8 minutes.nobody can laugh that jokes unless he is idiot.i have doubt about Americans after this show.they gave high points for this show.if they liked it they must have problems in their mind.i can not believe that people pay for this disgusting show.it does not worth a penny..i looked its rating before getting it,but i am very disappointed.this is the worst show i have ever seen.
They were basically modeled after every 1930's gangster flick you could name.
Well newsflash guys, Connery has always been overrated and finally after a decade of godawful films people are finally noticing.
"The Woods" is the story of a teenage girl taken to a private school by her parents after showing signs of criminal behavior (starting fires).
In for a penny in for a pound, after all... That would of course eliminate your 'lone man in search of justice' angle, but at least it would make more sense, instead of feeling like a dupe, which unfortunately seems to be the practice of the whole tale.
'One Good Cop' is the story of a New York narcotics agent (Michael Keaton) who takes revenge on the city's most powerful drug dealer after his partner of eight years (Anthony LaPaglia) was shot and killed by some goon who was high on the dealer's supply.
You'd think once a powerful drug dealer felt even the least bit threatened by one narcotic agent working alone (he didn't even seem to be a cop with heavy connections and influence), then he would immediately send out his goons after this guy and family.
Yet this potentially moving and engaging stuff *is* just padding, stuck in between very occasional action scenes as long, loooonnnnnggg vignettes which are then either just left behind or just magically resolved: e.g., after 20 minutes of closeup on the oldest girl's first 48 hours of stages-of-grieving, we jumpcut to some action, and she is just next - and last - seen frolicking off on a tricycle at her new home, daddy's loss just no longer to be at issue, and the part just as suddenly becomes an 'extra'.
Set in 1965, "The Woods" is the story of Heather Fasulo (Agnes Bruckner), a young and troubled teenage girl who is sent to an isolated private school for girls by her parents after her failed attempt to burn her house.
As she gets used to her new school, she begins to experience strange supernatural events after strangely, she is granted a scholarship by the headmistress, Ms. Traverse (Patricia Clarkson).
I preferred the remake which wasn't the best film in the word, but its a better film than this, the action scene's are better executed maybe because it was made 30 odd years after its predecessor, and the way action sequence's are more doable with CGI and other advances in film making.
The police just manage to tag one police car after the three minis, and maybe a motorcycle.
Even after all these years, Magical Mystery Tour still ranks as one of the worst I've ever sat through.
I won't gush on about how groundbreaking the Beatles were time after time (again, you already knew that).
I nicknamed him razor, after the bad guy in Need for Speed most wanted, cause that's how i'm reminded of him.
They get bookings and do shows, and eventually cross paths with a wanna-be performer, hat check girl Vicky (Marilyn Monroe) who, after Tim falls hard for her, gets her big break and begins her rise to fame.
The one believable aspect of the film is the casting of Merman as a Vaudeville star; and after seeing her `act,' there is no longer any mystery as to what killed Vaudeville.
I can't explain how disappointed i was after watching this "thing".
- the ambassador initially wants to get to the UN, so they have studied us a bit after all (never mind not understanding our concept of military).
Along with her adopted son Jacob (Jaden Smith), the group attempts to try and stop the impending destruction, while the government chases after them.
The plot may sound interesting, but after Klaatu makes it clear what his purpose is, the movie becomes a downgraded half-assed chase movie that is more boring than it is thrilling.
True, it is not completely abysmal like , say , the day after tomorrow, and has at times decent acting.
The fact we are supposed to accept that after planning to wipe out human kind for many years, one alien changes his mind after seeing an upset child and step-mum, is absurd!
But after that thirty minute mark I realized that the movie was going nowhere.
Modern audiences, after all, are very little effected by the Cold War anymore.
Later we learned that the Globes were all over the planet, and they were the 'ARK' that was saving stuff to be used after the world was 'cleansed'.
The screenplay clearly went through arbitrary rewrites, perhaps after being focus-grouped to death, and shows not a single breath of imagination.
I don't know about the earth standing still but I certainly had a hard time moving after this one finished.
In 1965, after provoking a fire in a forest, the rebel teenager Heather Fasulo (Agnes Bruckner) is sent to the boarding school Falburn Academy in the middle of the woods by her estranged mother Alice Fasulo (Emma Campbell) and her neglected father Joe Fasulo (Bruce Campbell).
And after half an hour of the same stuff you become pretty tolerant of the gore and blood onscreen.
And after half an hour of the same stuff you become pretty tolerant of the gore and blood on screen.
Of course, such metaphysical feats of interpretation are intended to add an air of spiritual legitimacy to White's music: the film, after all, is a search for the world described in White's first album, "Wrong-Eyed Jesus."
I'm thinking the location scout for this film is the same guy that finds people to interview right after a tornado in the Mid-West.
I'd been awaiting this film's release for over a year now, and finally, after a bunch of problems with editing and whatnot, this movie got a DVD release.
"The Woods" tells the story of a troubled girl named Heather (Agnes Bruckner), who is sent to a secluded private girls school in 1965 by her estranged parents after causing problems and lighting a tree on fire in their back yard.
Basically Daniel 'Dan' O'Grady (Shay Duffin) has returned to America from Ireland after stealing 100 pieces of gold from the magical and nasty Leprechaun (Warwick Davis), but he manages to trap him in a crate covered with a four-leafed clover before having a stroke.
Slowly the Leprechaun starts to show up more spooking everyone, until they all know that there is a scary creature after them.
So after some chases and trappings, they get time to search for this clover in a big patch, and luckily find it, just when Leprechaun has got his gold and realised one coin is missing.
When Dan O'Grady returns to the U.S. after stealing some Irish leprechaun's pot of gold, he thinks he can settle down and enjoy his newfound wealth.
i don't have an opinion about jackson in the issues raised on this document, since i can assure you I DON'T THINK I REALLY KNOW michael jackson after seeing this document.
I guess MJ chose Bashir after his fame-chasing interview with Lady Di had hit such heights (did we really want to hear that the future King and Queen of England were both unfaithful to each other).
This becomes very, very annoying, and one might even begin to feel embarrassed for ever having believed that Jackson's nose was indeed made of plastic, or that he slept in oxygen chambers...  Do yourself a favour: after watching this TV movie, it is absolutely necessary to watch "The truth about Michael Jackson", in which you'll see the footage Bashir never showed, in which he for instance praises Jackson's parenting skills.
The film takes place in 1965, and focuses on central character Heather Fasulo - a girl sent to a an all-girl boarding school by her parents after she decided to burn down their house.
And the plot, well after ten minutes anyone can see how the movie is going to end.
Even though part two came out five years after the original, we're supposed to not notice that the actors look a lot older and wear their hair in completely different styles.
And for those who must know, yes, I was named after the Biff Brannon character, so maybe I'm a little bit biased in my review.
Just one dumb idea after another.
I didn't get this movie, even after the end.
She is tortured and soon becomes brainwashed into believeing the fact that her father does not care if she is missing even after viewing news coverage about him looking for her and offering a reward for her return.
Unfortunately, all of the characters are so boring that after a while you stop caring who's doing what to whom.
Director Andrew V. McLaglen, good in the 1960s at marrying action-adventure and comedy, seems lost playing to a grittier '70s sensibility, and with a script that presents the mercenaries with one bloody setback after another.
A message of racial brotherhood is advanced by Ntshona and Kruger with some jaw-droppingly bad dialogue, as Kruger's South African character, Coetze, drops his deep-rooted racism after a few minutes of carrying Limbani on his back.
Things don't exactly purr along for the mercenaries after that, but even the complications feel forced and unnatural.
When it wrapped up, I heard the music that indicated to me the film was ending, and I laughed harder than I did for any part of the movie because after all that going on and on and going nowhere, it ended with the result of: STILL having gone nowhere!
Occasionally one of these films, such as "French Quarter" which rated far more highly than most, has remained memorable long after it has disappeared from cinemas and video rental libraries; but most B movies had approximately the same relationship to major film releases as pulp paperback fiction has to the novels of Galsworthy, Ibsen or Tolstoy - and all have an important role to play.
A few of them are exceptions, taking care to retain an interesting story line without demanding too much attention from somebody relaxing after a hard day.
I suppose longing for a simple and sweet melancholy resolution and being left with an unsettled feeling was what Carson McCullers may have been after.
Later, she tells him basically that he acts more white than white people do after he refuses to help her husband out of a disastrous situation that results in catastrophe.
In a park, after a slaughter, a black woman survives and becomes the main witness against Christian.
(This attestation coming moments after witnessing the construction of a Las Vegas home with two (count em) washing machines and dryers is vaguely disconcerting.)
I actually didn't get to watch this film until 2009, about 2-1/2 years after its release and now the current economic troubles only serve to marginalize this film and its Republican bashing tone.
It wants so desperately to blame Republicans for the credit problems of ordinary Americans but time has proved that it wasn't until after the Democrats took over (soon after this film's theatrical release) that the economy and credit problems reached Armageddon status.
I watched this movie today and decided to look it up on IMDb after to see what rating it was given.
Take for example the scene where star John Clay is grilled by a policeman after bringing someone to the hospital.
Made myself some microwave popcorn in anticipation of watching this movie after seeing the 7.9 score.
As a result I stopped watching this after 20 minutes, I couldn't bear it anymore.
Thirty years after first seeing this movie, it still stands up, and still touches my heart in a way few movies have.
I wanted her to have a very, very unhappy ever after.
The story is not intricate, but the movie is so slow that one finds it difficult to follow... Bullitt gets off the taxi, taking all the due time; then he calmly walks toward the parking area; he opens the door of a car; after a while, he shuts the door of the car; he broods over something for another long while (there's no hurry!
Instead of mystery, clues, police procedure, shoot-outs and problem-solving we're treated to scene after scene of...not much.
It doesn't change after this half hour, it just gets old really fast and I get the feeling that it's not moving forward.
I thought, after watching the movie preview, that it would as good as the manga was, or at least fun.
I've been a fan death note after the watching the 1st series of Anime; and I started reading the manga because the anime wasn't coming out fast enough.
Hopefully the director was able to get his job back at the bottle-capping factory after the shoot.
i first heard of the film years ago, lots of hype about it being a great little indie zombie film (i am a huge huge fan of the genre), then when i eventually got hold of a copy it was well packaged and the cover looked good......after the opening sentence i had already made up my mind that this film was complete and utter tripe but i still gave the movie a chance.
The major characters are named after famous horror directors like Raimi, Romero, Carpenter, etc.
And it's not just the fact that the "film" is to the most part incredibly dull: it's supposed to be like an indirect "homage" to Romero's zombie trilogy and other horror-movie greats; hence the rather trite "idea" of naming the idiot characters after real-life directors, actors, or horror-film characters.
I may be a tad harsh, after all these types of horror movie aren't meant to be serious, but that's the rub, I think Bookwalter is so convinced that he was making a classic that he, and the large cast could not see that he couldn't handle the scope and the end result is so bad it's bad.
Composed by Dave Grusin the theme sends a chill into my psyche when I hear it years after viewing the movie.
The Venona Papers (opened after the fall of the Soviet Union) have confirmed without a doubt that the Rosenbergs were not only traitors giving the Russians America's atomic secrets, they also showed that the Rosenbergs were hard-core ideologues who felt their mission was more important than theirs or other people's lives.
David Twohy does an okay job of directing but I'm surprised how he could have messed up this one after doing a good job on the original.
- after seeing it twice, I still can't figure that one out.
The movie drops you right into the middle of this mess - I suppose that it was meant to be an intriguing way to start the movie but after the first 30 minutes you'll still be scratching your head trying to figure what the heck's going on.
From the side, the back, the front... those goggles are so important that a prison guard at one point tells Riddick that he's going to keep them after Riddick dies.
All she does, scene after scene, is roll up her eyes and say something she thinks is clever and-or funny.
The movie is wall to wall sex and after a while it stops being a Women in prison movie and just becomes a softcore (slightly hardcore) porno.
He hasn't any doubts about the INADEQUACY of the religion teacher and about the ADEQUACY of his twopenny halfpenny dialectics because what really matters, according to the script, is to strike blindly at everything concerning the religious element, especially at the issue of sainthood, without any pause for breath, without any alternative voice, profiting by every occasion to deny the existence of life after death.
(IMDB is BIG) But the guy needs some critisism after spending all that money in this Swedish/ Danish/ Norweigian co-production.
The beginning is quite clear and obvious the importance of the diary to the character of Thymian, but not only does it not sustain its direct duty to bring her some form of closure, revelation, or salvation, it also simply disappears after a certain point and is never heard of again.
If you still insist on watching it after reading this, make sure you take a gravol!
One of the Blues Brothers could have had a homocidal ex-fiancee after him, etc.
You get used to the not so hot animation after the first few minutes.
that comes right after hepatic shutdown, and just before irreversible coma.
I had some pretty good picks at RedBox (The Host, Abandoned)but after seeing this stink bomb, I began to have my doubts that someone was a sleep at the wheel.
Glad to see he's still working after turning out a clunker like this.
Most of what occurs on screen is unintentionally funny; as an example, check out how Gary Lockwood throws his hair back after any scene in which it might have gotten mussed up a bit.
I only paid a buck to see this (it's a reissue from Digiview Productions) and I watched with a couple of glasses of nice wine late one night after everyone else had gone to bed, but I wasn't sleepy...I was looking for a time-killer, and that's what I got.
Unfortunately, the movie dribbles on for a few more unnecessary minutes after that.
This movie was rated R back in 1977 and after viewing it, I have yet to find out why.
Leslie Neilsen sounds like a boxer being interviewed after a bout where he was unable to find a neutral corner.
Similarly he is hit with a full fire extinguisher once on the head and twice on the back which downs him only to spring to life shortly after.
I'm still reeling from the experience of watching this piece of garbage and I think I'm permanently brain damaged after being exposed to it.
Anyway, I'm off track... this movie is pure crap.. not even one of those "watch with your friends after some herbal refreshment" movies... Everything from the recycled (and butchered) storyline of terrorists on a sub, where every possible cliche is used (and screwed up) to the awful performances, to the terrifyingly bad dialogue.
There is one saving grace though, after watching the performances in this stinker, you'll be appreciating the master thespianism that is one Jean Claude Van Damme.
If he'd been honest, he would have added, `And not much will happen after that, either, so if you're thinking of walking out, cut your losses and do so NOW.'
If you want to see just how badly Hollywood was floundering in the 'sixties, by all means watch this movie - but you'll probably decide that you didn't really want to know, after all.
What I see is someone who is trying to buildup a reputation in the industry as legit, after coming from an industry where the mainstream population is going shun you.
Piling car chase after fistfight after senseless killing on top of each other will not guarantee a thriller.
It reminded me of a home movie gummed together by my aunt Flo after a drunken and diurretic trip to Mexico.
As it turns out the attacker is also ostensibly rather thick as, after being given a quick pasting, he reveals that the reason for his decidedly anti-sociable behaviour was that he had in fact resorted to a spot of DIY justice in response to the rape of a number of women down the alley in question.
A woman must put her life back together while chasing after a homicidal killer clown murders her son in this excruciatingly bad exercise in tedium masquerading as a horror film.
The movie started out a bit promising but sank after the opening scene.
Mother hoisting that diary at her son who doesn't want to read it right after the father dies.
Even after she realizes that Ann-Margret duped her and is going to seriously hurt her career, Ms. Helgenberger continues to work towards finding the truth.
A sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny, and these days you won't even be able to go to a Berni Inn in your Austin Maxi to refresh your jaded palate after watching.
It was precisely these films which inspired the younger generation of Italian filmmakers to revolt against and create the neo-realism revolution after the war.
We didn't do anything' surely the second most used line in films after 'Let's get outa here...'
(this is my first IMDB comment BTW, after using this site for years)  I found this movie the worst movie I've seen in a while (I've gotten good at avoiding them).
Perhaps I'd read one too many okay reviews, but I had such high hopes for this after High Art, that I found it a little, well, disappointing.
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
DEADTIME STORIES was released a few years after the release of George A. Romero's CREEPSHOW.
Scene after scene of Audie trying to pull it together, and it can only end one way.
Since then I tried hard to get any possible copy of it and now it is available on DVD... now, after 20 years, I think this is truly one of the silliest martial art flicks I've ever seen - and I've seen tons of them.
Truly recommended as a pure fun movie which value is in stupid dub, silly dialogs, trashy look, great action with obvious usage of dummies and wires... And after 20 years it just got better than the first time I watched it!
But, after performing his act, fate arrange things for an instant click between Rocco and Alicia.
Then, after some events that involves a small robbery and a video tape with scenes from a previous encounter between Ana and FabiÃ¡n, both girls have to go after Rocco but with different intentions: while Alicia tries to find him to make up her mind about the marriage, Ana tries to recover the tape so Alicia won't find out.
It seemed to follow a pre-made formula of music montage after music montage inter cut with short scenes of dramatic acting, as if the director was following a manual of how to make a musician's biopic film.
Also the use of fancy, rapid editing was way overused and after a while seemed only there to give it a sophisticated look.
Poorly filmed, the set ups are almost basic and unimaginative, and the scenes of New York and elsewhere were clearly filmed decades after the events take place (Marc Anthony's character had been dead over ten years when Andrew Lloyd Webber's woman in White played the Marriot Marquis.)
I am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release.
Just one meaningless, inscrutable scene after another.
he has to convince the girl to go tamely to her execution, which after spending some time with her boyfriend she decides would be a good thing.
It's just that after watching films like 'Hobgoblins' and that pumaman nonsense this doesn't seem that bad.
I felt like vomiting after seeing this movie.
Try 'Persuasion' instead, and after that ANY of the other contemporary Austen adaptations.
Having it all just work out fine after all seemed very contrived.
After a particularly traumatic incident at work,he takes the day after off to recuperate.
This is instantly forgettable stuff and I can't see it having much rewatchability value in the future...especially since Bela Lugosi turns out to be a good guy after all!
In a plot patterned after 1940's "Boys of the City"; Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), Ernest "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison (as Scruno), Donald Haines (as Skinny), and David Gorcey (as Peewee) slip away to a spooky old country estate, after getting in trouble with the law.
The kids are stuck in Lugosi's creepy house, and basically silly situation after silly situation transpires, without any logic or reasoning building up to a ridiculous conclusion that, if you were casually paying attention, you could have easily picked up from the start.
Growing old, as they say, is not for sissies and this film shows how much effort goes into just keeping a simple romantic relationship aflame after a certain age.
Well suitable for a film which had 'Beer is life' for a motto :-) Thinking back to that memorable evening at the International Filmfestival Rotterdam, where Chris Doyle himself treated everyone who was left in the audience after the screening of 'Away with words', to a beer.
I must admit the after screening Q&A made up for the fact that I found the film totally unintelligible.
We start this story after the end of the first Snow White.
In one instance, after the landing party hears a woman's scream, Kirk orders everyone to 'fan out!'
Spock, McCoy and everyone in the dozen science labs aboard the starship can't figure out a way to damage these alien suckers after hours of testing, despite being given a great clue by way of the sun; then Kirk idly latches on to a way at the last minute - maybe he was the only one being objective?
It's not much - Sam Kirk's only appearance is as a corpse and Kirk's sister-in-law dies soon after.
The content become contrived and predictable after a while.
Right from the laughable intro motel scene to the final idiotic comment by deMornay this film will either immensely aggravate you or have you rolling in laughter as you watch scene after scene of idiocy and pure unadulterated garbage.
This film was recommended to me by a friend or (ex-friend as he has become to be known after this movie,)and I had high hopes for it, with stars such as rip torn and James Earl Jones.
She actually made three new films after "A Night To Dismember" was released on DVD.
Daniel Bernhardt stars as Alex Cardo, a thief who learns how to fight after he is sent to prison, seems he is in prison due to him trying to steal a sacred sword, however now trained in the arts of martial, he sets up to redeem himself in the kumite.
Soon after her arrival, she's told by her wacky mother that love is in the stars for her when Venus and Mars align - and before you can say "Seen that before" an American hunk named Cody appears (have you ever noticed that these guys are always named Cody or Ken?
The rest is easily told: after some unfunny interludes, all girls fall in love and live happily ever after.
And the cute one who was after a gay guy suddenly decides for the shy cab-driver, who has helped her stalk Mr. Right-But-Not-Straight.
Well after much nothing but fondling and slo-mo body contact the story progresses to the grand finale which is obviously a play on our hero's name in relationship to biblical characters.
If the movie had just been about a man and a woman having an affair after their partners first had an affair, this might have been a good movie.
With a few unforgettable Allen moments, like when Cecille herself goes into the movie (and one character's self-realization after discovering the wonders of, gasp, improvisation), or when Tom can't pay for a meal cause he has 'movie-money', Purple Rose of Cairo is one of those fuzzy but rare treats in the movies where we're reminded why we go to the movies in the first place.
One thing is for sure: Ron Howard must be ashamed of his brother after watching this film.
The comedy part essentially lasts for the first half an hour or 45 minutes of the movie and is okay, not anything new or hilarious, after that, it's all the same old typical bollywood story with emotions and sad sobs thrown in.
What starts out as a mild comedy, turns in to horror and disgust, when these 'so called' lovable guys shouted "bitch" at a crying baby girl after which they dump her outside a church where she almost drowns and dies!
Suffice it to say the script is unbelievably banal, the comic ideas antiquated and poorly executed, and the acting so cheesy and over-the-top that, after only a few minutes' exposure to this drivel, you'll be agreeing with the French as to the comic genius of Jerry Lewis.
Supposedly these three selfish stooges find a baby on the doorstep and then bicker relentlessly about having to look after the child... whining and slapping each other in-between pathetic songs.... and spitting hateful remarks at this tiny kid.
Then after they have reduced you to gasping in disbelief the script calls for them to abandon the kid in a storm, where the director then chooses to show us the horrifying sight of a baby wet and blue lying in a sodden basket.
And after that they all behave like a bunch of teenage girls who're all gaga about the kid.
Comment 1: I had to stop watching the movie after i heard the line, 'Do I have to swallow John Stamos's Semen?'
So I better enjoy "Trainspotting" or such dumb (but fun) comedy as "Hey dude where's my car" or "Harold & Kumar" which at least provides laughs and don't make you fast forward after half an hour.Last thing, the story is more about a stupid girl than a stoner, if someone know where she can find pot with so much effects and that last so long just tell me where.At least be honest and do a real film about drug and not a retarded teen movie, so long Mr Araki!
The movie strives for zany unpredictability by featuring one mishap after another; unfortunately, the consistently bad outcomes make the plot anything but surprising.
I will always scratch my head after watching movies this bad.
Worst of all, the movie ends with a finger-wagging moral: a denouement that assaults what little intelligence you'll have retained after a single viewing.
Early on, the comedy was right on key, but after that, drama took over, and very limited humor occurred from there on out.
But I would imagine, after hitting a high with Big Daddy, either the quality of the films started to wear off, or Sandler just got too big for his britches.
From an acting perspective, Sandler is surprisingly strong, though nothing that would gain him much more respect after turning in good performances in Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish.
I'm not exaggerating when I say that after the first half of this movie, the whole film was a big letdown.
Additionally, his troubled times come when he fast forwards through waiting for his promotion after months of working on a project.
PS: It was pathetically funny to see the characters make some position before and after all the roundhouse kicks they made many times against their 'oh-so-powerful enemies', that bothered them everywhere, except in their 'base', funny to see how their enemies knew even their thoughts but not the location of Zond's batcave.
The film starts with a sequence that sees a horribly mutilated man crash his car after his body begins to melt.
I bought it from my video store for 3 bucks, after I saw it a few years back.
I was so embarrased that I wanted to leave after only 30 minutes.
For those who sat through the credits after being numbed out by this tedious film about father-son abandonment-guilt deja vu all over again and again and again, it was revealed that the film was shot in Asbury Park.
Okay, it wasn't at all scary, maybe an explosion or two, it does after all take place on a military base.
So, after he finishes showering he gets out and the scary lightning gets him.
It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over.
I watched a lot of episodes, but after a while, I grew bored of it.
The producer, played with gusto by Robert Morley, quickly falls out with the play's authoress, the marvellously eccentric Margaret Rutherford, and after the first rehearsal he rips out 27 pages of the 30 page script.
The retarded animal at the center of the story is a general walking disaster area, every attractive young woman who comes in contact with him ends up dead after being mauled & mutilated, and after about the fourth murder I simply decided I'd had enough.
but after a while it made me long for a comedy like, say, Annie Hall or Manhattan (am I dating myself?)
I bought this film used, and should have suspected that it was a turkey if it was being sold at rental stores a mere four weeks after its DVD release.
The only reason that this misshapen mess of a film was made was because Ray was something of an idol to Wenders, and dying of cancer, not long after the two men met filming The American Friend a few years earlier.
after seeing a marquee at a local movie theatre which reads something to the effect of "Coming soon: 'Unmasked part 26'" hinting that he still will never be able to stop killing, no matter how much he may want to, because the producers will keep bringing him back again and again in more sequels.
They just kept giving him chance after chance after chance.
From the moment when the McElroy character played by Peter Fonda is shot POINT BLANK in the stomach, and not only doesn't die, but lives on to lead the posse after cold-turkey surgery THE SAME DAY, this movie lost me.
A nice parting gesture after they ride 80 hard miles to rescue him.
And were the town people who were after the money, who knew every nook and cranny of their tiny town, just terminally stupid as well?
Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others, so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.
I will say that in the restroom after the movie the other women were laughing at the movie and shaking their heads in disbelief of the hype.
How did Peter Fonda recover completely in a 24 hour period after being gut shot?
How did Russell Crow's mouth heal completely after being beaten unmercifully by Peter Fonda?
"Equalizer 2000" is supposedly set after the nuclear winter; in a time were the snowy grounds of Alaska turned into unbearably hot deserts.
Disaster of course, ensues, they meet a "madcap" family and try to avoid them but fail and after a lot of chaos eventually manage to become best friends and LOVE is returned!
Tom is such a nice guy that when Cecilia"s husband Monk fights with him Tom after he knocks him down, with the old one two, offers Monk a hand to help him up!
I wouldn't go so far as to say that I hated this film - it's not crummy enough to provoke that strong an emotion, and after all, it IS supposed to be a no-brainer comedy, but I just didn't it find to be very entertaining.
I am not sure, but I believe the title was invented after the success of the great naked gun movies that were made years after this horrible crap.
Rahim doesn't take too kindly to the interference of this bounty hunter and kills a few of his nearest and dearest, leaving Randall so angry that he forsakes his money and goes after his adversary purely for the personal satisfaction of itÂ.
Soon after, a bully shark Troy (oh, how original name) appears on the scene, with his two pals, a barracuda and an eel.
Mia Farrow gives one of her best performances as Cecilia, a Depression-era waitress with her head in the clouds who gets dumped on over and over; after a miraculous situation comes her way and promises a better life, she has to choose between reality and fantasy...although some outcomes are predestined.
'The Reef' or 'Shark Bait' as it is otherly known is a floundering story about a young guppie fish named Pi who is forced to move to the glossy reef under the sea after his family are killed.
The plot is roughly the same, although this time he doesn't go after his parents - even the voices sound alike!
What follows is love hopping from one person(or beast) to another but it all gets fixed in the end and the lovers live happily ever after despite their past nights worries due to the constant change in couples.
I was looking forward to seeing what would happen after WM.
The match ended after she injured herself (inreal life) But i didn't care.
7/10  This was a rushed PPV just after Wresltemainia.
OK there was this guy who went to Miami, but i bet even Fidel was not insulted after seeing that scene.
It's just weird that you have a movie called "The Godfather of Green Bay" where the character that the movie is named after could have been completely cut from the film and you would have not lost a thing.
Of course, "The 40 Year Old Virgin" came out five years after this movie did, but it was a bigger hit (and was far less forgettable) because it was smart and had a surprising amount of heart to it.
For instance, no one in the movie thought it was as weird as they should have for the Shandling and Benning characters to get married after just one date.
His best scene came when David Janssen brought him back on horseback "dead" after a rain storm / landslide or something killed him.
Yeah, so you think its going to be a bunch of predators and a bunch of aliens whoopin each others asses... well its not.... its 3 predators.... and you don't see them or the aliens until after the first hour of humans walking around this temple confused and lost with pointless dialogue and this "I'm going to touch stuff that I don't know what it does yet" frame of mind...  when the 3 predators finally show up.. your thinking YES... carnage is coming... the reason I came to see this movie.... well...
I'm sorry... the first predator dies instantly to an alien... the 2nd puts about about a 20 second fight before dying to another alien... then after that awe inspiring 21 seconds of alien vs predator action, it goes back to the humans being lost and stupid again for an additional 20 minutes... then you are rewarded with another 20 seconds, where it shows the remaining predator kill an alien... but its not the uber fight you think its going to be... it takes all of .5 seconds for him to slice through the head with ninja like reflexes... im glad at least one of the predators wasn't a total weakling right?????
I know you didn't want one to be really powerful...so don't worry... the last surviving human, a lady that is way too gungho about being a guide in ice wasteland BEFRIENDS the last surviving predator... it would seem that predators are nice guys after all.... he cuts off an aliens head and tail and gives them to her... tail for a spear, and head to fit over her entire left arm for some sort of shield......
The queen alien shows up, after this huge atomic blast goes off ...
I'm glad that after setting off a blast of this size, at around 2000 feet below the ice... that this stupid queen alien thats for some reason 5x the size it was in aliens, can somehow survive when the entire area was vaporized, and climb up a 2000 foot vertical cliff... argh....
I can't tell you what happens after this... because I walked out at this point...
For an indicator of how long I have been a fan of the series, I will tell you first off that I saw Aliens when it came out on video tape in the late 80s and saw Alien 3 in theaters, I obviously saw Alien after its mid-70's release, and it scared me like few movies have ever been able to do since.
Okay, maybe It is possible they would have the same kind of ritual, after all why can't highly developed species have their rituals...
See, they're not such bad guys after all!
They have disturbed the pyramid and the Predators are going in after them!
If I ever choose to see another one of his movies, I'm going to walk out after twenty minutes, go get something to eat, and then come back for the last ten and see how I feel about it.
Scene after Scene is one joke after another.
Predators have hunted humans for years, so let's send some adolescent ones to go after the fiercest species in the universe, and hey, let's only have them do it every 100 yearsÂ.Riiiight.
That's exactly what I was looking forward to after 14 years, especially in a film with 'Vs.'
One Alien & Predator battle after another.
And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.
I became a Julie Harris fan after seeing her in East of Eden when I was a very young man.
All he was seeking for was her virginity and after he got what he wanted he became a better person.
Talk about redefining "And they lived happily ever after".
"Fear Runs Silent" has a good premise,but this premise is completely wasted.Director Serge Rodnunsky doesn't create almost any atmosphere(apart from the beginning,which is pretty creepy),instead he fills this trash with so many annoying flashbacks.The ending is totally awful:after all these grisly events it all turns into dream!!
"-I thought when I prepared to watch this one.Was I disappointed after the projection.
In one plot we have a group of teenagers on a field trip being attacked by bigfoot-type creatures, in the other we have Kerry seeing a psychiatrist due to depression and nightmares (one assumes that Kerry is seeing the psychiatrist after the events of the field trip).
I actually switched it off at one point, but realising there were only 15 minutes left I thought I may as well watch the rest, I'd got that far after all.
Lee Curtis intelligibly jumped ship after II, so they had to bump her off in a car crash with her husband.
Excess can be amusing in moderation but not episode after episode after ...
Well, I think I shall be leaving the show after series 4.
If it had ended after series 1 with a good resolution of Rambaldi I would have given it an above-average mark.
Let's get to the guys who went after Goucem's neighbor Fifi, what is their real motivation?
Now I'm sure that some of you out there find this to be funny...it'll stop being funny after you sit through this turd.
Nothing will be funny for at least two days after the viewing of this movie, you'll be that mad at yourself for watching the whole thing.
If there is a God, and after seeing this movie you'll really question that, he will "strike down with great vengeance and furious anger" those responsible for this turd that is so in need of flushing.
I saw the play, the one-woman show years ago, and went to see Julie Harris (from Grosse Pointe) in her dressing room, after the show.
I wanted to turn it off after about 45 minutes, but I sat through it hoping for the twist, or hoping for SOMETHING to happen, it never did, thank goodness I only rented the movie....
A small, early gem from the Ron Howard-Ganz-Mandel team, with some personal touches, to wit: The line when `Belinda' (Shelley Long) tells `Chuck' (Henry Winkler) just after they made love that `she is not wearing her watch' to let him know that she loves him is just beautiful, a nice, semi-polished little gem that I think most people can appreciate and enjoy.
That's, after all, how this movie is marketed, a low budget horror movie.
The low points of the film: the movie trying to teach the kids about sex; the kids discovering a native tribe on their island after SEVENTEEN years (!!!
Unlike the way the first one ended, Richard and Emily are dead when they are found, but their son, Patty soon renamed Richard after his father is adopted by the only mother on the ship, Sarah who has another child, a daughter, Lily played by a new successful actress, Milla Jovovich.

Blazejowski always carries around a mini tape recorder to capture his moments of brilliance, as he often comes up with inventions one after another.
I finally shut it down during the scene with Garry Marshall, after they were interrupted for the third time by some extremely contrived, embarrassing spectacles, culminating in Jack Black's entrance in his underwear.
That conclusion might make an undeserving shill feel swell, but after an hour and a half of pained "drama-dy" it's the final indictment of the cluelessness of all involved.
Kidulthood has a good first ten minutes, but after that the film falls a part and is no more then a 2 out of 5 star film.
The plot of the film is it is set the day after the suicide of a 15-year-old girl from West London who was bullied by a group of girls and the evil Sam (Noel Clarke).
Then, after being given a day-off school for mourning and quiet reflection as a result of Katie's death, the black and mixed-race guys instead decide to go off on a spree of casual sex, violent confrontation, knife-wielding thuggery, drug taking and general mayhem on London's streets and shops Â all set to various rap 'choons'.

A Better Tomorrow(1986) made John Woo an action guru after years doing comedies and being known as the king of comedy in Hong Kong cinema.
In fact, it's one of the worst films I've seen recently and this is after watching SILO KILLER and SCARECROWS.
However, Lerigot soon decides to surrender after it is learned that Divatox has captured his wife and child!
Watching this movie after that one, I was hoping for some more unintentional humour, but didn't really find any of that, apart from the scene where the Power Rangers have just gotten their new Turbo powers, and say things like "This is great!"
Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year.
I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.
My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.
A small, early gem from the Ron Howard-Ganz-Mandel, with personal touches, to wit: The line when `Belinda' (Shelley Long) tells `Chuck' (Henry Winkler) just after they made love that `she is not wearing her watch' to tell him that she loves him is just beautiful, a nicely semi-polished little gem that I think most people can appreciate and enjoy.
Even after finding out about their personal downfalls.
Dean Cain and "Hamelt" then have one bullet each in their guns after the bus crashes and their all shot up.
The supporting cast features a bevy of film stereotypes; the distant father, the crazy veteran, the villainous FBI agent...even a black security guard named after a ball player!
(Even after he's left for dead in an earlier battle.)
The main character, Yu, for example, recovers multiple times after being a hair breadths away from death.
The goofy drug-addled daughter -- Cassie -- gets to make a very fine presentation of a Martin Luther King speech, but only after she's already dead in the plot.
its hard to tell whether those who made the film wanted to snipe at the middle east or the Americans, because both will be insulted after seeing this film.
Just out of curiosity, I turned it on after watching the film and was surprised how much I learned about the film, the directing process, the actors, and the director's life.
Anna meets a rock star and after knowing him for, maybe, a few hours, sleeps with him and tells him they made love.
I give it a '3' -- there's enough good violence to feel punched up after a numbing week at work.
He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld.
Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ?
What could have been a meaningful story about the dreadful abuse of women and the crazy notions forged by generation after generation of self interested, jealous and frightened men of power, turned out to be a soulless and simple romp, highlighted here and there with the help of "painting by numbers."
I lost interest after struggling with it for 1 hour.
Would anyone like to argue that the Turtles could never have made it in show biz after the advent of video?
Had I paid money instead of seeing a special screening I would have demanded a refund after ten minutes.
I'm a peace and love kind of guy, but right now, four hours after seeing this, I find myself still wanting to fly to LA to find Jamie Kennedy and kick his ass.
I hoped for a good nice comedy, that would make me laugh, and give me a nice feeling after watching it.
I caught this on cable (nothing else on) and my jaw dropped minutes after it started and I kept watching because I truly could not believe it could get worse.
Although after seeing the New York city skyline as France, we turned it off after we stopped laughing.
This is loosely based on events that occurred during Frank Sinatra's tour of Australia where, after referring to a female reporter as a "two-bit hooker" he was black-banned by the local unions.
to me like, after all most recent film hollwood are based on comic books to produce them means that enjoy.
It was great to see what happened to the old crew after they were arrested in the original, but unfortunately the entire storyline is pretty much the same this time around.
However Federal Agents step in & forbid the killing of any Graboids due to the endangered species act which gives them the opportunity to become Shriekers & then after that stage they transform into yet another different type of creature which Burt has to deal with...
Which makes Twist a horror film -- if that's what you're after.
How funny is it really to see a grunting halfwit running around in circles after a bunch of little kids?
One can only think Holden was forced to work on this picture, which hits you over the head with salvo after salvo of predictable psuedo-psychological double talk and laughable explorations into "hidden traumatic childhood incidents" intended to sensitively explicate present behavior in painfully simplistic terms.
We had, after all, already had Hitchcock's "Spellbound", of which this is more or less a copy.
These days, after a decade or two of "getting in touch with our feelings" (what does that MEAN?)
I think Tim Roths character got annoying after the first 10 mins, obviously tarentino or rodrigous didnt pick the music for they're rooms, all in all, Dont waste your money, but if your a True Tarantino fan you must get it.
I'm afraid I can't give a complete and proper review because I walked out on it after watching just over half of it.
Keaton's uncontained exuberance here may have lead to his getting the title role in BEETLEJUICE (1988) but nonetheless comes across as essentially overstated; Winkler though, miles away from his iconic and ultra-confident Fonzie character, is wonderful and he is matched by Shelley Long (of CHEERS fame, hence another established TV performer trying to break into movies) as the call-girl abused by customers (after her pimp is flamboyantly 'executed') who seeks comfort in the arms of neighbor Winkler (himself engaged to a neurotic woman dominated by strict parents).
Joe Spinell has a small role towards the end as the slimy manager of the swank brothel to which Long relocates after her association with Winkler and Keaton is disrupted: the latter happens to work at the same joint as a towel-boy(!
But it's most of the time really boring as hell because you know what will be the end after five minutes of the movie.
One day as he arrived at his apartment building, Chuck bumps into his neighbor, Shelly Long, after she had been beaten up by her pimp.
There's one sequence which infuriated me..three girls, after the killer's eyes have been blinded, watch one of their own get her shirt ripped off and drilled to death without even attempting to help her!
The strength in numbers, even after they discover he's the wacko, fail to join forces to surround and cease him.
Wisely, the story avoids any moralizing or delving into the murky waters of the subject matter; after all, this is a comedy, not `Taxi Driver,' and Howard never lets it slip even close to leaving the laugh track.
Oh well, it's all watchable enough for the true fans of the genre and for the people who gave up watching Slumber Party Massacre movies-series after the previous sequel, give this movie a change, you might up liking this movie.
Apparently the ladies in the house don't know how to open a door or window to escape, which becomes almost a running gag after awhile.
This is the 50s, after all.
It seems incredible that this codswallop was released 2 whole years after that definitive science-fantasy epic 'Star Wars'.
Disgruntled former scientist with NASA is brought back to the fold after a comet--"wrenched out of orbit by Jupiter's gravitational pull!"
Well o.k.,o.k.,nobody in "Meteor" actually says that - after all,that would be downright plagiarism,but we do have a lot of "hommages",not to say rapine and pillage from thirty years of space movies,every one infinitely better than this travesty.
Soon after this, disaster movies came to an end, not to be seen again until their special effects-enhanced re-emergence in the mid-1990s.
after hearing on websites that this movie was gritty and gory and all this other good stuff, I went to check it out at the rental store.
after seeing 2 minutes of this episode I was utterly utterly disappointed and ashamed.
Other incidents that beg some logical questions, why did the power station explode so fast after what's-his-name got the news about his mommy?
How on earth did the power come back on after that huge explosion?
Centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'Other' or gifted human (anyone seen Neo?)
I have read the book after watching a movie and got some clues about the original plot.
It may be dated, but it is still funny after all these years.
First, I would like to voice my outrage at the exploitation of Vladimir Vysotsky's talent five years after his death for this piece of Reagan-esquire propaganda.
So after seeing all the totally unnecessary artistic license taken by the adaptation of the story - things that turn an epic and suspenseful story into an action-hero-vehicle and gore-fest - I wanted to invoke the cryptic invocation whose heading is the Dragon's Tail, sign of the descending node - OGTHROD AI'F GEB'L-EE'H YOG-SOTHOTH 'NGAH'NG AI'Y ZHRO!
First, we see him let a murderer go after the police who arrested him acted wrongly in the arrest procedure.
But after all, what does one expect from a film directd by Peter Hyams?
I caught the first twenty minutes of this on the Fox Movie Channel, and was so intrigued that I rushed out and rented it last night, after finishing a 3 1/2 year project.
Coming to the IMDb site to review this commercially successful movie, I was amazed at the Oscar recognition it garnered in 1978 for what is, to my eyes and ears a very unremarkable re-make of the enjoyable 1941 Claude Rains feature "Here Comes Mr Jordan", while surreptitiously grafting on the title of another "life after death" 40's classic starring Don Ameche.
I found the movie so frustrating, I had to turn it off after about 20 minutes.
When I heard of the premise about a mockumentary about the new-found patriotism everybody seemed to have after 9-11, I was definitely looking forward to The War Effort.
How comes a woman doesn't recognize the man she loves, just 14 years after he's disappeared, and when it happens that much more than half his face looks exactly the same it was?
The best point, to place it, after all, above the 'awfull' grade: It's funny, thanks for some sincere giggles and roar of laughters while the whole evolves - in short, a classic in the "worst of" category... (In this mood, don't' miss it!)
The dual role played by the unbearably unwatchable and quasi-intense Fiennes (proving acting is not a genetic trait), is excruciating bizarre and Gretchen Mol must have wondered after and hour of plodding dialog how she was not supposed to realize that the new mysterious Hispanic guy was her old flame.
This was the bottom of the barrel, and I can hardly believe that that Bhansali went on to make "Devdas" after producing this cheap masala movie.
after 15 years of painful waiting period for the new Real Rajko Grlic's movie, I saw Karaula last night and I was so sad and disappointed...
I certainly saw it coming after the middle point of the film.
Incredibly, you start being bored after just ten minutes, as the first of many endless dialogues flows quietly.
Ironically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of "Mother," IS included in the film.
He shortly after commits suicide, a decision one might understand in view of the fact regarding his character and life.
They say that horror film series like these tend to deteriorate after the first film, and this is exactly what Scream does.
Really should have quit after one ... No.
The climax is somewhat watchable but is let down by the fact that Sidney probably didn't need saving after all and the finale was written just so the murderer could explain his motives .
Watch the opening of Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard or read the first page of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man after Toto and you may catch my drift.
"Waiting..." does not take that approach and is one lame gag after the next.
Immediately after, they were on the Internet looking up various musical artists from the movie so that they could get to know the music that they now loved, but had missed out on.
In fact, the plot is "tricking you" into thinking it's going to get good, and then when you're interested again, it's like - "hehehe... got you sucker...", and then continues to unfold as lamely as you subconsciously assumed it would after the first 15 minutes.
Yes, Loic is enigmatic and incredibly attractive, and the film could have developed well based on that, but instead it wanders hopelessly after its first 20 minutes and becomes essentially 90% talk and 10% plot.
I watched as PPV on home cable after reading some reviews and taking in the marketing several months ago, and only because I like Jennifer Anniston and I was bored with X-Mass shopping and am not very familiar w/Vaughn.
Prior she was not pulling in audiences as one would think she would after Friends.
She rides her bike and he runs after her.
If you're going to make Vaughn's character a beyond believable inconsiderate jerk, this same character would not make a 180 degree turn around after a short erudite "pep talk" from his bartender friend.
By the same token, if you're going to make Aniston's character the kind of person who would put up with this behavior for so long, she would NOT in real life totally change her mind about him a few days after sobbing in her bedroom about their relationship when he finally makes the list of changes she wants (minus the bowl of lemons and ballet tickets he should have had on that table with the dinner).
Though it started on a promising note, after five minutes I found myself guzzling an extra-large coke, just so I would have the excuse of going to the rest room to get away from it.
Thomas Van Hasebroeck (teasingly nicknamed Van Chickensoup) is a lifelong dreamer because he fears action and commitment after his precocious sister (Alice) is killed because of his demands that she do something that will prove she still loves him.
My favorite scenes are Alice's determined confrontations with the Blessed Virgin after her father's disappearance.
Even after breaking up, they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live, and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who (annoying).
They meet a few months after, and do the "it's good to see you!
after it ended.
It's very clear to me why the Outfest programmers chose to screen this film after the awards ceremony (so the viewers didn't get a chance to show their displeasure) and without a Q/A with the filmmakers afterwards (where I and the vast majority of others in attendance certainly would have voiced our displeasure): shame that they included it in a queer film festival at all.
I guess if you're into the rock'n'roll narrative, you'll find something to like about this movie; after all, this romantic notion of being hungry and breaking through to the mainstream has a certain appeal, but I just don't think it's done all that well here, either in a technical sense or in story-telling.
Who becomes a rocker after watching Tina Turner?
I could handle the dated costumes and social norms, but after an hour or so, it seemed as if that's all the film had to offer-a tour of SF's colorful corners in the Haight-Ashbury era, with a tacked-on murder mystery that came to no satisfying conclusion.
In a way Jane of the book was like a bird in a cage, it is only after finding that Edward wanted her to truly be free to be herself that she spoke more freely in his presence.
Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment.
I wanted to be angry after watching this, maybe even choked up a bit.
Soon after wards a lot of internet hype went into this film based upon the fact that a lot of people are anticipating M. Night Shyamalan's movies.
With the lackluster "The Village" as this film's predecessor it was time to look into a refreshing albeit familiar direction one expects of M. Night and after a year or so of waiting I finally saw it tonight.
I watched this movie in a theater packed with other people all excited about this film, however after its showing, more than half were at the box office demanding their money back.
Only after drinking milk and pissing your pants, though.
Year after year, his works of uncompromised genius are poorly received by theatergoers and film critics alike.
This is one of those forgotten films and after seeing it, I really think TCM should have let it remain forgotten!
It's obvious to me that the cast of this movie was "on a mission from God" to leave a legacy to those who come after and have never known the real thing.
I had to walk out of the theater after half an hour it was so bad.
The first reviewer here remarked on the retiree stereotypes and the gags wear thin, thin after the first run through.
We're stuck with one preposterous situation after another, and they all somehow interlock.
Bryan Brown was in this film and takes you from the Malaysia arena and hardships, to Australia in the years after the war.
Bruce Lee stars as Billy Lo, an action star (of the martial arts variety) who mobsters are trying to force to sign with them, however after taking a couple of beatings and an assassination attempt, Lo fakes his death, has reconstructive surgery and looks to teach the mobsters what the meaning of "No" is.
In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee's original version would've easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here.
I was very annoyed after watching this film.
Approximately 11 minutes of footage of the late Bruce Lee, including film of his funeral and his body in his coffin, are used to sell a movie about a supposedly dead actor avenging himself after being Âkilled' for not paying protection to organised crime.
There's an uncomfortable echo of the death of Brandon Lee when Lee's character Âdies' after someone replaces a blank in the gun that shoots him for a stunt sequence with a real bullet.
If they'd used all the real footage of Lee either before or after this, the film would have made much more sense: instead, they used alleged look-alikes, their faces sometimes hidden by false beards or motorcycle helmets, intercut with close-ups of the real Lee.
I think Game of Death shouldn't have went ahead with it's release, Bruce Lee would've been disappointed in it as towards the end of the film after fighting Hikim, you could obviously see that it was no longer Bruce playing the part of Billy Lo and it must've been a kid or someone drunk editing that scene showing Bruce with candles and a punch bag behind him and when it cut to his replacement, there was nothing behind him.
Years after the fact, DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY (based, we're told, on Clouse's own book) would come along and reopen the old wound(s).
I WAS very nervous and fearful throughout the first half of the film in not knowing what to expect after psycho Alex (David Hess) and his friend hit the party.
Initially, Lane receives a chilly reception in the Little Big Horn Saloon where Slim Reeves (Ian MacDonald of "High Noon") goads him into a showdown after he labels Lane a sheep-man.
Lane has Maria eating out of his hand after he wagers that he can ride a bronco that nobody else has managed to stay aboard for a full minute.
i turned it off after 1hr 15. and then wrote this, cos i hate people who think this stuff is some how great, and if you don't like it, its because its just too cool to be appreciated.
Stephanie Beacham is great as the seemingly selfish Rose Millar with flashes of kindness underneath and her friendship with Blanche is one of the joys of the series,the aborted escape causing a real rift between the two,this is resolved when Blanche is sent back to her friends in the 2nd series after being sent to another camp at the start of series 2 along with Nurse Nellie Keane(who falls in love with Sally(Joanna Hole)in series 1,and Slyvia,Blanche informs them,that Slyvia died a month after arriving in the new camp,Nellie dies a few months before the end of the war in series 3.
In David Cronenberg's ridiculous attempt at a film, when the character's think of a car crash, they think of sex and then some more sex and then even more sex after that.
The 13th Warrior begins with a scene of Ambassador Ahmet (who existed in real life) headed north after being sent away so he won't fool around with the king's wife.
It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit.
There's an air of cheapness about the whole thing - the leaders of the experiment literally run the project out of somebody's basement (ridiculous when we learn how high up it goes), and in one hilarious moment, an attempted rapist gets up and walks out of the room after being knocked down by Anna.
Now after this movie I think negatively of him.
I am so sick of them, particularly of her, what was at first her appealing acting style, the same in movie after movie after movie, now makes me want to shoot the screen.
Impatient action fans - tune in one hour after it started to see the extras get killed.
Before that is alot of drama, and after that is the rescue, and that's all, folks.
Series 3 took place in Singapore, when the War had ended and the women had to cope with being free, trying to get used to their lives after years of imprisonment.
It's when local high school girl Lucille Dillerton is found drowned and boozed up after she jumped off a pier that the police headed by J.Edger Hoover look-alike Det.
If you said four, based on the fact that that is how they are packaged on DVD into a two-disc four-film box-set, then you would be mistaken - there were in fact FIVE films to this series, this last one coming fourteen years after the last effort, "The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery".
In the film they take the place of the real Athos, Porthos, and Aramis and they and Ameche bungle their way into one situation after another.
My house needed fumigation after several of them!
This film   But after 50 min we just stopped watching in order not to lose our good mood.
It also shares its ability to bore me witless, with the quantity and quality of sex seriously waning after the first half an hour, and very little in the way of decent gore, despite featuring more of the undead.
A female spirit (Laura Gemser) and an old man conjure up the dead buried on the island to go after these three and stop any development from taking place.
Eastman and Funari wind up in a 'mental institution' after all this.
I nearly wanted to cry after the first 15 minutes (and 2 scenes).
It was maddening to sit through scene after scene of incomprehensible stupidity, waiting for something to happen, only to get to the end and realize NOTHING WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN!
But after an hour of this film I was about to chew my own leg off to try and escape.
It was dreary beyond belief and  after two hours, my friend (who reached the same conclusion as I  did, but totally separately, since we do not talk during movies)  looked at me, we got up and made our escape.
Micheal Moore comments that corporations are only after profits.
i was dragged out of my bed for this film and frog marched down to the local cinema where i paid my money and i intended to enjoy a film, which i was convinced would be in the style of Bowling for Columbine ... 3 hours later after i had sat through the same point being rehashed and retold to me by various people i ran outside with a splitting headache i had such high hopes for this film, the film had its heart in the right place but the director obviously didn't cut his film enough.
terrible....boring,and these people acted like morons.....i turned it off after getting tired of listening to these guys repeat every question a million times.
i would have like to have seen what happened after the marriage,but i couldn't get through it.....im sure this movie was great n all,but personally i like my films to not put me to sleep.....just didn't really need to be a flick,as far as im concermed.
in a handout which i picked up in the cinema the director confesses to the fact that after each days shooting she then went and wrote the screenplay for the next days filming!
I was fortunate in that Jacqueline Bissett & the screen writer did a Q&A after the movie.
I was excited about playing another sneaker, after the Thief series was lacking the third part for a long time, so I thought I give splinter cell a try.
Having abandoned quality after the first one the series has opted for repeating a formula with usually increasing flesh and hoping that word of mouth and shear deluge of films will make money.
John 'Bradshaw' Layfield beat Batista via DQ after Big Dave hit JBL with a chair in a lame main event.
Are there wireless towers or satellites after the nuclear holocaust?
I just want to puke after seeing this film.
There's a nice range of guest appearances from some actors who went on to great things (Anita Dobson as a maid who bites the dust after two minutes on screen), but the supporting roles are obviously less significant to the two leads.
I can understand the filmmaker and studio wanting to try something new and different, but this whole story premise was too off the wall and didn't give the viewer what he expected after having already seen the previous two films.
Petty Mimic: Sentinel is the third film in the Mimic series & you know a series is in trouble when they stop numbering them after only the first two & as if by magic my fears are confirmed with this distinctly average at best horror/thriller.
I was left overly disappointed after watching this.
No, by the end he turns back on all of that and decided to take after his mom.
The best we get is when Woodcock said "I'm "Basically" sorry" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused.
Now, if you play this two movies one after another I guarantee you that you would not be able to tell which character was from which movie, since they are almost the exact same.
Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere and flings us into one implausible, sitcom-level situation after another.
Just wait until it's shown on TV, as you might find yourself looking for the remote after 15-20 minutes.
View on the film:  For the first twenty minutes writer/director Toback gives the film a bit of a similar feel to Richard Linkletters great first film Slacker.With the characters meeting up in very loose over-lapping scenes.Disappointingly after this,the camera for some dumb reason is kept about half a mile away from anyone in the rest of the film,and whilst this could have worked for a few part of the film to give it an "intimate" look.but due to it being constantly used,all the passion and intimacy in the interview in naked scenes is completely lost.And for all of the apartment scenes Toback has a very loud piano playing the same three or four notes,for the whole of the film,which gives the impression that there is a ghost badly playing a piano in the apartment!!.
Neve is sexy, but I wasn't feeling the "She's the hottest thing on planet Earth" vibe they were trying to get across by showing everyone panting after her like dogs in heat, it just came across as fake.
after one hour of dribble and complete boredom, there is a twist in the plot!
That was okay, too - because the story didn't have anywhere to go to, and after the first 15 minutes, you don't want the characters to develop - you want them to either make sense or go away.
She tells boyfriend that there was no cash, and Bad Things Happen - after which we see that the poor little rich girl is a Bad poor little rich girl.
That is not a spoiler, after all, the title is "VIRUS."
Unfortunately after this film, Bing was done with the clergy.
I had great hopes for this movie, which I rented after reading other comments, and also based on my previous experience with some excellent Cuban movies.
No horrorfan can just sit back and enjoy EDT2, it is a disgrace to the genre...after 1 hour and 28 minutes you see one or two better scenes (breaking the arm is one of them, but still not impressive), and that's about it I'm affraid.
Now, after years, I am very disappointed.
Just cliche after cliche.
Tragedy after tragedy, plot twist after plot twist.
Dr. Weaver was in limbo with her son, after miscarrying.
and yes it all surrounds Dr carter or does it, after watching the last E.R.
Weaver is just not believable as a lesbian; her naming the trans-gender studies unit after Romano smacked of childish revenge.
Instead the audience got another story filled with quick cutaways and bass designed to give you a scare in that moment, but after leaving you with an emptiness where the story should have filled.
- Character time travels to 1986, then promptly dies after telling a local young couple that a spear head he brought is special (it had pierced the body of the once called "Christ").
And then after, we're supposed to believe that the thief is really a good guy who really cares?
Maybe it was written by someone's 14 year old after one too many games of D&D.
We get to see the real Kull now after he gets the crown.
The typical and oh so unoriginal hero who has no flaws, treats women with respect, thinks there should be no slavery and he makes it a point, and gives an occassional grunt to remind he is after all under all that heroic visage, a barbarian.
I bought it for $2.00 at a local video sale and after watching I felt ripped off (and went out and sold it) The main reason for me getting it was that the script was by Charles Edward Pogue, a man who I have alot of respect for after "The Fly" and "Psycho 3" But I could'nt see a trace of his usual good work here.
Every line of dialogue in the movie is looped (dubbed after the fact), destroying any sense of authenticity and verisimilitude.
Scorpio was a film Burt Lancaster didn't think too much of according to a recent biography and after viewing it I can certainly see why.
Other parts of the movie involve police officers who help the lady after problems with the phone sex job.
Now for anyone who loves classic Hollywood films, there's really no reason to explain in depth my reason to watch a Mitchum film--after all, he's Robert freakin' Mitchum--a wonderful actor who made everything (even crap) quite watchable.
Four years after original Dragonheart movie, which I liked a lot Universal released on video this cheap and rather pathetic sequel.
It is, after all, a movie about a girl's quest for romance and a career -- pretty standard fodder for many romantic comedies.
The story goes that after Draco.
They must have had a shock after the edit.
There is a genuine, uplifting tale buried in this film, that somehow got lost as each executive decided to burp out a script note after lunch.
But, after I looked up its information here, I realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing.
He was named Nero after his adoption.
Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with Octavia and his nomination to Emperor.
The acting was between good and sub-par, the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor to a rushed, bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure.
That is what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, a part of the production series on the Roman Empire.
And many, many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, I doubted whether I was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy.
Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four year reign, and was only three when he was assassinated; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior, not treason; and Nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family.
Then he goes off to conquer Britain, and is poisoned by Agrippina soon after his victorious return.
Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 A.D., two years after beginning his reign.
One man is obsessive, the other is "the other man," but does not know this until after she is out cold.
The film also contains an abundant amount of female nudity, which after a while became gratuitous.
I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves.
Half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film.
The film actually gets going after about fifty mins, not that it's to going.
Nothing in it made any sense , even by horror movie standards.The premise wasn't too bad but it just fell to pieces after the first 5 minutes its an Australian movie and the male actors have Australian accents but the women have these terrible fake American accents and one of the womens accent is so appalling i have no idea what country she is supposed to be from .
after watching this movie i tried to find a way to get in touch with the director to sling some abuse , no other movie has driven me to that point before don't watch it unless your video store has a ' didn't like it?
I didn't have much time for jim sheridan before i saw this movie, after seeing it i had none.
I'd never thought particularly highly of jim sheridan before seeing this but after seeing it i thought even less.
They all get together working in a restaurant and there is a lot of awkward moments, in fact the whole show is more soap opera with a load laugh track added to make you think it's funny, but it's just one awkward moment after another with a mentally ill woman thrown in for the gut buster (not!).
I also liked how the movie made the marines have a prayer after the insane slaughter of civilians who clearly had no weapons.
A Marine is told he cannot visit a doctor until after he goes home, and then only on his leave.
& they disappear after there scene..  HBO missed on this.I just cant figure why this has such a high rating on IMDb  Ratings: *1/2* (out of 4); 42 points (out of 100) IMDb 3 (out of 10)
So Wizard of Gore only gets three stars, mostly for the stomach-churning stage sequences wherein the putative 'Wizard' disembowels, maims and punch-presses his victims to death in front of a live audience, only it's OK because it's all an 'illusion', only it's NOT really OK because the victims all die horribly soon after.
Or after wards.
In the opening titles he cuts his head with a guillotine, shortly after reemerges fully intact.
Returns to her seat and shortly after the show is over dies the same way she was torn in two by the chainsaw.
However, sadly, after that point the plot takes a predictable average-man-turned-detective turn strait into a pit of boredom.
Hopefully he'll get it right one day but after this, the Reckoning and now Lucky Number Slevin, I wouldn't hold my breath.
He saws women in half or drives spikes in their heads--and yet they are just fine after the trick is complete.
The big jerk instead of getting help or calling the police on his cellphone after he's allowed to leave by the hoodlums bursts in like he was a member of an AFT assault team and gets himself shot to death for his brainless effort.
The main character is trying to find Finbar (after a lot of tiresome teenage angst), but the scintilla of suspense that this search might have evoked is spoiled by the fact that Finbar is an obnoxious bore, and not worth finding.
If the movie was half-interesting and believable in the beginning, after Danny goes to Sweden, it becomes decreasingly interesting and believable.
I spent money to rent it so I kept watching it for another 45 minutes...still no plot after an hour.
I decided, we are going back to America, it is a better place after all.
I just don't want anyone to waste their money; if, after this, you still feel some strange curiosity to buy and watch this movie, remember that you will never have back the time spent watching this, and will hate yourself for that for the next year at least.
Speaking of Junior High, the script reads like a pre-adolescent's English homework after seeing the major slasher movies.
The acting could have been improved if the actors felt the moment, i felt like screaming it after a while!
So after watching 1 hour of the movie I found out that it would be more fun to eat my own "***".. at least I wouldn't have such an awful aftertaste in my mouth as I had when watching this movie.
Soon enough the kids are being murdered one after one by the ruthless monster "The Bunny Man".
Constance's dream to have a blonde-haired and blue-eyed daughter was not fulfilled after her incestrial efforts and instead she was blessed with a hulking maniac that she decided to keep padlocked in an underground chamber for the rest of his life.
I was expecting something as bad as The Night Devides the Day or Carnage Road after reading so much negativity.
The storyline is interesting, but what you watch on the screen isn't after all...
The plot is that Sir Gawain has been given a year to live by the magical Green Knight, after which if he has not solved four riddles, the Green Knight can have his head.
after the start of the show.
?i mean he should have died too after the tree burn down .it could have been better too bad it had to end like this......................The Whole movie could have been a better .
Well, nothing i mean NOTHING happens till one and a half hour of the movie(what happens is the same old sightings of those zombies roaming in the house) and what all happens after that is silly (totally silly).
But i might add that the only thing worth watching is Susmita Sen and her acting (does a great job after Samay).
Producers of Vaastu-Shastra warns: it you watch this film we shall not be responsible means that if you regret after watching it, blame it yourself as we already warned you.
which i will not spoil for you here, but for the most part its just one terrible scene after another that it really becomes difficult to watch.
The story is a hundred years old about a few friends on holiday & something is after them.
She tries time after time to show that Moore's films aren't flawless scientific reports on their subjects.
The film plods along, marking off point after point like a laundry list.
There's no clear narrative line, just a series of scenes, one after the other.
The day after watching this film, I woke up wondering if it was real.
She tries time after time to show that Moore's films aren't flawless scientific reports on their subjects.
Its not even worth discussing the illogic of the plot, its twists, or how good the amusement park looks after being abandoned for so many years.
It leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl.
I think they got the point after that was said for the billionth time.
It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one clichÃ© after another.
Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar.
Mohr heads a nasty group of bad guys who go around shooting hard working prospectors after they've signed over their claims.
Blake Edwards must have had a huge ego after the success of The Pink Panther.
The scenarios and music get old after 5 minutes, and you have to stay there for like 10 hours.
A great disappointment after Pola X.
Sadly, 'Shadows' is precisely the sort of movie which would convince such people that all the negative stereotypes about silent movies are true after all.
But, I think after finally seeing this film (the final one for me to see), I can safely say it's the worst.
- After you've seen giallo after giallo, you begin to think you've seen it all as far as a convoluted plot goes.
The problem for me is that after a good opening segment of cartoons about birds the film becomes a music and dance fest.
Bullard enlisted in the French Foreign legion at the start of WWI, and after being wounded at Verdun in 1916, he transferred to the Lafayette Escadrille.
Soon, after he joins Mays' gang, Gangster 55 is also.
The Gremlins kid (can't remember his name) is an archaeologist who is summoned to the site after the two dirt bikers tell the cops about what they found.
The second half, however, is quite interesting: Merli quits the force after shooting a hood (John Steiner) in 'cold-blood' - apparently, it little matters to his superiors that the latter had done the same to undercover cop and Merli protÃ©gÃ© Ray Lovelock, who remains paralyzed for life!
Killing people with pickaxes is not funny after 6 times.
Crispin plays the two brothers Stanley and Simon who are the same person after all because Stanley turns out to be schizophrenic and playing the role of his dead brother Simon (whom he obviously killed like everyone else).
Also don't expect to rent this movie and see Blake Lively(Accepted) or Robyn Lively(Savannah) in any screen time, they appear at the end of the movie in sort of a cameo role after everything of importance has happened.
Thirty years after entering the cultural conscience with the his groundbreaking performance as Alex deLarge in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Malcolm McDowell returns to the screen in this unabashedly violent and emotionally detached film about envy amongst gangsters and the need to be the "gangster no.
It is sad to see how the Superman franchise simply evaporated after the first 2 films.
Clearly the magic was gone in the franchise after the first two films, and perhaps "Supergirl" was seen as a means of taking the same idea in a new direction.
There's a dull action sequence involving a runaway backhoe, as well as a scene where Supergirl uses a lightning-charged streetlamp to ward off an invisible monster that's after her.
The utilitarian script delivers functional scene after scene without regard to logic, human psychology, plot or intelligence.
It does however excel at placing loud, stupid moments one after another until there's over two hours of crap on the screen; damned if you could offer a reason why.
The Salkind brothers wished to put the series after the failures of Superman III and IV but this in 1984 when he come out was a great box-office flop.
It's the story of beautiful blond young girl Kara from Argo city; a fragment of Krypton planet where the survivals are take refuge after the planet's destruction.
The all-star cast is interesting; the 18-old year Helen Slater in the title-role is wonderful; she's very beautiful when she flies with the mini-super costume and she gives to character the right mix of naivety and courage; she's the real perfect choice for the role; it is a pity that the picture's failure have run over her and have ruined her carrier still after to start.
Superman Returns will be different in the sense that he returns to earth after being away for an unspecified period of time.
Been a long time now - but if I remember correctly, Amanda asks, after having sliced of the cowboy's penis, "don't you think he wanted it this way?".
But even so, after I managed to get trough the whole movie I couldn't help but wonder how the actors willingly would humiliate themselves like this?
I tried to watch it once, but had to shut it off after an hour.
After aiding old time friend and FBI man, Felix Leiter (David Hedison) in a drug bust, and standing up for Felix at his wedding, Bond returns hours later to discover Felix's wife is dead and that Felix is barely clinging to life after being fed to a shark.
The only advantage for its producers is that you CAN'T forget it after a vision.
The story begins in 1999, with an old gangster performed by Malcolm McDowell being advised that Freddie Mays (David Thewlis) would leave jail after thirty years in prison.
I thought the movie played too hard to the ten-year-old 'cussy-boy' crowd, who seemed after wards to be a bit embarrassed by it all, as were many of the parents whose eye I caught exiting the theater while the end credits rolled.
It was surprising, at least after all the media attention in Latin circles it received, to come out of this movie as if I had just lost 2 hours of my time.
If anything after having seen Mexican and Colombian cinema and being familiarized with the themes they depict, "Paraiso" doesn't seem to know where it wants to go and what subjects it really wants us to familiarize ourselves with.
I got up to write this review after the first 10 minutes of the July 7th show and I'll never watch this show again.
this was changed after the first few episodes into an "approve or disapprove" system where the judges vote afterwards on a winner, and a majority vote from the American public decides a second winner for the round.
Less than half of every show actually involves performing, and they spend way too much time on background info and letting you know what is coming up "after the break."
But after sitting down and watching it, I don't know if I can actually sit through another episode in order to see them.
And the plot, well after ten minutes anyone can see how the movie is going to end.
How could the director, after watching several days of pitch black dailies, not decide that it might be time to invest in one lighting kit?
How did the editor so seamless cut scene after scene of pitch black on pitch black so effortlessly?
Well, I guessed the killer *in the video rental*, after I looked at the cover!
But if you check for them you will see that they both made something after their "Buddy Movies".
However, after an hour it all goes downhill, and I mean steeply.
The teens get picked off one by one after the Token Irish chap tells them all a scary Moonlight story.
Tony Montana didn't build his empire after a weekend's charabanging in Aberystwyth.
Just a handful of films have nibbled round the caps, including Performance, Work Is A Four Letter Word and - coyly - Dougal And The Blue Cat (less a whimsical child-friendly distraction, than an escalating series of terrifying derangements), in which Dylan the rabbit complains of feelings of exhaustion after cultivating his "crazy mushrooms".
Bluto the jock gets slaughtered while out 'dogging', shortly after conversing with a talking cow; the rest follow suit.
'Sacred Weeds', a 1998 TV series, encountered similar headaches after getting a bunch of dosed-up students to record their experiences live to digicam.
However, after a bad batch, the group begins to see unearthly visions of demonic apparitions trying to attack them.
I'm not sure where this comes in the Bud/Terence line up of movies, but, much like the early plot where the two characters team up again for one final mission, this movie has the feel of a movie made after the heyday of the pair.
Anyway, forget this movie - it was a boring waste of time after 15 mins or so and never gets any better!
Sorry, but after sitting through this sort of crap 100s of times my patience has finally snapped.
I deserve some good quality drugs after sitting through this.
Soon after, perhaps another five minutes or so, the main character would find her friend dead.
This time, they are feebly attempting to turn our hearts and minds against the psychedelic mushroom, and all those who indulge in such practises of course, by suggesting that anyone (even an cloying, incessantly altruistic, All American teenage virgin cheerleader-stereotype) can become a psychotic sadistic murderer overnight after ingesting a single "Death cap" mushroom (not even a psychedelic strain: merely a poisonous lookalike).
The only idea of mushrooms that stays with the "plot" after the first forty minutes is the supposed special black headed mushrooms our heroine takes that allows her to see into the future.
None of the characters were convincing or engaging, in fact I prayed for their deaths after about 15 minutes.
I am quite certain also that the good money thrown after bad towards salaries, production and marketing on this one, could have funded 5 superior new hopefuls with the aim of in fact igniting a revival in the 'Industry' and saving the rest of us from the embarrassing drivel we got.
The idea of blurring the lines between reality and imagination is quite nice and works after the horror kicks in along with the effect of the mushrooms.
I suppose I could knock the production values and minor technical crap like that, but it's an indie movie after all and you make do with what you can afford.
who team up again after several years and go to Miami to track down the killer of an infamous robber who had just gotten released from prison.
Naturally the reason it's been empty for so long is because everyone has heard the tale about the ghost that haunts it......many years ago a young girl lived there, with just 2 servants to look after her after her parents died, and when the girl too died, the servants (a married couple) were bequeathed her fortune; as was her wish for their kindness.
I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about.
And at the time of writing, he's done just over 40 roles during or after BH90210.
During or after "Popular", she's been in twenty projects, including hit movies like Pearl Harbor, The Ring and a regular cast-member status in two series, while also guest starring in others.
Basically the story revolves around the search for the missing key, as a woman named June from Canada (Lilli Palmer) turns out to be the heir to the fortune after the son disappears and isn't heard from for several years.
At least in the end reality hits them in the nose and after a stint in bed together they realize the moral bankruptcy of their "new thinking".
And this tease.stay after the final credits, and you will be greatly rewarded.
The ending of the film is highly unusual but effective, although especially for me--as someone who champions extremely liberal sexuality and thinks monogamy isn't really a great idea--there was a contradictory one-two punch of being disheartening, then shortly after uplifting.
But while in a hotel room in Las Vegas, after they've all revealed some secrets, they decide to have an orgy.
I can still remember my wife and I discussing the movie for weeks after first viewing it - with a little bit of embarrassment but over-all just plain laughter!!
thinking back it really fun to elicit the red faces from our friends - still makes me chuckle even after all these years - thanks for the opportunity of sharing this information with those who haven't seen it - its worth much more than the price of admission.
But after almost two decades, Aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and co-star Belushi, so he assembled this "Concert Movie", which is supposed to be all about THE MUSIC, not the story.
When Victor gets out of jail, his mind is on bitter revenge, especially after he discovers that Elena, now clean and sober, has married the invalid David, who's now a paralympic basketball star.
Hey there everyone,  "live flesh" is one of those fine movies which go through your mind days after the movie.
Picture Victor, a young street kid who falls in love with a ravishingly beautiful woman (The Italian Francesca Neri) after a one night stand in a disco bathroom.
Sancho (after a tip from jealous David) and Clara meet each other at Victor's house, which again leads to a shoot out.
Victor and Elena are reunited after 7 years and get a baby.
After spending time with the real characters in Strictly Background, you'll want to know more about their lives and what happened after the cameras stopped rolling.
Curious, seeing this after the smash hits of "Todo Sobre Mi Madre" and "Hable con Ella", because this movie sort of prepared the viewers to what was coming.
And while Arthur O'Connell does a good job as her father, I've never been able to picture him as anything other than a determined bachelor after his role in Picnic.
That song Gidget I had on 45rpm as did all the girls after we all got a load of Sandra Dee and James Darren together.
Manmohan Desai was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films AAA is one of them   The film marked one of Bachchan- MD most famous films and also a blockbuster  The plot is the similar long lost brothers theme but it's well handled and entertaining  The plot is revealed in the initial 20 mins itself which is damn serious but then the film gets funny and entertaining Amitabh's character is one of the best parts, Anthony Gonsalves became a big rage and is remembered even today The scenes between Amitabh- Vinod, the fight and the jail scenes are well handled(in PARVARISH surprisingly both played opposite roles of cop and thief) though the long lost theme isn't taken much further like other films(meaning the searching of the siblings.etc) but the film is more on entertainment then story  The film then focuses on love stories between Amitabh- Parveen, Rishi- Neetu.etc There are several entertaining scenes like Bachchan carrying Mukri to the hospital, Amitabh's long drunken monologue, Amitabh- Pran scene and many more There are too many songs though, like after the famous MY NAME IS ANTHONY GONSALVES in few minutes there is HUMKO TUMSE HO GAYA and PYAAR KE DUSHMAN   The film ends too in a slapstick manner with the disguises which also got famous and the long fight scene  Direction by MD is fabulous Music is good too  Amongst actors Though an esemble cast Amitabh towers above all and no doubt his character of Anthony became a rage and won him best actor award too He excelled in his character which is completely different from what Bachchan did mostly Vinod Khanna plays the cop role with elan and his last funny act is hilarious Rishi is a natural in his role and he is at his best towards the end Amongst the girls Neetu is alright, Shabana irritates, Parveen is very good Pran excels, Jeevan is as usual Hercules is okay
The movie begins when Kishenlal (Pran), a taxi driver for the gangster Robert (Jeevan) returns to his wife Bharati (Nirupa Roy) and sons after spending many years in prison because of a crime committed by Robert.
The song "My name is Anthony Gonsalves" is an absolute classic and himself talking into the mirror after being beaten up is another great scene.
The real dealmakers for the film, however, are Pran and Jeevan who respectively are devilishly fiendish as Kishenlal (reborn of course -- who can forget the brilliant "Sewer ka putter ..." sequence after spotting Robert on his return) and Robert, the antagonist to all.
If you expect the narrative to slow down after that, think again.
The movie goes through many different moods and emotions, but after the first 15 minutes of melodrama the tone is generally kept light and pleasant.
I guess the first one is closest to the "Night Gallery" series, but this film is much better than what comes after it because of Serling's strong involvement in every tale presented.
The third was the true classic, with Richard Kiley giving a masterfully performance of a vicious horrible creature, a Nazi war criminal who thinks he merits leniency after years on the run.
The plotlines follow the model of the 1950s horror pulp comics, with characters spoiling for their comeuppance: a black-sheep nephew suffers a revenge beyond the grave after murdering his rich uncle; a ruthless blind woman blackmails a surgeon into performing a transplant using the eyes of a desperate bum; a war criminal finds what he thinks is respite from his pursuers when he is miraculously transported into a museum painting.
The painting hangs in a museum, and he spends day after day in there just staring at it and eventually feels himself drawn into the painting.
But back in reality he's recognized as a Nazi who was condemned after the war, and a former camp inmate tells the police about him.
Earle Edgerton,(Tom), Judith Resnick (Laura) and Martin Barlorski (Dan) all made just this film or maybe two after this production.
The crowd scenes after the opening decapitation are fall down funny.
Indeed, this delectably dreadful dreck was paired with the equally atrocious, yet somehow oddly endearing dippy hippie terror trip-out "The Curse of the Headless Horseman" on a twice-the-tacky-terror twin feature offering that must have caused anyone who saw them together to either make an immediate beeline for the exit door 15-odd minutes into the first film or slump into their seats in a comatose stupor after the ending credits of the second picture finished rolling.
like i said its funny but its pretty darn good too.......................  the film is about people being filmed without knowing it and getting their reactions to unusual encounters mainly with nudity, like a naked lady asking for directions, one asks some ppl to kiss her, and a naked girl in an elevator, and then has video of ppl discussing the film after they watched it...........  so if you haven't seen this and you like stuff like candid camera and things like that you'll like this, but this is also more than that, so ya i recommend it, if you can ever find it
In fact, one of my favorite exchanges was when after Funt asked what a premature baby was, this boy said, "It's one who knows a lot for his age."
I also loved seeing that scene with that red-haired woman when she faked an orgasm after getting spray-painted!
However his cheeky charms were right for this role, Olivia Williams was average but passable, nice to see her in an British flick after her roles in 'Rushmore' and 'The 6th Sense'.
The story more or less revolves around her version of events, and after the first 30 minutes, you get the feeling that everything is not what it appears to be.
Shortly after that ended Armada started coming on Toonami.
It was being continually cast in these kind of films that made Powell leave Warner Brothers two years later after his contract was up.
That would convince me to spill the beans to a bunch of strangers after keeping my mouth shut for well over 50 years!
After constant pre-emptions and special episodes of "The Practice", "Miracles" was cancelled after only six episodes.
The Save Miracles Team, even after a year has passed, is still doing what it can to save the show.
It's a shame, because had attention been devoted at any stage to actually having characters or making the (actually quite promising) story more engaging it could have been pretty entertaining - the fighting is well executed after all, even if it's entirely one sided.
", or "Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan" in the English dub, starts off with our heroes relaxing and having fun after peace has been restored on Earth.
Also I noticed quite a few plot loopholes left dangling after the movie was over.
This movie is produced after the Macross Robotech series.
And still, even after all of these years, SDFM:DYRL not only holds up, but is still a force to be reckoned with.
Jim Varney was so funny my sides ached for days after watching him.
Olsen & Johnson are up to their same antics again, but after the opening scene of the Universal lot running for cover, the film can't maintain the pace of that scene or what made Hellzapoppin a laugh riot.
It may not be perfect, but after all I always like to watch the film when it's shown in TV every few years.
Schweiger has come a long way since DER BEWEGTE MANN ("Maybe, Maybe Not"), and in the process has single-handedly brought German cinema back to the masses after a half century of domination by the high brow author directors (Herzog, Fassbinder, Wenders) who made German cinema synonymous with boredom, and inaccessibility with the masses.
Directed by the emerging Mr. Till Schweiger, who usually plays the protagonist in many european movies (like the upcoming Star Trek, Star Wars bashing satire from Bulli Herbig after ManitouÂ´s Shoe) Imagine Brad Pitt doing a great road track movie...
Having just watched this movie for a second time, some years after my initial viewing, my feelings remain unchanged.
(I can still hum the main theme to "Heart of the Tiger," some six years after I last played it, and it still sends chills down my spine.)
Because it's something that mainstream Hollywood seems to not be able to get right after all these years of practice.
Or we're handed a world that is set up in a very deliberate, expert manner, then expected to accept the fact that anything goes, no matter how ridiculous or silly the film unfolds after the halfway point, like in Event Horizon.
The idea of naming those gravity wells after the two monsters from the Odyssey is definitely a nice touch.
The idea of the discrimination against the Pilgrims, and thus the hostility Chris Blair faces, adds an emotional side of film, along with the idea of not acknowledging one's existence after they've died.
Many references place the film in the time just after the declaration of war against the Kilrathi.
I keep wishing someone would release it on DVD-- especially with Nathan Lane's rising fame after coups like "The Producers" (and even Lion King), but it hasn't come out yet... great performances and typical sharp Lane humor.
He directed the first German movie after WWII, The Murderers Are Among Us, in 1946 with Ernst Borcert and Hildegard Kneff.
Like Der blaue Engel from 1930, Der Untertan is made after a famous novel by Heinrich Mann, the elder and politically more interested of the two German writer brothers.
Well, the director of the films sees the ghost, and immediately after he wakes up, begins to construct a bunch of things that resemble what he saw when the spirit came into his room.
Well, they finally find the house after a girl recognizes the house in one of the older movie maker's movies, only to find out that the older guy is going to blow it up for the grand finale of some movie.
Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck reunite after "Double Indemnity" and "Remember the Night" to star in this great unknown film, which is another Ross Hunter-produced and Douglas Sirk-directed picture.
Coming,in Sirk's career ,just after "All that Heaven allows" ,it looks like its twin movie.Unlike "Written on the wind" or "Imitation of life" or "Magnificent obsession" ,it's not melodrama.It's closer to realistic psychological drama.More than the lingering charm of a romantic past (Blue Moon/You saw me standing alone/Without a love of my own),Sirk focuses on the selfishness of the children.Remember in "All that Heaven..." how the son and the daughter could not admit that their mother (of the upper class) should fall in love with a gardener and how they bought her a TV set where she only could see the reflection of her loneliness.Here the boy's attitude is not far from that: a spoiled child -as his sisters are- ,only concerned by his studies and his love affair,he does not care if his papa has become a nine-to-five man ,useful only for the dough he brings home,a life no more exciting than that of the toy robot he sells.Barbara Stanwyck 's role recalls the 1953 effort "all I desire" : the return of the woman,be she legitimate or a former flame.But in "there's always tomorrow",one can notice one of the permanent features of melodrama though: the woman who turns her back on love and becomes a successful businesswoman (or star) (see also the end of "written on the wind" "imitation of life" or Stahl's "only yesterday")
The only thing I knew about the film was that it was about two musicians making found object music after some major crisis in the near future.
Sitting at a cafÃ© after seeing this film, I overheard the conversation of some hip thirty- somethings who had apparently been to the same session: "Â figured it would be a typical Japanese film with long superfluous shots of someone smoking a cigarette and all that Â".
He specialized in swashbucklers after he made some film noir thrillers at Universal.
They manage to catch one and they return after being gone for two weeks.
The commandant of the Foreign Legion orders Lieutenant Kruger to administer full honors to Kincaid after he pins on the medal.
; legionnaires who are punished for daring to look twice at their Lieutenant's fiancÃ©e; an Arab chieftain who marries off his daughter to a rival Sheik to bring peace between their warring tribes and in a bid to rid their country of the 'French' infidels; the kidnapping of that same feisty daughter who, not only turns the heads of all her ten titular captors but, after several escape attempts, eventually steals the heart of tough guy Lancaster; etc.
One final note: after searching high and low for this film on account of a friend of mine who is a big Burt Lancaster fan (and recalls the star's brief sojourn in Malta in the 1970s), ironically, it was he who eventually provided me with a means to catch up with it via a surprisingly well-preserved VHS-sourced copy he acquired!
Really you're every bit as out of touch with that class as are the poor old writers of Eastenders,who also seem to think that all their working class characters are fit for is barneying and throwing themselves at every passing bit of skirt 5 minutes after the wedding ceremony!
However for "all or nothing", after almost 2 hours of watching indifferently, near the end of the film I was crying with my whole body shaking (good thing it's an afternoon showing and only 10 ppl in the theatre).
Wow, not only is she a goddess and still looked great 10+ years after FYO, but she is a riveting actress.
He is an important member of the French resistance and arrested with his friends in a meeting after being betrayed.
The film revolves around Lucie and her attempts to rescue her husband, after he is arrested by the Gestapo at a Resistance meeting.
The show started out promising but quickly deteriorated after Shannen Doherty left the show.
I really liked watching it in the beginning because the characters seemed real but after Doherty left, everything fell apart.
  The hole ironically named after its major weakness (holes in the plot!)
Based on this movie the screenwriters probably spent under five minutes to read the actual book, after that they probably told the core story to their kids and asked what would be like really cool, so in come giant insects, pirates and whatever.
The also had pirates going after a treasure chest I don't remember any treasure chest in the book.
We deserve much better after 70 years and digital technology.
First of all, not only do our heroes react with hostility and violence when they finally encounter other normal human beings of the non-gigantic-man-eating-insect variety on the island, but after inviting them over to their humble Robinson Crusoe home, complete with dinner table, place settings for ten, goblets, eating utensils, candles, and the like, but once convinced of the defected pirates' trustworthiness, they give one of them - a caveman looking sort from years surviving on the island Â a total celebrity makeover, shave, haircut, gel, new clothes, etc.
Mulder and Scully just seem to give up on the case after Billy disappears too.
Chris Carter wrote Requiem not knowing whether or not the series would end after this episode.
I remember the Monday morning after THAT SINKING FEELING received its first broadcast on British television in 1982 , all my classmates were discussing it: " Did you see that bit where the guy said ... " and I remember thinking that my peers had been watching another film because I recalled distinctly hating it .
For an extremely low budget with a sometimes difficult to discern dialog (poor audio, though there is some noticeable re-dubbing), I was pleasantly surprised, especially after being disappointed with director Bill Forsyth's American comedy, "Breaking In."
The guest stars are varied and fascinating, allowing each episode to have a fresh and intriguing spin, while the long term story arcs keep the viewer coming back week after week.
I saw this film several years ago..fell asleep and I missed the ending of the movie .... what happened after she fell??????!!!!
The mystery is effectively spooky, and this was, after all, like the radio play, an effort to say "Boo!"
But after watching this 1, i fear meteors and the possibility of an intergalactic war far more worse now.
The Hole, based on the novel (after the Hole) by Guy Burt is a good exception to this.
This like it's going to be a good slasher at the beginning, when in the second scene, Bigman defeats another bikie in a jousting match with chains, then soon after another of his gang punches a nun to death, but it goes very quiet after that and never picks up.
The shopworn premise, basically just another rough'n'tumble post-nuke survivalist take on a classic Western movie scenario (the Fabers are clearly patterned after early settlers, with Strong as a heroic roving troubleshooter type and the bikers substituting for marauding Native Americans), doesn't promise much, but luckily the uniformly sound performances, unusually complex, well-drawn and even plausibly human characters, a welcome element of genuine humanity, Percival Rubens and Eric Brown's smart, surprisingly thoughtful and introspective script, a few unsettling oddball touches (Bigman has a severed doll's head affixed to the top of his motorcycle helmet), Rubens' capable direction, a sturdy theme which addresses how a man ought to fight for what's his and stand up for what he believes in (Ben refuses just to let the bikers destroy his farm without putting up a fight), an unsparingly harsh and savage tone (early in the picture the bikers raid a missionary and murder a bunch of nuns!
Richards' career has utterly tanked, and after seeing The Third Wheel, I cannot keep a straight face while calling this unjust.
Either this editor gave up after reel upon reel of barely cohesive footage, in which case it is the directors fault, or he simply cut the footage together in such a manner as to give it no transition, as a sort of practical joke.
It's filled with interviews that just becomes too much of the same after a while.
It makes the movie very tiresome and boring to watch, already after the a couple of minutes.
Court and Ip cleverly do not change the scenario as much as you might expect after the first couple variations.
Person after person, every participant in this unwatchable boring mess says nothing but stereotypical b.s.
Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers starts six weeks after the death of teenager Gail Bowers (Erica Roby) mom & dad as she moves to a new home in a new state with her now legal guardians her older sister Anne (Noel Thurman) & her husband Clark Pederson (Griff Furst).
Yes that's right, after seeing the skin on her face literally fall off she takes her clothes off (gratuitous breast shot included) & takes a shower.
To begin with, Spanish Horror cinema is one before and after this movie.
Finally after a long wait I got the chance to check out this flick, and what a damn shame I wasn't more safe when buying it the first time, because this was a really good flick.
Specifically I was after more work by that classic's storied supporting cast: Paul Henried, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, S.Z.
Only after the initial intriguing premise is set in motion do we discover to our amusement that all the characters we've become interested in are fairly despicable, particularly Geraldine Fitzgerald as a sociopath and nymphomaniac.
This ambience is lost after some badly directed action and almost ruins the following helicopter distorted lens sequence, meandering us through the unwelcoming landscape like a drunkard.
One Sunday (after hearing how good it was from so many people)I was at the video store and decided to pick it up just to give it a try.
Anyways after 30 minutes the guys are around 30 years old or something and wearing suits and all that business-like styled persona.
Poor Maurice, all he meant to do the day he met Georges was collect knick-knacks to help the poorÂ Instead he ends up being forced Â (after a little convincing) to pretend he is George's wife in order to help him hide the affair that his mistress is about to reveal and, in the end, discovers the feminine side he was never aware off.
I didn't see part 1 or part 2 of this film but after catching part 3 just 15 minutes away from the beginning, I was hooked.
It's also weird watching Victor Jory play the hero, after seeing him play the bad guy in many Hopalong Cassidy movies; he's somewhat more convincing as a bad guy than as a good guy.
Our story beings with two really bad rapper wanna-bes and there brain dead girl friends, after getting stoned, got get from a Drive-thru restaurant at 2 AM!
Won after the movie becomes this miss-mess of ideas, from other, better, movies.
I just thought of this film after about forty years and remembered it as a real funny feature picture.
It is particularly puzzling, that Kevin Coughlin's movie career should have ended after this, his most successful film.
Pls, do not forget if you get into watching this movie you will be able to leave the projection, go to business lunch, come back after an hour and you will not need anyone to tell you what happened meanwhile.
i was just flicking through channels when i saw an ad for reaper....directed by Kevin smith....now this came as a surprise to me as I'm usually up to date with his works....a regular on the IMDb page as well as the message boards...so decided to give it a go....mostly anything Kevin smith does (despite saying that after jay and silent bob strike back he was quiting the industry...) is good in my book :) and i was pleased to see that this was no exception....the plot is great...and not (as another user posted) like Shaun of the dead...similarities in certain things perhaps...but clearly not based on Shaun of the dead... i would however recommend this series to any fan of Kevin smith or even any fan of comedy...its a warm light hearted comedy about a kid whose just really not had the best start to being 21...:)
You might trick yourself into thinking it is mildly clever after one or two episodes, but you'll soon realize this show has less tricks up its sleeve than a magician in a nudist colony.
he must lie, make up lame excuses and keep secrets from her), it actually gets moving after a while.
He's the sort of character you either love or loathe (he proved to be the latter for me, after having witnessed his animal cruelty in the 'Pilot').
There are many shows this season that have had a great premise only to drag and loose my interest after just a few episodes.
Its one of the best shows and has great amounts of laughs and after an hour of jokes that don't bore you down I must say Reaper is here to stay AND the CW has got a winner in this one.
Whatever happened to the Surfer culture in California after the attention of the rest of the world turned away?
I expected more by this movie, and let's admit that after having watched Fandango, I was a little disappointed, although some good elements are to be appreciated.
Unlike the others he did very little after 1984, the year he released "Red Dawn", an embarrassingly moronic and histrionic right-wing propaganda film that alerted an unsuspecting world to his extremist political views.
Anyone who has had to choke back their emotions after a nostalgic rush reminds them of what they will never have again, will be moved my this wonderful sequence.
after being queried about his surfing.
I gave up after an hour, though it failed the 20 minute rule where at that point I realise it hadn't captured my imagination.
At the heart of this movie is this purity... and after the draft, relationships, addictions, and just plain adolescent insanity, the characters find that their friendship is still alive because of a common love.
The angst never really gets out, and it stays with you long after the credits role.
And I have not seen too many of them done after that, which can pass the test of time quite as strongly.
The way Quinn and Franciosa interrogate doesn't leave too much room for difference, except that Quinn's subjects were still breathing after it was over.
Barry Shear directed and Luther Davis wrote (after a novel by Wally Ferrsi) Across 110th Street in 1972 and the film stars Anthony Quinn as Mattelli and Yaphet Kotto as Pope.
Across 110th Street has some pretty non-believable scenes and segments, which are not explained too carefully and seem little unconvincing, but they are very few and are easy to forgive after all the merits and positive things this film gives.
Disguised as cops, three black crooks steal a big amount of cash after killing five syndicate runners and two policemenÂ The New York police and the Mafia react with immediate concernÂ   Tough police veteran Captain Frank Mattelli (Quinn) resents the intrusion of Lieutenant Pope (Kotto), a black detective, in the case, while Mafia boss Don Gennaro (Frank Mascetta) sends his paranoid son-in-law, Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), to reassert control over the Harlem branch and see that the money is recoveredÂ   The black syndicate, headed by Doc Johnson (Richard Ward) and his assistant Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), rejects D'Salvio, while promising only token help, and accuses Mattelli, who has been on the take from Johnson for yearsÂ   Anthony Quinn plays well the ageing detective who has long ago perceived that all his efforts are not going to do more than raise the very small part of the cover of crime, but he is not above taking a bribe from a racketeerÂ His method of dealing with a reluctant witness is to hit hard first and ask questions laterÂThe rigorously legal approach to police work, as exemplified by Yaphet Kotto, is not for QuinnÂ This is his territory, his little kingdom, and he keeps the peace as best he knowsÂ
Of course, after the second tape, he moves forward with disastrous results, but Charlotte exposes her secret to Lionel and it is just the thing to shut him up.
Alas, none of the six are really happy, hardly even content; the bible-reading Azema possibly comes closest, smiling as she cleans up after unseen invalid Claude Rich - even cleaning HERSELF up when he throws food over her; Isabelle Carre is a little young to be the sister of Andre Dussollier but given her loveliness there's no real reason for her to pursue true love in the Lonelyhearts columns.
Here is another rarely-seen anime film I had watched online, and after I did I love it.
Finally, Algaroc was imprisoned by the King of Gods himself, but after that time, the brother and sister still despised each other, so the Children of Fire and Water forever remained apart.
Remember, these images were stronger in the minds of those who saw this film in 1952, because it was just seven years after these totalitarian regimes were defeated.
With Johnny leaving a wife and young son behind and nobody to look after them Tommy gives her his share of the purse.
At the Carson Estate, where Cain told Tommy that he rented out, Tommy, after meeting Carson's daughter Sheila, realized that Carson is really Wall Street Banker James W. Carson.
In one final and unselfish act Mr. McCoy became the father to Tommy that up until then he never was; you can just guess what happened in that faithful eight round after The battered and almost beaten Tommy McCoy heard that bit of news.
It was great to see it again after 25 plus years.
They play detectives out to catch "The Gorilla", a man who kills people after sending them threats 24 hours in advance.
I expected a lot more from this film after all the hype.
I realized after, when I watched the DVD out-takes, that this was based on a TV series so that may be a reason for those difficulties.
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD.
Wallace (perhaps a bit too easily) finds his father, a bearded man named Heraldo (Rodrigo dos Santos), who has just gotten out of prison after serving fifteen years of a twenty-year sentence--for murder.
A few years after the "City of God" fame, Meirelles and other collaborators including Director Paulo Morelli decided to produce a Brazilian TV episodic series entitled "City of Men" on the same premise.
Heraldo is out on parole after having served fifteen years of a twenty year sentence for robbery and murder.
It is a very sensitive telling of events after the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off Peggy's Cove Nova Scotia.It's a terrific tear jerker but not in any shallow sense.
Even after 10 minutes the music mesmerized me, it sounded like "Hans Zimmer's - Gladiator,(Lisa Gerrard).
I had to leave already after 30 minutes but those 30 minutes of movie where enough for me to understand that "Blessed Stranger" is NOT a pulp movie.
This movie tackled closure, which is probably the hardest part of grieving, especially after a disaster.
Starting at the end and working back the first thing I, take issue with is the dedication at the end credits "To Walter Lord" the one human who strove to explore and find the truth about the wreck of the Titanic and all things related to it (his uncle was captain of the California, the ships captain charged with not coming to the aide of the Titanic, finally cleared of the charges after his death).
Then we're told that, anyway and after all, the little guy was "quite expensive."
gave me a serious headache, and a sick stomach; both hung around for more than an hour after the movie.
Again after a year, the show had a large following but there was not enough room in the prime time schedule for an average sitcom in the age of Cosby Show's success.
Like Charles in Charge, Mama's Family was cancelled after 2 seasons.
It's obvious they wanted to try something different for the Columbo series, as they tried numerous times before and after this movie as well.
At first I thought this would be a Santa Clause rip-off, but after seeing it, I would recommend it to anyone.
Immediately after its initial TV Presentation, the local TV station did a news segment on it.
The first time I saw this movie I thought it was kind of dumb but after seeing it again I began to realize it was'nt so bad.
Meanwhile detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) for the past four years has been trying to discover the identity of a powerful drugs dealer known as the Iceman, after a shoot out with one of the Iceman's men Jack finds a picture of Reggie & figures he can help him find the Iceman.
Much like the car chase in "Bullitt"; its the part you remember years after you've forgotten the plot of the film.
Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting.
In "Another 48 Hours", Cates and Hammond go after a man known only as th "Ice Man".
It was funny when Reggie finally took the lighter from Cates after he was shot.
Eight years after the original 48 Hrs., this sequel was released.
Jack has been after a drug dealer named the Ice Man.
I thought it had a great twist on who was the main bad guy after all.
Unfortunately the audience discovers after paying the price of admission, that if you want another 48 Hours, watch the original.
The remaining interest in this film lies in the historical/cultural themes: The war (referenced only in regard to minor plot points - the characters seem scarcely affected except that they're scolded for leaving their lights on after curfew), and the role of astrology in American society (it seems to be have been perceived as a way for idle, reasonably well-off women to be parted from their money).
Right after that, Vicky realizes how much William loves her and leaves all the predictions aside.
The heavenly body also refers to Whitley's comet, a comet to be named after her husband.
There would be worse episodes after the series was revived and wrung out, but this is certainly one of the weakest of the original series, despite the talent in front of, and behind, the camera.
Duvall stars as a wayward preacher who, after one too many run-ins with his ex-wife and her new lover, finds himself on the run and wanted for murder.
My Mother had passed away a year after this film came out and I had not taken it very well, not very well at all.
For a year, I went into complete solitude, intoxicated night after night, day by day.
If we had immediately seen the police coming for Duvall after that, it would have served as a great coda to reminds us that within sinners like Billy, there are saints/good men, and within "apostles" like Duvall, there are sinners.
This is a powerful story of a very flawed-but very sincere Pentecostal preacher from Texas who flees after slugging his adulterous wife's lover with a baseball bat, killing him, as it turns out.
After affixing the Disney brand to five--count 'em, five--Air Bud installations, all laughable after the first one broke some modest ground (and prompted rumors from PETA that Buddy the dog was killed by bone spurs resulting from wearing tennis shoes in filming), any affiliation with this travesty must be purely contractual.
What I saw was the male lead chase the female lead after she had been teasing him, then he wrestled her and pinned her down to introduce her to Western-style kissing.
I have no idea who anyone is in this movie and to tell you the truth after being dragged along for a while I didn't care.
In the third act however--that is, after Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome--he seems to grow in the part and his acting gains conviction.
I saw this movie almost immediately after watching Veronika Decides to Die, another film just released based on a book (by Paolo Coelho).
Gladly after about 15 minutes the movie settled into a very nice love story with a great time jumping twist and Eric Bana got better and better as the story went along.
I'll admit that after reading some early remarks about Robert Schwentke's cinematic version I was very worried, in fact so much so that my expectations were somewhat low.
You pull for them to live happily ever after and frankly that is what a good romantic drama should do.
And moments after that, his future self (Eric Bana) arrives to assure him that things will get better.
What I liked most was its metaphorical allusion to the distance in relationships and how the important people in our lives stay with us even after they are gone.
I watched this film in Poland, the fatherland of Agnieszka Holland, after being attacked and robbed in a dark alley earlier that holiday-trip.
It was after my mother died recently, I saw it on HBO.
The accompanying music is wonderful -- I find myself humming it for days and days after watching it.
The screenplay omits two short passages that are important to the plot: (1) Cassius' avowal in the first act, after his attempt to persuade Brutus to oppose Caesar, that if their positions were reversed and he, Cassius, stood as well with Caesar as Brutus does, and Brutus made a comparable appeal to him, he would certainly not listen.
(2) Immediately after the assassination, a promise by Brutus to Antony's servant of safe conduct for Antony, who thus knows when he comes to the Capitol and weeps over Caesar's body, challenging the conspirators to kill him also, that there is no danger of their doing so.
The action is nearly non existant, the sci fi was thin and stretched but the zombies were just ok. That majority of this movie is movie is cliche after cliche and you almost always know whats going to happen next.
Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice.
But after watching this movie i must say the scares were quite refreshing as in they were not your standard kind of horror.
When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil.
She has no memory of who she is or why she's here, but after a group of soldiers bursts in and takes her to a hidden lab underneath the mansion with them, she quickly begins to realize a terrible secret.
I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down.
In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible, the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the T-Virus released into the air vent, after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated.
One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once.
Esslin becomes a Vampire, after being ravished by Khorda.
There's no happy ending, and the final despair stayed with me a long time after that first viewing.
Unless you're the sort of person who, after hearing a brief description of the plot, would be curious, it's probably not going to satisfy you, or come across as being silly.
The film is definitely of it's time, quite dated, but a fascinating curio for Quarry fans who are very familiar with his Yorga character, but not Khorda(..this film was sandwiched between the Yorga films according to Quarry)who is dressed in elaborate robes, jewelry, and long hair carrying the appearance of some guru or oddball prophet..Quarry admits in the audio commentary that his look is fashioned after Charles Manson and that the film itself regarding the hippie youth was modeled after his followers.
Robert Quarry co-produced this venture after the unexpected and phenomenal success of the two "Count Yorga" features, but it did not hold up to expectation at the box-office.
Here's what Robert Quarry did after Count Yorga, if you're interested: he donned a wig and caftan and became a Charlie Manson type hippie guru vampire.
Well they decide to fight back and go after a tank stationed at their track.
The fans of this series (movie and comic) could not get enough as I'm sure you will feel the same after seeing this Masterpiece.
The story is, as many say, somewhat themed after Shakespeare's classic "Romeo & Juliet", however, the mixture of vibrant Fantasy and animation makes this far more memorable (And I am a lover of R&J).
I'm not an expert on porno-storylines but I don't find it very erotic to see people die after having sex.
When the first husband turns up alive after a year on a desert island, the woman has two legal husbands.
In this case the wife remarries - not only after six months but also to her "dead" husband's business partner!
Arthur marries MacMurray's business partner Douglas after the former is presumed to have drowned in an accident.
The plot device of having a person show up after an absence on a Pacific Island and after being declared dead, only to find their spouse married to another person served comically for Irene Dunne in MY FAVOURITE WIFE and Fred MacMurray in this trifle, adapted from a Somerset Maugham play.
Arthur plays a woman married to the best friend of her dead husband, who's mighty surprised when her dead husband turns out not to be so dead after all.
Businessman's wife, widowed for one year before marrying her deceased husband's best friend, finds out her first husband is still alive; he was believed by the Coast Guard to have drowned after the sinking of his ship, but instead was rescued off an island.
When I first heard the premise;a spouse declared dead comes back home after months alone on an island , only to find his beloved wife has re-entered marital bliss with his best friend, I thought 'it'll be interesting to see if they come anywhere near the brilliance of "My Favorite Wife"' And I also presumed this had to be a rather blatant rip-off of the Cary Grant-Irene Dunne classic released ,incidentally, in the same year.
Louis Wolheim is Nick Scarsi, Chicago gangland boss obviously modeled after one Alphonse Capone, who doesn't care who he has to steamroll over to get his way.
Howard Hughes produced the film, which was painstakingly restored after disappearing for more than 50 years (complete with a brand new musical score especially written for its restoration).
The film does hold up after 80 years now, and it's still an entertaining precursor of a genre that's largely gone today.
I commenting Mega Man 2 after beating it a lot of years since I beat it the first time.
But that's the entertaining side of this thing after all.
David Zucker started with Scary movie 3 after the Wayans brothers stop making sequels.
But after seeing Date Movie, which was the worst movie i've ever seen, I felt the need to point out some things about Scary Movie 4 that Date Movie is obviously lacking.
The jokes in this movie made sense, had many pop-culture references, weren't extremely dragged out, and flowed with the over-all story, wheres Date Movies jokes where just one, hollow, interchangeable joke after another...
I would of origanlly given this movie a 5 or a 6, but after seeing Date Movie, i'm grateful for people like David Zucker, and i'm giving it a 7.
I don't know if it's because I watched it an hour after slamming my finger in the car door and I had cried myself into heaves and needed something to laugh at.
I mean, the flick wasn't even funny after the opening sequence with Shaq and Dr. Phil in a saw-like peril.
NO SEQUEL"...I can see that it's stuck to it's word, seeing as they did change that after the second one was released.
But after a couple weeks I really enjoyed it and actually hated leaving during the day because I would miss it.
We then go to our hero from the first three, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who has taken a job looking after an old lady in an old mansion.
Instead of being purely a documentary, the narrator introduces us to Verus, our lead, within the first few minutes... after which, he joins in the narrating.
The power (literally) goes to his head and, now, let's fast forward to the presentÂ ÂBrothers reunite after one went missing for two years, and older brother, Victor (Purcell) leads his younger sibling, Evan (Cavill) to a sectioned off/private farmland to shoot up the inhabitants.
Quite possibly the best thing I can say about this film is that after seeing this as a kid I wanted to join the Merchant Navy, and I did, and I'm training to be an Engineer Officer, as these film clearly shows engineers are brilliant and deckies useless.
Then there's the fact that this is a movie from a time long forgotten - a time when smoking cigarettes on screen was accepted and normal, when the PC brigade wasn't around and you could light up whenever and wherever you wanted - these guys go through pack after pack - in the car, in the office (god forbid..), and Boyle even lights up while his colleagues are having lunch right next to him.
When Oscar realizes after a while that their relationship has reached the point of no return he tries to break it up.
- but there has been lot of good stuff after overrated 1980s.
I'm no fan of Hugh Grant, in fact I hate the man, but he's exactly the right casting choice for this movie and it's almost a shame that he went on to make lots of rubbish movies after it.
As the title suggests, Flo becomes inconvenient, particularly after Jules dies suddenly.
It's a little hard to imagine Lana Turner going on to a big career after her encounter with Douglas, just as it is hard in real life.
Angry (why is never explained) at Hollywood in general, he vows after the funeral to become a success in order to throw the name Shields back in everyones' face.
She does have one marvelously comical (unintentionally so) scene where she drives like a maniac after finding out that Jonathan doesn't love her (the heel!).
Still enjoyable after all these years.
Barry Sullivan disappears after Lana shows up, not to be seen until the end.
It wasn't a total waste of money though, I have a younger brother and sister who were born after the Thundercat era and have grown up on the "new" 3d cartoons (that have absolutely no morals or lesson to be learned) so seeing them watch the series was OK I guess!
I have to admit that i was always in to Transformers and He-man more than Thundercats but it didn't stop me from enjoying it every week after school on TV.
When I was growing up in the 60's I used to go matinÃ©es and watch Hercules and even the later TV series with Kevin Sorbo as Hercules.I read that Hercules is the son of Zeus and as the years passed into my later 40's I finally grew to accept there is only one God.The one who counts and God made it clear in His 1st Commandment Thou Shalt Not Have No Other gods Before Me.Zeus is a (false god) I used to think the Hercules films and TV show and even the cartoon were great,But after God wrote His Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai which I call The Capitol Of God's World was all I needed to know God is the only God,all other gods and goddesses are false and they go against God's 1st Commandment.So it was written by My Father.
At first I found it boring but as I persisted watching the show I realised it that it's not that boring after all.
In the end, both brothers die, Herc is reunited with his wife, and they live happily ever after.Well not exactly, but they lived ever after.
For some reason, every character is named after a Greek or Roman god.
Hercules becomes amnesiac after drinking from the waters of Lethe.
If you're after a glossy, American-style fable of women winning through despite insurmountable odds, look elsewhere.
It was interesting to watch the effects on their lives after the publicity and this is something which The Full Monty did not touch on.
But after seeking unanimous approval, they embark on doing the calendar.
In the end, after their American promotion, and a bit of banter they return of England, and it says that they have raised a lot of money for a leukemia charity, and to buy a sofa dedicated to John.
The first is I watched this movie on DVD and found myself needing the subtitles and after I put them on I found myself enjoying the movie more.
"Calendar Girls" is the story of two best friends, Annie and Chris (both expertly cast), who set out to raise money for the local hospital after Annie's husband is stricken with terminal cancer.
This is a type example of a show which just have gone on and on, years after it should have been canceled.
I'm proud to be of that number--after all, at the age of thirty-five I'm ten years out of the target demographic at which Hollywood films are aimed.
Aside from that, as a film, it gets a little too didactic towards the end (it was more emotionally involving before his conversion than after); however, Raul Julia's performance is superb.
The movie details the life of Oscar Romero after being appointed Archbishop.
The first portion of the film is admittedly not the best editing, but after that it is bordering on great.
"A Day with the Boys" by Clu Gulager follows a group of boys as they are playing war games of childhood.The boys are only playing:burying the adult character/businessman alive after quick execution.Suddenly the camera is panning to reveal that they have killed others.The grave of the victim is marked with his suitcase and there are three similar graves marked with their own deceased occupants' emblems:an umbrella,a basket and a child's doll.Gorgeously photographed by Laszlo Kovacs "A Day with the Boys" looks like a painting with freeze-frames and dissolving images.The innocent darkness within children is stunningly revealed.An unsettling and poignant work of art.9 out of 10.
But in between, and a little after, these two blockbusters, a series of unfortunate events (not the Lemony Snicket kind) became stumbling blocks in the industry: among these mediocre messes came "Pride", "Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy", "The Polar Express", and now this--the most recent, most hilarious, and most horrible attempt at a comeback--"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot".
That being said, and the fact that I still love the Bears as a 18-year-old, gives this fourth instalment my most solid vote of 7 after "Jetsons: The Movie" and "Hocus Pocus".
At first, I actually had no idea that Billy Blanks was an actor, but after seeing the poster for this film, my interest had been captured.
The movie centers around veteran police office Frank Rossi, played by Piper, who after his partner Wallace is brutally gutted by a ruthless drug gang, becomes bent on avenging his partner's death.
Rossi and Billy eventually team up after a number of confrontations when Billy's sister and Rossi's reporter girlfriend Helen (Played by Bobbie Phillips) are kidnapped by Kasajian's gang.
remains after more than a quarter century one of the most perfect reflections of the gradual process by which the Holocaust could have happened in a Europe which believed itself civilized.
The beginning of de Sica's film follows the state of affairs in Italy shortly after the Fascist government of Mussolini has declared the ordinary tennis clubs off limits for Italian Jews-just the beginning for the Government's separatist stance.
The Jews in town react in various ways: Giorgio, who is in love with the daughter of the Finzi-Continis, is enraged; his father his philosophical; Giorgio's brother is upset only after being sent to France to study, and later, finding out to his horror about the German concentration camps.
I watched "Two" on a local syndicated station every Saturday night, and it came on after the 11:00 news.
Coming after a couple of stories , one of which is considered to be a modern classic ( The Impossible Planat/Satan Pit ) while the other ( Love And Monsters ) is one of the most radical pieces of television produced Fear Her was never going to be all that well received , but its Luke warm reception is to do mainly with the fact it's a very dull predictable story   If you watched the " next time " trailer from the previous week then you'll know in advance as to what the story is about and therefore there's no suspense .
By contrast, films of real events can be full documentaries which were filmed only in advance or concurrently; or semi-documentaries in which some of the essential scenes have had to be fictionally, but as accurately as possible, reconstructed and filmed after the event.
The central metaphor of the film is a medieval wooden statue of Mary, recently excavated after being buried for centuries - like Gould's and Andersson's potential to be lovers or man and woman.
David has drinking and smoking problems and after a dinner party at the Vergerus's home, he confesses his infatuation for Karin to her.
This declaration revives her sensuality and femininity, which were forgotten after fifteen years of stable and loyal marriage.
I don't know why this film has such a poor reputation -- I'm very much baffled after having seen it.
Anyone who has worked in a store after hours has either done or thought of doing what happened in this movie.
"Career Opportunities" starts off promising enough, but after an hour it slips into "Home Alone" territory and becomes silly.
It has many funny and marked scenes as when Jim, with bride clothes and walking of skids sees Josie and falls after that.
Explain to me why after this Frank Whaley did not turn into a huge star?
It was really unnecessary to have the whole trapped in the store after hours and then have Connelly and Whaley held hostage.
I write this 18 years after this movie came out and she still is the hottest woman in Hollywood.
But she looks amazing here as Whaley discovers after they've locked him inside the store for the night, to look after things and tidy up.
But I'm a very picky viewer (I currently watch about 5 hours/week), and after watching several episodes I find the show's shortfalls put it right at the borderline between what I think is worth watching and what is not.
Sorry, but I think after viewing this, there's no doubt that Ed Wood should have ranked up there with Steven Speilberg for one of the greatest directors who ever breathed.
Okay, now, if you're not aghast yet, imagine a subplot about a pretty lady out to find her missing sister, only to find out she has gotten into drugs with a group of bikers, who are now after her sister's best friend.
And how did Dracula destroy the Monster so easily, tearing him limb from limb, after the Monster demonstrated he has superior strength by punching through several walls and tearing a car door from its hinges.
because they think she's a cop, and after a bad trip she wakes up in Anthony Eisley's bed.
The cops are already after them, but even more troubles arise when the echo-voiced Count Dracula (Zandor Vorkov) arrives and blackmails the mad doc into resurrecting the Frankenstein monster and giving him the blood of his victims!
Technically Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is a bit of a mess, there are some awful day-for-night shots, the performances have to be seen to be believed, the music gets on the nerves after a while, the props & sets are cheap & the photography is point & hope for the best stuff.
A year after they appeared together in "Love Finds Andy Hardy", Lana Turner and Ann Rutherford were paired up in two 1939 films: "These Glamour Girls" and "Dancing Co-Ed".
I saw this on Lifetime sometime after it had originally aired and it dawned on me on whether or not this girl's decision would have been as difficult had this been about a girl who had been adopted and then had found her birth parents.
It also could have been a much different flick if she had appeared to the Sands (her biological parents) after having been married and expecting.
I watched the film about a fortnight after I read the book.
We do not get this sense of irony because the movie is CONTRIVED, some examples being: how Alex just happens to run into everyone he ever did wrong one day after getting out of jail (the bum, his droogs, the cripple), or how after Alex luckily is not recognized by the cripple, he goes on to sing the SONG HE SANG WHILE BEATING HIM AND RAPING HIS WIFE while in the cripple's house, as if he were the most idiotic person in the world, which he is obviously not.
It is believed that in pre-earth life, Lucifer proposed that everyone who comes to earth be forced to do good, so that everyone will be worthy to return to God's presence after death, therefore 'no souls will be lost' -- however, he wanted the credit for this plan.
It is hilarious to see a detective trying to work while fighting extreme obsessive/compulsive behavior, as well as germaphobia strong enough to merit using anti-bacterial wipes after every handshake.
I saw this movie on it's original release and thought that it was just an exciting and hilarious ground breaking film ( I believe it had an X rating for a while ), and after seeing it again on DVD - I think it's a masterpiece.
How Alex's parents disown him after he returns home from a correctional center?
I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it.
The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing.
The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity.
He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies.
It's funny, after you watch a film many times you begin to fall in love with it.
No one could replace Stanley Kubrick and after the intitial tears I bought his boxed set and tried to make the best out of a bad situation.
One night, after killing a woman with numerous cats, Alex's gang turns on him and leaves him at the hands of the law.
Stanley Kubrick remains to this day, even after his death, as one of the best filmmakers of all time.
What it does, though a series of "sessions," is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.
"A Clockwork Orange," which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating (that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture), had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years.
Its characters, its style, its subject matter, its explicit material--all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling.
Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, "A Clockwork Orange" is indeed as offbeat as its title.
It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.
Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today.
A typical murder mystery might be deciphered halfway through, with the protagonist fingering the villain in the third act, and everyone goes on to live happily ever after.
Into this milieu writer (with Mark Boal) and director Paul Haggis places this painful examination of the effects and aftershocks of war in the persona of a father whose only son is reported as 'missing' after he has returned from his tour of duty in Iraq.
Unfortunately, the reason his son is AWOL is because he has been murdered, which is discovered shortly after Jones arrives.
It is true that, after parts of the mystery are revealed, some parts that you learned earlier don't make much sense.
Paul Haggis (a genius well known after Academy Award winning "Crash") tries to ask and answer provocative questions and his new film disturbs, heats and moves a lot, every character being powerful.
I guess after years of service in a uniformed group, you can't deny that some of the habits, good and bad, stick to you after discharge.
When writing for others (Clint Eastwood, the Bond franchise), Paul Haggis delivers one masterpiece after another.
In particular, he focuses on Hank Deerfield (the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones, in a role originally meant for Eastwood), a Vietnam veteran whose faith in American values is tested when he learns his youngest son has gone MIA after returning from a tout of duty in the Middle East.
Hank knowing that something is wrong in that Michael being the gong-ho army man that he is would never leave his unit, here in the safe and free good old USA, this after searing 18 months in the Iraqi war-zone.
It's not long after that a badly burned decomposed and dismembered body is found just outside of the Army base.
The distress that his and Joan's lives turned out to be after their son Michael came marching home from war!
In what may be his finest performance yet, underrated actor Tommy Lee Jones plays an old, grizzled and retired military police sergeant who receives word his youngest son (Jonathon Tucker - Hostage, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is missing after being back in the states from fighting in Iraq just two days ago.
She looks raw and unglamorous and spends a large part of the movie with a Band Aid over her nose after TL Jones inadvertently lands a punch in her face.
Almost set aside as merely the mother, (whose job, after all, as a mere girly, was just to give birth to and raise her sons.
As Hank Deerfield, a proud and meticulously organized retired army veteran and patriot, his presence fills screen after screen with emotional persuasion to lead the audience through an astonishingly thought-provoking journey.
Loosely based on the story of Richard Davis who was killed by fellow soldiers in Columbus, Georgia after returning from Iraq in 2003, In the Valley of Elah, Paul Haggis' first feature since his Oscar winner Crash is a poignant reminder of how war robs people of their humanity.
In one of the best performances of his career, Tommy Lee Jones is Hank Deerfield, a career military man whose son Mike (Jonathan Tucker) is reported as AWOL from his New Mexico base after returning from eighteen months in Iraq.
A grizzled, former military policeman, Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), is notified that his son, Mike, is AWOL after returning from the fighting in Iraq.
I like the way he kept the camera back at the end of the hallway when Mrs. Deerfield cried into her husband's arms after viewing the mutilated body of her son.
I signed up for this membership to say something after reading all the negative comments on this movie.
Takeshi's third film (after "Violent Cop" and "Boiling Point") seems to of hit the right note in blending quirky humour and sudden violence.
Also the suicide at the end threw me.....why kill yourself after taking all of the assholes out?
She knows and has learnt many things about life by the end scene, and make sure you watch the film thoroughly and the end credits, too, as there is more imagery after the credits.
It is no secret that he tried to commit suicide in real life shortly after the completion of Sonatine.
Yes, it maybe seen as a sad act to name a login after a film but for me Tekeshi Kitano has yet to direct a better film and Sonatine will haunt me for all sorts of reasons for years to come, especially the excellent score from Joe Hisaishi.
(But you may after you watch this movie.)
Even years after, hearing Joe Buck call the short shot to the left field corner still sends chills up and down my back.
adrian monk..a detective who is suffering from a very mild obsessive compulsive actions but they develop to a disorder that made him on a medical suspension right after the murder of his wife...the reason that lead monk to such complications is that he is certain that he was the target of the bombing that lead to his wife's death..and guilt distorted his vision that even his genius mind can't concentrate when it comes to his wife's case... monks methods accompanied by his disorder is giving a great flavor to that amazing series..especially that sherlock holmes and Agatha christy made it very hard for others to show us more characters in the world of crimes and mystery...but monk came from nowhere with the help of the talent of tony shalhoub( or should i say mr.monk).. and no doubt that all characters -either guests or permanent- were amazing and participated very helpfully in that work... just to save you time to go and order the whole series i would like to tell you one word that describes this masterpiece.....  FLawLESS
My original vote for this drama was a 6 but after reflection, I raised the vote to a 7 because some of the scenes were so very haunting.
If this movie doesn't pull at your heartstrings for any reason, then consider the irony of having gone through all that Maris did to break this record and have it noted in the record book that he did it in a longer season and the final irony of having that decision reversed after his death.
Produced very shortly after Mark McGwire broke the Maris record, Crystal framed the 1961 story with scenes from the McGwire run.
Good little touches like Maris' special eggs (which Mantle began to eat with reluctance, but came around when Maris said he hit home runs after eating them), scrap book collections shown periodically throughout the film, the song 'I love Mickey', and other audio-visual pieces of baseball memorabilia make this a baseball trivia-buff treat.
And in response to witnessing by former Yankees teammate Bobby Richardson, who became a minister after retiring from baseball, Mantle repented and became a Christian.)
manmadhan is a must-watch flick for all movie-lovers,youngsters and particularly the NEW GENERATION GIRLS.the theme of the movie was very apt to modern times and the taking of the film was good.specifically the screenplay of the movie was too good,very appreciative on simbhu's part.in other movies they really do not show to the viewers,on the screen,something which turns out to be......-i just don't wanna reveal.simbhu is too young to make someone like me to expect such amazing work from him.becoz i always thought simbhu lacks smart looks.but only after watching manmadhan did i realise that for an actor -his/her looks count nothing at all-all that matters is the FINE SKILL OF ACTING that lies within him/her.simbhu's performance as a "pretending to be a psycho" in the beginning of the movie was really cool.Oh no...!!!!!
This is Simbu's take after newly emerging heroes donning psychotic roles.
A very disturbing show that you cannot stop thinking about for at least weeks after watching it!
That was what I was asking myself after painfully having to go through the entirety of the utter crap that was Manmadhan.
The worst part is, after going through three hours of intense pain and suffering, the films ends with "To be continued".
after all, it is a Hit and most of the Tamil people like it.
Now, two years and two days after Schultz's death, a new cartoon is made.
Scene after scene, joke after joke, flops like a dead fish.
When they finally get to the scene involving the Valentine's Day dance, nothing happens and it is cut off after less than three minutes there.
Charles Schulz requested (though since he did not hold the copyright to Peanuts he could not demand) that no one create any new Peanuts stories after his death.
Directly after it comes "The Psychic," a huge step down.
Obviously there's terrorists (Russian Terrorsits :O) dodgy Russian's, one of the climbing team has mysteriously been killed so the leader has asked his old climbing friend to join them who is now a monk after him and the leader lost a friend on a climb.
The ones where someone with the fear of flying lands the airplane with one wing, no wheels and after all the crew die after all drinking coffee spiked by a scorned lover, while callous Corporate overlords cover up the shoddy maintenance schedule of the aircraft.
I've seen most of "Monk" episodes, although I didn't begin to watch until sometime after it began.
That's the question I asked myself after watching "23".
His empathy with the character is profound, and rather than some quirky stereotype, his Monk is a beautiful, poetic character that will live for a longtime after the petty series characters of modern "hit" television fade away.
(He did, after all, play Kris Kringle in the original "Miracle on 34th Street".)
It starts out really well, however after John Forsythe meets with Shirley MacLaines character, the film somewhat slows down and can be at times tedious.
What I loved seeing, as almost Hitchcock being a surrealist (he was a big fan of Bunuel after all) as much as being a director of dark/light comedy, was the non-chalance treated with the body from those around it throughout.
Local artist Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe) decides to help his neighbours to cover up the crime, but after burying and digging up the corpse several times, the truth behind "Harry's" death is finally revealed.
I never knew the film was a comedy before I began watching, so you can imagine my surprise when one innocent character after the next stumbled upon a brutally murdered corpse and react in the very least expected ways possible.
Medical student Marty(Justine Bateman)needs a roommate after her flat gets broken into so she takes in Alec(Adam Baldwin).
Justine Bateman ,an actress we just haven't see enough of, is great as Marty who thinks she can look after herself till she realises things are out of her control.
Marty (Justine Bateman of Family Ties) is searching for a roommate after someone breaks into her place.
And after you've been locked up for 5 weeks, with very little food and water, by a man who has murdered your ex-husband, your best friend and your roommate-to-be, all you worry about is what the police is going to think?
It is hard to believe that 'Percy' was made only five years after Norman Wisdom ended his run of cloth-capped comedies.
I was fortunate to be sent a copy of this movie after my plea.
Sadly she disappeared after this miniseries.
And some of the historical facts are skewed (for the most part, because we learned more about the occurrences at Pearl Harbor after this miniseries was made).
It's so predictable and bad that I switched of the TV after the first 15 minutes.
She will make some big mistakes, yet in the end, the Prince will see all past that and say that he loves her, and live happily ever after.
Then after a little Harry Potter dungeon sitting, they find the loophole to this idiot-cratic (is that a word?
They get married and live happily ever after... Did you ever have a doubt?
I know Danish is a hard language to learn and to speak, the Queen of Denmark's husband doesn't even speak it that well after many years in Denmark, but then you need to employ at least A FEW Danes, instead of just teaching the actors a few words.
With a supporting cast of a vastly younger coworker, in love with older man and the separated husband of the eye specialist, trying to work things out after tragedy.
Even masterpieces like Big Fish, Edward Scissorhand, Chocolate, Green Mile (or already mentioned Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind) have a clear Hollywood sign, and after all those Rambos and American Pies, comics based blockbusters and remakes of French movies (what is additionally ironic because average American movie consumer would rather see a rattlesnake on the floor than French movie on the screen) this touch of Hollywood became odious, what is a tragic decline for this old temple of movies... just few decades ago the touch of Hollywood style was the best praise a movie could be given.
Saw this movie after the hype surrounding the many nude scenes present in the movie.The actors and some emotion looked real but then when it came to acting it out, they weren't professional enough.
I also saw a interview of Carlos and Ana which was taken after the Cannes shock treatment.He said he wanted to show real images and thats the reason he prefers dÃ©butantes in every movie.Also Marcos is supposedly a driver for his dad at the History of Cultural museum (that obviously explains his inclusion).
Persuaded by his wife, however, he decides to wait until after the procession of Catholics to the shrine of the Lady of Guadeloupe.
Unique and disturbing, Battle in Heaven is full of shock and awe, but it is the awe that remains after the final credits.
It creates a drugged-out kind of sensation watching it, by planting actors like stiff cardboard cutouts in scene after scene, usually staring into space amid saying a line or two like "I just kidnapped a kid" in subtitled slang.
There is almost no portrayal of Ana and Marco's states of mind after the kidnapping goes wrong.
Element after element, plot event after event set the tone for a story that is being told.
OK, the movie is ending, but we have extra film, I know, let's have her give him a blow-job in heaven and declare their mutual love after he stabbed her to death.
Dull, predictable lifeless story about a widower who gets a second chance at love with an old college flame after a chance meeting.
This movie may not explain werewolves, but it does do the race some justice after movies like American Werewolf or American Werewolf in Paris (or something like that) really gave a bad and false view of them.
If you want to see a good movie about a man finding love after his wide died get "Chapter Two".
It could happen, we'd seen it in the movies, after all.
i can't watch this movie without becoming totally entranced and still think about my lost love often...the music is just beautiful and so moving and joe brooks is funny and charming...shelley hack is very lovely and does a great job with her winning smile and poignant tears as she says goodbye instead of goodnight in LA...  well, i'm going back East in March and we'll see if maybe one can go back again...i may even move there, since i can't seem to get him out of my heart...it's been a part of me since i was 16 and the strangest thing is the movie came out a few months after i met him in Disneyland and i flew back to Boston to see him shortly thereafter...we've been trying ever since off and on...
"California", which we hear whenever the hero goes after his old flame, should be adopted by the state.
Right after Levi descends from his train at Eboli, he sees Barone, a dog that has been abandoned and who will become his companion in exile.
The actual filming was done in Aliano, an ancient hill town, where the real Carlo Levi went to live after the war.
There are also a lot of little things going on that only occur to you after a few viewings.
We missed you after 9 years of your legendary sitcom bearing your last name as the title.
Of course, there is the unforgettable Barry B. Benson, a graduate of the hive who becomes a lawyer and wants to rid the human race of stealing their honey, but after a courtroom trial, he would learn the hard way the true meaning of life of a bee.
When Romasanta kills his wife, MarÃ­a(Maru Valdivielso)and mute child Teresa(Luna McGill), BÃ¡rbara seeks him out after being seduced herself by him.
A nonconformist bee graduates after the nine days of mandatory education from which he missed one.
One of the better animated films after a long run of disappointments(except for Ratatouille).
Mariel Hemmingway steals the film as the wife who takes charge after giving into hubby's desire to expand her sexual horizons.
In fact, all the males in the movie are made out to look like idiots, especially the lead character -- who finds that his wife "Likes p**** more than he does" after a menage a trois.
I was skeptical to rent this movie after seeing some of the bad comments on imdb, but sometimes you have to take the plunge and decide for yourself.
Mariel Hemingway actually gives a very good, amusing performance as the prim and proper wife who turns into the insatiable "sex monster" after she gives in to her husband's suggestion of a menage a trois.
Marty, after first enjoying his new Âdream come true' freedom, comes to realize that his wife spends more time with the girls, has reached a new level of strength, freedom and happiness, and he's the odd man out in his own bed.
So, Laura realises that she only wants her husband, and they all live happily ever after.
Don't know how I ever missed it but I rented it after seeing the TV series and laughed like crazy.
Romasanta (Julian Sands) might be the culprit, only problem is there is a raging sexual chemistry between them, but after her sister and niece disappear, Barbara decides she must act.
Babar in his childhood had his mother shot by hunters, but he was rescued and looked after by an old woman.
as i grew up i forgot about BaBar then after a while i began thinking about what my favorite TV show was.
in fact i even named my rabbit after babar!
Three soldiers returning from Iraq after sustaining injuries received during combat expecting a normal 30 days of leave.
We would recommend to watch this after dinner with the family.
"Good thing I didn't have my weapon," she says after.
UPDATE: I just watched it again after almost 2 months and enjoyed it as much the second time.
The characters were true to form and based on my experience showed the way it really is as one tries to adapt and adjust to live after returning from a deployment.
I'd never heard of Neil Burger's "The Lucky Ones" until a friend recommended it to me after catching it on a flight to Australia.
Released in theatres stateside last year, it was pulled after making a paltry $267,000 in its opening week.
it was Don's way of 'showing how outtakes happen' .. Universal canceled the show after ONE season .
The main character is a trouble maker but he has a good heart.People will cry after seeing this animation.
He's on peak fighting form here only a few years after his Karate championship successes.
Normal people who, after facing the unimaginable from the occupation forces, decided that the best thing they could do was joining the armed conflict against the occupation.
Arna Mer, a Jewish woman who fought in the 1948 war dedicated her life to helping Palestinian refugees after the 1967 war.
Using old footage, Juliano Mer returns to the refugee camp after his mother's death and after a devastating Israel Defense Forces operation, to check up on the kids who attended the drama group - Arna's Children, who have grown up under Israeli occupation.
The plot here is muddled, and it follows a young woman who, after witnessing the murderer leave the scene of the crime, finds herself as his next target.
What I like about Bido style is that there is always a subtle comment on something deeper thrown in than just going after the killer, at least in a better way than Bava and Argento might put in if they ever did so.
Eric Roberts stymies the kidnap attempt after being shot in the knee, continually whacked by an aluminium pole, scorched with a flame thrower, falling down the side of a skyscraper and again down a lift shaft.
The scenarios and music get old after 5 minutes, and you have to stay there for like 10 hours.
In all of my years of life, I have not met one person, one living soul that has not liked this game after watching it or playing it themselves.
For 2 days straight I beat it, after getting about every single fruit and WT lizard that the world could hold, and watched the touching ending that like gasping for breath, and trying to hold back my tears.
It is also a great date movie because it is not long and gives you plenty to talk about after.
He targets young baker Antonio (Jonathan Fuller) and his wife Maria (the amazingly alluring Rona De Ricci, who looks great in and out of clothes), only to find himself lusting after her.
The week after seeing "Wordplay", I solved the Sunday NPR puzzle, (name a famous American in eight letters, six are consonants, all of which are Roman numerals); I didn't submit my answer because I figured if I could solve it as quickly as I did, it had to be pretty easy...there were more than 1200 correct answers sent in.
The Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada(Lance Henriksen), known for his public executions and torturous methods of those he and his foot-soldiers deem heretics and witches, is overcome with lust when he gazes upon the naked body of baker Antonio's(Jonathan Fuller)lovely wife Maria(the stunning beauty Rona De Ricci)on trial for being a witch after halting the never-ending whipping of a boy child in front of a crowd of people.
Like the documentary Spellbound from a few years back, the director is also after the kind of irony of making such an isolated experience of finishing a puzzle into an event with hundreds of players once a year with friendships and acquaintances- a social event as much as a match-up.
This german movie is one of this boring serious german movies filmed year after year to burn money which is better used for good movies.
Some of these women have been free to explore their sexuality while some don't even know what an orgasm is (even after marriage).
So, after the film's subject drones for hours about various women's issues, I'm supposed to take her seriously as a woman of substance and a feminist.
Gets involved in bad relationship after bad relationship without recognizing her own self-destructive behavior and poor choice in partners?
Obviously Fox was hurt by the fact that she couldn't talk to her lover after his wife discovered their sexual relationship.
Then we have (after equally impressive editing by Nils Pagh Andersen) a lengthy work that is asking you to spend the best part of a day to watch it.
At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots.
We're told a story with a love so strong like earthquake, love that did not die even after ten years of separation.
I find this one of the most moving stories because it is not a frolic through the daisies, walking along the beach and live happily ever after stories.
I'd give this a 7, not because I loved it but for the reasons mentioned above and will freely admit this movie stayed with me after longer then I would have thought it would.
Although the second part of the film may be a slight let down after the strong first part, this movie is a definite treat for those who are sick of standard Hollywood fare and for the fans of Sean and Robin Penn and Travolta.
(Oh, and it was so endearing when the 9 year old gave the adults permission to swear because after all she has heard worse.)
What really gets me is that all the reviews described this movie like this: Hip Comedy about a woman who remarries after her 1st hubby goes to jail, and then 10 years later when he is released must choose between the 2.
Travolta at least seems to try after that, but the sheer stupidity of the story is too large an obstacle for even him to overcome.
And that isn't the fault of either of the Cassavetes men, the dad John who wrote the script or the son Nick who retrieved it after his father's death.
Or just after that, does the couple really arrive at an old friend's flat in the middle of the night and have a beautiful family meal prepared for them, an idealized clichÃ© of the Italian mother feeding everyone?
The truth is these weapons were not seen by the average Westerner until 10 years after they were introduced.
This made-for-TV movie was so good that 11 years after having watched it I still can't get it out of my mind.
Some friends wouldn't even give the movie a chance (to the point where they didn't even want to look at the box, they were so scornful) until I had to beg them to watch it- they thanked me after the first few scenes.
Oliver Reed has less than 10 minutes of screen time as a heavy-drinking Cardinal who comes to visit Torquemada and try to get him to ease up on the mass killing a little, but trust me, you'll remember his scene long after the movie is over.
Because it's a newer version of a classic horror movie (and it went directly to video), I have been putting off watching Stuart Gordon's take on Edgar Allen Poe's classic story, but after finally catching it; I can honestly say that I don't know why I didn't see it earlier!
But Delicatessen has so much more, which may only be revealed after repeated viewing.
While "Delicatessen" still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet & Caro, it's not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success, as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers.
Since food is scarce in the film's world, Clapet has devised a scheme to provide himself and his tenants with a regular supply of meat--he runs ads in the local paper for handymen, and after they fix a few things on the building, they become the main course.
The major issue I had with the film was the fact that after this guy, Max, admits to raping Julietta (she is indignant and mad for a whole five minutes) she forgives him.
This was the fourth - and last - fantasy adventure for the actor-director team of Doug McClure and Kevin Connor after THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT (1974; undeniably the best of the bunch), AT THE EARTH'S CORE (1976) and THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT (1977).
Here with this, in terms of fun arguably the second best film of the four after At The Earths Core, Connor and screenplay writer Brian Hayles send McClure, Peter Gilmore and a few rough neck sailor types under the ocean, to where the lost cities of Atlantis be.
Directed by Kevin Connor this was the fourth & final 'lost world' film he & star Doug McClure made together, the first being The Land that Time Forgot (1974), the second was At the Earth's Core (1976), after that came The People that Time Forgot (1977) & Warlords of Atlantis rounded of the loose series of films which is probably my favourite overall.
However, after they find a gold statue they, together with most of the crew of their ship, are abducted by a giant octopus and taken to the lost undersea world of Atlantis.
The first time that Vitti and Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), a calm shrink meet face to face is okay, but the events that happen after that are serious and down-right funny.
It just loses appeal to fast and it especially does so after the first wedding.
Director, Wellson Chin, also does a good job of putting over the human characters after the initial opening battle.
But after these two initial scenes, the film steadily goes downhill.
But hey, at least someone whipped one of these out in the 00's, ten years after the genre died out.
A masterful film and beautifully shot i have never seen a film which rocked me to my core it is hard to believe that my life will ever be the same after seeing this awe inspiring film.
But after the initial shock faded, I really few in love with this family and wanted to know what was going on.
You're stuck there in the best seat in the house, centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "When the F*** is this film ever going to END???"
Son: realizes that he has to study harder to pass some important exams (after his folks stood up for him and killed those bullies who've been abusing him all the time).
Daughter: after being hit on the head by a rock she gets back to her parents' house to find her parents really closer to each other emotionally and physically (breast-sucking scene).
But I realized after a while Miike set it up from the beginning with Q suddenly entering into this world, and somehow for no actual reason being accepted.
It's a look at the disintegration of a family using a medium within its video-work (I was reminded of Godard's equally un-settling work of original sexually depraved and uncouth family in Numeroux Deux), and if taken really as being a serious work you might have to turn it off after a while.
I actually retired from Asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish.
My headache set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem.
There is no better perverse pleasure than watching a married couple smiling and connecting after years of dysfunction as they hack apart a corpse together... especially following everything that's happened previously, which includes but is not limited to necrophilia, coprophilia, copious milk spraying, and random violence.
Along comes a mysterious visitor who becomes a house guest after hitting dad on the head with a rock (twice).
When I first watched this show, I was little disappointed but after watching it again.

for the Afterdark Horrorfest cheapie CRAZY EIGHTS, discussing whether one-time (or 200-time, depending on who's counting) child porn star Traci Lords--who appeared in CRAZY EIGHTS long after she reached "legal age"--was exploited by the porn industry (or vice versa).
Since Judy's beloved dad died days after her mom signed her life away to MGM, Judy viewed studio head Louie B. Mayer as her surrogate father.
Christoph Stark's second film comes not so long after that trendy, popular flick 'Run Lola Run' by Tom Twyker.
As I watched performance after performance, I realized no one could tell Judy's story like Judy -- her songs tell it all!
Despite being at the mercy of the entertainment system and a stage mom who allowed the abuse to go on (over work, drug abuse & etc), Judy Garland was able to give timeless performance after performance.
The film that had all the right elements going for it, proved to be one of the things that broke her spirit, at a time when she needed all she could to make it big, after having left MGM.
The director engaged in a spirited conversation with the audience after this fine documentary was shown.
As a teenager scoring one success after another she was given pep pills to make her work harder and longer followed by sleeping pills so she could get some rest before the cycle repeated itself the next day.
She became involved in one doomed relationship with a man after another disappointing one, a lifetime pattern.
He hoped that the audience would have a real good laugh and that after leaving his film one would consider the reason(s) for having an enemy.
As an American, it took me a bit to get used to the language of rural Ireland in the 1920's, but this film draws you into a world that seems not at all foreign after a while.
Victor then falls for the old conversion by sex routine (the girls mother and general titillation for some watching) and Dave finally after another pathetic attempt to break from his cell finally does what the audience wants and uses the cistern lid.
I didn't have high hopes for this movie after seeing the two previous and awful offerings from Raw Feed.
They will leave this sphere and after some event for which they are all preparing will be transported to some other level of existence.
There is an extended interview of the cult member, a monologue of the teacher, a description of the facility, a fascinating mathematical explanation of what they believe in, and a forensic report of the investigation by the police the morning after the cult takes part in the event.
While trying to save her mother Deborah (Elizabeth Godush), they are abducted by members of the sect Quanta Group, composed by scientists, philosophers and mathematicians that foresee the end of the world after a meteor shower.
To see him crying after all the tough guys he has played it is really funny.
I'm still unclear on whether the sheriff was one of the seven mummies, whether he wanted the gold for himself or to protect it, or why he was after the amulet at all.
i was left with lots of questions after this movie, but i still enjoyed watching it.
The convicts spend the latter part of the film just being chased by the sheriff, the mummies don't even join the pursuit after their one fight scene.
Seven Mummies starts out on a lonely desert road where a police transport vehicle has crashed, the five convicts can't believe their luck & after killing one guard & taking the other (Carina Vincent) hostage they set off across the inhospitable desert terrain towards the border.
The sound was often out of sync and looped after the fact.
At first, after doing her grief work, Miko comes on the Nichols, smooching him up, her wide-open lips revealing glistening incisors of frightening dimensions.
I must say, I'm not really a fan of Poe, but after this film.. Woh, I am now..
I can still feel the salty tears running down my face after seeing this as a kid.
My kids asked many questions about J.T's world after the movie; it showed them a slice of life that they had never before seen.
The one or two times she let me have the kitten, after some time, she'd wind up telling me I had to get rid of him.
I can still feel the salty tears running down my face after seeing this as a kid.
I was a young kid growing up in Brooklyn and my life had some strong parallels to JT's as I, too, had a hard, lonely existence and adopted stray dogs and cats only to find them dead after being hit by cars one after another.
It was on Saturday mornings about noon after the cartoons were over.
It was aired sporadically after that around Christmas in the mid 70's.
I remembered the main points though, the little boy who lived with his mother, nursing a homeless cat back to health in an abandoned building before and after school, the tragedy that happens, the saddest moment on TV since the Martins forced Timmy to give up Lassie to move to Australia in "Timmy and Lassie", (both of these tug at the heart strings and bring a tear to the eye) and the 'turn around' happy ending.
in December 1980 and after that hadn't rerun it again until Thanksgiving Day, 1987; at that time, my family had their first VCR, and I was very lucky to have videotaped the show.
was mostly available for educational use, but sold it to me after I explained to them I couldn't locate a commercially produced copy of the tape and that it would be for my own personal use.
The major issue I had with the film was the fact that after this guy, Max, admits to raping Julietta (she is indignant and mad for a whole five minutes) she forgives him.
Ja'Net Dubois is also great as his worried, exhausted mother, who is firmly mired in poverty, despite working many hours at a store day after day.
Perhaps after a couple of decades of having seen it, its like Dark Shadows...you remember it as scarier (or in this case, funnier) than it actually was (and we'll sadly never know now how good it could have been), but I would love to go back and watch it again.
The only thing that I can think of that is a negative point for this movie is that after you watch this, Comedy is RUINED...because NOTHING is funny after you watch this.
My most vivid memory of the movie was that after seeing the theatrical release and thinking it was hysterical, I rented it while on vacation with my folks.
Well, after 15 minutes my Mom was howling with every morning wake up, every confrontation with the judge, and we almost lost her when Austin Pendelton started his "stuttering" defense!
The movie, however failed to get the recognition it deserves, but I'm glad I watched this movie soon after its release.
long after the credits have faded from the screen.
Ten years after the film was released, Film critic and historian Mick LaSalle wrote in his article, "Half of what made Joe Pesci funny in this comedy was the stream of reactions of Gwynne, as the Southern Judge, a Great Dane to Joe Pesci's yapping terrier."
Honestly, you made need a doctor after this movie.
Expect a few unbelievable surprises from the irresistible guy who's smart enough to make one hilarious movie after another.
Smart comedy is smart thinking after all.
after making unsuspecting minions do his dirty work, he plans the biggest threat of all - if he isn't paid 50 million dollars by a Friday afternoon, 10 random people will die.
While Laurel and Hardy had begun to decline since hitting an-all time peak in 1937 (Way Out West), this was still only four years on, and just a year after the reasonably amusing A Chump At Oxford.
Much 'hilarity' ensues, after which the General demands, "what are you trying to do, put on a Minstrel show?"
It was embarrassing to watch L&H play-acting through the dopey one-liners, saying things they would never say in their own world, and the forced emotional responses dictated by the script; then right after a poor moment I would be charmed their perfect timing and naturalness with a bit of physical comedy or some of their own dialogue.
Sadly, they kept going for awhile after this movie.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wasn't a fan of the great duo, but seeing it for the first time was a revelation after all the negative things I'd read and heard about the Fox movies.
Situated mostly in Paris during the early 1970s and among the aftermath of the collapse of the De Gaulle government, the film tells of a change of prosperity that occurs after the death of her father's, (Fernando; Stefano Accorsi), brother-in-law.
Set in the politically turbulent Paris of the1970s, "Blame it on Fidel" tells of a sheltered young girl who has her comfortable bourgeois existence ripped away from her after her staid, conformist parents (Julie Depardieu, Stefano Accorsi) suddenly become born again leftist radicals.
But be reassured "La faute Ã  Fidel", her first fiction film (coming after a pair of interesting documentaries) isn't a carbon copy of a Costa Gavras movie in any way.
On the road to a nervous breakdown, this emotionally vulnerable man comes to Ben after Jelly briefly encounters the therapist during a minor car accident.
The pacing is so slow, that I felt so bored after the first twenty minutes.
In a jaunty opening prologue, the brothers are shown as cute little tykes in dark suits and bowler hats being rejected by one foster family after another due to their misbehavior, which early on drifts into larceny.
But after he leaves Stephen to motor off with Penelope he notices that the "fake blood" on his shirt is turning brown.
However, after a second viewing I found that the plot does make sense, if you pay attention; and if you'll let it get into your head, there are rewarding depths of profundity and meaning in the tiniest details.
I am writing this right after watching the movie so my rating as of now is definitely 9, a must watch if your tired of the usual movies hitting the screens.
I was left assuming Penelope simply bought her way out of it; she IS rich, after all.
As the sophomore effort of Rian Johnson, after his first very impressive debut Brick (which, I should note, also tooled playfully with conventions of a genre as he attempts here), he's aiming quite high.
Ten years after one of Fox's most popular television show, I thought they'd have put more effort into paying tribute to the old days.
I guess people just like to see what people look like years after seeing them on their favorite show.
i started watching b.h.90210 on the soap-net after the new one just came out and i haven't been able to stop watching it.
He picked her up when she was 10, and looked after her onboard ever since.
I'm not sure what I make of it all, however I do know the film still haunts me and on some level colored everything I watched after that.
Only after the ego completely sacrifices itself, can the soul become free to discover the supreme self, Atman.
The girl leaving together with the boy represents the life after the supreme Liberation, where the soul is together with the supreme Self (or with God).
The Romanian cinematography has had a crack-up after the 1989-revolution which demolished communism, but now I think it started to come back again.
MY psychotronic powers must need a little work: This movie continued for quite a while after I WILLED it to end.
But having to watch this commercial for more than 30 secs but a full hour and a half becomes very painful after just 15 minutes.
Dupontel who I usually always love despite very strange (bad) career choices has no lines here and is only one color tinted, making his character totally dull and boring after 20 minutes.
Of course, these murders are ultimately tied back to the fateful opening gunfight and to the plot of Doctor Brugen (Marthe Keller) helping her daughter regain her memories after a tragic auto accident.
It was only able to be made after the death of Chicago's longest reigning mayor, who would not allow movies to be made anywhere in Chicago.
Second I find the Hoffmann character not that convincing anymore after his "accident".
The theme song is great but overused and after a while I got sick and tired of staring at the young lead actress' naked body.
Standing up for bullied loner Jason, both in school and after, Kyle rescues his new friend from multiple classmate antagonists and then goes on to beat up the older brothers of the attackers.
Most times after you see a independent film there is always one character that stands out due to bad acting.
The best thing that you can do after reading this review is to watch "The Flyboys".
Kyle (McClendon) is the new kid in town and after a little trouble on his first day of school, he befriends Jason (James).
Jason's uncle works on and flies small airplanes, and after Jason and Kyle get a little taste of flying in planes, they want more.
Through Neri's performance(..she commands your attention in a minimalist fashion), we can see Gianna's attraction to Nancy right away, and as the film continues, that infatuation grows(..especially after photographing her nude or barely clothed)..it's all in her eyes, this lust that begins to take hold.
Producer/Director Rocco DeVilliers answered questions from the audience after the screening... two details remained with me... the film was done with a $2M budget, and it has been shopped to the majors with all taking a pass.
16-year-old boarding school student Nancy (Jenny Tamburi) arrives in town after her mother commits suicide.
You will definitely be humming it for days after watching this one.
I guess they are after all the digitally mastered movies that capture the awe of people.
As you can probably guess, eventually we see Goku Jr. lives up to his name, but not until after a brief word of advice from his hidden guardian angel.
Like former Florida Marlin Livan Hernandez said after winning the 1997 World Series "I Love Miami"), and you have your paraplegic beauty who plays high infidelity from her rich husband by sleeping with the Cuban (Yea!
But the most remarkable thing in this intriguing Giallo is the lush, ear-catching main theme that will never let one go after being heard for the first time.
Hulk Hogan does an awesome job as Shep Ramsey, an intergalactic warrior who never takes time to relax after a mission.
It is also definitely the best Hulk Hogan movie (I say this after watching the horrible Mr. Nanny).
Triggering this behavior though is the accidental killing of a young woman who gets a little too aggressive and dies after Eddie pushes her off and she hits her head on a table.
The only thing this movie will be remembered by is for being Eliza's first topless movie after she said that she will never come out nude in any movie.
As it is, Schmidt and Molloy's treatment is so ridiculous, all it needed to complete its film student predictability was a scene with the protagonist lying naked on the floor, in the fetal position, after suffering a mental breakdown.
It had little gore or anything really adult-themed, so if that's what you're after this isn't for you.
The episode begs the question, after having been misled by Deep Throat in 'E.B.E.
What a great way to end the first season of the x-files.An apparent unrelated.minor car chase leads the agents to the discovery of what seems to be concrete evidence of a government conspiracy.The early sequence of the man being chased who then is shot emits green blood which has toxic properties is a classic.Also Deep Throat plays an important part i this episode though can the agents trust him after his lies in E.B.E?A stunning moment happens when Mulder enters the warehouse and before his very eyes is bodies in tanks of water.When he returns with Scully the bodies are gone much to Mulders disgust.He thought he had irrefutable,indisputable proof.This episode must be watched!
Steven also his hearing his fan base and decided to do his own fights scenes, also at the end he gets back to his 'movie' roots when he goes after the man who set him up in the beginning.
Tab Hunter, the golden boy of Warner Brothers of the fifties, plunged towards obscurity after leaving the studios who had found a new hopeful in the form of Troy Donahue.
Seagal plays John Seager, freedom fighter and freelance mercenary, who after getting shafted by his current employer, goes to work for an enemy of the said employer, and proceeds to shaft him.
However, after slight improvements in the films "Into the Sun" and "Black Dawn" I have to say "Mercenary for Justice" is his best film since "Half Past Dead".
That is Seagal's stunt double again jumping fences to get behind the truck after the initial war sequence.
Back in the US & John promises to look after Radio's widow Shondra (Faye Peters) & young son Eddie (Tumi Mogoje) but Chapel is hired by billionaire Greek Arab arms dealer Ahmet Dasan (Peter Butler) to break is son out of prison & kidnaps both Shondra & Eddie in order to force Seeger to carry out the break.
When a girl he's picked up turns aggressive after his failure, he kicks her away.
It looked like it would cave in after the next storm.
It seems Steven Seagal's moves are becoming slower and slower after each film he makes.
I didn't quite understand why they were fighting; actually, I didn't understand what the movie is supposed to be about other than John Seeger, Seagal's character, wanting to get revenge after someone used him for whatever purpose the writers threw into the script.
Seeger's agenda also includes rescuing a little boy and his mother after being kidnapped by the same villain that used Seeger.
It starts on a war-torn battlefield with Seagal and a group of mercenaries fighting a legion of French soldiers after having kidnapped and killed the French ambassador.
Christy investigates some circumstances that occurred during the six months of rehabilitation that Vanessa received in Locke's home immediately after the accident, a losing battle against a certain death.
The girl has a tragic past that includes the death of her sister after a fiery car crash.
i had really low expectation going in.mainly because of the words MTV films appearing on the screen was surprised at how well done this psychological suspense thriller was.i found it very atmospheric,and suspenseful.there weren't a lot of cheap scares.it was intelligent,and well written,in my opinion.the ending was unexpected.i was also very impressed with the acting.Nora Zehetner as Christy was very good,but Matthew Settle as John really impressed.basically,my opinion of MTV films went up several notches after this film was over.i don't get the low rating(5.3/10).but that's just my opinion.for me,Beneath is a well deserved 8/10
At the of Anais' request, her journal was published only after the death of all the participants in the events.
The so called plot is simply an excuse to provide grounds for one sex scene after another.
Director Phillip Kaufman stirred up quite a bit of controversy when this film was first being released, most likely because of the intensity of the love scenes, but after watching the DVD I am now thinking that this film could have maybe slipped by with an R rating.
I really enjoyed seeing Henry and June again on the satellite Â 15 years after its release.
If you have not seen Henry and June - find it and watch it - after the children are in bed.
It is strange how people can have a gigantic Hollywood budget, the whole powerful studio support system and churn clunker after clunker.
The result is a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits.
As Stephanie opens up to Lydie, Lydie begins to acknowledge her own conflicts about her current pregnancy with her husband Paul (Timothy Hutton): their first pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth and the current pregnancy began three months after that unresolved tragedy.
Set in scenic Upstate New York, the movie explores the anxieties and fears that many women face before, during and after pregnancy.
The portrayal of Native Americans is a joke and perpetuates stereotype after stereotype of native "innocence" vs. Western "intelligence".
We see her watching a baby scan, and learn she has conceived only three months after a stillbirth.
But of all the images that remain after viewing, it is the solitary anguish of Amber Tamblyn, her own hand over her face to muffle a scream, that will haunt you for days afterwards.
The lines and thoughts stay with you long after the movie has ended.
This could have been an intelligent and moving film about a man who finds his missing son after 10 years adopted by a native tribe in the amazon.
I was bored of the movie after about the first ten minutes, but I made myself watch it, hoping it would get better.
In yet another Seduction Cinema soft-core parody, Dildo Baggins (Misty Mundae, because she can NEVER not be in a Seduction Cinema movie *rolls eyes*) along with fellow Throbbit lesbian lovers, Horny and Spam go off to destroy the evil G-string, after drunk perverted Smirnof, the Wizard presents that quest to them.
The best thing about any of these films is Misty, as she is able to carry off this witty, charming on-screen persona that just blows you away, time after time.
Not that Christopher Lee singing and dancing with a deadpan look on his face isn't somewhat amusing, but this is chock full of songs and after a while I just wanted to stop the DVD before the end, although I somehow managed to get through it all.
Captain Invincible returned to obscurity in his native Australia after a nasty run in with HUAC...  Captain Invincible is a hilarious, rock-opera parody of DC/Marvel superhero comics.
And after we spend the whole movie watching Wayne earnestly trying to solve the mystery, he duplicates the first movie's fatal conceit by announcing himself as a cult conspirator at the very end, thus transforming "Blood Cult"'s dubiety into outright fraudulence; it doesn't just make no sense, it is a frontal assault on the viewer's intelligence.
Ten years later, after an expedition in which he is captured by cannibals, the father is finally reunited with the son, who has been raised by the savages and knows no other way of life.
Wounded, he bumps into a young girl who he befriends after she offers him shelter.
The murderer and the child grow closer together despite the law being after him and the pair develops a friendship that is shattered when the mother discovers the sheltered criminal.
This is the third Lisa Gastoni "mignotta-movie" (to borrow a phrase from Italian Euro-Cult authority Marco Giusti) I've watched Â after THANK YOU AUNT (1968) and Fernando Di Leo's SEDUCTION (1973) Â in which a middle-aged woman is seduced by a much younger man.
Lisa Gastoni (at 43) is still a sensual and attractive woman and has her hair dyed reddish blonde here, but this proved to be the last of several roles in a similar mode Â to which I alluded above and of which I wouldn't mind catching Jerzy Kawalerowicz's MADDALENA (1971) and Giulio Petroni's LABBRE DI LURIDO BLU (1975); in fact, she went into a long period of retirement right after this one before re-emerging two years ago.
Shot during and after the tulip festival in the spring, the film shows the Canadian capital in a storybook setting.
Even with that, the film was censored on release and, after 1934, when the Hayes Code was in stronger effect, it wasn't allowed to be shown at all.
Miriam Hopkins meets fellow Americans Gary Cooper and Frederic March on board a French train, and after an odd beginning their relationship develops into love.
But the revelation, in my opinion, is Gary Cooper; after seeing him in many of his 1930s films, I feel that I like him best in the variety of roles he got to play in those years: a young idealist in "Peter Ibbetson", a sensitive soldier in "A Farewell to Arms", a sophisticated artist in this one, etc.
As Cooper's friend and rival for the affection of Hopkins, March is also very funny, which comes as no surprise after his brilliant parody of John Barrymore in The Royal Family of Broadway (1930).
Sadie Frost is totally hot in this movie, and her running around in panties and a tank top after a drug/alcohol induced stupor was pretty hot.
Personally, I was hooked after the very first scene.
I hated this movie when I watched it, and after watching it again now I know why I hate it so much.
Fortunately, I was able to return the movie to the Hollywood video drop-off box two hours after viewing it, saying my last "thank you" to the legacy of High Noon sell-out movies that need to be quickly forgotten.
Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits.
The dilemma of the piece comes with a decision left up to Tommy, leave his tribe which are essentially his real family after ten years of living with them or joining his father in the modern civilization across the river.
The story's frankly quite simple, and at times this movie would have looked like the many Japanese movies which children-miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust, and how they go about hanging around each other, dealing with respective adversaries and the likes.
I watched it on video, soon after it came out, and again this morning.
I am a huge Sonic fan, and after all the fun Genesis games came out, I thought that they couldn't possibly get any better.
I have been after this movie for years.
There's also an additional layer of tension to the movie (compared to a traditional zombie movie) in that after someone's been bitten, you aren't sure WHEN they will start turning into a crazed flesh-eater.
This film was banned in several countries after its release, but it is not nearly as gruesome as one might expect.
Verney realizes the seriousness of his mission as Sister Catherine escapes after burying a comb in the head of Anna Fountain (Honor Blackman).
I was expecting it to at least end with a bang after making us sit through nearly ninety minutes of boredom, but no.
The film begins with him being defrocked and soon picks up 20 years later--after he's created an order of nuns who look just like Catholic ones.
I just thought it was icky and stupid--after all, the demon was an obvious puppet--and a bad one at that.
The final horror film from the celebrated British studio was the second adaptation of a Dennis Wheatley novel to reach the screen, after "The Devil Rides Out" in the late 60's.
Choosing to develop To The Devil A Daughter, however, was probably a bad decision: budgetary constraints meant that a faithful interpretation of Wheatley's book was impossible to achieve, and after much script wrangling, filming went ahead whilst further revisions were still being made.
Intrigued, Verney agrees to pick up Beddows' daughter Catherine (Nastassja Kinski) from the airport and look after her until they can meet again.
Unfortunately, the messy finalÃ© (which sees Lee's character disappear mysteriously after receiving a bump on the head) does mean that the film closes on something of a bum note and admittedly cannot hold a (black) candle to the real Satanic hit of '76, The Omen, but it's also nowhere near as bad as some Hammer fans would have you believe.
At first, the "Andrews Sisters clones" get on your nerves, but you grow to like 'em after a bit!
That's after she wangled an invitation to share digs with the young man's sister.
Oddly, she didn't make a film after this one for another 12 years.
I had asked the spirit to take me to a gorgeous girl i had met in London a few weeks before, as i regretted never asking for her phone number after having to rush for a train.
I Like ManiRtanams movies  But Geetanjali is something different and its a class of its own in the sense even if you see after 15-20 yrs its still looks fresh story.
As it emerged both of them reached heights they never did before or after with this movie... (yeah, i know the entire series of maniratnam's movies and most of Ilayaraja's music...)   The main protagonist's death is but a matter of ti me, and the leading lady is in a similar situation.
Now after finally buying I could finally watch the film in its entirety.
Now a year after his death, a kid named Jake(Charlie Sheen in a pre-stardom role) mysteriously rolls into town on a bike.
Soon after, a mysterious car, the incredibly rare Turbo Interceptor, rolls up and challenges one the gang members to a race.
Why did they decide to end things off all 'happily ever after' with plenty of cringe inducing sentimentality in a way Disney would have have been proud of?
Director Marvin brings little imagination to the action scenes, two cars racing along a virtually deserted road starts to become tedious after the fourth time.
Nick Cassavetes is great as the villain - in fact, he's so evil that I named a character in one of my stories after his character of Packard Walsh just as a reference to show how evil my character is.
However, after seeing the entire movie, I was not disappointed.
You would expect that, after time, my enthusiasm would diminish, especially since I have no interest in ever visiting the Amazon!
The bit where Jake's scrambler breaks into 4 meteorites still looks great, the tasteful re-animation of the Wraith mobile after crashes (nowadays that would probably be done using reverse photography).
If I were writing a script about the making of this movie I would have had a few friends sitting around after watching Shawn of the Dead and Day of the Living Dead (original) while getting high and munching on Rice Krispie treats and canned chili.
Have you ever tried to talk to somebody after they wake and bake?
Come to think of it, what kind of person would let anyone, living or dead, get their mouth anywhere near their genitals after seeing that same person gnawing raw human flesh right off the bone?
Shortly after this I ran away from home with a friend, with the intention of going to Brazil, mobilising the Indians into a guerrilla band and killing the loggers.
I laughed so hard I missed a few of the jokes, they where one right after the other.
I saw this film in LA, and I have to say that I was practically transported to Cedar Sinai after the screening because I was laughing so hard...

She is, after all, an outsider and divorced.
It is a light work with some sombre undertones from the military setting: we are after all in the summer of 1914, and the gallant young officers will soon be facing the terrors of the Great War.
Jimmy Lydon also passes muster, and his career was such that he took whatever was offered after a good run in the Henry Aldrich series.

Malena has grown hatred for his father, for he served under Anti-Communist Dictatorship of the Argentinian army to quench the communist movement torturing thousands of innocents, instead of looking after his family.
I must say I've been at this since I was 10 years old...watching horror films...reading Fango...searching for those lost treasures...after years of seeing horror films everything starts to blur and become the same old thing...stories retold, murders recreated..scares duplicated...Basically, you realize that there is not much new or novel out there...ghosts, monsters, zombies...psychos...that's about all.
Shortly after, Prof. Roth is found murdered under mysterious circumstances and Alan gradually becomes sucked deeper and deeper into a (spider's) cobweb of occult conspiracies.
Considering the plot (and perhaps after a few slight changes) and some of the malignant characters, THIS should have been the final chapter in Dario Argento's Three Mothers trilogy!
It was wonderful to see Michael York back as D'Artangen after all this time.
I thought the kids were cute, VERY REFRESHING, after watching the horrible movie "Cat N Hat", where the kids were obnoxious horrible brats!
Most of the movie-going public would have agreed with them after the embarrassment that was The Country Bears in July 2002.
Almost one year after that box office flop, Disney bounced back big with the surprise hit of the summer, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which steamed rolled its way to $300 million domestically and possibly two sequels.
The premise, I understand, but what followed after the beginning credits rolled was beyond boring.
And I was psyched that there's going be a movie based on the ride (after seeing the trailer), and I when to see it with my Mom; and after that I love it!
The film starts when husband-and -wife realtors Jim and Sara Evers, with their children Michael and Megan, visit to Gracey Manor; after Sara received a phone call that the owner is selling the house, and workaholic Jim thinks it's a "golden opportunity" for their real estate business.
The movie starts great but unfortunately gets cheesy after the first half hour.
Rob Minkoff seems to have lost his touch after making The Lion King since his last two kid films have been average at best.
Griffith doesn't even attempt to propose any sort of resolution, which does admittedly come off as rather hypocritical Â it is, after all, one thing to merely acknowledge a problem, and another to try and fix it.
I remember David Denby in the New Yorker going on and on about how great this movie was after Sundance, and I was very curious to see it.
Too bad that she was gone from movies for so long, especially after seeing this.
Their thirty year-old son David Gold (Aaron Harnick) has just moved back home after a frustrating experience as filmmaker.
This was Toho's first-of the 1980's-foray into Tokusatsu, after a hiatus in 1977 with The War In Space.
Madeline Kahn passed away in December of 1999, so it was released 2 months after.
(Or as Randy Travis puts it) It seems that Gruner is part of a unit called TNT (this is one of the film's better ideas) and after the senseless murder of a woman and child, Olivier gets sad and runs away from the unit.
i don't know about you guy's but this movie was awesome.also the message that the movie is trying to pass is the reality of our life's.the end of the movie where bless is being killed by the cop and after that it says "you have to make the right decision" it's the best ending and at the same time the most touch full ending that i've ever seen.
One dies and the other lives, even after Marcos discovers his secret is no longer secret.
When things get ugly between them after the couple is kicked out of the cab, the drive starts wailing on the girlfriend, which results in a "heroic" rescue, leaving one very dead driver...
In the end it's not just a great comedy, it actually manages to deliver something that can be called "a message", when, after main character Dante has survived possibly the worst day in his life, he has to admit that it wasn't all just bad luck but also a broad hint that he could/should change his life as a clerk.
That seems to be odd, but hey Terminator 2 was made years after part 1, so I guess they can pull it off, it'll be interesting to see how they do it.
Caitleen Bree, who is still secretly loved by Dante, even after she cheated on him 81/2 times, and who is marrying an Asian Design Major.
Yeah, if you didn't care for the Mythology yet you would after this episode.
But after watching it many more times, it does dawn on a viewer that a lot of things are amiss in this movie.
Not long after, I saw Sideways, which also deals with the friendship of two off-beat males.
I realize that, "sweet," would not be the first adjective out of one's mouth after seeing Second Best, but sweet is what it is.
The direction, the dialog and the performances Â especially that of Joey Pantalione Â ring true and honest and real without even a hint of the after taste of Sweet 'N Low.
Enter a 'conflict' point in the film, and also enter a very big 'clunk' of disbelief for me: why would such an upwardly mobile, very ambitious guy, who escaped the tedious, dead-end life of a suburban Jerseyite, still consider the pathetic, terminally whiny Elliot his very best friend after all these years?
It is easy to understand why Denys McCoy dropped out of sight after "The Last Rebel," since he couldn't stage suspenseful action scenes.
I couldn't stop laughing almost all the movie time (exept those, few sad episodes), and i couldn't stop laughing an hour after the movie!
after watching the film i kept remembering little pieces that made me laugh, and beautiful evocations of.... icebergs?
It's a highly stylized tale of a young restaurant manager who decides to break away from her stultifying and humdrum existence after she inadvertently locks herself in a freezer overnight - only to discover, once she gets out, that her husband and their two carbon-copy young children have failed to notice her absence.
He also recalls his early years on Broadway (only after he was rejected by the President of NBC for being gay),and his eventual rise as a television celebrity, makes this for a film to be taken upon.
It is definitely a psychological thriller and I felt like it gave me lots to think about after it ended even though I felt as though I was missing something during the movie.
I was surprised how much I enjoyed it after all this time.
It does however remind me of the movie "Carnival of Souls" in a way that the driver of the vehicle was not supposed to have dies in a crash when he had almost hit a silhouette figure in a white nightgown off the road and soon after a lady had also had an unfortunate accident with a far lesser fate than his.
We've got an innocent, upstanding couple, who find themselves stranded in a castle after experiencing car troubles, and are gradually seduced to a life of vice and debauchery by its bizarre inhabitants.
Leaving that aside, as you watch whatever it was blowing red light after red light and blasting pigeons in every direction, you don't need to get huffy about how fast he might have been going.
While I would not lie and say that this is a profound film and that there is anything to be learned from it or much to be thought of after seeing it, it would be only natural to praise it for its pure movie-like, feel-good quality, a small escape from the everyday.

This movie's premise seems to be "take a cast, put them on an SST, and then subject them to trouble after trouble."
Daniel (Tom Hollander) is single, successful and after one look at Martha he thinks he's in love.
anyway the scenes with him and his mother are just so sweet that i don't know how he was able to pull himself so together after she died.
I found that after seeing LD in several movies, she is great in factual stories, like October Sky.
Eventually, Vood and his men decide to rule the world and they attack one village after another until Vood learns that Ela is in one village.
In a scene very near the end, he is escorting a young woman to a shower to warm her up after she has saved his life and helped his team.
"I suppose you're one of those fellows who does the Times' crossword puzzle in 10 minutes," says an irritated Admiral Brindsen after ffolkes offhandedly explained the meaning of a coded message the Admiral had just received from London.
"I don't get the double 'F'," says American reporter Johnny Jones to Scott ffolliot, a man he's just met as they speed down a Dutch lane after an assassin.
Its still captives me every time after having seen it possibly more than 30 times, if anyone reading this could explain the scene to me where Harald (cramers No.2 guy) says that it feels like the last minute and asks about the escape plan.
Also, see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and I still am entertained after 20+ viewings.
And while James Bond is rewarded with the most beautiful girl after having saved the world, Ffolkes receives a completely different gift at the end of the film... All in all, "North Sea Hijack" is the perfect action thriller for a stormy and rainy autumn evening in front of your TV set.
The finale does seem something of a let down after the build up, but it doesn't ruin the film.
Obvious but suspenseful thriller about a teenager (Shia LeBeouf) who is under house arrest after committing a crime and must wear a special ankle bracelet.
After a year, he was sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father.
He began spying on his neighbors after days of boredom.
I mean this movie was done after the father/son crash.
Fortunately, after the highly disappointing Taking Lives and the ho-hum Two for the Money, it seems Caruso has come back to the form he had with his brilliant debut Salton Sea.
There are a couple of "shock" moments, but they appear and leave in the first 5 minutes of the film, after that, the teenage love puppy story sprinkled with tepid moments of "tension".
The murderer will suddenly and stupidly (after years of calculated planning of all his murders) start attacking all of his neighbors.
Kale gets put on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class.
This leads to him being put under house arrest after he punches out an unsympathetic teacher.
Disturbia tells the story of a teenage boy named Kale who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father.
It is so slow that after the first half hour, I put it on fast forward (the advantage of subtitles is you can watch a movie like that).
(7) Ben Affleck did well as the smarmy, annoying shop manager who goes after Shannen Doherty.
Maybe it was because I saw this one after I had already seen Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but now I got some of those great "in-jokes" that were included in those movies.
One hour after takeoff, the first flight of America's first S.S.T.
Everytime i see the film it still cracks me up, even after a few years have passed (nearly a decade....does time go that fast!!!)
The film came out when I was fourteen, and I went to see it with my cousin at the local mall after a rousing bus trip.
Personally, I think Kevin Smith's films went downhill after that.
But after all the mayhem they manage to get up to in the mall, they just can't get their ex-girlfriends off their mind.
But what compensates it is that there was a continuous roll with one after another, so if one didn't work out there's another that would hopefully evoke a laugh.
Time after time his paranoia causes those close to him to have to distance themselves - sometimes for their own safety - because Larry really is a wild man who is subject to paranoid delusions as well as auditory hallucinations.
Or perhaps it is because he has learned to live in and accept "betweenness" after his experience on the ferry.
Not only is the dead girl Alice PALMER (Laura Palmer being the deceased subject of Twin Peaks) but she was a young woman with a double life which was only revealed after her death.
It is a very striking film, full of life for long after the credits have rolled (watch them all by the way) - don't watch any trailers.
The last of the six shorts that Hubie and Bertie starred in and probably for the best as where do you go after the insanity of this??
MOUSE WRECKERS (1948) is my second favorite Warner Brothers cartoon (after the delightful FEED THE KITTY).
And you may just feel hungry for cheese after watching it (don't eat too much, mind you; you don't want to do what these characters did!).
Reality starts when he's sitting in the boat with the red shirt, bearded and eating noodles...  Post card incident is a trick a big trick, its shown him sitting in a hotel window writing to his wife, well if this takes place in his dreams then in reality while he is with his wife later after saying goodbye to their recent friends how could he have the card???
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
I would have been happy if The Split had ended after the gang had stolen the money & got away with it but there's this tacked on ending a lot of which feels very random, like how did Ellie's landlord know she had the money?
But after all, we don't know what morality is.
The story told by the film is solid enough that after only 4 years it was remade.
Now, that might sound strange, but I wanted to see her in a film that predated the 1950s and 1960s movies that I knew; in those, she looked old and worn, as you might expect after so long in movies.
Perhaps the best of these occurs sometime after Sadie's conversion: lolling indolently, he reads from a small book something that sounds incredibly like Ecclesiates-- for a moment, we nearly believe that Davidson has converted him, too.
It might be obvious not long after he turns up what he is after but its still a good film.
(They put one in mind of English books such as E. Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods, not that the story is nearly as pleasant, but because the children are so good at looking after themselves independently.)
Seven children continue in "Our Mother's House" after she dies in this 1967 film starring Dirk Bogarde, Pamela Franklin, and Mark Lester, and directed by Jack Clayton.
Criminally under - rated,cinematographer/director Mr Jsck Clayton created some excellent intelligent atmospheric films that lovers of British cinema look on with special affection.His 1967 "Our mother's house" is a fine example of his sensitivity with child actors and his flair for looking beyond the obvious in casting his adult roles.Mr Dirk Bogarde,for instance,might not have come immediately to mind for the role of a feckless working - class Londoner,but Mr Clayton knew exactly what he was capable of,and Bogarde's performance so moved Signor Visconti that after watching "Our mother's house" he chose him for the life - changing "Death in Venice".
The mother was a vicar's daughter who rebelled by taking a succession of lovers, repenting after her seventh child and turning into religious nut case.
This was on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) a few days ago, and after all the great comments I saw about this movie, I didn't hesitate to tape it on DVD.
But it definitely does improve after that.
The general gist of the film is that seven children who fear the orphanage bury their mother in the garden after she dies of illness, so that no one will find out.
Charlie is masterfully portrayed by Dirk Bogarde who was in his more fruitful period with such masterpieces as "accident" "king and country" "la caduti dei degi" "morte a Venezio".He keeps people waiting for he only appears after about forty minutes.But when he's on the screen ,the chemistry between the thespian and the children is so obvious that there's no hiatus.At first sight,he resembles some adult Peter Pan (hairdo,swagger,clothes,not to forget the name:Hook!
It concerns 7 siblings left to fend for themselves in a big house after their beloved Mother dies.
So, if you want to enjoy the mystery first, then stop right now...and come back after you've seen the film.
EMr.S, at least as I remember it after 20 years, combined those genres.
You got a guy that has been "supposedly" in a coma for the past four years after he killed his fiancÃ© during some weird ritual.
He starts having nightmares after his first night about going into the attic of this place and finding a locked trunk, but someone is inside.
What Ek is really after is a book of magick for which Trevor only knows it's whereabouts.
Overall, I gotta say that after a slew of mediocre Hollywood budget films, this was a volatile breath of fresh air.
The score is wonderful, the type you'll remember after one viewing.
Finally, a horror movie in the classic tradition of unsettling fear that stays with you for months after you see the film.
The DVD will give those with a home theater system a good workout and add to the overall experience...and watch it after the sun goes down with all the lights out too!
That is, after killing Faith, he aborts said ritual (by not killing himself), putting his soul in limbo.
(To see this, note that the earthly part wakes up from the implantation surgery just before the one nurse says that her shift is over, while the tormented half wakes up two or three seconds later, just after.)
I have my own, I think most of the movie is imagination of the character, and the only reality scenes are the ones where he walks everyday in the metro of Hong-Kong, depressed after his wife would have left him during the vacations in Hong-Kong, where he shave his moustache.
And the action Â after some homeland establishing shots (including a loving mother) Â is transported from the UK to the US.
All the Basil Rathbone films were made in America, but after this movie there was talk of moving the character to America permanently.
Pettibone/Gregson manages to surreptitiously hand off the document, which he had reduced to microfilm and embedded in a matchbook, to the fiancÃ© of an American Navy Lieutenant -- she doesn't know that she has it until she suddenly recalls that Pettibone/Gregson dropped the matchbook into her purse just after he lit her cigarette.
Directed by Roy William Neil, the master of deductive reasoning Sherlock Holmes(Basil Rathbone)and his often bumbling parter Dr. Watson(Nigel Bruce)make a trip to Washington, D.C. after a top-secret agent is kidnapped and murdered after passing off hidden valuable microfilm inside the cover of a matchbook.
Read the book some time ago and after watching the movie felt much the same sort of existential exhilaration - if there is such a thing.
I almost shaved my beard off after watching it just to see what would happen.
My 7 yr old had some issues" with it as well the first night but has since resolved them after considering the whole of the film.
While I consider Conway a good tv comedian, only Knotts ever showed potential for the big screen after leaving the Andy Griffith show.
Presented at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival in the 'Quinzaine des RÃ©alisateurs' category - a category promoting abstract and rather unusual movies - 'La Moustache' follows the intricate story of Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), an ordinary Parisian architect who slips into a vicious identity crisis after he spontaneously shaves off his moustache.
Directed by Armand Mastroianni, who after "The Supernaturals" and "He knows you're alone" obviously just doesn't know any better.
If this is any indication, he went downhill after giving Hanks a start.
Life really is a box of chocolates after all...but don't bite this one.
I saw this after Dead Man's Walk and before Lonesome Dove.
Then, after seeing Lonesome Dove and Return to Lonesome Dove, I realized that Garner did right by the part of Woodruff Call.
I've attempted to watch some of the other "Lonesome Dove" sequels, but had to give up after a few minutes.
One of the first things I do after watching a movie I really like, is checking reviews of others...professionals and amateurs, as listed here.
It's unfortunate that no feature length movies have been made because I, for one, would love to know what Sisko learned while moving among the prophets after falling into the fire cave (Final Episode).
This series was rich with spin-offs, potential movies - a never-ending cash cow, and yet it ended abruptly after wasting an entire season devoping Ezri instead of tying up the loose ends.
Unlike all of his predecessors, Sisko also has a goofy and even downright awkward side, which is very refreshing after years of the stodgily military Picard and the space cowboy man-ho Kirk.
Emissary reminds me of Babylon 5's Pilot Episode: The Gathering, which was aired a month after Emissary.
Rick Berman and Michael Piller did a great job creating this show and keeping it alive and healthy after Roddenberry's death, while giving a fitting end to The Next Generation.
Not to mention the ending, I only kept watching after a bit to see what happened in the end, and it was lame (it could've really benefited from a twist ending, like Planet of the Apes).
It takes place after a nuclear disaster.
And after a while, on a big enough screen this can get really irritating on the eyes!
We then jump right into the world after the war, which apparently show us that the only people surviving nuclear winter will be "B" actors-go figure.
bus-sized ATVs on a cross-country trip from the desert southwest to Albany New York Â the only place that they can get a radio signal from 2 years after the bombs fall.
In the novel, Zelazny looked at the world a generation after the holocaust, an interesting point to examine, where government has established control again in the remaining population centers, and the recognizably ordinary lives people can lead in these pockets of safety is in sharp contrast to the nightmare world that lays down the road apiece.
Instead of keeping this setting, though, the authors of this film decided to go with a world maybe a year or two after the bombs, which presents a much less interesting vantage than any of the time-points noted above.
The locations are all dust, sand and rock... this is after all Damnation Alley and the Earth has been tilted off its axis.
The latter , to me , is STILL unrecognisable under the make up , after the 6 or so times I have watched the film .
I'm 19 years old and I saw this movie eleven years ago (1992) and I still love it after over a dozen viewings.
Our entire family (ages 6 to 46) enjoys this movie year after year.
And suppose Hook came after him for revenge ?
t is till the legendary Captian Hook kidnaps Peter's children that he is reminded by Wendy of who he used to be, of course Peter can't believe it, he can't believe it even more when Tinkerbell pays a visit and carries him off to Neverland where he meets Captian Hook after so long.
Hook is undeniably a love or hate movie, but even after so long, I still like it, though I don't think I could call it a classic to be perfectly honest.
At 10 years old, I began to watch movie after movie to catch up to my older sister.
I recently watched it after so many years of it lost in my memory that I felt like I had visited a historical landmark..its placed within a treasured set of memories on my part.
During a conference of crime bosses held in a Gotham City skyscraper, gangster Chuckie Sol is killed by a mysterious cloaked figure shortly after Batman bursts in on the meeting.
Throughout the film we encounter a beautiful woman name Andrea Beaumont who makes a fool out of Bruce Wayne, and in a flashback of Bruce Wayne, its explained that the woman was the first love of Bruce Wayne, but it tears him apart when Andrea abandons Bruce by leaving with her father to France after in tides with a local mafia.
An unfairly forgotten film, "Mask of the Phantasm" is not only a great animated film Â it is also the best of all the Batman films after Burton's original.
Not long after the new animated series of Batman started they made a movie.
Batman is suspected of murdering a gangster after a mysterious dark man does it.
Andrea after suffering the killing of her father could not think in other thing but justice just like Bruce after she leaved him, then for an unknown circumstance, but the other difference is that Batman doesn't kill, the Phantasm does.
The right thing for WB to have done was to have these amazingly talented people work on the live action version of the Batman movies after Burton left but instead they got Schumacher and we all know what happened after that.
I really love the choir music she plays at the end when Batman is on top of the roof and springs into action after seeing the bat signal.
SPOILER the BEST scene in the entire movie was after Andrea returned the ring to Bruce.
after putting on his utility belt, he extends his hand for his mask.
The first hour of "Traitor" was simply great, but after the first hour it started to lose it's entertainment value and became a bit tedious.
The parts after the first hour wasn't bad, but just wasn't good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing.
The FBI wants to know that too, especially after a visit from Agents Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Archer (Neal McDonough).
Samir is a deeply religious man, who wants only to serve God, after being caught while trying to sell detonators to, who we can only call Terrorists, he is sent to prison.
And of course the FBI is after him at every turn.
Through the recommendation of a mutual acquaintance, Samir hooks up with a terrorist named Omar but before you know it they both wind up in prison after being captured by Yemeni government soldiers working in conjunction with the FBI.
I gave it a 1 because i had to buy my friend a glass of wine to revive him after falling asleep halfway thru the movie after yet another car breaks down to create some suspense..
Well after going to see this movie with some very hardcore friends/critics, we all agree, the professionals are getting paid off!
Guy Pearce delivers a winner of a show as well as the straight edge FBI agent chasing after Cheadle, though his character has been done to death, to be honest.
The brief scenes with the CIA are quite amusing as they mostly sit on the sidelines throughout the movie and clean up after the mess which is left behind after the seemingly simple firing of one Mr. Cox.
I think that after making a such a serious and dramatic effort last year, they're just goofing off this year, and that's fine, they're allowed to do that.
What makes Burn after reading less of a film then most Coen Brother's work is that there is not any real thought involved.
The second I pressed the stop button on my DVD I almost totally forgot about the movie, a good film is one can't get out of your head for a week after watching it, and most Coen Brother films do that.
Maybe it is just me but after i watched the film i felt unclean and distressed.
Brad Pitt s character who was the most outstanding character and the star of the film gets shot in the head and dies after one hour... after that, i lost every interest of the film.
Ozzy Cox was totally on the rebound after the shyt hits the fan with his wife divorcing him and what does he get?
I felt like burning the movie projector after watching!
"No Country for Old Men" directors Joel and Ethan Coen's uneven, overwrought, misanthropic comedy of errors "Burn After Reading" (* out of ****) should have been burned after they made it.
"Burn after Reading" had none of that.
I have never felt healthier than after 96 minutes of explosive and grateful laughter at the "Burn" screening, also marveling at the array of British-stage caliber acting from "Fargo"-invoking Frances McDormand, witchy-icy Tilda Swinton, a more-manic-than-ever John Malkovich, and a dozen major players, such as J.K. Simmons as the deadpan CIA boss and Richard Jenkins as the former Greek Orthodox priest, now running an upscale gym.
The jokes were hilarious throughout and despite the fact that I seriously thought they would become stale after a while there was always some wacky, juvenile joke around the corner to get me laughing again.
3)People with the wrong company or with larger attention spans will eventually Overdose on the jokes and cease to find the movie funny after a while.
I've read many Netforce books, and watchin the movie after reading them, gives the main characters more depth than portrayed in the movie.The plot has some weak points and sometimes it seems almost rediculous, but in all a very entertaining movie
His dad, campaigning for governor of California, is very angry with "B-Rad" after he does some inexplicable thing.
Synopsis: Mark Lyndsay Chapman plays Richard Armour, a likable reporter whose life changes after his girlfriend, Angela (Catherine Mary Stewart) returns from a holiday in Hawaii with a female friend (Lisa Blount).
The story started off well enough, but after just a bit, the FBI's NetForce started looking like a bunch of nerds playing in cyber-space.
<shakes his head> It could have been better, but I couldn't rate it too low, after all, it DID have a very good twist at the end (no spoiler here!
Truly panicked he finds himself a wanted man, framed, and on the run with nothing more than the passenger list he got after dispatching the Angela robot.
He finds out a little more, from another,older passenger who seems to be in charge of a localized group of these beings-he manages after a fight,to damage the mechanical brain and he begins talking incoherently about "Dynamitards...are the collective of Dymogeny" and how they intend to fully take over.
This was a second series attempt from musician Roderick Taylor a year after Otherworld for CBS.
It should also be noted that leading man Mark Lindsay Chapman, then going under the name Mark Lindsay, was given this role as compensation after being cast as John Lennon in a TV biopic, only to be removed when his real name was discovered to be the same as Lennon's killer.
Ryan Merriman plays the whiz-kid genius who wanted to win the house, then decides, "Hey, Dad, maybe we shouldn't have moved in here"...after having complained about wanting to throughout the entire beginning of the film.
It cleans up after itself, cooks meals, makes beds, etc.
At first I did not know there was going be a Cinderella 3; but after I watched it, I thought Cinderella 3 (as well as 2) are great sequels for everyone: kids and adults...like me.
I must say that I was very skeptic about this movie, especially after I watched Cinderella 2, which was really not very good.
Especially Gus and Jaq preforming "At the ball".A great plot line which shows Cinderella to have a more stronger personality and willing to fight for her happy ever after.
Cinderella, with the help of her mice friends Jaq and Gus, must now fight for her happily ever after.
Now to put a time frame on Twist, understand it starts a year after Cinderella has married the Prince.
Thus the first segment of II, starting right after Cinderella's honeymoon, has already happened in the beginning of Twist, but time is then rewound; the third segment with Anastasia and the Baker happens entirely after Twist; and the second segment, which was the stupid little story about the mice, is completely irrelevant.
I didn't expect any more character development in Twist, after all, it's before the point where she dances with him and we see that she's not exactly as she appears to be.
We see the Stepmother turn more wicked than she was in the first film after she gets the wand.
She dreams of a life of luxury, and because of her kind heart she has friends that do all the work for her, she gets her chance with a prince and after dancing she's in love and gets married.
the story behind silkwood is possibly an interesting one, which i will investigate further after writing the review.
The plant shut down one year after Silkwood's death, and there is still debate about whether or not plutonium from Kerr-McGee was supplied to Middle Eastern entities.
After being contaminated twice she soon discovered that someone was after her, probably for her part in trying to shut down the plant.
He's great in one scene (spoiler) after Karen (and an older lady employee named Thelma) have been "contaminated" and Karen asks him if its changed how he feels about her.
For instance, the first 30 minutes of the movie spend way too long dealing with Karen's relationship with her three children, who are now in the custody of her ex-husband, but never appear in the movie after that.
However, as is the case with a good handful of Nichols's films after Silkwood, the ending comes before once is ready for it.
This film was showed to high school students who became equally fascinated by the story after viewing the history channel's video.
Disturbing battle violence, a scene of full frontal male nudity, a very graphic and prolonged gang rape scene with thrusting and screaming, and an unnecessary sex scene between Boudica and her lover after battle.
Anyway, the fighting was well done, but teh ending was too abrupt and left the viewer wanting to know what happened after the battle.
Then, after that, it bears no resemblance to the book.
(which actually occurred years after Claudius's death).
It had to do with a rented apartment that was occupied by Col. Holloway, Donald Randolph, just after he was discharged from the military after the end of WWII.
Released two years after Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, MGiQ is the poorer man's version, though it has its own charms, mostly in the way of the LA settings and Bray's portrayal, tired and unshaven, but with the determination of a pit bull.
The story started off well enough, but after just a bit, the FBI's NetForce started looking like a bunch of nerds playing in cyber-space.
<shakes his head> It could have been better, but I couldn't rate it too low, after all, it DID have a very good twist at the end (no spoiler here!
Now those movies are classics and sort after by everyone who sees them on TV.
I saw this film at the Cleveland Film Festival, it was one of the few US films showing, so I wanted to see it, but after reading the review in the festival magazine, my expectations were low.
We got to talk to the director of this movie after it was shown and he pointed out that he wrote in a week.
The mother dies, the family has to move, the father is blinded defending the Kings' cattle from thieves even after he's been fired.
During a Q&A after the screening in Cleveland, Gottfred said as of yet there is no distribution deal.
While the people around him are convinced that he is crazy, we are not so sure, because after all, we are watching his movie, aren't we??
The writer/director who discussed his movie after the screening at the Ashland Film Festival, said he made this movie based on his own experiences making movies...and while it pays a hilarious tribute to the process of film making I think it goes even deeper.
Maybe I'm not even the right person to be reviewing this documentary, seeing as to how I was born long after the '60s were over.
Richie havens, Joan Baez,country Joe and the fish, and ten years after Alvin lee were great, all the footage made great documentary of the first and only real rock concert.
The film's odd legacy would continue, shortly after I saw Wavy Gravy in person at a university drug symposium - "What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand!"
Seeing the movie after all these years inspires me to alter slightly that old adage about lemons; in the playful spirit of the hippie generation, 'If life hands you mud, make mudslides'!
I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long.
James Toback directed the film to showcase Kinski and expected her to become a superstar after it's release.
With a plot line that ultimately lands "Derek Wu" mixing with the wrong crowd after returning from a stint in the slammer, Yee manages to steal the show.
I just watched a screener of this film after a friend who worked on post-production insisted I watch it.
I was looking on IMDb for more info on this film and I was compelled to write this after reading heartless comments left by immature users.
I just rented this film after looking at the cover for weeks at Blockbuster.
But it definitely is boring if your concept of a horror movie is limited to gore and run-for-your-life scenes after every 5 minutes of dialogue.
You know, the kind where after they've come and gone you must back em up for a second take.
Jesse Bradford plays Bobby, a twenty something recently released from prison after doing a stint for killing a guy who attempted to rape his HOT girlfriend (played by Ameiia Warner) in a restroom.
Can't go with Kirby, though - think he's a real turnoff especially after he's filed sexual harassment charges.
When I wrote about this show for the first time, I did it after the pilot episode.
But after 7 episodes, I feel myself able to truly say something about it.
What I feel after 7 episodes is that for sure is an interesting plot, but the show is getting a lot late to make it interesting.
Kim Raver is by far the best choice because she's proving to be one of the best TV actresses of the time, she's always a lot convincing and her character is for sure the best edged of the show, her previous works with strong characters like Kathlyn Hale in "The Nine", or Audrey Raines in "24" and Kim Zambrano in "Third Watch" gave her great bases for the confidence and the dramatic lines that Nico needs and Lipstick Jungle is being all about her and she deserves this attention after so many supporting roles.
The plot is flowing in slow motion and after so wrong twists seems like the writers are finally getting in their shape after hard 7 episodes.
When, after watching an episode, you find yourself discussing what could have been instead of discussing what just happened, you know what the fate of the show is going to be, and that's what happened!
THIS is the first time i think this has been portrayed by a man in a sitcom, i mean in this honest way - a man, in the position a woman usually is/or was, after her kids grew up and shes there suddenly having no plans in life, being angry that she didn't foresee this day coming - because she didn't take time to work or achieve her personal goals, in order to take care the rest of the family.
(Unless I have been completely hoodwinked - I was born just after the war!)
The challenge of balancing right and wrong is integrally woven into each show, and I find myself thinking about moral dilemmas presented in each episode long after watching.
Comparing his performance with those of the actors reminds me of the supposed comment of director van Dyke after the filming of Rose Marie, starring Nelson Eddy as a mountie: "It was easier to get a good performance from his horse than it was from Nelson".
As they decide to pool their resources together to hunt the leopard down, new evidence comes to light that it may not be the creature after all.
It's not exciting to see that scene after scene of watching people do absolutely nothing yet continue to talk away.
It happens off-screen after a pretty nice set-up.
It contains two very frightening sequences--one in which a young girl is locked out of her house while the leopard is after her; the other is one of the scariest locked in a cemetary after closing sequences I've ever seen.
Director Jacques Tourner here had his third and final teaming with Lewton (after "The Cat People" and "I Walked with a Zombie") and he really ratchets up the tension in some scenes.
After a great start, with an extremely suspenseful scene with a woman outdoors alone on a dark street with a panther loose, but after this dramatic part the film bogs down big-time....down to a crawl at times.
And the minimalist script leaves a great deal in the dark, and even after the picture's florid, almost surreal climax, the air of mystery lingers.
Soon after a leopard, hired from a traveling circus for a publicity stunt, escapes from a fancy nightclub, horribly mutilated bodies begin to turn up in a Mexican border town.
Though not filmed; the after effects of the revelation are shown graphically; her mother on the floor of her room packing Annabels bag, crying and moaning as she removes all trace of her daughter from her life.
The story has this people living in a building that is about to be taken over by some corporation...what this has to do with anything is beyond me as this is never touched on after the city goes crazy.
A man awaits his daughter's return home after a tour of duty in Irag I am guessing.
It was an excellent movie, much better than anything that came before or after it.
Naturally, SciFi isn't showing it again anytime soon (why show quality independent cinema when you can run 100 promos promising to show us the identity of the Final Cylon in its place, after all?)
The only thing that bothered me is the female character--the daughter of the protagonist--who is returning home after having, presumably, served in Iraq, complete with a scar on the left side of her face.
She comes chasing after so do several other turned citizens.
Appropriately grim with a rather downbeat climax as governmental biological teams finally arrive after night closes, with many of the cast members either dead or turned.
Clutch (Nick Damaci) is a former boxer who is the "big brother" of the building in that he tries to look after everyone's needs.
When Clutch learns that his daughter Casey (Kim Blair) is returning home after a tour of duty where she was wounded, there is another dimension added to Clutch's responsibilities.
Meanwhile, Clutch's daughter Casey arrives in New York City after serving in the Middle East and begins making her way home.
It was very Indie-looking from the beginning, with gritty film stock and no-name actors, but after worrying for the first few minutes that this could mean "cheesy", I realized that the film felt authentic instead.
They are acted like regular people, don't have any outstanding abilities (ones a former boxer, his daughter is coming back from a vet center after fighting in Iraq (a small subplot of the film is her attempting to get to the apartment complex during all the chaos), and that's about it).
It had some jump scares, but it kept getting freaky even after the jump.
At the end, you see one of the main characters on a rock but I had no idea why but after reading the plot on this site I realize why.
I always thought Molly Ringwald was the prettiest actress I ever saw, but after seeing Brooke Langton, that may not be the case.
My girlfriend and I had just finished watching John Hurt in Michael Radfordâs Nineteen Eighty-Four and I put this documentary on because I thought a nice short colorful coral reef film might be nice after such a grey depressing movie.
Or, was the booby trap set off after Robin left the jail?
i.e., after the credits.
Dialog is delivered with pauses after nearly every line as if they just spoke some profound words that will be remembered for the ages.
Vi has broken up with her boyfriend after his obviously autobiographical story is panned horribly by the school teacher who scathes it.
Vi, stricken, gets hammered, lights up and... well... let me just put it this way... after having her last story ripped to shreds by the professor, her next story is certainly something of an improvement.
When asked how he plans to attain his dreams of stardom, he answers: "I don't know, see if I have any connections... whatever..." After a meet-strange with a documentian Toby, both seem to be exactly what they're looking for and maybe their seemingly unobtainable dreams might have a chance of coming true after all.
But after some hard questions and earnest promises, he agrees.
However, these exploits end after a mere 10-15 minutes, to be followed by an entertaining saga of a Jewish family, their mentally unstable Putzfrau, and a nerdy, confused filmmaker wannabe.
It is Solondz after all.
I felt I had gained little after it was over, though I will say that the concept and themes explored are quite interesting.
No doubt wary after his previous ventures, Solondz attempts to circumvent some of the criticisms that less savvy viewers are bound to make.
The storyline in fact works perfectly fine until after the kids decide to do something.
TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS has been restored by Flicker Alley and TCM after being unavailable for decades.
So she jumps in, swims around for about 30 seconds then gets out and just sits there, She heres something in the bush, so she turns of the tape to look around, next thing you know a gun is being pointed straight at her head.. and BANG, her head falls into the pool, and the start credits come up, Not to bad for a beginning, But after the credit the storyline is about a bunch of filmmakers that set out to an island to make a light hearted comedy, But the actors that the producer's have set up aren't really what you would call Great,,, or even Good.
Bari Suber was great, shame she never did anything after this.
Sure, they have a lot of canned goods, but something tells me they'd be in poor health after a lifetime of poor eating habits.
That means approximately nine generations after the ones who first lived there, and in often there are three generations alive at any given time.
It was angry, in your face and catch a look at a little message after the closing credits,.
Babe Ruth fans must have known this was all hogwash in 1920, so it's difficult to ascertain the film's pointÂ possibly, this was a proposed film about a baseball player; after Ruth signed on, the story was probably tailored for the famous baseball star.
You may just feel like playing the piano yourself after watching this.
Jane has three men after her in the movie.
Olsen & Johnson are up to their same antics again, but after the opening scene of the Universal lot running for cover, the film can't maintain the pace of that scene or what made Hellzapoppin a laugh riot.
It may not seem as original and maybe it isn't, but I am still thinking about it, 12 hours after I saw it and personally I think that is great in this era of popcorn films...  Other aspects that are part of a movie, like lightning and acting are really great!!
I hate movies where you know the answer after 10 minutes.
An early scene where Thomas the patient flips out violently after being touched by an extremely hot, sexually agressive young woman gives away the fact that Thomas was sexually molested as a child, although like a bad poker player who shows his cards but figures nobody was really paying attention anyway the filmmakers seem to think the audience will react with something other than complete indifference or a loud duh when they finally pull the molestation card out about forty minutes later.
Both times after watching this I felt that world isn't fair.
And if you're not entertained during and pleased after it, well.
Giving away some of his possessions, drinking and casual sex run a gamut of things Benjamin attempts after learning he has five weeks to live.
Wong Chai Chi also known as Mai Tai Tai begins to develop a relationship with a leading member of the group Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang) but flees the group to Shanghai after she witnesses the group actually murder a Traitor to the nationalistic movement after she was goaded into luring him into a house.
Furthermore she had to sexually seduce this victim after mechanically losing her virginity to one of the members of the group for training.
Three years after her separation from Kuang they are reunited in Shangai.
People do and probably always will make decisions in a time of passion be it political, moral, or sexual, that after a time of more rational thought they might not have made.
Half an hour after the movie, you won't rember who did it or care.
The sophisticated and empathic audience is sure to find this film a winner that will haunt their thoughts long after more foolish viewers have lost interest.
However, after reading dozens of reviews from mainstream media in North America, I have a strong feeling that most critics failed to understand the movie - not only the subtleties, but even some of the plot.
I am very impressed by this film after just watching 5 minutes of it.
There was a scene after she finished having sex with Leung and goes to report to her superior officers.
Sure it seems like a story in a decade, but after all they are the flashbacks of the leading female role.
That Lee chose to make such a film after his phenomenal success in Hollywood, and during this period of phenomenal progress for modern China, gives Lust Caution a heightened sense of relevance and urgency, a film that can potentially invite questions on what it deeply means to be Chinese, to be Asian.
I watched this film when i was about 14 and spent the next decade hunting for it after it became deleted, i recently came across it and watching it now i can appreciate it in its silly 80's glory!
Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip.
With a cold heart he turned the old lady away, ounce and again after she warned him to not be fooled by appearances.
Like many other Disney films, I'm still impressed with this one after rediscovering it.
Tonight I watched again after 4 or 5 years and it just opened my eyes.
He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father.
The castle and the woods were gorgeous, the ballroom was beautiful, but the best was the breathtaking scene right after Belle dumps Gaston and runs out to the field behind her house.
the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow.
The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination.
Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts.
They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.
Not to mention that after he realized that he wasn't cut out to be a part of that business he had plenty of time and chances to get out of it.
I believe it would be fairly to blame it on stupid writing that made the character take one wrong stupid choice after the other.
With Ringo set to make the film Magic Christian in February 1969 it is hard to see how the group could have got back together after six months apart.
I sat down tonight and watched this film, after a full week of re-watching the Beatles Anthology, I was really excited to see this film because it's suppose to be so hard to find, well let me tell you I was so disappointed I can't even begin.
The Beatles actually would continue for another year after the film was shot (they had yet to make 'Abbey Road,' for instance), but it is clear that 'Let It Be' catches them at as low a point as they were to reach in many ways.
This was an early ordinary rockumentary about 4 ordinary yet very talented blokes in their late 20's at the peak of their creative powers, in the process of readjustment to being mere hairy bickering mortals again after experiencing a few years of quasi-godhood.
I'd argue after watching this and listening to Let it Be... Naked that the majority of the songs are as great as the main tracks on Abbey Road.
Then there's organ pianist Billy Preston who might have officially become the fifth Beatle had the group not split up some time after this film.
In fact, the boys, obviously after a lengthy layoff, gradually get back into things over the course of the film and by the end of the creative process are once more musical dynamite.
Back-to-back, out of nowhere after all the fumbling rehearsals, suddenly we get two perfect, crystal-clear music videos of Paul singing "Let It Be" and "The Long and Winding Road" (better than the released versions imho).
"Abbey Road," which came after this and was the culmination of the Beatles legend, put the lie to that forever.
This movie is just an hour-and-a-half long after school special.
he takes a few tentative steps away from the group, and returns - after coming up against challenges when he strikes out on his own or gets pulled back in by other members.
There are revelations of varying degrees in every scene that left me wondering, where are they going to go after this - like life, this film is quite willing to keep moving, with or without you coming along.
The Anarchist's Cookbook seems doesn't seem terribly concerned about making one big statement, instead, after establishing the characters, pushes them into a situation and tests their reaction.
If you think after watching this that anarchy is about violence you are wrong, please re watch the movie up until Johnny black shows up.
The plot is that a plastic surgeon is asked to alter four women into perfect specimens, but three of them are killed after wards (they never really explain why.)
arguments in which there IS an _opposing_ point of view, rather than just blind anti-Republican, anti-Bush hatred (8-9)*5 For proof (rather most recent of many), of the many just watch his defense of Kerry Nov 2 2006, soon after his (Kerry's) gaffe about lacking education and ending up in Iraq.His hilarious attempt at bolstering his position is even crushed by his own guest Thomas Ricks.

Does anyone believe that Olbermann would ever go after a liberal the way Hannity did Voinovich over immigration?
He goes after all the idiots running our country and points them out for what they really are.
Instead of selling the car he always bring it back after cruising the city in the night.
Mahzun falls in love with a heroine addict and everything hidden in him comes out after this... Tabutta Rovasata is a good movie with a strong story, charming characters and good acting..One of the best of 20th century Turkish cinema.
Granted- I haven't seen this movie in quite some time- but I had to drop by and defend it's honor after reading some of the others reviews written about it.
There were many funny scenes and Michael York made a fanstastic Devil; they always filmed scenes with him after taking the usual 'express elevator' to Hell.
Watching this sequel of THE SHEIK I keep seeing everything that had already been recycled in the Broadway operetta DESERT SONG - also filmed as an early talkie, shortly after SONG OF THE SHEIK.
Because even after all those years - his 'hypnotic gaze' in the film remains hypnotic.
I like some stupid movies for various reasons;a favorite actor or actress,a setting or plot involving something I find interesting,or I need a laugh after a hard day or night.
The stories you read about him were often written as much as 1000-1300 years after he was to have lived and vary tremendously--and they are essentially myths.
I would have loved a good castle siege or sacking here and there throughout the film...and I kept waiting and waiting and it only came too late--after I was pretty bored with the film.
Hal Foster sent many pages of corrections after he read the script.
The biggest problem is that it is, after all, a fifties film, with all the good and bad points of the fifties.
The story itself is thin and we sort of jump straight into the story after very few introductions.
You get a few thrills from the action scenes and after watching it I felt like I hadn't wasted a good hour and a half, but then again I could have found something else to do also without loosing a good nights sleep over missing this film.
I risked this movie after reading comments here and elsewhere.
It's called Megalodon but we don't see the shark until well after the fact, and they really don't seem to freak out about the fact that the shark is supposedly prehistoric but now lives in our ocean.
I sat down to watch this expecting a b movie, not great but one that was still entertaining - I didn't get that, I watched it with a friend of mine and we didn't talk to each other for half an hour after it finished simply because we were in shock at how bad it was.
The other rig workers disappear after one scene and, save for a disembodied voice, are never heard from again.
I tried to watch the entire movie, but after 15 minutes I've started to fast-forward the movie and watch only the key scenes.
*Spoiler*   The guy disappeared after the explosion.
Not a single part of his ship could be seen in the crystal clear water after his completely pointless suicide mission, I mean he could have got away easily.
One of the favourite scenes is when David (Peter Dalle), after one of many quarrels with Marie (Lena Endre), smashes the TV-set he just bought in the street and then gets arrested by the police.
The first meant doing whatever the studio said, and the second meant that what the studio told him was to play the racketeer personality that had sold "Public Enemy" in film after film.
Paul Draper who was the dancer/comedian in the cast was in fact blacklisted shortly after this came out.
( Interestlingly someone commented that they were suprised that this movie wasn't blacklisted, Draper ( according tot he IMDB bio) was "was an international star in the 1930's and 1940's" who's "career effectively succumbed to the anti- Communist hysteria that existed in the U.S. after World War II, when he was blacklisted out of the entertainment industry as a Communist sympathizer."
The main plot of an inventor creating 'telepods' that accidentally become gene fusers gives the film its Sci-Fi element and the way Goldblum's character transforms after he goes through is very commendable.
Cronenberg keeps the basic plot from the Vincent Price classicÂa scientist experimenting with teleportation becomes horribly disfigured after his body is accidentally merged with that of a houseflyÂbut discards the silly notion of a man sporting a massive fly head and arm.
The final scene were Brundlefly emerges from the teleport after merging with metal and wants Veronica to end his suffering is a truly touching scene almost unheard of in the genre   Being an 1980s movie means we're devoid of CGI and count your blessings for that because the make up here deserved throughly deserved the Oscar it won .
The best thing about the movie is that he didn't turn into a fly straight away after he left the machine; he was slowly throughout the whole film which really created the suspense & the tensive mood.
There'll be time for that after you're married."
In FOUR'S A CROWD he's the nation's richest man, who has a secret passion that is sillier in it's way than trout fishing (which, after all, is exercise).
I bought the DVD recently, especially for Halloween--which of course, it arrived 3 days after.
I can think of few things worse than being quarantined after exposure to a deadly pestilence with limited medical resources...relying only on hope to save me, which quickly turns to despair as those around me fall into the darkness.
Â after 16 minutes anyway.
He doesn't instruct a sub-ordinate to commit suicide, but he publicly humiliates them and pushes a revolver towards them after making it quite clear that their military career is over.
In 1912, a stern old Greek general finds himself trapped on the ISLE OF THE DEAD after an outbreak of the dreaded plague.
I watched this show when it was first released on television, more than ten years ago, and loved it, and after a recent viewing, found the show had not lost any of it's edge!
The bank rip-off seems pretty well thought through but everything after that just seems like crap, plotwise.
Having watched this film, I became bored after about 30 minutes and as it was only just over 90 minutes long I persevered in the hope it would improve!!
And add to these people a   couple that had a dream of living happily ever after.
It is weird, but in all the time that I have spent watching this movie and watching the commercials I thought that I would never ever be able to tell them apart (Heather and Heidi, that is), but after studying it, I could tell them apart just fine.
Famous, as about every film buff knows, for being the movie in which infamous gangster John Dillinger and "The Lady In Red" exited from and Dillinger was gunned down shortly after leaving the theater.
That part of the story is heavily contrived, but it works very well regardless because after all it is a 1930s movie.
Despite its melodramatic but never overwrought style 'Manhattan Melodrama' has sufficient weight and substance to make itself heard 70 years after the fact.
I couldn't believe that it was so expensive to purchase since it is out of print for 5 years, but my husband had spoiled me this Christmas, after hearing my nostalgic story.
Although it is well acted, I found myself squirming after a while with this narrowly focused film.
A beautiful college girl is set up by criminals after she "rejects" the bizarre and violent sexual advance/attack on her by a deviant pimp.
It is absolutely fine with me even if the theme of the movie disturbs me, but trying to convince me that there is goodness in this world after letting me see the worst of it - doesn't work.
I noticed that this film contains bits of celluloid that was picked up off the cutting room floor after Kim's renowned "3-Iron" was made.
Many weeks/months/years later, after Han-Ki goes to jail, one of his men offers to let her go.
The central protagonist had a peculiar lack of lines and the college girls venomous retort after his first unwanted advance made you wonder who was really the bad guy.
He chases after her and finally catches her.
I saw this film shortly after seeing the same director's The Isle and was much more affected by this production, although they are both striking works.
Inveigled into prostitution after a tough guy develops a romantic fixation on her in the street, she gradually comes to accept her new condition in life, the advances of her captor and even grows to 'like' being in the arms of her customers.
The thug spends his first night with his love, an unconsummated encounter after which she sleeps on the floor beside him.
This phase took place after the untimely death of one of the greatest animators of all time when Charles M. Schultz,the creative force behind Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang,passed away.
Before or after you go over the river and through the woods for your holiday feast, watch this cartoon.
Musa was one of these films that is so absorbing that after two hours when the film had ended, it seemed like on an hour and a half.
Initially the five paralleling story lines seem disparate, yet watching them ultimately intersect in inspired ways is one of the film's innumerable pleasures: a husband tries to repeatedly kill and bury his wife, but she keeps returning, even more indestructible; three young burglars break into houses and get into trouble; a London hit-man travels through Japan with his interpreter/employer, continually asking people what function they serve in life; attending a hypnotist's performance with his family, a salary man becomes permanently convinced he's actually a bird; and a driven advertising director has to reexamine her life after her increasingly hysterical ideas for television commercials are rejected.
It put me in mind of Trainspotting, if Shallow Grave had been one of its stories and there was more life after death.
The film focuses on several story lines, from the fairly tame (the sexual confusion of a group of young friends), to the surreal (the murdered wife who keeps returning to beat up her husband in ever more bizarre ways), to the absurd (the man stuck in a trance thinking he's a bird after the hypnotist is killed)...and beyond.
Several days after viewing the movie, I still find myself walking down the street, remembering a funny scene or line, and laughing wildly to myself about it.
He asks, and then his face shows great concern as he repeats after his wife: "What, the bathroom lights are out!"
Why does the woman in commercial business run after her lost recordings, only to stop before she reaches it with a sigh: "I'm so stupid?"
It also leaves the impression that the mastermind actually spent serious time after coming up with such issues fertile for reflection.
Beery's Champ does everything he can to properly raise his son Dink, but he's not very smart, and he's not exactly a great father; he suffers from gambling and alcoholism, and it's often the kid who has to look after the dad.
Dink and Andy have a magical relationship but after a heartfelt scene Andy convinces Dink to live with his mother, but with Dink away, he loses the will to go on.
Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them.
When he gets to show his character's emotional vulnerability, the scene is doubly poignant coming after the macho confidence he normally displays.
The Champ is guaranteed four handkerchief film even now almost eighty years after its debut.
The movie is original in the way that the life of Amelie (and her friends/family/acquaintances) is presented; However the novelty wears off after an hour or so, and all that's left is a trite, highly predictable movie that I wound up turning off.
The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade.
I must say, after I've watched this move, I now consider it my all-time favorite.
this is one of those movies that leave you in a good mood after you watch it.
Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity.
I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time.
Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...
L'Anglier doesn't return her letters, and after she purchases arsenic, he dies of arsenic poison, having become ill at her house once before.
The case, which was a media sensation in its day, ended with Ms. Smith being released after the jury reached the verdict of "not proved", which, in Scottish law, meant there wasn't enough evidence to convict her but sufficient evidence to entertain doubts about her innocence.
(By the way, I warn you... after I saw it I caught myself singing that Dionne Warwick song for weeks afterwards.)
One night during their stay, after returning from a day of looking at plantations, John sees the silhouettes of the prince and Lillie on the drawn shade of the house just after the prince has grabbed her for a quick kiss.
Trevor Morgan was not yet 20 when he did this film,he too is a troubled teen who is befriended by Nick Nolte after he does a bit of vandalism to Nolte's house.
Maybe that is why it died at the box office after a few weeks without really making it big.
Go see "Off the Black" and "Apocalypto" on the same weekend and I am certain you will feel better after the Ponsoldt Movie.
As Ponsoldt pointed out in the Q&A after the screening, the setting is supposed to be his Georgia home.
Those aren't my words -- they are those of Ponsoldt in the Q&A after the film, who said that he actually wrote the film as a romantic love story.
Most will not be surprised at Nolte's performance -- he is, after all, a veteran if there ever was one.
However, the pacing does pick up after a draggy first hour, and the supporting players are interesting.
As her flamboyantly traumatized and traumatizing son, Frank Langella gets to chew up the scenery, which he does with great relish (before "Dracula," after his memorable film debut in "Diary of a Mad Housewife" and Mel Brooks's adaptation of "The Twelve Chairs").
I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.
That's what I felt after watching that movie, it's really close to the society and the public's pulse, some overestimation is there but through comic frame, you'll enjoy watching that movie Marwan Hamed is not an ordinary director, he is one of the best around.
There is so much music here I often break this up into a couple of viewings, but no matter where I pick this back up in the concert, it's a good starting point because it's simply one good song after another.
In "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye", it's the one where the oblique upward camera angle captures Ralph Cotter over the garage pit right after he dumps the body of Vic Mason (Rhys Williams).
I'm a bit apprehensive over the Holiday Carleton character, I actually found her to be somewhat pathetic, particularly when she trades lip locks with Cotter after he slaps her around with a towel.
Then again right after she manages to miss Cotter with all that kitchen artillery.
In KTG, Cags plays Ralph Cotter who after a daring and violent daylight prison break, uses his smarts to prove that he is no small timer and formulates a grand scheme to garner lots of cash and protection which involves crooked lawyers and crooked policemen.
Holiday clearly dislikes Cotter initially but after an incident where he smacks her around the head with some towels, her demeanour changes and she starts to become attracted to him and agrees to him staying at her apartment.
Cotter then gets involved with another woman, the daughter of a wealthy businessman and after the couple get married and jealous Holiday discovers who killed her brother, Cotter's problems start to escalate alarmingly.
Better than those that came before, superior to those that came after.
This has an effect on the "moral and upstanding" man and after mulling over what to do; he decides to deal out his own punishment...
Like most films by this director, MANSION OF THE LIVING DEAD is best watched first thing in the morning after the caffeine has just kicked in.
A solemn, sombre echo from an era since long lost, which after the forgetful ravages of time still can like the bird of Phoenix rise from the ashes of oblivion to once again let its plumage shine with unprecedented respectability.
Directed by Leslie Howard(who also played Mitchell)The First Of The Few tells his story from an idea he had one day watching the birds to the planes flying in the war.Made in 1942 a year after the Spifires helped win The Battle of Britain this is an uplifting film made I imagine for the sole purpose of building troop morale.
Geoffrey backs him up 100 percent and is the test pilot for Mitchells aircraft.However tragedy is just around the corner when (after working flat out without sleeping or eating)Mitchell feels unwell and consults a Dr who tells him if he does not stop he will die in just a year.Will Mitchell ignore the advice or heed it?well if you read about him you will know if you don't know the story then watch this wonderful film.David and Leslie have a great chemistry and play their parts well a must see film about an important part of British history.
As one bemused company director remarks after an encounter with the character's unassuming forcefulness, "But I thought you said he was *shy*..?"
Leslie Howard was killed in an airplane crash shortly after finishing this film.
It's less visceral than the only other Tsai film I've seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of doorways (holes) into others' emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here, as Tsai sets up long shot after long shot, usually with long takes, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei.
A plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor.
Read the book after you see it, and you'll be amazed.
First, I read the book after I saw the movie and was surprised by the different direction the movie took.
However, after I read the book, I thought the movie could have been so much better.
after i first saw it i walked out of the theater in wonder... and the comments that i heard from others that saw it - they thought that it was just as good as i did!
they are similar however... enough for me to know most of what was being said after watching the movie for a while.
for a while after i saw the movie i looked to buy it.
All of the news sources quoted in the film are from right after the attacks.
As a matter of fact, I don't think there is a single news article quoted that was from after 2001.
Why would the US government blow up the third building ('building 7') with bombs, hours after the attack?
Every military person, every politician, every analyst, every aide, every national security person should have resigned in disgrace after 911.
Boy oh boy... factual error after factual error... outright lie after outright lie... pissing on grave after grave of 9/11 victim...
The stupid message aside, even the technical aspects are not that impressive, the graphics are pretty ugly, the music dull and even the speaker voice gets pretty annoying after a while.
Also we heard from the media that there was 20.000 people in the building at the time of the collapse, or at least it was speculated within the first 24 after 9/11.
Like why the small explosions in the Twin Towers after the planes have hit?
There's example after example, of dishonesty, trickery and stupidity.
In this case, to accept what Loose Change suggests is to acknowledge that your government doesn't serve the people after all, but only its own secret agenda, and that voters are just a necessary inconvenience in some sort of twisted Orwellian world we never knew we were part of, that need to manipulated to bring them around to accept the rhetoric of the day.
Nicole Eggert's contribution is less than stellar, times must be tough after Baywatch.
Are you going to believe that a college kid is still flirting with a space alien after he's seen tentacles?
Quite frankly, I was not expecting much after reading some of the posts here... but I decided to watch it anyway and was riveted!
The excessive stupidness of some of the college students got a bit annoying after a while.
Obviously no-one believes Luke but when Bobby Johnson (Mark Trottier) is found dead under mysterious circumstances Luke is convinced the alien babes are behind it & since he is blamed for Bobby's murder after having a fight with him earlier in the evening Luke has even more reason to expose the alien menace on campus....
Soon after that, we get memorable lines from Luke such "how about the belt of O-FRYIN!'
This type of movie is supposed to be a little over the top, after all.
The hubby is really not seen too much after that other for some occasional nookie and seeing running the ranch.
Orson Welles shows up eventually after the obligatory wish washy scene and leaves with his wife.
I think the second worst aspect, after the terrible story line, was Lange's acting.
Then the son, after being led around by the nose by the evil mother does a complete about face in the space of a few minutes on the strength of his wifes unsubstantiated accusations.
), and go on to leave happily ever after.
This is a film to watch with friends after having a few drinks, then one might enjoy the "masterpiece" some avid fans thought "Hush" was.
After being introduced to one greedy, scheming relative after another for the zillionth time, WE GET IT!
BUT, after 1001 warning signs AND when he then tries to kill two people (by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another), you'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot!
I stopped watching after 15 minutes or so...
They should have dropped the final cut of this mess into a vat of acid and tossed the director in after it.
He was just like a Bond-villain after a while, even with the idiotic laughter and everything.
I tried numerous download sites, checked websites after i read favourable right ups.
but surprisingly, i saw myself waking up day after day watching at least 3 episodes of Jewel in the palace.
and that was even after a few death threats and several frame ups.
I was searching for worthy Korean TV series to watch after having seen the more contemporary setting drama such as Stairway To Heaven, which is highly recommended.
If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible).
What Conte's after is not just the killer but the source of an infectious but non-microbial malaise that will claim Nichol, too, the night before he was to marry.
A great moment for me was when i in a Dungeuns and dragon game meeting stole Sam Neils Line after i was challenged by another knight.
I don't know what else to say besides the fact that I fell in love with this movie after I saw it the first time.
Everyone knows the film inside out but are still watching it year after year; fills in on every funny line (like when de Boeuf shouts "Striiip him!
I canÂ´t really say anymore if itÂ´s a good movie or not but I guess itÂ´s perfect for a day after...
"Tomorrow the World" is a thought provoking film about an American family who adopts a troubled German boy after the war.
Viewing it again after 35 years it was almost as affecting, with wonderful acting by a very strong ensemble cast, with Hope Lange a stand-out as the mother/ex-wife.
So, after you shake your head in disbelief at the ridiculous ending, you can at least look at the clock and thank the editors of this film for the fact that they could have wasted even more of your time.
I have to admit that after reading the users comments from "adyt23" and another terrible review, I went into it without any great expectations and with my finger on the erase button as it was recorded on my PVR(Tivo in the U S).
There are a number of minor holes in the plot, one of which involves how Nick managed to get a gun after falling into a lake out of the plane.
I believe after the MST3K folks scraped the bottom of the barrel to find films like "Manos: The Hands Of Fate", and "Mitchell", they took a peek under the barrel to find this piece of drivel lurking underneath.
And somehow, after all this interaction, the future from that point wasn't affected by the fact that these differently dressed people with strange accents that came down from the sky in a flying bird.
Characters meet themselves in other times and it gets really confusing like where did he get that gun after he jumped from the plane into the lake??
They of course are caught, but after an inventive escape they are taken on a whirlwind adventure in Arabia, with all the humor you might find in an Abbott and Costello movie.
