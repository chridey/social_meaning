Doris Day, the first actress to get billing over Cagney in over 30 years, deserved a nomination, but lost out to Eleanor Parker in "Interrupted Melody", also at MGM.
also James Cagney was brilliant as well/good chemistry between both leads... buy the video/ get the soundtrack.. if available.
It also stars the popular Doris Day as the singer who is sponsored by him.
Robert Keith is also good as an agent who has first-hand knowledge of Day's unhappy personal life.
Stero system would also help.
She won a few years later for I WANT TO LIVE...also, someone said her voice was dubbed for I'LL CRY..not so.
I also really liked the fight scene outside of the building.
In both films she was obliged to abandon the role of professional virgin with which she was also identified in favor of semi-pro actress and in both films she managed reasonably well.
I am one of many who also feel she deserved an academy award for her portrayal of Ruth Etting.
The film also keeps you a bit off balance, as the drama and personal turmoil between Ruth and Marty is offset by a whole host of musical numbers during Etting's rise to stardom.
In fact it's a real shame that Day didn't continue in this vein of acting, as many have said, but also, for me, that Mitchell subsided into hack television work.
Kaufman also plays an overacting janitor, supposedly has the biggest case of homophobia on earth because he thinks, I'm not kidding, that a man being eaten by another man is totally normal, homosexual behavior.
There's also a lengthy conversation about testicles and the eating of said organs.
There's also a running comment that no one should be in the college "at these hours," often through a truly pointless subplot about some jerk-turned-good guy who saves a girl he likes, who works inventory at a book store.
The zombies are also major wusses, who can be defeated by a few punches.
The music, drawn from Etting's most famous recordings, is also memorable, and Day pulls out all the stops for her songs.
But to also find her an accomplished actress of the melodrama is quite astonishing, since Day is often known as the fluffy powder puff of feather weight musical tripe, or, the squeaky clean, yet strangely asexual appendage of Rock Hudson.
Day is in great singing form and also holds her own as an actress.
Soon after, Helen also takes the potion, and avoids a large gun shot in her stomach.
Goldie is back to rub in her good looks and also to steal back wayward hubby Bruce Willis--not because she even wants him but because she CAN!
In her role Meryl Streep gave us so many wonderful,depicting and amusing little things that she does.Detailes,detailes!Goldie was also very funny,and Bruce was certainly unusual(but in a good way).
Rossellini is also good in her small but important role.
Meryl Streep is also AMAZING here, she is extremely hilarious, gorgeous, seemed to be having a ball, had some great costumes, was very unpredictable and i just loved her overall, she was amazing.
Goldie Hawn is also amazing here, she is very beautiful, funny, had some cool facial reactions, was quite bizarre at times, and just rocked overall!.
But also the whole essence of eternal youth, beauty and living forever, and Death Becomes Her handles the subject very well.
Interesting was also to see Bruce Willis in so different kind of movie I have used to see him.
Julie Strain appeared also in the credits and you wait for her appearance than you recognize disappointed that they only dubbed her voice as one of the callers.
Conrad Brooks, the young Cop from Ed Woods "Plan 9 from outer Space", appears also here but why???
This DVD includes also one of the worst and most boring Making-Ofs I've ever seen.
His first movie The Miracle of P. Tinto was very irregular, it had some great moments (like the opening B&W short) and also tons of unfunny and lame jokes and weirdness for the sake of weirdness.
The cast is excellent and the quality of the props and scenery are also excellent to watch.
It is not only the characters, but also all the background is related to the comic (and all the little details you can find).
I also have to say that things that look normal in the comics, may seem nonsense in the film, that's another component that I liked.
Also, while made in the midst of the Universal horror period, it demonstrates some of the best elements of that genre, however it also pre-figures the oncoming decade of sci-fi flicks of the 50s, but with a more intelligent, and mysterious, plot than most of the B sci-fi films that followed.
It also incorporates some noir elements such as shadowy images, gun play, etc.
The Man with Nine Lives is also known under the alternative title Behind the Door (which is actually more accurate).
As you conquer states you are also able to play as other states such as Gaul, Greece, Egypt, etc.
Medieval: Total War II is also very good and I will like to play Empire: Total War when it comes out.
*Memo to me, must search Ebay for Solitaire toy ... * Nuggit was cute also, reminded me of the Transformer Bumblebee!
I also like the Go Bot Characters, Leader 1, Sparky, Small Foot, Pathfinder, Scooter, Fitor and Cop-Tur, though it's been a while since I saw the movie and I can't remember if some of those characters were in it, alas.
I also wanted to know more about Solitaire, the Jewel Lord Diamond Queen!
When I first saw this movie(Vampire) on TV some years ago, and have looked for it ever since, I was enthralled with Richard Lynch, his portrayal is 'right on' in this role..............now some of you may not agree with me, but I also put Rutger Hauer in a similar category, delightful to watch, downright scary in some of his roles,(Nighthawks) but the ultimate romantic, if given half a chance...........of course, my all-time favorite love story movie is Ladyhawke, so I admit to being a tad prejudiced.......I have seen Richard Lynch in a number of TV movies, series, etc, but have lost track of him over the recent years......  there are also websites for Rutger Hauer where his fans can go to keep up with his movie roles, etc........He also is the founder of an organization that helps AIDS victims, mostly children, i believe.....called STARFISH.
He is also a supreme narcissist: In one shocking scene, he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel.
As the film progresses we learn this vampire is also evil, materialistic, vengeful, exploitative, selfish, and classically Evil with a capital "E".
An earlier film I saw him in is called The Premonition, where he portrayed a rather creepy carny; also a fascinating film.
The plot provides three possible suspects of the serial killings: a crippled and bitter ex-trapeze artist (Naschy) whose wife is among the victims, a handsome schoolteacher of noble birth but who's actually impotent and, surprisingly, a police commissioner who just happens to be the latter's boyhood chum and is also secretly in love with his wife (Orchidea De Santis, whom I saw in the flesh and on screen Â in Luciano Salce's equally obscure but infinitely superior political satire, COUP D'ETAT [1969] Â at the 61st Venice Film Festival)!
JACK THE MANGLER ( 1971 ) starring Paul Naschy aka SEVEN CORPSES ( MURDERS ) FOR Scotland YARD This is a very hard to see film, but is worth the hunt for fans of Naschy and also giallo knock offs.
Sadly, it's also the covered version of the film and not the nude version that was prepared for export.
This was also the film debut of Beal, Hamilton and Cattell (the only film she ever made).
Comedy lovers should also watch out for Red Dwarf co-star Norman Lovett in a very brief cameo.
He goes into town and "buys" a wife (Loretta Young), whom he treats with respect (he's a gentleman) but also quite aloofly (he's still deeply in love with his dearly departed wife and is not ready to move on).
This was also a nice change of pace for Robert Mitchum.
'Rachel And The Stranger' poignantly questions the role of women in society and also the portrayal of women in western films.
This movie is also shocking like most Verhoeven movies.
I also wish I did not throw away Basic Instinct.
I give this movie an excellent rating because it captures not only a way of life, but also great acting by well-known celebrities whose characterizations bring the story a sense of reality.
I also thought that Gary Gray added the right amount of drama/comedy to the whole show.
On the one hand, it has the feel of a western, but it is also a tender love story.
this triggers a battle of wills to win the heart of RachelÂand just to add to their problems the film is set against a backdrop of continuing raids by rogue Shawnee Indians on the local homesteads.This is truly a forgotten western classic that still feels very fresh today,Rachel and the Stranger is very very charming film,that is also very funny and has a simple but intelligent script,on top of that add three truly Epic performances by the three leads and an action packed finale and you have a wonderful film.
The movie is also a good depiction of frontier Ohio.
The theology  of the time was also extremely flawed.
it showed how the Jesuits convinced the Hurons in the end to be baptized by convincing them that they would be healed of their sickness if they accepted God and also it showed how the Jesuits did not claim the responsibility of the foreign diseases brought over from the Old World but blamed it on the Native's lack of Christianity.
this film also showed how both sides thought the other was stupid, the Native's believed the Jesuits God was the clock and didn't understand the whole concept or for instance when the Black robe was lost and the Native's were directing him- they didn't understand how or why these foreign people didn't know anything about working with the land.
Rutger Hauer is also a great, varied yet charismatic actor, and it seems his best work might be with Verhoeven.
They did, ... but there was also this little thing called the French and Indian War.
He falls in love with a beautiful and very young Indian chief's daughter, and tries to join their group -- and yet he also understands the priest, and is attracted to his spirituality.
But it also shows how nutty these priests were to try to preach to the unconverted.
It also presents several native American tribes (such as the Hurons and Mohawks) and how truly savage they could be.
On LaForgue's trek through the wilderness to the Jesuit mission to the Hurons LaForgue's companion the courier du bois Daniel (Aden Young) also ponders the same question.
I write this review mainly as a student of history, but in terms of the art of cinema I think Black Robe is also excellent.
This could also be considered the romanticizing "Dances With Wolves" effect.
That is also exactly correct!
And the sorcerer said: beviaire, witout the R. The way the natives are dressed and wears their hairs is also very exact in an historical view.
DMD also is beautifully-filmed.
He also is a good man, stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own well-being and is a gentle soul.
The Algonquins and the Hurons are also shown with their beliefs, too, and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white European-based priest.
Without spoiling the ending, or adding political/theological agendas my own, let me just add that if you enjoy a beautiful-looking movie which also has a thoughtful, haunting story with honest characters, you should check this out.
Alas - it also helps rob the British Army of its finest victory.
Satire is also magnificent in this, and it comments on more or less every aspect one could think of, relating to the period and situation.
The episode plots also had their relevance in war, and there were also some good settings, even though there were certain anachronisms.
The show also tries the mick of the British upper class attitude.
Hugh Laurie is also a very good comedic actor and his is delightfully naive as George who just sees the war as an adventure.
Stephen Fry is also a talented comedian, and is great at satirising the leadership of the British army.
General Hogmanay is also rather stupid and keeps making sure they are on the right track and doing what he wants.
After that movie people expected this movie to be a sort of "Turks fruit 2", also because it was once again directed by Verhoeven and had Monique van de Ven and Rutger Hauer as the two main leads.
"Turks fruit" and "Keetje Tippel" (and in a way also Verhoeven's earlier movie "Wat zien ik") show some similarities in the way the story is told but it are in fact of course two totally different movies.
The writing was also top notch.
'Blackadder Goes Forth' then is not only one of the most hilarious comedies written - better than 'Mash' if you consider the contrast between its scope and its brevity - but it is also a fitting tribute to all those poor souls who toiled and died and were lost.
Throughout the series there are some stars to look out for including: Rik Mayall as Lord Flasheart (who appeared in series 2, Adrian Edmondson as Baron Von Richtoven, Gabrielle Glaister as Driver Bob Parker (Bob also appeared in series 2, Miranda Richardson as Nurse Mary (appeared in series 2 and 3) and Geoffrey Palmer in a special appearance as Field Marshal Haig (in the last episode).
This forth and final series is perhaps the best of all the Black Adder episodes; it is also more of a tragi-comedy than just plain old slapstick perhaps because at the time (1989) the events of WW1 were very much in the minds of a lot of people, whether it be surviving soldiers or relatives.
The madness of this war also draws our attention to those very same front-line troops such as Blackadder, Baldrick & Lieutenant George.
Blackadder Goes Forth is far more intelligent than a lot of sitcoms; the writing and acting is exceptionally good, and also underpins the true human sacrifice the millions of soldiers gave to their King & country while the smug & arrogant Generals went home to more medals, honours and riches than ever before.
I also had the strange thought while watching of how great it would have been to have Johnny and June Carter Cash playing the leads, since this film was made in their heyday.
This is a very down to earth film story written by William Faulkner concerning a cotton farmer named Jackson Fentry, (Robert Duvall) who lives in the South and he is a poor person but also works as a watchman over a saw mill during the Winter.
The films "The Others" and "The Stir of Echoes" also come to mind, as perhaps, Friday the 13 and the story of Peter Pan which may be the main inspiration for the film that looks at the story of the boy who never grew up and stayed in Neverland from the point of view of his mother.
It makes us to identify with its main heroine, the orphan herself who after many years comes back to the very house she used to share with her childhood friends, also orphans and where she wants to open the house for the handicapped children.
There's what you see... and there's also what lies beyond.
Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare.
However, with the release of The Orphanage it appears I should also keep my eye on Spain.
Due to this I almost passed this film up, but I'm glad I didn't because I've finally found a haunted house film that I not only liked but also could sincerely call horror.
Those that aren't familiar with those previous films or wish to have their thrills in the form of Saw or Hostel will no doubt find The Orphanage tame and those that get their kicks from Asian horror (Gin gwai, Ringu etc) could also feel begrudged.
The timing of the scares and the execution of them are also done to perfection.
The film is dark, mysterious and harrowing like Guillermo del Toro's Pans Labyrinth - which also has child at the heart of the film.
Both films also drive home the extreme capabilities of imagination and dissolution.The film is presented by del Toro and, in much the same way Tarantino presented Hostel, there is no real direct evidence of his efforts on the screen.
There are entire sequences that are reminiscent of classic fright films: of course the boy with imaginary friends, as mentioned above; but also a psychic and her entourage right out of "Poltergeist"; there's a death I've seen before as well, I think out of one of the "Final Destination" films; and of course, the general outline--a ghost story set in an orphanage--is vaguely reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's own "The Devil's Backbone".
It is spooky and atmospheric in places, it has some jump scares, but it also has some out-and-out scares that are guaranteed to get to you, no matter how hard-core you think you may be.
It is truly a remarkable feat that hits home hard emotionally, but I will actually say also succeeded in me leaving with a smile on my face.
Thankfully, there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura.
The technical aspects of the film are also severely wanting.
Despite feeling like an effective throwback to American cult B cinema of the 1970s and 80s - namely the works of Walter Hill and John Carpenter, ATGS also has such a refreshing, contemporary feeling and a razor sharp sense of humour that I can't think how the film can possibly get boring or how anyone could not enjoy it.
There is dumb humor in this but there's also some sly and dark humor thrown in here & there which redeems it.
Plagued also by her devotion to God, she tries to fight these forbidden desires and lusts with prayer and penitence only to have them come back ten fold.
On the surface, ATGS is a black comedy with a great cast, but in the end is also a wonderful examination of group dynamics.
He is also one of the easiest ways to recommend this movie, as he totally dominates the screen whenever he is in it, to the point where it is completely believable that he intimidates two armed police officers in their squad car as he chases them down with a moped.
One could guess that some viewers who are offended by nudity may have been "turned off" by this film, which also may account for the low 3.2 rating.
The exotic setting in the past also helps give the film a sense of novelty.
Zalman King is an actor and scriptwriter who expanded his capabilities in mid career to include both producing & directing (more recently he has also very successfully tried his hand at cinematography, to complete what today has become a rare fivefold).
This featured another original film-script written by Zalman King, and its name was not derived from any previous literary or dramatic work, but was clearly intended to exploit the reputation which WO-1 had earned - no doubt its sub-title was also selected with the same objective.
The film is best described as a movie equivalent of the 'bodice ripper' paperback romances which appeal most strongly to the fair sex but men often also enjoy, and when televised they provide ideal entertainment for a couple.
The films ending is rather prolonged and is also somewhat weak, this is particularly noticeable because of the strong meat which preceded it, but Zalman King does deserve credit for ensuring that it was not made glaringly obvious long in advance.
The music is also convincing and very disturbing.
It was pretty sad but also heartwarming in a way.
Parks also got to sing on the show, and wasn't half bad.
The interesting news is that his mother also started watching them (not sure if this good news or not:-)).
I also hope that the Greek producers will make also a comedy on the subject and not always the drama stories that they usually do.
!And also Yabanci Damat will be played at Greek TV channel Mega TV in july.Anyway let's keep watching this beautiful and funny TV show...(I really don't understand why greeks like Nehir so much, she is hundred times uglier than Natalia Doussopoulos!!!)
My Grade: D-   DVD Extras: Art Gallery; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for "Terminatrix", "Weather Woman Returns", "Sunny gets Blue", "Beautiful Hunter", "Tokyo Mafia: Battle for Shinzu"; and a promo for the 2004 Big Apple Anime Fest   Eye Candy: it's a WIP flick, so almost every girl has a moment of nudity, but it's also a jap flick she no bush BOO!!
The girls' mother is an alcoholic (the doctor and chauffeur are also trying to keep her inebriated, so she doesn't stop their murder plot), and she always has friends over for parties.
Getting the two girl's widowed mom Mrs. Ritchey, Charlotte Merriam, good and drunk Nick and Dr. Ranger also known as "Twitchy" cut down the food intake for Desney & Nanny slowly having them die from malnutrition.
There is also some funny, snappy dialogue from Stanwyck and Blondell.
Joan Blondell is also great as her gum chewing friend, setting the standard for vulgarity.
I also liked the unethical doctor with his facial twist and snazzy uniform which must have influenced people who created the wardrobe for Starship Enterprise.
I own the video and have passed it along to co-workers who are also pediatric night nurses and it has become a cult favorite amongst my collegues.
There are also some nice directorial touches from William Wellman.
Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG.
The way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie.
There are a few cast members in it who went on to bigger and better things, notably Meg Foster and Bruce Dern; also the director Quentin Masters would later score a sexploitation hit with the Joan Collins movie The Stud.
The allusions to Virgina Woolf are also key to understanding.
I also very much appreciated Anna Ferguson and Alec Willows in this.
You want to be supportive, but also want to encourage them to face what you think are the realities of the situation.
Ozon also frequently uses reflections of Marie's face in order to convey the idea of her physicality, literally highlighting the reflective nature of her self-discovery: in order to truly recover from the loss of her husband she must re-identify herself, perhaps also coming to terms with her own mortality, the subject of which is most explicitly conveyed in her conversation with Vincent about Virginia Woolf.
It is also hinted at during her conversation with her mother-in-law: the two of them trading insults over who will be the first to end up in a psychiatric home, while Ozon makes studies of the mother-in-law's aging features.
The switch between scenes in English and French works well also though some of the subtitles are not so good.
I've seen "8 Femmes" as well and this is also a very good movie, although it's something completely different.
The death of a beloved person implies also a big loss, a loss which dependents refuse to believe.
He is also present in the character of Vincent, whom she replaces with her missing husband, talks to him and treats him as if it was Jean.
What also fascinates me is that even though the movie was realistic it was magical .
But the logic is such that we can also readily accept that they put aside their differences, eliminate as many of the Iron Boat clan sent in pursuit of TI LUNG's character, and finally, take on the evil leader of the clan (KU FENG).
SUN CHUNG and his crew show a wonderful eye for their locations, the exotic and distinctive costuming and weaponry (of the heroes, and also the thirteen Eagles, and of course, their leader).
The man he has wronged is also compelling in that instead of exacting quick revenge as we see with other martial arts films he wants to know his families murderer to find out why he killed them.
The ultimate protagonist and leader of the Eagles is also good but more in line with other kung fu baddies than as a truly original character.
There is some basic dishonesty in our own culture and also many humorous sayings that arn't to be taking literally.
I also recommend renting Shall We Dance.
I also really disliked the directing -- every trick in the book is employed, or rather overemployed, such as ominous music, sudden noises, and excessive foreshadowing.
Bert Hughes is home alone in his Manhattan apartment,trying to work out a major change in his trust company when a noisy rat starts scratching around his periphery and he becomes obsessed with exterminating it.By the time Hughes is through,his whole apartment is nearly exterminated-and his friends are keeping their distance due to his rat-mania.Pretty suspenseful and effective rat invasion flick with terrific central performance of Peter Weller.Several memorable moments were the diner table discussion turned to rats and everyone felt uncomfortable;and the end battle with the rat.There are also some very effective jump scenes that were finding the cat on top of the refrigerator and the toilet scene.Overall,"Of Unknown Origin" is a fine animal attack film that deserves rediscovery.8 out of 10.
When the medieval rat traps don't work or come back gnawed on he decides to get a cat, which also comes back gnawed on (or replaced with a cheap stuffed animal that resembles his cat).
I am also rather desensitized to horror films.
That's not to say that it's a bad film, however, as there are a lot of good ideas on display, and the film also features what may be a career best performance from Peter Weller.
Director George P. Cosmatos, who also helmed the Sly Stallone action vehicles "Rambo: First Blood Part II" and "Cobra," wrings plenty of tension out of the creepy premise, expertly maintains a snappy pace throughout and stages the ample jolting shocks with a considerable amount of flair and skill.
DVD also has the original theatrical trailer.
However, it also showed the down side with drugs and the horrible price one has to pay for living this type of life.
), but the first time when she dances for Robert Davi you can see a nip slip, not much I know but the best you gonna get; also Emmanuelle Vaugier shows her ass   My Grade: D-
She also mixed selling drugs with selling sex - one of the golden no-no's.
I really enjoyed how the movie was well rounded, not just focusing on the best highlights, but also showed how he used positive and negative criticism to motivate the students, as well as their reactions to it.
Why was the nudity so apparent couldn't they just have moved past these scenes as they would make the movies rating towards the adult rating.Why was only the Americans girls family shown reacting to her arrest the guy in the story might have had family reacting badly to his arrest, this would have shown how he had a life to lose also.
At the end the girl confesses while the man doesn't - also at the end the Chinese interrogator is highly praised by his supervisor while the American interrogator goes home - quite unnoticed by anyone.
On the other end of the spectrum, the agents also don't want to lose their jobs.
The best parts of the movie were the 3-4 clips in between of various us presidents talking about freedom and democracy provided by their nation to their own citizens and also to the world.
This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey.
Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman.
The diplomats also seem to be carrying information mighty sensitive to the CIA, because Dutch and his team are going 'in country' under the authority of a guy named Dillon (Carl Weathers).
It is also during this material that we see that there may be more in store for them than just guerrillas.
The special effects are also well made.
That has already been tricked into doing a job, also in 115+ degree heat, and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces.
I want to start by saying that this is, alongside The Terminator (also staring Ah-nuld Schwazenegger) this is probably the action movie of the eighties.
It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done, especially the camouflage.
But oh no, this film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons, Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision.
Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously.
This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine.
The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien.
Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening.
This is also, incidentally, weakly rehashed in the sequel, using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.
The commandos also have a female prisoner.
Will, Asa, and Tucker also had potential in music.
The show also is unafraid to hurt or even kill off main characters if the story warrants it.
Much darker than Buffy and seemingly made for a more mature audience it also deals with the problems of teenage life.
it might also be a good show to pick up the season for because that way you can watch it at your leisure
I liked this unexpected twist and how it affected the characters, this also makes the change in series 2 more warranted, with the Antichrist born and free the story arc about Cassie and her family history is not needed anymore, a bit sad and strange at first but it keeps the show much more interesting.
When malachai appears (and he is a great Antichrist I must say) he seems less than happy about his role in the world.. he wants no part of his evil destiny, and also Ella seem to just wanna run away from her fate.. this unwillingness to abide to your destiny is a very interesting plot development I think, and is the whole Azazel-Cassie all over again but just a little different of course.
Especially Thelma, who is the best character of the show, makes a lot of bad choices for selfish reasons.. but she also makes good ones, and like when it came to Amy, who can blame her?
I also like the sexiness of the show, it fits very well together with fallen angels, witches and the generally Gothic setting.
A lot of humor, attitude, sex, and cool music that fits the mood very well is also good reasons to see the show.
We have also been trained to never believe a characters death (I'm looking at you "Alias"), and because of that this show had the ability to legitimately rattle me, in a good way.
Besides Cassie we also have Thelma, her lesbian ghost roommate.
Thelma is also not a new face, she was is in the famous five movies.
The girl who played Cassie was very good also.
This said, the adults in the show also played an important part, and without them (Jez, Azazeal etc) the show wouldn't have worked.
One of the cool people Tommy meets at the Trees is 'Mike', played by Mark Boone Junior - who gives a great performance as a guy who's wife is also threatening to leave him if he doesn't straighten up his act.
There'a also a small part with Debbie Mazar, who Tommy almost gets to take home - until she passes out and her friends tell him to leave her alone!
I should perhaps also give some praise to Buscemi for writing a screenplay with an obvious subtext of never getting what you want : Tommy want`s to snort yet more drugs but someone comes into the bathroom , Tommy wants to take a woman he`s picked up in a bar but she falls asleep while he`s in the bathroom , a young kid wants to buy an ice cream but the ice cream man suddenly has a heart attack , so the theme to this movie is very clear .
Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own.
Mark Boone's wife also as a seriously difficult woman who hasn't a clue what she really wants, stereotypically so.
But he's got more range than that, as he showed in LIVING IN OBLIVION(1995), and this movie, which he also wrote and directed.
The nice surprise is he also has the makings of a fine writer and director.
Buscemi also directs actors well; this is the film which convinced me Chloe Sevigny was for real.
ItÂ´s an annoying mess of a movie, which tries to make sense in the last scene, but by then you have been subjected to tons of extraneous footage, bad dubbing, clues and a pretentious movie-within-a-movie, also called Epidemic.
Oh and also fragments of the film-in-a-film "Epidemic" are shown in-between.
This movie also features some great aesthetic distance!
The movie also lacks any spontaneity and the genuine-feel often found with the small children on the television show.
it is also nice to see the friendships and trusts.
She was also a friendly person there.
It is so far also the best.
I also had the chance to visit the region, specifically Croatia, in 1999.
If the fire of music is in a child it will come out if handled right, if not, then thats OK also, but don't let it just die as a faint ember of creativity...fan it into a full flame of artistic expression.
I also didn't know the reason for Dennis Quaid's alienation, just that he was angry and miserable.
My initial impression was that he was the baby's savior (and had tried to be Natasa Ninkovic's savior also).
Of course it also turns out that this picture has revived (and unfortunate) significance today--since 9/11.
Are we now asked to ignore it because Serb civilians have also suffered?
First things first , I doubt very much there`s any truth in this " True story " Producer of SAVIOR Oliver Stone also wrote the screenplay of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS and unlike the account of Billy Hayes book the film version is a work of complete fiction .
It also seems strange that the Croat defence council ( HVO ) decided to drive their Serb and Muslim victims right beside Joshua`s hiding place to be massacared .
I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict .
A good mix of local and international filmaking skills also present what I would consider an accurate picture of the racial and religious groups depicted in the movie.
There is not a whole lot of dialogue which is also much appreciated.
The music also returns to a much more Persian feel, compared to Warrior Within.
The Dark Prince also brings about a new dynamic to the world, as the often humorous verbal encounters between the Prince and his corrupted self caused me to stop playing for a minute or two, just to better enjoy their bickering.
The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use, so spamming powerful attacks is still possible, however, this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat, with more strategy and tactics necessary, among other things because of those archers... arrows in general are present in this, and they are very welcome.
Making things interesting is also the fact that you no longer use a lengthy blade as usual... and I will leave it at that, lest I spoil something.
One can also tell that the good people at Ubisoft had Splinter Cell on their mind... a couple of the new moves are right out of those, and stealth is a genuine option at several places.
In this, you also get to control the Dark side of the leading man sometimes, who's stronger, but whose life gradually drains, one of the aspects of this making for serious tension.
This gets you into it the fastest, and is also the shortest of them.
This also requires patience, reflexes, fingers adept at VG's, and time.
its a wonderful continuation of the pop series and presents a befitting end to the series.The prince looks great as ever and the various new features which are present in this game add an extra spice to it.The speed kill system is wonderful and makes the job quite easy for the prince,also in this game i cant recall a single instant where the game presented bad camera angles as are present in the previous two games.The game play is although pretty much similar to the previous two games but the platforming in this one is really great.There is one more added attraction in this game that is chariot racing which is quite nail biting stuff.Also in this game there aren't any monotonous boss fights as were in the pop warrior within.All in all a wonderful gaming experience,a must play for everyone and i give it a well deserved 9.5/10.
It also happens to be HBO's first animated series since Spawn.
It has to be one of the most sombre British films of the thirties.It is also extremely interesting as as a timepiece  The truck drivers and their local pit stops are all captured well in this slice of early British cinema.
The same actors often play different characters at the different periods of time (for example, the guy playing the medieval king also plays a Stalinist henchman and a contemporary smuggler).
This guy obviously has talent in spades and manages to create something that is visually stunning and exciting but that also carefully defines real characters and emotion.
At the very last scene when it reverses you see him get shot outside of the bus and also the shake is thrown on his clothes at the bank from the girl.
The film is an antithesis to very famous movie by Tengiz Abuladze (also a Georgian as Iosseliani) Monanieba (Confession).
In fact, it is rare that they even crouch to make a smaller target (this is also somewhat true for the robbers) having absolutely no thought about surviving the fight.
In addition to that, they seem amateurish enough that they don't search a robber that has actually been shot (maybe they were so surprised they forgot), making it possible for Tanner not just to retrieve a vital clue but also a loaded gun from a corpse about to be sent to the morgue.
There is also this spinning camera effect used during the gun fight and in the bus bathroom which is nothing more than distracting.
I loved Sean Astin's speech at the beginning which reminded me of some of the best moments from Blade Runner or 2001 but I also enjoyed the sheer energy of the film.
Movies involving time travel can be tricky but if done right, can also be very thought provoking.
I like sci-fi movies and time travelling is also compelling!
Slow motion is used to signal the slowing down of time before a backwards trip, but it's also just used any old time to signify nothing other than the total running time needed to be longer to qualify as a feature-length film.
Together with her photographer Arty (Matt Mitler) she goes and sees Ruth, while there she also sees Duane and the potential for a really big story for herself.
Written and directed by Frank Henenlotter who was also responsible for the original, and like the original I really didn't think too much of it.
The film is a lot more professional looking than the original, but maybe that's the problem as it's also far less entertaining and interesting.
Oh yeah, the house is also chock full of dozens of friendly freaks, including a female version of Belial named Eve.
I also didn't like the story about a house of freaks that was going overboard with the whole freak thing It was nice but these other freaks were just ridiculous.
Soon, just a matter of few minutes, you are introduced in a new character that will also link this one to its sequel: that's Granny Ruth, one of the most entertaining in the whole series!
I really like the first Basket Case back in (1982) as it was very Gory also really funny and a lot of Fun  And now they are back again and this movie start from by showing what happened at the end of The Basket Case, Soon start from the ending of the first movie  The twins are now main headline on the news , Granny Ruth and her Grandaugter are watching the news and know who these two are, as they rush to the hospital, Duane and Belial break out of the hospital after he killed one of the doctors.
It also featured some horrible acting and directing.
The movie is more consistent this time, also in its pace.
It's professionalism also makes this an overall more effective genre movie.
Luckily the movie obviously also doesn't take itself very serious, which in the end also is this movie its strongest point.
It knows it's ridicules and it actually exploits this by putting in more ridicules new looking characters and silly moments and dialog and the actors also seem to be totally aware of this.
It's also a reason why this movie is a totally pleasant genre movie to watch.
It also lets Duane act more as a psycho this time, which also allows Van Hentenryck to do his bad overacting and make him get away with it.
The story is of course silly but it also still is a notch up when compared to the first movie.
It's at least more layered, also of course due to the fact that there are more characters in it this time.
It makes sure that you as a viewer also just can't take it serious at all and therefor lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride!
They also run across a huckster sideshow scammer who's trying to capitalize on a fake freak show (he claims to have the bones of Belial) and of course gets a visit from the freaks.
The special effects were also masterfully done, considering the modest budget for this film.
I also loved the story, and for those who think it's unoriginal, consider it's borrowed from an early Robert A. Heinlein novel!
Martin (Hache) talks about life through incredibly deep characters, specially Martin (father), whose very balanced but also extremely dark side drives spectator into a superior intellectual world, in which you are overwhelmed by messages, looks, behaviors, feelings.
Anyway, that's what this movie is about; reflection and not only for young people also for adults.
The film is also noteworthy for its portrayal of the hypocrisy of adults who impose upon their children "values" that they themselves reject in their day-to-day lives.
That one is also a lot better made (even the very lame remakes are superior to this dung).
David Niven is an isolated concert pianist who is swept into the lives of apartment house residents in "A Kiss in the Dark," also starring Jane Wyman.
One From the Heart was made following his Boy Gang trilogy, which has also confused many as to "why?"
Sometimes their egos and force of will create incredible works of art which also manage to achieve commercial success and mass appeal.
I also understand why most do not.
He's also gives a great emotional baring when he realizes that he may have lost what he had.
The film is also about colour, every set piece has been designed to show bright neon colours - again dream like, but to others it just looks fake.
It is NOT an easy movie to like... there is so much wrong with it (bland, dislikable lead characters, poor dialogue, over-stylized sets) but it means well... and there are also a lot of things that DO work (Tom Waits' music, the young and sexy Raul Julia and Nastassia Kinski, the airport scene).
Forrest and Garr are kind of hard to accept as romantic leads... they both seem a little too bland and ordinary (which was the director's intention)... but also come across as too unlikable: Garr is a whiny shrew and Forrest is a macho jerk.
Still the movie is entertaining enough to find it watchable and perhaps even also recommendable.
The story is very good and also original.
It's also about elements of personality and relationships that we don't find easy to look at or admit to.
My wife and I have worn out two video versions over the years, as well as a copy of the soundtrack LP (being big Tom Waits fans also).
There are also some harsh scene cuts now in the film that weren't there in the original (including one extra bad one where the music is abruptly cut off).
The film is also noted for it's songs and score by Tom Waits and Crystal Gail.
I'm a huge fan of Francis Ford Coppola's films, not only his "Godfather" films, but also what he has produced in the 80's and 90's.
The husband is also aroused by the boy but denies his attraction.
The author of "le Boucher" (1970) and "les Noces Rouges" (1973) excelled when it came to depict vignettes of provincial life, in the Kunstler's shop and apartment but also in the town itself.
It was also clever from the director to have chosen evocative colors for her film and she's got a sense of light.
She also has the gift to build her film on a relentless crescendo and to shroud it with an increasingly latent, ominous tension.
But also with Jean-Marie's tantrums he has to try to resist to the strange attraction he feels for LoÃ¯c.
It may also walk a fine line with works like "Harry: Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien" (2000) by Dominik Moll which could be his little brother.
I also like horror movies.
There is sadness at the end but it also accompanied by a silent studied reaffirmation of faith between man and wife.
It also has a lot of people in the movie, making it a movie that all people can relate to because there is lots of different types of people as well.
I liked it also because even though the family cast may not be the best of actors and actresses, they put together a family type of feeling that makes it seem like they are a family, even though they are not.
Teens may also enjoy it, only the teens today are mostly into PG-13 movies, not necessarily G movies.
The group discussing the effects of drugs on the people also includes Marins, which makes this rather odd.
I think, also, that this was ahead of the curve in that one might look at how the media and public at large indict horror and music, in this day and age, as channels for evil which only encourage those to commit crimes and perversion.
We get that John Wayne has really been sent by the government to work undercover and infiltrate the gang of outlaws; as also seen in 'Riders of Destiny,' and countless other early thirties westerns such as 'The Man From Hell's Edges' (1932) with Bob Steele, etc.
We get Lucille Brown as the "Prairie Flower," and Leroy Mason as the head villain, also from the better 'Texas Terror' (1935) in which Lucille gets more screen time than the villain, and when finding out that John Wayne is indeed a good guy at the end, rushes to his cabin to spend two hours alone with him!
We get the Tin Lizzie driven by George Hayes, also featured in 'Texas Terror.'
Rejected also by his father, the issue of teenage gay emergence isn't exploited, it's treated with sensitivity and compassion.
i also really loved all the music in the movie!!
Following the lives of several teens over the course of 2 months at a theater arts summer camp, the movie tracks , between very impressive musical numbers, the sex lives, personal battles, and identity crisis in a real manner without being preachy(which I hate) Watch for The Ladies Who Lunch number, also the Turkey Lurkey number, they are show stoppers.My boyfriend thought since it's a musical, it must be a kid movie, but it is quite the opposite, very entertaining.
I also enjoyed seeing that all aspects of teenage life were portrayed in the film from homosexuality and love and hate relationships to betrayal and deceit.
The novel was also fairly saucy for its time, with large chunks of the population having to peel down to their skivvies and beyond to prove that their clothing was not hiding the alien slugs.
The original songs (from the people who brought you "Fame") are also good--occasionally terrific.
1993's "Dragon Fire" (Starring Dominic Labanca, Dir: Rick Jacobson) also has the same story, but this movie is better.
Russia's War: Blood Upon the Snow is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen (see also "Stalin: Man of Steel" DVD from the History Channel).
Showing clearly Stalins ruthlessness but also giving so much well deserved credit to the ordinary Soviet peoples struggles and efforts to survive both their own and a foreign dictator.It gives a much more balanced look on how the war was fought and can give much understanding also to the development of the cold war and also understanding on what can be seen as a Russian obsession with the war.After have studied this documentary and read books in the subject one have no doubt anymore that the war affected the Russian people hardest of all nations.A brilliant historical documentary at its best!
There are also interviews with survivors of the Gulags and World War II, and with some individuals who were directly acquainted with Stalin.
While the program is very educational, I also found it to be emotionally and intellectually gripping, and artfully done throughout.
While the program covers the war on the Russian Front in-depth, it also contains significant portions that describe the years before and after the war.
Much time is also spent on the World War II years, including the experiences of all levels of the military and civilians.
Some lesser-known incidents are described also, such as the self-sacrifice of some very young Soviet soldiers in front of Moscow.
Some resistance groups fought both the Nazis and the Soviets, and many civilians were also caught in the middle.
It also presents one of the most haunting images of misery that I have seen: the face of a Soviet soldier who is wearily eating while on the march, and who looks towards the camera.
The screenplay by Neil Simon is very good, I also liked the score from Marvin Hamlisch.
This is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of the decade and I think it came out around the time of the equally hysterical and quotable Airplane, also a favorite.
I also wasn't that impressed with the scene in the guest room with Chase under the bed while Grodin was sitting on it.
Stars Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, and Charles Grodin are at their best, while the supporting cast also does an excellent job.
There are also Robert Shaw from Jaws and even President George W. Bush at a crucial moment.
He also does a character named Gammy Numnums, which is an older snobby woman and is one of the funniest characters in the movie.
in this Movie Dana Carvey hides his face behind many disguises.unfortunately someone also hid all the laughs,somewhere no one will likely find them.this is billed as a comedy,which is OK,but it's not funny.it's not even amusing.it is however,stupid in all the bad ways possible there are some talented actors in this movie,but i guess sometimes actors sign without reading the script,(or what passes for one,in this case)Dana Carvey certainly has some comedic talent,but aside from the two "Wayne's World" films,he hasn't has a chance to showcase it.i kinda felt sorry for all involved.it was truly embarrassing and painful to watch.i'd have to give "Master Of Disguise" 2/10
The direction was also poor, and the crude humor was (as is in most movies) pointless and dumb.
There is also a short scene which implies the Werewolf has raped a teenage girl.
The movie also had humour in places; as with An American Werewolf in London, not overly done and well-timed.
Thinking no one will believe them they decide to stick to a story about a wild animal killing them until the boys uncle, who was also on the hunting trip begins to come back into his life and confirm with him his worst fears...the killer was a werewolf.
Also let's also not forget the trash talking, chick raping werewolf who tries to be funny and at times may give you a slight chuckle but more than likely will give you a feeling of uhhhhhhh.
I don't want to spoil anything for newcomers so will just say that I was also greatly surprised by the actual werewolf (some decent makeup used there, shame about the few bad CGI shots that interfere with what could have been some great transformation sequences) and how he behaved, I may be mistaken but there were a few things here that felt pretty original and unique and that's no bad thing.
It's also a retelling of the classic mythological story of the son having to confront the father figure to finally become a man.
The film is also filled with homage's to great movies by Hitchcock, Spielberg and Landis.
Present day, Scott's wife (Sarah Aldrich of Port Charles) is in a new, unhappy marriage with Scott's friend Mitchell (the under-appreciated Richard Tyson of Two Moon Junction and Hardball), who was also along on the hunting trip years before.
The directing and acting are uniformly good, also unusual for a teen oriented film, and the characters are all pretty likable and behave in an intelligent manner to deal with the problem, for the most part.
It may also be the first time I've ever seen a werewolf that engages in witty banter with his victims, so props for originality.
The situation of Sam collecting DNA sample is also funny.
Notes should also go to Richard Tyson for playing the sleazy and violent.
A newer movie, Wrong Turn has done this premise again and is also well made.
Keep also an eye open for Billy Bob Thornton in a very small role as background redneck.
Yes, it's a knock-off of "Deliverance" (good movie also), but this movie is worth your while.
Mason also gets in a spot of bother when the hunters accidentally stumble upon the poachers at work, and gets in a vicious scrap with Snake, a slimy looking redneck played by Billy Drago.
The weapons are also not very great.
You also get a gun that fires what could be described as a load of snot... Well, do I need to say more?
Oh, and you also get to play with the lamest, and I mean the LAMEST main-character in a shooting-game EVER.
Prey also feels too much like Doom-3 and is almost as dark on many occasions.
There is also times when you can actually change the entire formation of the level.
It also doesn't help that the game only has a very small amount of enemies.
The game play in Prey is also something that makes this game so great.
The sounds in Prey are also pretty cool.
The voice-acting in Prey is also brilliant, which is good because bad voice-acting can spoil a game (Final Fantasy X-2 anyone?).
It is also an amazingly stable game, suffering none of the encumbrances known to occur with alarming regularity in other titles.
But here we also glimpse Prey's professionalism: jukeboxes come with a host of full rock tracks, clocks animate and change in real time, rain falls outside in rhythm, and Don't Fear the Reaper plays just at the right moment.
That's right, not only does the game allow saves anytime, players are also technically invincible courtesy of Tommy's Spritiwalk ability, an alternate game mode akin to Area 51's mutant switch.
They're nice, atmospheric corridors, though, thus rarely repetitive, and Prey also avoids Doom 3's problematic love of dark spaces, something it references in one of several humorous moments.
And i also remember different kinds of interesting side stories concerning family matters.
The scene where Boomer plays at the Orchestra and does John Ma's work is a scream, plus the fight at the car wash is also hilarious!
Nina Li Chi is beautiful, and also did fine as John Ma's love interest (well technically), I really liked her.
There's also a lot of plot going on, too, or at least it might seem that way.
So, it is sort of silly stuff, but also taken seriously enough in this thriller form to go with.
De Palma also gets some great atmospheric backup from John Williams' score, and the pleasure in the plausibility of some of the more graphic scenes.
i enjoyed this Brian De Palma paranormal thriller/horror.it.may seem tame by today's standards,but back then,i'm sure it was probably pretty terrifying to some people.i thought it was also revolutionary.there are some pretty graphic images that i found a bit disturbing,even though i've seen a lot of horror/thrillers.but this is not just some slice'n dicer.there's a story in here,and the gory parts are part of the story.John Farris wrote the screenplay adapted from his novel.and he has quite a few excellent novels that in the right hands would make good films.
(and yes,The Fury borrows form Carrie,another DePalma film.in fact some of the sequences in Scanners were nearly identical to those in the Fury,but were actually not as graphic.i think The Fury is actually a superior film.Amy Irving is terrific,and steals the show.the supporting cast is also good,with Kirk Douglas,Carrie Snodgress,John Cassavetes,Andrew Stevens,and Fiona Lewis.Charles Durning also has a small role.an unrecognizable Melody Thomas Scott(Nikki Newman from the long running soap The Young and the Restless)also has what amounts to a cameo.but it's Dennis Franz in his very brief appearance that is hysterical in a bit of comic relief performance.as for the movie itself,if you have a weak stomach or don't like horror films,i suggest you avoids this.but if you like being scared,pop this in late at night for maximum effect.my vote for The Fury is a 9/10 P.S.
John Williams also deserves special mention for his wonderfully powerful music score.
Supporting cast Snodgress, Durning, and Lewis are also good.
Learned viewers will also recognise Cassavetes as the great, independent director of caustic dramas like Shadows, Woman Under the Influence and Faces.
Meanwhile Peter is in Chicago & hot on the trail of Childress who becomes aware of Gillian & her powers which match Robins, Peter also knows about Gillian & the fact that she can help lead him to his son Robin.
It is also worth noting that David Cronenberg's above-mentioned "Scanners" seem to owe a great deal to this movie.
It also explored the subject of telekinesis (moving objects with the mind), but he stretched it over a broader, international canvas and threw a terrorism subplot, a fractured love story, an Argento-inspired school for cute, gifted girls, telekinetic rivalry, and John Cassavetes as an evil puppetmaster of troubled psychic warriors into the brew.
Mr. Farris also wrote the screen treatment.
There are also some scenes that are not recommended for the squeamish.
The music score is fairly effective in building up the tension and thrills, but also it has an impact in the quieter moments.
I also read rumours that a movie of Darkplace was getting made.
This programme not only makes me think of and laugh about shoddy horror shows, or appalling writing, it also makes me think of the times that I thought that I was a talented writer when I was younger, and wrote lines similar to the one above, feeling very proud of myself.
From Matthew Holness as the ridiculously narcissistic title character, Matt Berry (who might be a bit of a one trick pony, but really gives the performances of his life on this show) and the ever so underrated Richard Ayoade, who also directed and co-wrote the whole thing (which kind of makes him the real life Garth Marenghi, come to think of it).
The show however is also a brilliant example of cult British sitcom.
It is such a good parody, so accurate that it has the author who has "written more books than he has read" appears as the main character, writing, producing, and also having his best producer friend appear as the hard nosed hospital director (with disastrous consequences).
I also laughed from start to finish, especially when Alan Arkin discovers the basketball phenom.
It is also one of the most quotable shows ever.
the movie also has excellent soundtracks from some of the best songs of the decade like "Holding Out For A Hero" of Bonnie Tyler ,and "Let's Hear It For The Boy" of Deniece Williams .
i recently had to buy another copy of this movie as he had worn the first one out he also has a copy in his granddads van so he watch it whilst out.if there was ever a remake of this film I'm sure my son would love it just as much a the original one.
But there's also god acting from Lori Singer & others.
Kevin Bacon is "Footloose" in this 1984 film which also stars John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, Lori Singer, and Chris Penn.
Its also funny because lots of people fainted because they thought they saw Jackie Chan twice, one after another.
This movie also stars John Lithgow from 3rd Rock from the Sun!
While this film is not as inherently horrible as say, Xanadu, it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously.
Possibly slightly dramatic -Will (Christopher Penn) tells us several other towns have also banned dancing.
He also has a big dance number (to a song called "Never") which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves.
The subject matter can get a bit redundant and and also the interviews can to.
I also believe that what me enjoy this film further than I have other Edward Burns films (i.e.
The interplay between different characters in their witty ways, and also the great acting by all the actors in this movies, of course, the handsome Ed Burns, the pretty Bittany Murphy are the lead actors.
I wanted to hear lots more from "Sylvia" who I also adore and, of course, "Val" who was the epitome of "Ethel" from "I Love Lucy".
Although seven years has elapsed since "Shuang Long Hui" opened, with VHS copies of it available under a number of titles, Dimension Films not only dusted off "Twin Dragons" but also has plastered it on screens across America.
The domesticity is also played down, with Alan R.Trustman absent as co-writer and James R. Webb taking full control of the screenplay.
This production and it's second part Cold Lazarus was paid for by the UK tax payer and co-produced by the BBC and (also publicly funded) Channel 4.
Also when the gay teen tells off the guy he's in love with and the closing scene (don't want to give it away) were also extremely powerful and honest.
The film also ends realistically BUT not depressingly.
There is also a great amount of communication that isn't purely driven by dialogue and it's exceptional between the two main players.
Several times, I found myself laughing at some of the silliness of it all, but I also was impressed by how well the film all worked together pretty seamlessly.
", also written by Robert Klane, but it does have its moments, i.e.
The importance of family and friend's support in such situations is also highlighted.
He presents an image of strong, athletic and smart, but he is also filled with anxiety, confusion and doubts.
Steve in discovering himself, discovers that anguish is also a companion to love.
The dialogue is also not that great nor is it into going into things explaining things for an exception of a few secs here or there.
There is also a lot of brilliantly timed comedy.
Lau Ka Leung (director of "Drunken Master II") and Ringo Lam also appear.
I love the original Class.... and also love the original Toxic Avenger.
I mean, this movie also includes an award winning number of melon heavy breasts...although many of these chicks are bald...but hey, they got large knockers!
Sound simple enough because we also got a dolphin-sophomore who is belemic and a professor with a 9 foot hairdo.
It is dumb, tasteless, and incredibly bad, but also it is hilarious!
The first movie was made with gross out humor but also with restraint that things never got too out of control.
Not so here, as Class Of Nukem High II is so bizarre and surreal that it's a non-stop assault on not only your senses but also your common sense and your physical being in general.
We're also presented with a scene that is tiny, remote and claustrophobic, with drag queens at the bottom of a rigid internal hierarchy, everyone's on the skids, and dykes are harpies from another planet.
Financed with cash from friends, not Alliance or the CFDC, this movie has to take responsibility for its own neurosis, but it also must be credited with the brilliance of the impersonations, and nb: apparently Russell was Mae West's house boy, and the routines he does are all impersonations of MAE WEST'S impersonations!
He could also imitate the voices of the women.
All by themselves, the impersonations are worth renting/buying this film, but the rest of the story is also superbly done.
First and foremost, the film is a document of his brilliant performances; he not only got the look and mannerisms of his subjects down cold, he also spoke and sung all the voices himself!
I also thought that the technical aspects of the movie were great-- especially the sound and music.
Loving Evangeline:  I have seen this film a number of times and I think it's a good one, unlike one comment that did not like it at all and wished others not wasted their time on it, I also think that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
This project also has the ability in the wrong hands threaten the entire world.
The cast also includes: Carrie Genzel, Gardiner Millar, Camille Sullivan and William B. Davis.
it also indicates to the problem of young girls eloping from their homes, and landing in trouble eventually.
Being her last lead acting performance on the silver screen, Asha Parekh has also consummately portrayed the pensive image of a forced widow lover.
There's also a marvelous supporting cast which fill the film with color.
But, startlingly, this film is also sexually passionate and pulls no punches showing the animal attraction these two have for each other.
It's also about identity and about finding out that the person you truly are maybe quite different then who you always thought you were.
I'm amazed this pic isn't better known, I agree very much with Ebert's review particularly(SPOILER)  The last scene that kind of does take credibility away fro the rest of the pic but then again-it maybe a little to Hollywood but the movie did (somewhat) follow the book's ending which was also positive although nowhere near the film's last scene.
If you can, you shoud get the DVD because It has director commentary along with the two lead actors, Maura Tierney (who is amazing) and Adrian Brody (also amazing).
The DVD also has an interesting storyboard sequence for the car chase scene, with commentary.
There are other problems later in the story involving the buried wife that are also troubling.
It also looks very similar to the gill man in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, so there's not a whole lot of imagination here.
Not only because of the superb acting of Pamela Reed & Michael Murphy and each and every one of the ensemble (something we almost take for granted with Altman pictures, which always give sublime acting) and the great writing, but also because it gives non-Americans some insight in Political USA.
Typical of the series, Tanner is on the one hand shallow and full of empty rhetoric, while also sincere, idealistic and sometimes inspiring.
Tanner's campaign manager, a woman, is also extremely smart, more than a little cynical, but capable of being inspired by her candidate whose weaknesses she knows very well.
He must also be a personality and be able to navigate the tricky terrain of the American media, with the result that those who go farthest are those who know how to work the system, not those who are most honest.
Tanner '88 is also great entertainment as far as being able to expect "For Real" reality, to quote an episode, as Tanner encounters real politicians, for the most part not knowing that it's a fictional show (Pat Robertson, for example).
And touches of irony help along the way, like how Veronica Cartwright's reporter, who at first is not getting much of the scoop, and how she soon acquires the fired former camerman on Tanner's inner circle (let go for an uproariously stupid montage video on drug legalization, taken mostly from Tanner's notebook) who shoots like many a pretentious reality-TV cameraman- and then also reports first on the affair scandal to boot!
I also liked how Kitty Dukakis got figured into the actual storyline, as opposed to just another throwaway political figure.
So while the family represents a similar idea of continuity as the trees, of the species being reproduced, it sis also offered in stark contraast to them, as each member of the trio will eventually die, for all the nourishment and fertility, while nature lives on, indifferent.
I also loved the fact that Tyra Banks was a black doll, and the other cast members were white, you just don't see that very often, Had I not known that Tyra Banks was playing "Eve" the life-size doll, I would have figured that the person picked to play "Eve" would have been white, hey, that's just the way the world works.
Tyra Banks also did a fine job at portraying the doll named Eve.
This also reminds me of the days when Lindsay Lohan COULD act.
also it had Lindsay Lohan in, one of my top favourite actresses so i thought what the hell.
I also find most of these types of movies to be shallow, to only speak to a young audience and to patronize (all copies of Get a Clue should be destroyed.)
Eve also brings a little wisdom with her when she shows the people around her that life is about happiness and sweetness and simplicity, and that when adults get caught up in petty disagreements and entangled in their "demanding" lives, they are only doing it to themselves.
I also did not recognize Tyra Banksat at first.
I've traveled with many bands doing tour photography and also was a contributor to many Music magazines.
So, I also see no reason in bashing it completely.
Tyra Banks also stars, which is good because it's great to see an actress who had higher aspirations take roles like this to show they are humble and don't take themselves too seriously.
Loretta Devine is also one of my favorites.
It also demonstrated the negative effects of covering up the issues through lies, misplaced aggression and denial.
I was also touched by the positive and encouraging words offered by the minister which ultimately had an effect on the main character.
The music also did an amazing job of being original and matching the mood/moment.
Neel is also admirable in that he loves Pauline but doesn't make any moves on her.
This film can also be seen as a tract against capital punishment since Neel is basically a good man who made a bad mistake.
He is also repentant even to the point of believing that he must pay for his sin in accordance with the law.
I also highly recommend his Ridicule (1996) and La fille sur la pont (1999).
He is also in charge of the prison where the convicted killer, played by Emir Kusturica, awaits his death sentence.
Madame La (Juliette Binoche) is such a gentle soul living there who believes the man is good and useful to the community but also hidden under the surface is innocently sexually obsessed with the man before she even really meets him which is what much of the community thinks she is leaning toward, especially some bored debutantes which are like counterparts to Juliette's character.
It is also a fine story of personal redemption and the decency that can allow it to thrive.
The convict notices the admiration of Captain's wife and the captain also noticed it, but left the things going as they were.
The convict was also killed.
But a "veuve" is also a slang word for the sinister guillotine and it has a tongue-in-cheek connotation: Saint Pierre unlike France hasn't got a death instrument and must have one.
Emir Kusturica, a noted film director himself, is also one of the assets of the movie.
First and foremost, a big round of applause to not only Sivan for orchestrating this enjoyable historical jaunt and evocative cinematography, but also Manish Malhotra for the gorgeous costume design and John Kundan Pai for the beautiful production designs.
Moreover, the complaints that surrounded the film also intrigued me, as it really seemed that the dramatic license taken to interpret a BC-era story had met with plenty of objections for not being historically accurate.
So you have set up a Romeo & Juliet circumstance, where descendants of the royal households fall in love, and also have to deal with the rubbish politics back home which bays for their blood.
But with romance out of the way, SRK also showed off the result of his training in the numerous swordfights he gets put into.
I feel that this interpretation for the screen would also suffice, though stopping short at what Asoka is more renowned for, the propagation of Buddhist teachings across asia, and his emblem, the Chakra, emblazoned on the Indian flag of today.
Its also very interesting to note how well the fight sequences have been taken.
Even with its faults, "Asoka" is gripping through and through with spectacular battle scenes, fine acting by Khan and also, notably, Ajit Kumar, who plays Asoka's duplicitous brother Susima.
Both the latter films are not historically accurate but Asoka is as near the truth as one can get about Asoka most of whose history is also historical speculation.
Kaurwaki is also a historical figure as she is the only queen whose name appears in Asoka inscriptions.
They also gave no significance to Devi, who was much more important in Asoka's life.
Asoka also meets and falls in love with a strange women Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) also known to be Princess Kaurwaki of Kalinga.
As the story develops more, Asoka and Kaurwaki get married but on the day of their marriage, Asoka is asked to return to Magadha as news makes him aware that his mother is very ill. As the entire story from here unfolds, things take a real big turn, as Asoka does indeed become larger than just retaining the throne, he also loses his communication with Kaurwaki and her younger brother Arya (Suraj Balaji) and the story leaves you with a shocking and questionable ending.
One can also easily debate weather Santosh Sivan's cinematography alone had a message of its own inrelations to the story.
Shahrukh Khan is totally hot and perfect as Asoka, but I don't understand why so many people are saying bad things about the actress Kareena Kapoor, that in my opinion, was also nice in the role of Kaurwaki.
It is also a great epic from the Indian movies that deserves to be watched by people of all ages, and even not being 100% faithful about the real Asoka's life, it is a great adaptation of it.
The only two things I need to complain are :  + The songs, that are not a masterpiece like in ''Lagaan'' and also doesn't have anything to do with the story of the movie.
Asoka could not only be Shah Rukh's greatest screen incarnation, but also a clear message to international cinema of his screen presence, dedication and mastery of his art.
The guys in the film are fun to watch also.
Georgia Groome's Joanne is also impressive; Johnny Harris' loser pimp Derek is another super characterisation, a convincingly exponent of the emotional handbrake turn.
Though some of the scenes indicate a sense of lost hope, in the courage and loving protectiveness of Kelly and the childlike innocence of Joanne, there is also a sense of possibility.
We also suspected that he wasn't going to shoot Kelly, if only because she'd been so sympathetically portrayed throughout.
Not only does London to Brighton triumph as a great British film but also as a gripping thriller, and one of which I can safely say new comer Paul Andrew Williams should be proud.
The acting was of a high standard especially from Georgia Groome who also has a promising career ahead of her.
The fact that it was made in such a short time is also another factor to be considered.
I staggered out feeling relieved it was over, but also strangely uplifted, and greatly rewarded for my Â£6.50 investment.
I also saw London to Brighton at the Edinburgh film festival, the buzz after the film was all so positive and I think this film will do really well based on this word of mouth.
The movie also plastered with comedic slapstick-type scenes,strongly represented in the scenes where Baadshah upturns his house to convince Seema that he is blind.
I feel these are not overdone (though they had the potential) because of the clever lines also sprinkled in between scenes.
Abbas-Mustan after BAAZIGAR came back with SRK in BAAZIGAR which was planned after BAAZIGAR  The film is a remake of NICK OF TIME, RUSH HOUR  The movie does disappoint you compared to BAAZIGAR and is too cheesy and stupid in parts  The all detective agency office changing into a hospital.etc is too stupid The film has some funny moments but things are too lose at start  The twist in the tale where the confusion about BAADSHAH occurs it makes you interested The scenes in the plane and then the entire chain of events are well handled The film does have many convenient situations too But they are some funny moments too which make you laugh and also keeps you thrilled at times  Climax is too filmy and a complete copy of RUSH HOUR  Abbas-Mustan is good, but not at their best Music is good, title song rocks and also Mohabbat ho Gayi  Shahrukh Khan fits his role well though he overdoes it many times yet his comedy is well directed here and his pokerfaced comedy suits him most but he does make too childish and clownish expressions which irritate Twinkle Khanna is nothing great Amrish Puri is laughable for wrong reasons mostly especially wen he says OH BACHCHI Rakhee is okay Sachin Khedekar is alright in a small role Johny Lever makes you laugh like in most AM films and he is a laugh riot Deepak Tijori is okay Deepshika is average Sharat Saxena is funny Razzak Khan and Saurabh Shukla overact Prem Chopra is hardly there Neeraj Vohra is good
He also played a man who has to choose between money and "the" girl in Yes Boss, two OPPOSITE identical people in Duplicate, a man in love with a terrorist in Dil Se..., a man seeking revenge for his father in Baazigar, or widow whose heart yearns for an engaged girl in KKHH.
The movie is complicated, but it is also interesting and it keeps your head up.
Sharukh Khan was fantastic in the film and so was Jhonny Lever.My favourite part in the film is when Sharukh Khan lies to Twinkle Khanna about being blind and Sharukh Khan and Jhonny Lever and they partners pretend that Sharukh Khans house is the hospital.I also enjoyed the fighting parts because it was well put together.
Oh, yes; there's also the sausage-shaped dog who sniffs out the Japs from ten miles.
The movie "God is my Co-Pilot" also has a Japanese villain in the person of Japanese air ace Tokyo Joe, Richard Loo, an American educated Japanese combat pilot who, by the number of USAF kill decals under the side-window of his Zero, seemed to have accounted for all the "Flying Tiger" P-40's shot down in China.
What also puzzles me is why they did not work with the same Director of Photography as in Cloaca, as it looked fantastic.
Monic Hendrickx and Peter Blok are good as always, but also Sophie van Winden was great, it's one of her first movies, she did a great job.
The music also creates the right feeling.
What is also said a lot is the the movie is (too) complex, indeed you have to think and pay attention to get everything, but since when is that not a good point.
Of course there are also a few minuses, at the end there are too much improbabilities and clichÃ©'s to add everything together.
This film is a delicate and thoughtful celebration of life, not only because of the beautiful rendering of family-life in its highs and lows but also because of the uplifting message director Van De Sande Bakhuysen leaves with his audience.
The film itself may be masked propaganda for conformity and bourgeoisie, but delivers a satisfying and tear jerking portrait of love lost and refound but most importantly about the responsibility we all have not only to make ourselves happy but also the people around us, who rely on us for their joy in life.
It also helped that Gig Young was on hand to play Mr. Rugle--and seeming to enjoy taking advantage of the situation.
Rosalind Russell is the Judge in "Tell it to the Judge," a 1949 film also starring Bob Cummings, Marie McDonald and Gig Young.
In addition the movie also has some action scenes, a car chase and, as the culmination of the absurd general situation, the heist of a jewel depository by partisans who help the day trippers, with an ensuing fierce shootout with a detachment of Dutch troops.
He also finds that the father of Ally is more concerned about his business and sex life then he is about his daughter.
Well, he meets a coffeeshop girl (which, at some coffeeshops also suggest that they double as hostesses and prostitutes) and despite knowing her profession, is absolutely smitten.
But anyhow soon after, he meets Eun-ha (Jeon Do-yeon), a "coffee" girl who also moonlights as a karaoke hostess, and falls head over heels with her.
He also ended up underused in the parts that could've shown his strengths, and overused in parts where he was completely superfluous.
I also watched the special features beforehand.
There was something missing, though I'm not quite sure what it was, and there were also some things that didn't quite mesh.
I was also disappointed to find out the lack of other work Chidzley has been involved in, but that's not movie related... oh well.
Spoilers End -  This movie also has a "made for TV" feel to it as well.
No depth to them, feeling more like a high-school play at times which is also indicative of poor directing and a scripts with no real interest in telling a story, but rather to "produce".
The movie also suffers from some minor sub-par theatrical production values.
The heroes are also a lot more natural and likable, although still a bit two-dimensional, and the plot is still a bit weak compared to a decently written adventure for D&D, but in comparison with the first film this one is an Oscar nominee.
The first D&D movie was largely hated by D&D players, partly because it wasn't a good movie, but also because it was not very much like D&D the game.
The characters also tend to act like D&D characters, and they actually explore a dungeon.
The first movie also suffered from this problem, but in this movie, it's probably because most of the actors are new, this generally being their first film.
But I chalk that up also to the inexperience of the screen writers (though also is relatively common in D&D games, so perhaps is a feature, not a bug).
The scene that preceded this one, where a group of African Americans hold Yune and his partner at knife point and Yune speaks to them by using a HOW TO TALK JIVE dictionary, is also simply unbelievable.
does have some funny jokes in it, but also too many flat ones.
THE MAN is essentially action and fun but it also has one or two nice messages either.
Children of Glory is supposed to render not just an utterly important event in Hungarian history but also how life tasted in an era of exasperation and unrest.
It is also a shame on producer Andy Vajna to have discredited the suicidal courage of the revolutionists by applying his Âhow-to-make-a-stupid-action-packed-blockbuster" kit while putting Children of Glory together.
I love the idea of making a movie to honor 56 and i also love making the story accessible to worldwide audiences.
I think the acting was also generally good, Csanyi never disappoints, Gesztesi comes through as always, etc.
While on a macro level it introduced us to the era of Soviet occupation in most of the eastern Europe bloc, this is essentially also a love story, between a national hero of a water polo player Karcsi Szabo (Ivan Fenyo) and student activist Viki Falk (Kata Dobo).
I also seem to recall that Amundsen as portrayed by Connery came across as a rather self-righteous and arrogant person.
Nobile also made some bad choices and had some bad choices forced on him by Mussolini's fascist government.
He was also a man out of his element, he was great aviation pioneer, but not a polar explorer.
But it's the survival story that works best, with director Mickail K. Kalatozov often eschewing the spectacle (airship and plane crashes, icebreakers and vast landscapes of ice) with a preference for medium shots that keep the film surprisingly intimate (unusually for such an expensive picture, it is also shot in the more confined 1.78:1 ratio rather than Scope).
The music is also great.
He is also the one participant Nobile has most conspicuously not brought back.
She is also willing to offer herself to Lundborg if he will risk his life to fly in unsafe weather conditions.
The others also agree the General must go.
He's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work.
As night cop and detective, but supporting single father of two, Wes Block is on the case, but his weaknesses may also tie into the murder as the bodies are starting to pile up.
A new device is presenting him with a family which shows his character with a more humane side and also gives greater responsibility which makes him more vulnerable to the killer he is pursuing.
He's also into really getting into his work, i.e.
Meanwhile, Tuggle doesn't stop as a director in giving this about as dark a look as possible, and with the sexuality, while sleazy (where else will you see women wrestling all oiled up and refereed by a midget named Shorty), is also effective for the mood.
It is not a movie full of snappy one - liners,dialogue is sparse and significant.Miss Genevieve Bujold is also excellent as the Rape Crisis Centre boss,outwardly a ball - breaker,but wanting to trust this odd cop who offers so many contradictions.
Dan Hedaya also does well as Block's partner Detective Molinari.
There is also the perfect well built suspense founded and built on the shoes and the color of the shoelaces of the criminal.
But he's also indulging himself with a lot of prostitutes who can give him a bit of variety in turn-ons.
I don't know exactly how many movies did Clint Eastwood make as a director and/or actor with basically playing the same role in also almost the same story every time, detective who makes no excuses and goes in hunt for a serial killer...sounds more than familiar?
The killer is not only likely to be a former cop familiar with police procedure, but he also knows Wes Block.
Clint is also a single father of two young girls and the growing similarities between the haunts of the killer and the cop becomes a cause for concern.
There are strong support roles from the likes of Dan Hedaya, Alison Eastwood and Jenny Beck also.
For most part, it's incredibly taut and it never drifts away from being sombrely downbeat, well maybe with a couple exceptions involving family (with clichÃ©d) moments, but saying that, it also had some of those moments that made you squirm in your seat.
The twist in TIGHTROPE is that the killer is also dogging the footsteps of kinky cop Detective Wes Block (Eastwood), a lonely divorcÃ©e with two young children.
The movie also had too many shots purposely and gratuitously out of focus.
that the film also conveys the monks' commitment to Christ is a bonus.
Monks, as historians remind us, created the foundations of Europe, not just in their scholarship and their faith, but also in their industry and agriculture.
After an hour the film shows that the monks, though they lead daily lives that are silent and isolated except for chapel services, do also get together on Sundays for a communal meal followed by a walk and a chat, rain or shine.
He was also told that there be no musical score or soundtrack.
The film also follows an elderly Monk who takes care of the garden and grounds and a blind elderly Monk at the end of his life.
He structures the film in an unscathed and natural way, both accurately capturing the monks' daily routines yet also flowing by seasons.
In what follows, GrÃ¶ning takes us through more than just the random praying of the monks, but also of them playing (there's a scene of the monks going sledding), cooking, eating and sewing, all daily activities of the monks (excluding the playing aspect.)
Nevertheless, GrÃ¶ning has created a film of its kind: the type that will keep you thinking and enjoying its quiet pleasuresÂonly through simple imagesÂfor a long time, yet also one that could gratify film lovers without a limit to its quiet sense of aptness.
Remarkably, given that European filmmakers tend to be among the most secular people in the world, the movie is also surprisingly respectful of the choices made by the monks in living in this particular way.
There also one can find a 'Great Stillness'.
You can also enjoy such simple things as the sound of the snow falling or a scissors cutting a wool cloth...
Madonna's videos are no stranger to awards either, "Take A Bow" received the AMA and the MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, while "Ray Of Light" won MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, also helped usher in one of Madonna's first four Grammy's!  
Everyone in the theater was also in high school or just out.
My other friend was also a DD and even though we didn't get the same "feeling" from it as our drunken friends, we did really enjoy the music and watching some people get sick and in a few cases pee on themselves.
It is also very uneven.
The movie also gets it wrong when it represents the agents as the good guys (BATFE has a terrible reputation among other federal agencies, and a worse one with gun owners Â deserved on both counts).
It's only wishful thinking that they'd also be as inept as the movie presents...  FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Man is rated PG-13 for "language, rude dialogue and some violence."
Anyone old enough to follow the shallow plot line (say, 10 or so and up) is also plenty aware enough to resent having wasted the money on this drivel.
Is X only a flick rating or also a movie rating.
It's a movie rating also.
Now I could see how a teen might like this, but for anyone wanting porn, they could also do a lot better!
The only surviving plane, being of course a B-17, flys off after all of the others have also gone or have been destroyed.
The artwork and animation are just terrific, there's also plenty of other things that will please the adult animation fan such as animated hotties like Taarna the platinum blonde warrior babe, sex, animated nudity, gore, violence and action.
One more thing, Roger Ebert gave this movie 1 and a half stars but he also gave, "the honeymooners" 3.
I'd never seen the short 'toon PAGE MISS GLORY until this week (or if I did, it was so long ago that all I retain is a subliminal memory of the denouement), but the cartoon people reminded me of the ubiquitous long-nosed "Kilroy was here" WWII graffiti drawing and also of the cartoon work of Robert Crumb, who emerged in director Terry Zwigoff's 1994 documentary CRUMB as perhaps the most extreme American misogynist NOT behind bars.
One spoof was Tex Avery's "Page Miss Glory", which has also been known simply as "Miss Glory" to avoid confusion with a movie by the same name.
The film was stuck and also banned by political activists of Indira Gandhi's Party.
Oh, and seeing Lou in the boxing scenes took me back to when he watched Stan Laurel also fight in the ring as a spectator in The Battle of the Century.
Meanwhile a spoilt playboy and his long suffering valet also enlist.
This film also features Dean Collins and his dance team in one of the most famous Lindy scenes ever.
There's also a classic skit with Abbott commanding a hilarious army drill, and Costello becomes involved in a boxing match with a big brute.
This was made at a time where going to the theatre was a full night out; not only to experience the funny antics of Bud and Lou, but also to enjoy a set of music and dancing for your money, too.
In this case, a little too much footage is devoted to the side story of a couple of other male leads who are at odds with one another yet manage to also enlist in the army along with Bud and Lou.
But we also get an appearance by Shemp Howard (one of the Three Stooges) as a cook, and that's never a bad thing.
Having seen this movie dozens of times on TV over the years, I was also surprised to see a couple of minor scenes, for the very first time, that had always been cut by our local TV station in order to make room for the commercials.
This was also the one that made it for them in the movies and turned them into America's no.
Shemp Howard is also on hand in a comic mess scene.
Absolutely uncompromising and downbeat; it's no surprise that the director also did several OZ series episodes.
This movie also contains the Andrews Sisters, who are so great!
This movie also gives you a pretty accurate account of "going into the service" for that time era.The military point of view of "Buck Privates" shows the innocence of so many of our young men and women that enter the service of Uncle Sam.It is very interesting to see how things have changed in the last 60 years,as well,not only in T.V and movies, but in the service, too.
And through the serendipitous casting angel, Buck Privates also included the Andrews Sisters who got to sing three of their standards in this, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, You're A Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith, and the immortal Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy from Company B.
He also has the best line - "How would YOU like to be the only guy at the beach with t*ts?!"
4) Shamefully waste a stellar cast by saddling them not only with shoddy, sub-par material to fight a hopelessly uphill battle with, but also with obnoxious characters to annoyingly overplay: the gorgeous Linda Kerridge as Deezen's hot honey girlfriend, Lyle Waggoner as the blundering killjoy police chief, Ruth Buzzi and Carol Wayne as ditsy moms, Terry Kiser and Biff Manard as comparably fatuous fathers, Cleavon Little as a doltish high school principal, Eric Stoltz and Tom Villard as vapid surfers, and the luscious Corinne Bohrer and the adorable Lucinda Dooling as airhead valley chicks.
There is also a hilarious above-the-waste nude scene involving two young hotties (one played by Brinke Stevens) that are trying to gain the attention of their surf-obsessed dates who are so involved in their surf reminiscences that they don't even notice the two beautiful half-naked girls.
"Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.
She is also great in this movie.
Everything that Christie's detective Poirot knows, the viewer also knows.
Nivens plays a great role also.
It is also very gripping with a crime that is forever tricky to work out and a truly unpredictable killer gives the film a perfect ending.
"Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.
Angela Lansbury is also a scene stealer as a tipsy, uninhibited novelist who does a hilarious tango with David Niven.
He also played Poirot in three TV movies: Thirteen At Dinner, Murder in Three Acts, and Dead Man's Folly.
Lansbury captures the humorous side but also the unfortunate aspect of the character and it is this immense acting ability that should have won her an Oscar.
The 1930's setting also gives an air of genteel opulence to the surroundings.
I am also very picky about dramas.
Hehhehehee, the movie also stars, without a doubt, the most unrelentingly sweaty character in the history of film.
The funny part is that those same "principles" are exactly what links him to the Charles Grodin character, Jonathan Mardukas, also known as The Duke, who has stolen 15 million dollars from the mob, and claims to have done it out of "principles", in order to give the money away to the poor.
The only other cast member whom I recognized was Mickey Rooney, playing a trigger-happy hit-man named Trigger (although apparently, Peter Cook also starred).
It also provides Charles Grodin with one of the best roles of his career, mainly because this is not a simple-minded one-dimensional farce but an intricate mixture of gangster thriller, road movie and comedy.
Except for the fact that the man The Duke stole the money from, wants to get him, and he is also the same man who framed Jack.
And also the FBI wants to get Mardukas so that they can use him to get his boss, so they warn Walsh not to get in their way.
I haven't seen anything else by him yet than this, THE LONGEST NITE (1997), but his other works include The Odd One Dies and Expect the Unexpected, which have also been hailed by HK fanatics and specialists.
Then there is Marvin Dofler (John Ashton), another bounty hunter who wants John also, but for a smaller price.
He does his usual tough guy attitude, but he also mixes it with some humor, and emotions.
Charles Grodin is also great as the sensitive accountant who is the exact opposite of Jack's personality.
The writing by George Gallo is also excellent.
He also manages to have some very funny scenes involving Jack and John.
Brest also does a great job by making the film enjoyable for it's 125 minutes.
But take apart this film, and it's also a film that women can enjoy also.
I would also consider it a fine example for other buddy action movies to follow, even today.
The soundtrack, featuring the guitar of Ry Cooder, also is outstanding and adds to the fun of this film.
It also features a brilliant funked-up disco soundtrack, featuring long forgotten artists like Jermaine Jackson, Jermaine Stewart, and Carol Lynn Towns, and follows Travolta's charchter as he writes a piece about the health club scene, and courts one of the fitness instructors there, played by Jaimie Lee Curtis.
It has some truly funny moments also.
There is also too much running around and too much time wasted on insignificant little things.
This film is also hopelessly dated in terms of fashion.
Bridges & CO also try to recycle a gag that worked in Urban Cowboy.
Jamie Lee Curtis is also a great talent, but she is wasted as well.
While the opening scenes are fairly inconsequential, there is a single close-up of Blanche Sweet's baby Â which not only elicits an emotional response, but also helps us remember the child later on.
At the end of the film, you see a shocking scene of the bloodstained mother walking around with a human heart in a bag... the (often heart-related) sound track songs are also very suitable, and after watching this movie you will never see all those "heartache love story" cliches the same way!
However, this Dan Andersen intrigues me -- not just the great body but also the vulnerable giant quality.
The film also known in another name as Last line of defence 2 an apparant sequal to another film Gruner was in as the lead as a different character.
The series is not only a truthful rendition of mid-century Denmark from 1929 to 1947, but also a documentation of Danish self-understanding in the 1980'es - at the time of Danmarks Radios broadcasting monopoly Â and the series itself was, and still is, an integral part of the ongoing formation of the national self-understanding (of which we seem to have a LOT!
I also loved seeing Bucks County, my home town, on the big screen.
What is also interesting is Jacquot's low-keyed exploration of sexual harassment in the workplace and of how brief, chance encounters with strangers can have long-term effects on our personal attitudes and perceptions.
An utterly remarkable achievement, not only by von Manahan's budget's standards, but also by any American filmmaker's.
It's also about the guy , Rueben - played by Quaid, that takes the job to kill him.
I should also note that the movie starts out rather comedic, but the tone rapidly changes to drama.
While the film is full of razor-sharp dialogue, writer/director Cole also allows us space, as we are driven through the beautifully shot ugliness of The Hammer's streets, in which Quaid & Baruchel draw us into their messed up worlds, to this point in time.
You must also be prepared for the fact that we will have continuous war in the future to keep SUVs on the road.
This film puts into perspective and also gives me many answers for the bloodshed carried out in many of the wars of the last century, and continuing into this century.
It may not be the best film ever made, but at least it has clever gags in it and also includes a very young John Candy.
McCormack worked in corporate film-making and documentaries but also holds an Honours Degree in Environmental Policy and Management.
It has a fun typical 1930's genre story and the movie can be seen as a screwball comedy, though its not the best genre example of it, since the movie besides its screwball elements also feature many other, more subtle, comedy styles.
(I think it's much funnier than the overrated (IMHO) Bringing Up Baby (which also stars Grant).)
Even though PENNY SERENADE (also starring the pair) was pretty depressing, it was also a quality film.
It is also one of the simplest in plots and screenplays, because it does not require any attempts at conspiracy or hidden identities or mystery (say as in the comic mystery "The Thin Man", or in "His Gal Friday" - which also co-starred Cary Grant and Ralph Bellamy in somewhat similar character types).
Not only is this sequence funny but it is also touching: Don't we all, on the rebound, make choices that seem right but turn out catastrophic!
I also like "Twentieth Century" and Bringing Up Baby."
I do not like the smug "My Favorite Wife," also with Dunne and Grant" or the mean "Nothing Sacred."
Exceptional performances are also delivered by the rest of the cast (including Best Supporting Actor Oscar Nominee Ralph Bellamy), but the film's real scene stealer is the incredible canine performer Asta as Mr. Smith, which is easily the best performance by a dog ever!
The casting of Slim Pickens as Alex Flood's (Martin) top henchman also seemed to go against the grain.
Caleb grabs a trashcan and throws it at Scar, who gets pushed into a fence, his face pressed so hard, and I guess the metal also being wet and cold, cuts his face.
!Honeswtly people!This is a Swedish movie with special effects like in Matrix or in Die Hard!This is a parody on many American action movies per example:Matrix,Die Hard,Rambo,etc.There is even love in this movie between Jessica(who wants to close local Police station) and Jacob(the policeman).The humor is original,typically Swedish,but still amazing!tHE ACTORS :Torkel Petersson is one of the best Swedish young comics on this time.Josef Fares and Fares Fares are actually Libanons,who moved to Sweden.Whwn Josef was 21,he was accepted to the Swedish Film Academy in Stockholm.He also directed another box office hit,Jalla Jalla,the film I also liked it.In this movie,you can see a brother,Fares Fares and a Father Fares.So this movie is totally Fares family movie and i really recommend it!
The kids hide the puppies in the basement, but also learn they won't eat.
Alice finds out about why that is happening, and also finds out about the puppies.
But someone else was also up there.
He also asks to see the "kids", so George, Alice, and Beethoven call the enourmous puppies downstairs.
This film also has pretty good quotes.
The characters were also great, especially Debi Mazar.
In the scene where Regina parked her car, got out of it, and walked over to her ex-husband to get Missy from the park, I knew it was a woman and I also hoped that she wouldn't be as creepy as Shelley Winters was in the 1973 movie Cleopatra Jones.
A lot of people don't realize that this film was nominated not only for an Academy Award, but also a Golden Globe and Grammy Award!
I also don't understand the rating this movie got.
It was also the time before a VCR would be found in every home.
Despite this he proved he was intelligent, quick witted and he had a number of smarts to outwit his opponents, but he was also capable of looking after himself physically when the situation arose (he was an expert in karate, being overweight does not mean you can't handle the rough stuff when you need to, my judo instructor was 19st, the same weight as Cannon, but boy could he move fast when performing various judo throws and moves).
Chiara Mastroianni, looking more like her father every day is also on hand to remind us what we lost when her father died and if she bears only a passing resemblance to her mother that's not so important because mum Catherine Deneuve is still very much with us.
Wenham is also good - after appearing in various bit-parts, his major break came in THE BOYS, closely followed by A LITTLE BIT OF SOUL and MOLOKAI: now, of course, he's a household name.
This movie shows that love really conquers all in life.People may try to feel that they are only sexually attracted to one another but they later on realize that this attraction is much more emotional rather than physical.Also,it also make us realize that people may find someone not only who can make them happy in bed but also in real life.
This movie also tells us how relationships are whether they are a one-night stand or a serious one.It makes us realize the difference between the two and how two people fall for one another upon meeting each other at night.With regards to acting,Susie Porter did a very good job and so did her partner.Also,the film was very realistic in its presentation.
I think that every boys/mans and women in the world should watch this film...because it 's quite true...and you will learn a lot about the opposite sex;) it's also quite original in the way it is filmed, the interviews...you have a lot of different point of views which are quite representative ...I'm speaking about women's point of view, of course...and i wonder if it's the same for boys.
There is a touch of magic realism with a bemused cab driver, but she also could be their whimsical thoughts.
I also got confused as to what was which with an indication of "The Third Day" vs. "The Last Day."
It also illustrates luxuriously how head games, lies and bullsh*t are NOT the way to enjoy falling in love.
Sigourney Weaver is a CNN producer, who also has a point of view of the event.
Edgar Ramirez was also very admirable, as was Said Taghmaoui.
I always have liked thrilling exciting films that also were puzzling for various reasons.
also cast are Spanish,Mexican actors Eduardo Noriega & Edgar Ramirez & are as expected just first rate.
Not only in the movie itself, but also as far as the reviews/voting/ratings are concerned here on IMDb.
You can also criticize the movie for it's dialogue, the fact that it seems to go in different directions, once it starts, but then again, these things were all done on purpose.
also pretending that was the USA!
I also though the two less Hollywood actors Edgar Ramirez and Said Taghmaoui did great job in portraying their characters and were stern on screen.
This, in effect, makes film slightly repetitive, but it also gives it a more detailed thoroughness that would make the scene seem dragged out in a linear arrangement of events.
The ending is also so explosive and heart-pounding, I held my husband's hand with the "grip of death" in anticipation.
Inside Plaza Mayor in Salamanca, Spain the president (William Hurt) is preparing himself to make a speech on the anti-terrorism international summitÂ   For months, President Ashton has been working with leaders from five continents to take a stand against global terrorÂ Security services were on high alertÂ But suddenly agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) saw something like a flash of light and two shots were heardÂ The president appears to have been hitÂ It also appears there was a mysterious woman with the name of Veronica (Ayelet Zurer) throwing 'something' underneath the podiumÂ   But soon Barnes discovers that something has gone rogue and there's something else going onÂ It's like somebody has been set upÂ It's like this war will never endÂ   Viewed through different points of view and multiple perspectives, "Vantage Point" is an extremely energetic motion picture featuring the best I've seen of car chases used to maximum effect by director Pete TravisÂ
The trailer gives away one of the huge plot twists in the film (I think there was supposed to be another, but that could also be seen from a mile away.
It also has a really great car chase scene and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't "get" those.
Tavernier also pores over the problem of children adoption through the different French couples at the hotel.
The background is also essential.
"Holy Lola" is a momentous work for two reasons: Tavernier added one more worthwhile piece of work to his own Aladdin's cave and also a work destined to the mainstream to make them realize of the hard process of child adoption.
The direction and script are also excellent, especially when you consider both are first-timers in the world of feature films.
He's also in love with sweet Celia (Cindy Eibacher).
He goes to work with a scientist named Old Walker (also Marceau) who uses electricity to bring the dead back to life.
You also see the wards in the orphanages of the babies nobody wants, babies with Aids etc.
Now, Malcolm's sister and brother-in-law also bite the dust, and so Malcolm is given the opportunity to re-animate them as well, with very interesting results, and fairly humorous, too.
Castle (who even has an amusing, unbilled cameo as a storekeeper) also employed other renowned Hollywood veterans behind the camera here, namely cinematographer Joseph Biroc (their third collaboration) and production designer Boris Leven.
): it deals with a deaf-mute puppeteer (Marceau, naturally) who, abused by his harridan sister and her boozing partner, takes comfort in his friendship with a little girl he meets at the fair and an eccentric dying scientist (also Marceau, made up to look almost Caligari-like) who experiments with reanimating dead bodies (most notably a frog) via two portable electronic devices.
It's also in colour, which is another rarity from this director.
One day, an elderly professor (also played by Marceau in a dual role) sees his puppet show and offers Shanks a job - to come to his home to assist him is some experiments involving the artificial stimulation of dead animals via electricity, or something...why or how it actually works is not expanded on, but it involves small implants being attached to the muscles and these are then activated by means of a small control box.
There are other similarities to that film: the genius dies leaving the misfit to fend for himself in the outside world, the villains are in a motorcycle gang, the misfit falls for a local blond teenage girl, and he also performs his "magic" for children in a school classroom.
A shy, intense and mysterious young man who loves photography ( The actor is Hiroshi Tamaki also known as Chiaki sempai from Nodame's fame ^^) The second character is a shy, rather mysterious girl, who lacks self confidence but is cute and amazingly pure of heart.
The actress, Aoi Miyazaki also played one of the leads for Nana 1 ( They changed her for Nana 2 because she was shooting tada kimi wo at the time) The third one is the perfect girl.
She is played by Meisa Kuroki ( who also plays the 'french' girl in "Haikei, Chichiue-sama") Our two main protagonists are, a bit like in Ima, unsure of the feelings of the other one.
He always does good jokes that are not only funny, but also true to life, e.g.
This is probably one of the best shows during his great career and you should really check out the wired and wonderful tour, that was also a great laugh.
Oh my god what rubbish some people say about some crap films  The film is a remake of ANGELS WITH A DIRTY FACES and is so bad it makes you cringe  Srk plays a Bachchan type of goon role and tries hard but his weird voice and his utterances at every sentence gets to the nerves  The goons to even the cop are cartoons  The film shows RAM JAANE as a big hero praised by Bhasti Vale Like Bachchan in AGNEEPATH, SARKAR  Rajiv Verma direction is bad Music is okay  SRK as said before tries hard but his weird voice and also expressions at places are a give away Juhi is okay Vivek Mushran is okay the rest ham even the talented Pankuj Kapoor
I really liked him because I was also in the same frame of mind for may be two months.
I also used to get these exciting urges to slap a policeman but somehow I controlled.
The movie also stars the very sexy Juhi Chawla in a decent role.
The effects also dictate the laborious pace of the piece.
Well, we get to see a group of bug-eyed ghouls, a near-human baboon (which is actually a cursed prince), a bronze Minaton (also known as Minatour in mythology), a large bee, a gigantic Walrus (one of my favorite of the batch), a club-wielding Troglodyte and a saber-toothed tiger.
Sinbad, arriving in Baghdad both to sell his merchandise cargo, and also to see again his love interest, the caliph's sister played by a luscious, very young Jane Seymour.
In order to break Zenobia's spell on Kassim, Sinbad enlists an adequately wise and aged wizard, Master Malanthius and his sexy daughter, the hyper blond, hypnotized-looking Dione (Taryn Power), who also has some of the most vapid dialog in the movie.
I also find that I care about the characters in this film and what happens to them.
Jane Seymour is also very easy on the eye and is the best looking Sinbad girl of them all.
I must admit, it was also fun watching Lee, a very beautiful actress, turn herself into a clumsy mouse-of-a-girl.
Mun-he Na plays Moon-su's mother and also gives an endearing, heartfelt performance.
There is also some witty use of animation in some scenes that cleverly supports the story without threatening to overshadow it.
There's also a romantic subplot -- more of a romantic triangle -- with Candy pining after a guy named Elvis in her English class, who Elvis in turn is trying to go after his Australian English instructor Cathy.
Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...  You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.
When I saw he was also in this even-bad-for-a-Roger-Corman flick , I just had to watch, no matter how bad it was.
He also has some fun dialog like "when I gets me enough money I'm gonna git me a set a dem Roebucker-teeth [false teeth from Sears & Roebuck], and if-en I save enough maybe I'll git me a couple-a gold ones" or some banter with his nephew Skeeter that includes words like "mighten" and advice to "don't crowd God".
Skeeter, the nephew (played by Brandon De Wilde), has some great facial expressions throughout the film and also has some funny scenes with Lady (the dog).
And, sometimes, it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.
For example, not content with the star appeal of the main players, there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know.
And then we have John Cleese, reprising his role as Basil Fawlty Â but this time, as a prancing cross-dresser also Â once again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role.
He's rude, sophisticated in the outside, but he's also a transvestite who loves to dress in ladies' clothes dancing to Donna Summer's Bad Girl!
You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens).
It has its moments of family tenderness and heartbreak and is also peppered throughout with gang violence.
I'm also not sure why if they have sensors and weaponry that sophisticated they don't just use it as a security system.
As a Enterprise fan, I also have to admit that I have a soft spot for Dominic Keating.
Things get good during the second half when John Liu, a great kicker also, and Hwang Jang Lee begin to fight.
Liu also gives a solid acting performance as the "northern leg" Shao Yi-Fei, a man who is a "loner by nature."
Secret Rivals was also a breakthrough film for Hwang Jang Lee.
I am also shocked at the R-rating.
The funny CGI effects are pretty cartoon like, but there's also PLENTY of action scenes to keep you going.
In the same night I also rented "The Farewell," a German film about the last days of Bertolt Brecht.
The Butt boy, Bucktooth Jane, tailor, landlord etc showed in the end also implies that they are not legendary guys in the movie, they are just normal people like u and me.
This is a dream not only for him, it is a dream for all movie fans, and also a dream for people in normal life.
We go to theatres so we also have dreams.
Surprisingly, there was also a very well conceived scene in the middle of the film involving two professional assassins who are trying to kill the main defenders of the tenement that I found to actually be a pretty kick-ass action sequence.
it also had a touch of The Matrix, and a pinch of the romance in Braveheart, and the magical quality we saw in Crouching Tiger.
He is also stabbed by three flying daggers which were supposedly aimed at his enemy and is later bitten in the face by two poisonous snakes.
Apart from creativity, Kung Fu Hustle has also demonstrated a higher quality comedy than his early 1990s works such as Fight Back to School (1991) and King of Beggars (1992).
She is also killed off in about 10 minutes.
It could also be great if you feel like a good comedy.
This is one of the best documentaries I've seen since Farenheit 9/11, Game exposes the truth about this lousy piece of garbage name G-Unit, game delivers one of his best performances as he exposes the lies, the deceptions and the evil surrounds this horrible group and pop rap group Pistol Pete from Terror Squad also delivers here as the person who exposed tony yayo as a coward, you know people always say you should listen to music like G-Unit, because it's good for hip hop's soul, it's not good, it is hateful, disgraceful, shameful and truly unbelievably tasteless, I Bet these stupid stans don't even know what real hip hop is, all they listen to is garbage like this, it's a shame that tupac and biggie & big pun turning on their graves and probably laughing at how pathetic the mainstream hip hop has become and especially for someone like fifty cent that is ruining it.
The story plot of this film lacked and the directing and editing were also sub par.
Speaking of Directing, I've also seen improvement in Donald Farmers work as a director.
It's also quite perturbing to see Jerry O'Connell's brother in this movie as there are flashes when one thinks it's him, but then the realisation seeps in that it's just someone who looks like him!
Not only was this film remade several times but it also spawned an unrelated television series.
Naturally, Michelle wants a divorce and also every penny that Rich Stone owns.
A modern day Hatfields versus the McCoys, with a bit of a twist...they're also related to each other.
First Attempt to direct from Jeff Nichols (who also wrote the script and produced the movie) ,with beautiful cinematography, winner of New American Cinema Award in Seattle International Film Festival, this is a chilling, tragic and original story to see.
While there is a sense of dreaded inevitability throughout, there is also plenty of room for the unexpected, but not in a contrived Hollywood manner.
Remarkably, this is a directorial debut by Jeff Nichols who also wrote and produced the film.
You will also enjoy this story and its wonderful music.
Goga Kapoor, Yashpal Sharma and of course, the talented Sushant Singh also chip in powerful performances.
Controvercially its story of Dawood (Underworld don accused in 1993 Bombay blast case)and his Gang "D".Ramu also got some threatening phone calls for that.
I am also a fan of RGV and I have compared all his gangster movies with this one and felt finally that this one is a completely independent one.
We can also find this style in Ramu's Sarkar and Sawant's Risk.
No doubt Yaspal Sharma and Sushant Singh gave great performance as bad guys, but Zakir Hussain who is also as talented as them is in a small role as Babban.
May be this is also signature of Vishram Sawant as his following "Risk" also contains a same unwanted number.
He's also gifted with a strong voice.
While the story gets a promising start it bogs down a bit after the first 30 minutes, the story gets just too unfocused also the casting could have been better, Sophia Loren is far from convincing and McGoohan is certainly not at his best, if Hough would not have tried to get more audience by starring a lot of big names like Loren and Montague and just have hired other actors who could played the characters more convincingly this could have been a better film.  
The movie also lacks in tension and the main characters in the story are handled in a boring and bad way.
George Kennedy also really wasn't convincing as Gen. George S. Patton Jr. Robert Vaughn plays a villainous American colonel, who also happens to be a very active homosexual in the movie.
It was also sort of fun to see a young Bruce Davison, before he received real fame in the late '90's/00's.
The movie is also truly lacking in tension.
The characters feel really distant and the events in the movie are far from interesting or exciting and the movie also totally lacks in style and atmosphere.
It by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it also most certainly isn't the best in its genre.
For once, however, he gave almost as much as he took: Brigid not only developed an arts reputation in her own right, she also managed to remain friends with Warhol until his 1987 death--something that very few people, and particularly those of Warhol's 1960s circle, ever managed.
It is also interesting that she claims to have been filmed for three hours talking about vacuuming her George Washington apartment.
She also has a 'c**k book' that is composed of her famous friends' renderings of the male organ.
She is also renown for her 'tit paintings', which are created by smearing paint on her chest and pressing down on paper.
It's also a horse-lovers' film in a big way, from the mutually supportive working relationship between Frank and his paint horse, Hidalgo, to his use of the prize money from the race to save the Dakota mustangs from U.S. government extermination.
In a way, SOTN is also a fetichist movie.
I also found myself scratching my head at historical timings.
Viggo is a favorite.It was good to see Omar Shariff.My sister's three kids are going to love the story of this.I do recommend it to any-one who likes westerns,horse riding and just general good fun.I liked the sand dunes.The different horses,land scape veiws.It shows what I thought to be more side of the Native American Indian.Beautiful colours in the horses.I think Viggos love and admiration for the horse shows in this film.It also shows an older part of amercia.
It is, also, a wholesome story of honest and self-less love and concern for each other.
I also liked the humor here and there.
Hidalgo has also given me a love for horses more than I had before.
He also made October Sky, which I haven't seen, but has been recommended.
The film also features good performances from Zuleikha Robinson, soon to be a star, I'm sure, Louise Lombard, and Adam Alexi-Malle, one of my favorite character actors (he was the guy who wrote Chubby Rain in the movie Bowfinger).
" Still of the night " is terribly underrated thriller from very good director Robert Benton.The Ending is truly shocking and some sequences are very good ( Central park and dream-like sequences ).It Reminds me some of best Hitchcock's films as Rear Window , Vertigo , North by Northwest or Marnie.Meryl Streep and Roy Scheider are memorable performances.Nestor Almendros photography is very stylish and memorable , especially in end parts of the movie.There are also some great lighting effects and complete lack of Gore.Music of John Kander is highly suggestive and fit to the rest of the movie. "
Hidalgo, his painted mustang, plays his part well, also!
The script also gives him one or two lines suggesting he's human a little as well as feral a lot.
Not only is "Gun Battle at Monterey" unconvincing in its reversal ending, but also co-directors Sidney Franklin, Jr., and Carl K. Hittleman of the abysmal "Kentucky Rifle" leave out important scenes that would have bolstered the quality of their western.
This low-key approach also heightens the film's suspense, placing the frightening events into an everyday context that everyone in the audience can relate to.
The film opens with a shot of a manzanita pine overlooking the ocean that immediately establishes the Monterey, California setting and calls to mind the 1961 Marlon Brando film ONE-EYED JACKS, a film with a very similar storyline that was also set near Monterey.
Turner is mellowing but is also obsessed with tracking Reno down and returning him to Monterey, where he can be hanged for murder (i.e., murdering Turner).
The plot also isn't most original but manages to avoid the obvious pot holes.
The relationship between Stamos and Polo is also very good.
I also love this film because it's one of the many that carved out for Harry Andrews his reputation for playing tough-tender sergeants and sergeant majors; in 'The Red Beret' his last-words line, "Pity the man who hears the pipes and was na born in Scotland," has stuck pleasantly with me into my sixth decade; he also gives a lovely little take when the red berets are issued to him and his men and his character must part with his beloved regimental headgear.
It should also be pointed out that the " location filming " in North Africa was obviously carried out somewhere else , my guess would be the Highlands of Scotland with its peat bogs and rolling hills .
Sean Connery also does this in the Terence Young directed Bond movies .
Bimbo the clown and the birthday puppets deserve some mention here, also.
I also read Leonard Maltin's review, in which he said that it was full of holes and was a weak Hitchcock homage.
The relationships that they shared were also well portrayed.
I was also impressed by the quality of the production considering it wasn't a Hollywood studio production (although it was released by United Artists).
It may be what we now call noir, but the twinkle in Welles' eye also lingers, suggesting a gris texture.
flashed to Holly Martin in the alley scene of The Third Man (which was also made in Europe in 1949).
I still remember the dark, cobbled streets and slick rainy roof tops of eighteenth century European cities -- scenes also not unlike the ones in The Third Man.
The ending, I remember, was also bitter sweet.
Dr. Rice is also somewhat of a mama's boy with his psychiatrist mom Grace, Jessica Tandy, giving him advice on his breakup with his wife and the solving of George's murder.
Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, apparently playing themselves in the two leading roles in which for almost two hours they sit in a restaurant and engage in a completely believable conversation ranging from the surreal to the social to the metaphysical also write the film.
The introduction also perfectly sets up the situation we are going to find ourselves in for the next two hours; it shows Wallace going about his normal, mundane activities, expressing discontent with his life and how he has to see his old friend Andre for the first time in years.
Once they actually get into the dialogue it becomes apparent the script has vast layers to it, it essentially is a comment on modern existence and the conflicting views held by people, it uses the two characters in the film as symbols of society; Andre representing the new age thinking, while Wallace represents the rational scientific mind and shows the conflicting desire of wanting to retreat back to primitive living to find our humanity but also wanting to enjoy the benefits modern society grants us.
"... it also produces a disgusting hodgepodge of patchwork observations and half-rationalized principles, in which shallow pates revel because it is something useful for everyday chitchat, but the insightful, feeling confused and dissatisfied without being able to help themselves, avert their eyes ..." - Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (Cambridge edition, Gregor translation)
I also love the tension that arises between them.
Andre subtly criticizes Wally several times in the film (note what Andre says about people who stuff their face out of habit while Wallace is eating; also notice that we hardly ever see Andre himself eat).
And summarily the viewer also has a role to fill.
Jean Maxwell (Mary Beth Hughes) also stays at the boarding house.
What really turns him into a determined type is his meeting with another patient (also similarly crippled) named Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman).
Around the same time that Malcolm McDowell became famous as Alex in "A Clockwork Orange", he also starred in "The Raging Moon" (called "Long Ago Tomorrow" in the United States).
The second film is also quite good and in the third Shannon wasn't included.
And this is also a very intelligent, humane and absorbing thriller (for want of a better word, we all express ourselves by clichÃ©s, like Peter or Jan would say!)
She also was great in her scenes.
It was common in the 1940s to have two guys sleeping in the same bed in movies, especially in comedies, but also in Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.
Jule also seems to have a rather selfish approach to being an 'Edukator', as she purely wants to cancel a debt so that maybe she could start a lucrative career herself.
It shows the ideals of revolutionaries of our times in a simple manner that people who aren't interested in politics and matters of the world can understand as well, whether they agree with them or not, and it also shows ways of dealing with these problems even if you're just a "small, insignificant" individual.
I also love the way the three protagonists beat the stupid morals that almost broke them apart, and the open ending makes up for the slight unrealistic aspects that are also present at the finale.
On a side note, I hated the grainy-ness of the film...weirdly I actually watched a film print of the DV transfer, so it might look better on a Digital Projector, & I also had the experience of watching the film burn through, which rarely happens now.
Helped enormously by an appealing cast who perfectly capture the ebullience, exuberance and idealism of twentysomethings, director/co-writer Hans Weingartner brings to life an intelligent film about politics that is also very funny and wonderfully romantic.
So we can also be surprised when "Jan" admits to having gone to the same concert she did.
I presume the number of English words that have casually become part of their lexicon is also symbolic of globalization.
It also shows that life and the system eventually get us all.
Its also sad to read so many commentaries about "lefty" film... the film is so much more than just the politics in it.
They also go to demos and forcibly leaflet shoe stores with warnings about child labor, but their real thrills come in the break-ins: they're hooked on the rush.
The problem of social precariousness touches many young people today I think, though there are probably not so many around who'd also take 'revolutionary action' as the people in the film do.
The development of the Hardenberg character was also very interesting: at first, he is a very rich top manager, also a rather pathetic figure, but then, as he gets in touch with his own idealistic past, he shows much strength and wisdom.
The story of the mÃ©nage Ã  trois vs. 'free love' also shows that young people then where even more radical than they are now...
The message in the empty apartment, 'Some people never change', also pointed into this direction.
As I said, we need more movies like this one that are so well made, and also tries to open people's eyes.
PS: It is worth to watch "The Edukators" even if it's just for the last minutes of the film, with Jeff Buckley singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallellujah" (that also proves the director's exquisite taste).
Eitherway, It made me want to travel around Europe some more, learn German, and also think about my obsession with shopping and TV.
This movie has everything to be an excellent movie for young people (but also enjoyable for older people).
There's also a story within a story, where the young woman who is eventually murdered is being counseled by an old psychic man aboard the train.
She was a profession, but she was also human.
I also found Robert Englund very charismatic, and it was nice to see him out of mutated makeup for a change.
Aside from transporting itself from place to place in its entirety, once settled, it can also create portals between itself and various locations, which are traversed (often unexpectedly on the whim of the cafÃ©) by crossing the threshold of one of the cafÃ©'s many doorways.
These portals are not restricted to the Earth, the cafÃ© can also travel to outer space and, apparently, even heaven, which hints at a supernatural origin.
The cafÃ© also has the ability to make both idle and heartfelt wishes come true, which of course are not always what the recipient actually wants or needs, and the cafÃ© seems to take a perverse delight in "misinterpreting" such wishes.
Richard Schiff also appears to just do what he always does, as does Laura Dern (a fantastic actress who just will not step into the spotlight- continually taking these near-cameo small roles at the peripheral of the stories).
While it's "courtroom" scenes are fairly standard, there are also some pretty imaginative sequences in here.
I thought this movie was more powerful than Rain Man (which was also good) but I have not seek Kramer vs. Kramer so I cannot make that comparison.
Full credit also to young Dakota Fanning (Lucy) who carried off a superb portrayal of her character and simply stole the movie!
I can also assure you that in real life, the attempt to take the child out of the home by social services would have occurred long before the child ever reached her fifth birthday.
I also thought the film had some problems from a technical standpoint.
It also leaves viewers in an unusual disarray of responses.
The movie also recalls Detour in that it seems to have been cobbled into coherence from footage already shot once the meagre budget ran out.
Laura Dern (Randy, foster mother) was also fantastic.
Michelle Pfeiffer also has a great performance and is very beautiful in this movie as Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison.
I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this.
Wiest, Richard Schiff, Laura Dern and others also turn in very complex performances that convey characters with deep, multifaceted histories, despite their relatively little screen time.
Nelson also has the editing, lighting and production design match the aesthetic of the cinematography.
Of course, there are also many scenes that will require tissues for tears.
It might also be that I have heard stories about Dennis O'Rourke (good woman director) and how he is a bit of a prick.
It was also clear that he was making a habit of showing up at her work and interrogating her with questions she did not want to answer.
There are also some semi-drunk old men who provide some comic relief that seems really out of place in such a dark film.
It also shows what a great guitar player and performer the man is, so beginning artist or even advanced ones should take a look at this DVD too.
Eric Clapton also makes regular affectionate contributions throughout.
All through the film J J Cale comes across as the cool and relaxed guy one would expect from his legend, but he's also got a constant twinkle in his eye and a smile and a handshake for everyone.
It was great to watch in a lot of ways .. the music was great and, as a longtime admirer of the music, I heard a lot of songs in the film that I would like to own if I could figure out their names, the scenery was kind of cool and made me wonder if the German director (who had never met Cale before he made the film) had also never been through the American southwest.
The film also made me think about the way we age.
If you like Heroes of Might and Magic III : Restoration of Erathia, i also recommend: Heroes II; Heroes IV; Ages of Wonders ( in my opinion a Heroes of Might and Magic rip off, but still a good game)
If you purchase a spell book for your "hero", you'll also be able to curse the enemy armies with spells or increase your own soldiers' capacity with your magic in combat.
I also recommend adding the expansion packs Armageddon's Blade and The Shadow of Death, which feature additional creatures, castles and characters, as well as the option to create your very own campaign adventure.
While, yes, there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people (with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars), there's also a message about tolerance and how, despite all that's wrong with the world, there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross...
The film is tense and exciting, and it's also a good indication of how times have changed; I mean, would you let your kid sleep in a room that is currently being inhabited by a male guest that you've only just met?
But aside from that, the cast is strong and the film is well directed by Lew Landers, who also directed Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff in The Raven some years earlier.
They also both carry a message of faith told in a very entertaining manner.
Ingram also plays Adam and Hezdrel.
It was also curious to me to see how society's perception of music, race, and Sundays has changed, but how some things never change.
He gives The Almighty great weight & serenity; he also plays Adam.
For instance, society in 'The Outlaw and his Wife' is ruled by a brutal, land-grabbing Bailiff who whips servants for losing a sheep; but it is also a place rich in pageantry, costume and rite, where communities can express themselves.
Similarly, nature might be a site of freedom for social outsiders, a sustaining idyll for lovers, and an awe-inspiring backdrop, but it also overflows in the lonely vagrant who comes close to rape, or the cliff and snows that can kill.
Some comments also state that Granny should be younger when the Looney Tunes were toddlers.
It's sort of funny how all the Columbo movies with a late Columbo appearance are also among the worst of the series.
This movie also further more has some serious pacing problems.
The movie could had also used some more interaction between the Lieutenant and the two suspects.
It's a nice change that this Colubmo movie is set at a complete different place this time but you can also actually wonder if it really adds anything that this Columbo movie is set in London, instead of the US.
Of course the movie is also filled with the usual British stereotypical elements, which perhaps also makes this a sort of a tiresome and also unoriginal movie to watch.
It's also part of the reason why the comical relief in this movie feels sort of weak and simple.
I love the original Nightmare on Elm Street like everyone else does but I also liked 'Freddy's Revenge' just as much.
However, there are also some major flaws in this movie as well.
The thing with the bird was bizarre and completely off the wall and i also kinda get sick of everything bursting into flames all the time but the party scene and the ending, how we see the bus at the beginning drive off onto the desert and the ground opens up and hell swallows them was implemented well again at the end of the film (granted we just see them drive into the desert but still..) Also Lisa was hot!
In the second film they attempt to use special effects and fail, in the third film they use special effects to their fullest extent and create a very good movie also scary in some scenes.
This movie also has very little trademarks of the series in it.
Kim Myers also starred.
Kim Meyers is also very good here, she is very likable, very beautiful, and felt for her in some scenes.
But this can also be nothing but a tactic from Freddy to push Jesse into killing, to titillate him where it tickles and where Jesse does not really want to be tickled, though when Freddy forces Jesse away from his girlfriend at the very moment when he was getting excited enough to let himself slip into some sex can be seen as the revulsion of Freddy for that type of sex or as the fear of Jesse in front of that type of sex, which would lead to believing that Freddy managed to get back into existence through the homosexual desire of Jesse and at the same time his resistance to this sexual appeal.
Note finally the use of an old abandoned factory to give some density to Freddy's old personality and past, but also to open another chapter in that exploration of fear : the fear we can feel in front of and inside those old factories that seem in many ways haunted.
Then the evaluation of that reference is a question of date to know who used it first and who is a copycat or an imitator, who can anyway also be a developer.
The school bus at the start is also a classic and another that springs to mind is when Jesse awakes in his room to find it's become so hot that things around it like a vinyl record have begun to melt.
There's also some nice camera work in there to, the shot that follows Jesse as he arrives at school the morning after the murder of the coach is good.
The film also delivers in the gross out department, the scene where Freddy comes out of Jesse's chest is plain old fun times for the whole family.
Kim Meyers (Lisa) is also very good Robert Rustler (Grady) has all the best lines and he's just way kool.
The shocking revelations that follow do not complete the circle and also leave one important hole in the story for me.
A few scenes will leave u thrilled ...like the flashback scene in which Naseer noticed that Juhi was also in the court room....and the starting scenes b4 casting.
I also remember watching it in the hotel lobby when we had to move somewhere when i was nine or ten years old.
Nagesh has directed this very well.The script is also very good.This movie surpasses all Indian thrillers.Even you can say this movie is the Shawshank Redemption of Indian Cinema.
Script, music, dialogues also count a lot on the success of the movie.
His acting also matched his character.
But also has a rebellious nature which we get to see during the later half of the movie.
5) Chandrika Husband: His acting was also good.
Supporting cast in the form of prisoners and guards are also extremely well developed and integrated into the story.
Nagesh also played his character true to life.
Kirk Douglas is also worthy of recognition as Captain Matthew Yelland, the captain of the Nimitz.
Anyone who has ever heard the word "foreshadow," knows that this scene will have some effect by the film's end, that Mr. Tideman's not being shown on-screen at this point is significant, and that the fact Sheen has not ever seen his boss face-to-face also portends something significant later, and is likely essential to the development of the plot.
Another original 40's person also appears in the present at the end.
this is one of the best time travel movies i have seen.it's vaguely similar to the Philadelphia Experiment but on a much larger scale.i also think it's a much better movie.for one thing,there's way more tension and suspense and you really can sense the fear and desperation of the ship's crew.this one will have you on the edge of your seat.the acting here is very strong all around.there's no weak link in the bunch.there no slow spots either.the movie flows at a nice steady pace,and keeps you interested right to the end.i'd highly recommend it as a rental at the very least.i purchased a copy which was more than worth it.for me,The Final Countdown is an 8.7/10
Unfortunately, it's also the only thing the movie has to offer.
This movie is also notable as a likely influence on 80s rock group Europe's cheesy hit of the same title.
The other movies of Kirk Douglas are also good.
Meanwhile a U.S. senator, played by one of Hollywood's deservedly decorated war heroes, Charles Durning, is enjoying his yacht, also near Pearl, while dictating to his lovely secretary, Katharine Ross.
What to do, what to do... What happens (which isn't actually much) takes a back seat to 1) an Oscar-caliber performance by Kirk Douglas as ship captain, and also fine performances by Sheen, Durning and others; and 2) the wonder of tactical operations on a modern carrier.
I'm also surprised that it has such a low rating, I was expecting it to be rated at least a 7.
Berwell tells Animal that the term "lynching" is also attributed to the same author.
There was a movie named " Saving God One Soul At A Time " Ving Rhames stars in this movie also which I've found to have a similar message.
The title of the movie gives you the main character and you also know, from the (V) behind the movies name here at IMDb, that it is directly produced for Video/DVD use.
Ving Rhames plays the animal which is not an accurate name for his character ,since his character is no different than a mob boss or a drug cartel kingpin.... this is how you have to be to survive on the streets.. excellent acting by Jim Brown who in real life is a PEACE ACTIVIST.. Ving Rhames does an excellent performance ,, who i think is worthy of an academy award nomination....Chazz Palminteri also performed well as a supporting actor.... this is a must see movie for Kids going down the wrong path in life,, since it shows the consequences of a leading a violent lifestyle....
Richard Pryor(who also produced the movie) stars as an ex-con who is given a second chance to redeem himself.
Cicely Tyson, who portrays her character brilliantly, plays their supervisor who is also the girlfriend of Joe's parole officer.
There are also about whether the kids will be able to keep their new home, or if Joe can actually make it on the outside.
He is not just a funny comedian, he is also a good actor.
It also goes to show how hard it is to get work in Hollywood.
Angie has really matured as an actress...I also like how the "angie" character was sincere and genuine, it really made me like the personality of her and want to know more about her....overall, very entertaining..surprisingly good performances when you find out afterwards it's fake (but based on someone else's story)
The world's oldest profession was also portrayed without all the typical American barbs.
The very end of the film is also a little weak.
I really don't think that the film has been completely planned in the strict (and too rigid sense), for this would also have taken away much of the emotional power from the film, as is the case with many too commercially calculated/that is, too strictly preplanned films from the USA.
Nevertheless, the story always has to be thought out, but I really find it is an advantage of the film that many scenes are played in a very spontaneous manner (that in my opinion also is seen in the fun of the actors to play it).
Anders W. Berthelsen played Kresten well, and Emil Tarding's smaller role as Liva's young brother Bjarke was also very good.
A touching story that I particularly liked: about a carreerist who suddenly realizes that his idea of leaving his wretched family behind and starting a new life is wrong, about a hooker who is trying to escape from the harrassing phone calls by an aberrant and their brothers who are also miserable and helpless.
Of all the Dogme films I've seen, this is the least offending and also, sadly, the least affecting.
Emil Tarding was also a joy to watch as the young son, Bjarke.
I can only say that he is NOT like that in real life... because I also know him!
Jesper Asholt also gives a memorable performance as "Rud" the developmentally disabled brother.
His portrayal of mental retardation is the most convincing I've seen since Giovanni Ribisi in "The Other Sister" (which was also 1999).
The other characters (except for Kresten's wife)are also played very believable.
In the 70s there was a horror cycle of pix in Australia and two well made examples LOST THINGS subconsciously owes a lot of imagery and style to are THE LONG WEEKEND with John Hargreaves, also set on a scary beach, and SUMMERFIELD which was a sunny setting for deadly menace.
I would also pointer the truly chilling British film THE WICKER MAN to add a clear sense of what LOST THINGS has to offer.
Sherilyn Fenn was great as the imperfect Billie, Dave and Jackie were also brilliant characters, and of course Trudy who was really the second star of the show.
Hellman also made a movie with so little action (other than a few race scenes) that some people look at it and see nothing.
Wilson and his obsession with the carbeurator jets is also impressive.
We whine about extravagant cute foppishness by the brothers Coen, but bury straight sweet refreshing slaps in our supersilly faces like this $350,000 wonder, also generated in/from the northmidwest?
There is also a small performance from Harry Dean Stanton that is endearing.
Its also the greatest road movie ever made because its thematically interesting unlike many other car films.
The two young guys have also picked up a girl on their way, or more accurately, she just got in their car, no questions asked; who she is, where she's going, nada.
The first rock song about racing, Chuck Berry's "Maybelline," is also heard at one point.
First time actors Taylor and Wilson express little emotion and there is scant dialogue but they also seem right for their roles.
It may also be the definitive statement of the anguish of the materialist paradigm that has begun to crumble and fall apart.
Fun, enjoyable and a good laugh too also.
Going off the beaten track ...let me also take the forum to write about two things regarding Quick Draw McGraw: One, this cartoon did not promote violence and again, I was totally ticked off at the 80's parental group that ruined it for the next generation of children behind me to be able to see this....and two - in the 90's when the Arsenio Hall Show was on, I remember he came out and performed a monologue about "El-Kabbong".
I also think that Judge Milian has come to be a little bit too much like Judge Judy, haranguing people isn't what I want to see.
She also explains in full detail why the judgement is made and also explains what type of paperwork and actions should have taken place and accompanied them.
It is also something of a last hurrah.
Yes the leading actress is dull, yes the CGI could be better in places but it works and gets a 7-7.7 If you like this also try -Shinobi -Azumi -The Promise -Storm Riders -Zu Warriors  Overall a good watch and worth a tub or popcorn!
I also like the soundtrack of the movie called : I Belong" by Cherie.... when Gracie was outside racing with the other girls and met his black friend.
well i think there is no comment on that movie... perfect that's the only word can describe it... i should talk more so in other words... the story was unusual but can be accepted easily and you feel the interaction with characters so fast... group of young boys and girls who try to find the balance and safety life in community...also how law enforcement and judge system can be understanding for such unique case... such drama can be useful for teens kids and also adults to learn how much important kids should live in safe and peace the meaning of real family and real love connection between group of people that lead to give a good push up forward into the success in work school or any other activity in life...thanks everybody
Diane Ladd as the grand mother is also very strong but Kristin Bell who plays the lead character Gracie out shines both of these experienced actresses.
Lou the beagle has not only to help save the world from the cats- he also has to earn the love of junior, who (in an unspeakably stupid and unbelievable scene) rejects the dog initially- as if ANY little kid would reject a darling beagle puppy, but the "plot" requires this kind of stuptidity.
The two strongest Holocaust films, at least of recent vintage, are the inimitable Schindler's List, towering above all, but also "Jacob the Liar".
"Life Is Beautiful" is also poignant.
There were dogs who live in doghouses that are filled with computers and satellite hook-ups, that also provide shuttle transportation to "Control".
While dogs are made out to be the heroes who not only save the world from allergies but also rescue the humans.
Dogs also often have to actually perform, exercise, do handy things or otherwise.
The story turns around Lou and his dog spy friends,who needs to protect the formula and also save Lou's owners of the evil cats.
It also serves as a fine example of how the genre of science fiction need not rely on "futuristic" expensive locations and effects, for it is incredibly location-driven and the bleakness of the Scotland it was filmed in reflects its interior contemplations on the "progress" of humanity via technology.
I found that the storyline was great and Kristen Dunst was outstanding as she played the main role as Hannah.This movie isn't just a real life event but we also influence others on how not to treat people.
The younger brother has also grown quite a bit, and has a greater role in this movie.
I thought it was also a very good plot.
This movie is also funny and a lot more action than the first one.
Sophie was also a good actor too.
One funny thing about this film is when that girl became Dracula and said "I'm also really thirsty".
He also had to be a great politician, what with dealing with kings, courtiers and husbands.
I also must recommend the book.
I'll second all other comment-writers who point out the witty humor and Errol Flynn's still nimble swashbuckling at 38 in this very entertaining film, but I'd also like to point out another feature of Errol Flynn's performance (also applicable to many other of his films):  He is also good at delivering more serious lines in exchanges with the villains (in a very believable, underplayed manner) and, for that part, more sincere dialogue with the beautiful ladies.
Don Juan is sent back to Spain because of his numerous romantic escapades and becomes involved in training the royal army in sword fighting, while also catching the eye of Queen Margaret.
Queen Margaret upsets Don Rodrigo, by trying to maintain her power, who is also at odds with Don Juan.
Robert Douglas is no Basil Rathbone but he still makes a fine villain.The score by Max Steiner is very fast paced and exciting and the duel between Flynn and Douglas is also nicely staged.
Instead it turns out that in The Adventures of Don Juan, not only is our hero still swashbuckling up a storm and almost as handsome as ever -- let's not forget, ten years and many events have now elapsed since Robin Hood -- but he is also man enough to laugh at himself along with the audience.
The Rabbia or righteous wrath of the title is mostly also left to viewers back then or now, and maybe it didn't get rooted.
The only other movie she made after this one was called "12 + 1" in which she also had a major role.
She also came across as a very sincere actress in all of her roles, but "The Wrecking Crew" gave her the chance to be more that just a pretty face.
Like the James Bond films, the Helm series also had some nice spy gadgets.
This,the fourth and last of the Matt Helm movies has a lot to recommend it and has serious credentials to be one of the most interesting films of the 60s and that is for a variety of reasons.One of these is the appearance of the late Sharon Tate who gives a very appealing comic performance in her final movie.The attractive 60s star Dahlia Lavi makes a good villainess and is a fine foil for Nigel Greene a respected English actor (who was later to die tragically) as the evil Count Contini.He had played a similar role in the earlier British spy thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE.Nancy Kwan also appears and so does Chuck Norris in a "blink and you'll miss him"screen debut.The reason Norris was in it at all was because of the movies' fight choreographer,none other than the legendary Bruce Lee himself and he does sterling work giving the many hand to hand combat scenes in THE WRECKING CREW a zest that was rare in action movies of the period that featured martial arts.
While he conquers one woman after another, he also manages to rescue a few tons of gold from the grip of the above mentioned villain (the later is usually considered to be the main plot - what a preposterous notion).
It's a cute visual, but it also reflects the level of wit that prevails thereafter.
The film also suffers from taking place (mostly) in a visually dull environment comprised of austere corridors, all of which are lit the exact same way.
******END SPOILER*********   I also got a big laugh out of the super-sophisticated high-tech mines.
(I also want to know how a missions doctor can find time to do anything else at all when he's in the field managing a hospital.)
He also sounds different.
the Robe, Jesus of Nazareth... the Passion of the Christ, for Pete's sake, where once again, Jews are demonized and another wave of stereotypes must be knocked down; a new generation of ignorant people who also probably believe Jews have horns (we don't), killed Jesus (we didn't, check your history) or worse, are the all encompassing "stereotypical Jew" with our money, our fame, our power, our jewelery, our incredible banking/jewelery making/doctoring/lawyering skills.
What also happens is that members of his drilling team start to freak and go insane as their effected by the noxious gasses that's seeping out of the ground!
I was also open to a cast of second tier actors (James LeGros, Ron Perlman).
We know that the pursuit of it has led not only to vast environmental damage, but also numerous wars and countless deaths.
We also don't know what interesting ways mother nature may react to what we are doing...
For the first hour he also does a good job keeping the threat obscured and dealing with our fear of the unknown.
It seems that the unknown director and writer Larry Fessenden was also affected by the hallucinogen gas of the story and end the movie completely mad, showing a weak answer of the nature in spite of having a plot with great potential.
Though the central conceit about nature "taking revenge" is pretty corny, the atmosphere is also pretty compellingly bleak, and the tension mounts pretty effectively as things go from bad to worse.
Le Gros' Hoffman is also a pretty unengaging hero, a blandly heroic saint of a guy who's always right about everything.
Great photography combined with naturalistic acting from the likes of Kevin Corrigan and Zach Gilford do much to sell the vibe of the thing, and the setting and slow escalation of the action also add to the experience.
They also have great movies.
This is the must have DVD for any person who loves the Faire Life, but also the perfect DVD for the average person might play to keep the kids quiet in the house during the rain or on a long road trip.
Though there was many negatives in this movie there was also some positives.
I was also impressed to learn that she won the Cannes short-film prize, *twice*.
It was also frustrating because, when Dimple's character sang, I am almost certain that knowing the lyrics would have only added to the enjoyment of the film.
also she wanted to be with her friends the past made her realise how much she needed her family.
Not only does Rupert defy our hero and his cohorts, but he also thumbs his nose at the chief villain and his accomplices.
David Niven and Mary Astor also star and you can find out about the plot when you watch it.
David Niven is grand also.
The king is also played by Colman.
This particular film, along with my all-time favorite THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938), also inspired me to take up fencing lessons in high school.
You also don't get scripts better than this, the Granger version essentially used the same script so that as it ran I was quoting dialog and making my dad go "I thought you never saw this before".
The film also simplifies everything.
Yes, that is true, but during this war also 6 million Poles died... And what is important: half of the killed Jews were Poles (which means that half of the killed Poles were Jews).
From the opening shot of over thirty trumpeters heralding the start of major work of art producer David O. Selznick wanted to top A TALE OF TWO CITIES made just two years earlier and also starring Ronald Colman, and he does.
He also brought in another director W. S. van Dyke to beef up the fencing scenes even more.
It also features nice sets in the old Hollywood style and an appropriate score.
C. Aubrey Smith is well-cast to play the part of Colonel Zapt, the king's loyal helper, and David Niven has a small role, also on the king's support staff.
This was also my favorite novel as a child as well.
Each & ever one of them plus others were about flawless under John Cromwells fine , polished direction., The Sets were magnificent, so good in fact, they were used in the 1952 version) I will also have a review of this version.
David Selznick was the producer, this being part of his series of movies-based-on-famous-novels that included "A Tale Of Two Cities" (also with Colman), "David Copperfield" (with W.C.Fields), and finally "Gone With The Wind".
The fact that the ending left it open for them to get back together was also disturbing.
Glenda Jackson starred in a film called "Stevie" in the 1970's and she had to carry that film herself also and even though I thought she succeeded this is a task that's practically impossible even for the best actors.
Their personalities are also engaging as they make all the tasks seem easy.
I also enjoy their coffee break crafts.
But there was also the focus on seals.
This has happened in the USA, and also in the UK and Belgium.
This is a magically quiet masterpiece of storytelling by John Sayles, who also gave us, amazingly, LONE STAR.
also i must comment on the credits to this movie at the end are unusual in that each actor who had a line in the movie has their line written underneath the character's name like for prisoner#2 underneath it said i'm bad.
There were also some good performances from the other characters in the film.
The documentary is done in a very spiritual mood, but the're also a lot of humor.
There are numerous juxtapositions inside the film...Madonna is spectacular on the stage, but she is also a woman with political and ethical values.
Then the docu follows Madonna from opening night until the last show in Lissabon, and also shows some of the strongest performances she did during the tour.
I do understand that this also is an important part of Madonna's life, but some of the footage you get to see is so hard and depressing that it leaves more impact then the 100 minutes before.
Very nice work on the show and special effects, also Madonna is hard-worker and she showed her work in real kind manner, she is hard, women, mother, boss, artist, wife, dancer - it is difficult or enjoyable?!
this scene also involved drawers of a dresser opening and shutting on their own, bloody body limbs flying around the room, and a painting of a laughing cat that came to life and then starting spewing blood.
And a cat also gets in on the killing or maiming or whatever action, a lot.
Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
Nathan Lane all but steals the show, but this movie is also powered by the likes of Victor Garber and Saul Rubinek, among others, a rich and varied ensemble that aid the cause enormously.
Then you got JJ McClure and Victor who are also in this race.
But they were also told it would only take 5 minutes because with an ambulance you can go in and out of traffic with no one bothering to stop you.
Soon after, a car passes them going the opposite direction and therefore also driving in the left lane.
McClure is a has-been race car driver who now teams up with Victor Prinzim and his alter ego, Captain Chaos.They drive around The United States with an ambulance.They're also accompanied by the creepy doctor Nikolas Van Helsing and a blonde they call Beauty.There are many other wackos in that race, including two entertainers dressed as priests.Burt Reynolds is terrific as J.J.The great comedian Dom DeLuise, who passed away this year, is brilliant both as Victor and Captain Chaos.Farrah Fawcett, who sadly lost her struggle with cancer last summer, is a real angel as Pamela Glover, aka Beauty.Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. make a great team as the former race car driver Jamie Blake and the scam artist Morris Fenderbaum.You gotta like Roger Moore as Seymour Goldfarb, who thinks he is Roger Moore.The American football quarterback Terry Bradshaw plays Terry and country singer Mel Tillis is Mel.Bert Convy is the welthy executive who drives on a motorcycle as the other half of the newlyweds.Milton Berle's nephew Warren Berlinger sits in the back wearing a wig.There's a lot of fun stuff in this movie.You laugh every time when you see the appearance of Jack Elam.Roger Moore's James Bond routine is hilarious.You know, the guy from "The Fly Who Bugged Me".The fighting scene is a riot.It's always hilarious when Captain Chaos appears, and this time he shows them hooligans.In the end we see some bloopers.We see Dom DeLuise laughing hysterically.They sure had fun making this movie.
Roger Moore's parody of his James Bond persona is also amusing and it's great seeing 2 of the 3 Rat Pack members(Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.) share so many scenes.
Unfortunately, I also recommend Peter Jackson's King Kong for the same reasons.
In addition to Burt Reynolds, the movie also stars Dom DeLuise as Reynolds partner, Roger Moore pretending to be himself, Farrah Fawcett as the woman Reynolds and DeLuise pick up at the beginning of the race, and two late great entertainers: Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. as two phony priests driving a red Ferrari.
Adrienne Barbeau, Jackie Chan, Jamie Farr, Mel Tillis, and former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw also star.
Besides a recent novelization that bridges the gap between the two predecessor movies and a sequel movie soon to arrive Stateside, two manga ("graphic novels," Stateside) are also available, but you might as well stick to GITS:SAC on the 'tube or DVD, for if the prospect of viewing anime gives you pause you'll probably also refrain from holding a fancy comic book.
I would certainly recommend this, not just to people who enjoyed the films but also to any fan of exciting science fiction.
Those flaws have been fixed to certain extents in the 2nd Gig which also pays homage to the original movie through certain scenes which should look familiar.
Next to the philosophical underpinnings of the plot, there's also the technicological future the makers foresee.
Here also the production team show their intellectual savvy.
She also takes getting shot up rather lightly.
His Max Prince is as over-the-top as Lane often is, but he also invests the character with a strong serious side (like most great comics, Prince takes himself with an almost desperate seriousness) that gives the role heart.
Motoko Kusanagi), and also how Public Security Section 9 was formed.
But it is also about life... this series goes much further than the movie in all aspects.
It also conveyed a feeling of raw realism that was particularly well conveyed by Margeurite Moreau and Brian F. O'Byrne.
It's also better acted.
I enjoyed the slow build up to the climax of the film; Puri in one of his best "bad guy" roles was also great.
However, crucially it is also one of the best, standing the test of time better than say the excruciatingly cheap but entertaining romp that was the Tomorrow People or the imaginative fantasy series The Ace of Wands.
The images and the playing show a lot but also leave a lot to be guessed by the watcher.
Mrs. Hall is also very adequate and sexy in her role.
I was also young when it aired.
Oh, yeah, Ivan also had a dog that lived in the closet, and he kept kicking the closet door every now and then to shut the beast up.
The Swinglettes as a take off of the Andrews Sisters was superb but unfortunately it also meant that Edith was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the daughters when she has a decent part in the original score.
I also loved the Police Sergeant, that man is made of rubber - is there anything he can't do!?
My classical musician husband also watched and thoroughly enjoyed the humour and theatricals.
Back in the 70s i had to have seen all those party movies , for example, The Van and The Gas Pump Girls, and lifeguard was so much of a breath of fresh air along side of those others, i grew up hanging out at redondo beach and Hermosa beach California which is where this movie was filmed, in fact on ricks tower u see the letters HR i believe that stands for Hermosa/redondo and this is also 1 of the beaches that mike love and Dennis Wilson of the beach boys used to hang out at as they lived in near by Hawthorne, I have this movie on VHS not available on DVD yet, and I watch it at least once a month, as i live in new york now and this movie brings back some special memories of my fun days, i even love that song time and tide in this movie, and watching him drive to the beach in his stingray passing all those very familiar businesses, wow, well if your nostalgic then i don't have to explain the feeling.
Well this movie has adrenaline but also has a interesting imagery to it.
there is also a mixture of cultures which i find refreshing.
All in all, so many others also bring this ensemble work to work...notably the always underused Patsy Kelley, whose frumpish comedic gifts rounded out this wonderfully funny movie.
But the cast also has the eerie likes of George Zucco, H. B. Warner, Donald MacBryde, and Rafaela Ottiano playing one creepy housekeeper.
Praise must be lavished on the script, co-written by murder-mystery novelist Jonathan Latimer (who also wrote some of the better Peter Falk Columbo episodes in the 1970s) and on the playing of Young, Burke and Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, who steal the film from headliners Carole Landis and Joan Blondell -- it is Topper's film after all.
She was also a topnotch comedienne as she shows in this outing when she somewhat assumes the role played by Constance Bennett in the first two outings.
The man behind them, Roy Seawright, had also been in charge of the special effects for the first two Topper's.
"Uncle Silas" is a Gothic thriller, based on a novel by Sheridan Le Fanu, and directed by Charles Frank, who also directed "So Long at the Fair," another wonderful film.
It's also a great book ("Uncle Silas" by J.S.LeFanu) and it's back in print!
They also have all the information about characters upon whom the book is based, and Harold Bell Wright, that one could possibly want to know (and then some!).
The "Shepherd" was also a model citizen-type, no gunfighter or ex-con, and was no relation to Young Matt whatever.
The Shepherd also achieves rapprochement with Old Matt, who had threatened mayhem should he ever encounter the man he blamed for his daughter's broken heart and death.
The story revolves around a family,that is hiding secrets that once revealed,might have deadly consequences upon them.It is inspired by some of Shakespeare's works and it echoes throughout the film.It's about one aging guard(Bachchan),named Eklavya; who has served for the family all his life.Many generations of his family has served before him and he must continue to do so,carry on their legacy.The family of the Kindom of Devigarh itself has mysteries that keeps echoing throughout the film.Eklavya has sworn to protect the family no matter what.He also protects some of the secrets that can never be spread throughout the Kindom.Until,one night,the Queen of the Kindom dies,besides her is her mourning husband.This starts the doubts and accusations within the family.The Queen's Son,Prince Harshwardhan(Khan) arrives to take responsibility of the family.But there are other things going on in the palace.Slowly,one mystery after another pops up and secrets are revealed,and as the story progresses we see more and more people dying because of the secrets.Putting Eklavya into a painful position and come to terms with the happenings and the truths about this family's dark history.
EKLAVYA is an intriguing period piece.It blends ancient settings with modern lifestyle.Giving the film a unique look.The film functions like a thriller,but focusing more on melodrama and characters,that aren't well written.And it's a well made drama that borderlines on melodrama.But the film has flaws,especially in the second half and by the time it ends,it feels incomplete.It's a relatively short film by Bollywood standards and I was more than surprised.Not only did it manage to tell an engrossing story but also wrapped it up with style with its short length.And the best thing is that it's devoid of songs,only one song throughout the film.But,I guess,because the story is wrapped around an epic setting,it needed a longer running time to develop the plot and characters more.Some of the characters were weak and not well written,some of their back stories are never told and leaves a lot to be desired.
The same rapport between them is also carried over to The Angel and the Badman which Wayne produced himself.
Now this film promos shouted classic from the top of the roof but sadly the film comes only half   The film starts off well, Sharmila's death scene is well handled and the drama thickens The film keeps you involved but sadly we expected much more The pigeons part was not well integrated in the plot and also the second half gets predictable and we know the actual killer  Even the Saif-Vidya romance track and the climax is half baked  Direction by VVC is excellent in parts only Camera-work deserves 5/5  Amongst actors Bachchan proves yet again he is an institution His body lang, dialogue delivery, expressions all are flawless even if he is just standing behind some lead actors he makes a maximum impact One of his best works Saif too does a great job,showing his growth as an actor Sanju is full of fun in his role and is brilliant in serious scenes His look and role is similar to THANEDAAR but he does a great job Vidya is mechanical Boman Irani excels in his part, Jimmy too excels in a negative role while Jackie is perfect
The critics have also been unanimous in their praise:  "Vidhu Vinod Chopra's propulsive 'Eklavya: The Royal Guard' has epic sweep."
We also meet his childhood sweetheart Rajeshwari (Vidya Balan) whose soul aches for the prince's attention.
We also get a glimpse of scheming royal cousin Udaywardhan (Jimmy Shergill) and his equally sadistic father and the king's brother Jyotiwardhan (Jackie Shroff).
I will also save you the trouble to read through my rendition of the cinematography and lens work as it is to be experienced.
There are also some boring scenes and some parts become annoyingly repetitive.
The cinematography is also fantastic.
As was mentioned in another of the comments here, Wright also wrote the story that was the basis for the Henry Fonda / Fred MacMurray film THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE.
Like one of the characters Eklavya from the epic Mahabharata, who cut his thumb off as a gesture of respect when his Archery teacher asks him to as fees for the teaching, this royal guard is also determined to protect his king so as to consider this job as his only Religion.
But be sure to also have an eye for Shroff, Irani, Sanjay Dutt and Saif Ali Khan: they also give an impresssive performance.
The film had an amazing story told in a very neat way about a royal guard of a rich family who is also like a family member and is going to avenge the murder of his master.
I couldn't see a single mistake in the film also it doesn't have a single useless scene and the ending was perfect.
She is also quite sexy in her tight jeans and short tops.
and also don't forget to thank to God who give people courage and faith to shoot this movie.
The only thing that let it down was the script, (which luckily enough was pepped up by the actors) and the other thing that let it down also was the over use of half naked women.
The ending was also well explained, rather than it being a simple, unexplained twist, it actually had a nice story behind it and it made you smile.
I can't remember it from the book, but the literary device they used to show us what happened in the past was effective as a literary device, but it also created a situation that was more than just trauma, it was full-blown PTSD and I don't think that she should have be allowed to go into fires after her performance on the test.
The strong sense of family, and how their love and respect for each other also helped form Reena into such a determined, focused woman was carried through in both versions.
Not the greatest film I've ever seen, but the score by Philip Glass is wonderful & the cinematography of Chicago is also terrific!
The soundtrack also adds immensely to the suspense.
This is definitely one of the scariest movies ever and also belongs to my top ten horror films!
The soundtrack which is one of the best in horror films also helps to create the atmosphere mentioned above.
Not just because it's genuinely scary, it's also intelligent (unlike 80% of all the slasher movies), it's extremely well acted, and it's serious which is always a plus in my book.
The fact that the main character is framed by the killer is also pretty original for this type of movie.
).The ending is a little bit anti-climatic,but who cares?Personally I love bad endings.Kudos also for Clive Barker.This guy can make a good,creepy horror movie("Hellraiser" and "Master of Illusion" are great as well).Highly recommended.The sequel is also worth checking out.
Virginia Madsen as Helen is beautiful and tragic and also damn scary when she wants to be.
It is also quite good although not as scary.
What is also interesting is that sadism and masochism are major features in Clive Barker's work.
The acting is also really good from both actors.
This film also has a great soundtrack, a very haunting score.
It's not only a incredibly brood horror film that manages to create an creeping/ingenious plot with such an unsettling physiological tone, but also providing some generally horrific shocks that creep up on you and aren't for the squeamish.
Not only does the plot build on this mystical legend constructively, but also there's also some solid social commentary on the mindset towards race and sex, which added more to this cleverly layered plot (or should I say tragic love story).
Not only does the film have substance, but also style to boot.
Soothing, but also haunting and was incredibly effective towards building towards such an almighty blow.
Good supporting roles from Xander Berkley as Helen's Husband, Kasi Lemmons as her friend/student who's also working with her their thesis and Vanessa Williams as Anne-Marie McCoy who lives in the rundown estate.
The dialogue was packed with depth, but also laced with interesting topics and Todd's lines were pretty much poetic and smooth.
They also are trying to destroyed every technology or human, they could find.
Segal's film is also visually striking, especially the wide empty streets of L.A. but unfortunately the feature has some incredibly campy moments at rather tense sequences.
The book also inspired filmmaker George A. Romero to created flesh eating zombies in the classic "Night of the Living Dead".
this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel,I am Legend,the first being The Last Man on Earth,starring Vincent price,and the third bearing the same title as the novel and,starring Will Smith.i really enjoyed the first version,and pretty much hated the third version.this version is,much closer to the third version,in terms of my opinion of it.i found a lot of this movie lame,lacking in any real excitement.the acting was pretty poor(though Heston wasn't too bad).i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times,and there is no real air of mystery to the story.having said that,there was one good thing about it.this one had a plot,(as slow as it was)which i felt the third one didn't.it was just this side of boring,for the most part,occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom.i was able to get through it.but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again.it just really didn't anything for me.my vote for The Omega Man is a 3/10
The violence is also very graphic for the time.
Heatseeker also ranks as one of the dullest features from Albert Pyun.
It also sports an albino zombie gang clad in cowls and sunglasses called the family (something of a nod to Charles Manson's gang of the time).
The finale is also anti-climatically shot and whatever effect the director was trying to achieve is undercut by the odd and inappropriate music.
Vastly inferior to the novel upon which it is loosely based (Richard Matheson's brilliant I AM LEGEND, adapted by the Corringtons, the husband and wife team who also gave us the abyssmal BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES), it nonetheless holds up as a good SF shocker STILL notable for Heston's performance.
I'm talking Charleton Heston and Anthony Zerbe.Neville and Matthias duking it out;and L.A.is the prize!Anthony Zerbe ALWAYS does the best villains!Ironic, that a former t.v.newscaster becomes such a technophobe.It's also weird that both hero and antagonist both have a connection with the same woman.
We were also fanatical Charlton Heston fans.
Mention must also be made of Anthony Zerbe as the megalomaniac leader of the family Mathias, he delivers great fanatical lines, a totally believable cult leader.
He falls for an Afro-American woman (the late Rosalind Cash) and tries to help her (Heston also marched for civil rights in the early '60s with Rev.
He is, of course, also a soldier, one who is willing to lay down his life so that others might live.
He is also a man of science and the only(?)
In accordance with 'The Heritage Illustrated Dictionary', omega is not only the 24th and final letter in the Greek alphabet, but also means the ending, the last of anything.
The movie did not disappoint me at all, but that might be because I saw so many familiar faces in it, being an avid Albert Pyun-fan, he used the same set of actors he always does: Jahi J. J. Zuri is making his film-debut as one of the fighters, and Thom Mathews is also playing a sympathetic fighter in the tournament, being forced to fight in the competition by the evil mastermind Tung.
Earl White and Chad Stahelski are also two guys Pyun uses often, and they're in the movie as Budokam fighters, of which there are plenty.
The martial arts-superstar Gary Daniels (from "Fist of the North Star") is a great bad guy, with his icy-blue eyes and nonchalant attitude, and the woman both men love is also a Pyun-regular, Tina CotÃ©, who hasn't done many movies yet, but always gives her best performances in Pyun's movies (like "Nemesis 2", "Mean Guns", and "Omega Doom").
On the other hand, this is also Chuck's best performance as an actor.
It also gives Heston a chance to play his quintessential role of a man at the end of civilization.
Related note: I Am Legend was also made into the film "The Last Man on Earth" starring Vincent Price.
There's also a somewhat interesting story that develops about what the monster's motives are.
The same scene is also used multiple times for different situations.
The movie also jumped back and forth between current time and 1988.
They had also just raved about "Wit", and we loved it.
Beth also goes on to find a new lover but also faces similar disapproval for moving on too fast.
Tom and Beth are also semi-normal because she cheated on him early in the marriage and he found out, but they stayed together for the kids, like most parents do.
This film is also turned out to be ones including philosophy and psychological world which adults can enjoy.
He lives his life with Shiro(White) who is also orphan and they live in a broken car.
I also liked the two guys.
I also liked the way they cast soap star J. Eddie Peck as a villain.
The sun setting on the car just at noon, the props strewn all around just speaking: "I'm a messed up boys tree-house, but a car, under a bridge and also beautiful."
3D elements are also nice to behold.
The whole Yakuza plot, linking all of the fragments also doesn't lead anywhere really.
More like two and a half separate main story lines (there are also a lot of sub-plots) that just happen to overlap a few times and end on their own.
I also notice he is either the producer or director on all of those films.
It was also just as absorbing as it had been at the age of 10.
predates most of our great spectacular films of the 1950s by many yrs (Ok, we had silent films King of Kings & 10 Commandments & some other De Mille Films, Sign of the Cross etc) but this mythological setting was unusual for the times... Cant wait to see again.. Massimo Girotti whose work I know from Senso & later Medea is excellent... rest of cast were not known to me & also not aware of director, Blassetti.... now I am !Will look forward to viewing The Iron Crown again,.and other films by Blassetti..Thanks again TCM !
There are hints that the filmmakers had seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but The Iron Crown also anticipates---and establishes the blueprint for---films as disparate as Shrek, The Princess Bride, and many of the renewed pepla cycle of the 60s.
The film is also echoed by Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, though it is certainly a lighter hearted affair.
The performers are also notable: Massimo Girotti as the afore-mentioned "Tarzan" figure (who is also prone to giant leaps a' la The Incredible Hulk!
I would also like to find the 3 volumes on DVD also.
As the videos are for my mum who also loved the mini series.
Of course, Garson is also loved by the prospective husband, Robert Young, of Flynn's daughter, the young Janet Leigh.
Greer Garson is "That Forsyte Woman" in a 1949 film that also stars Errol Flynn, Walter Pidgeon, Robert Young and Janet Leigh.
However, the third person in the Wolfe household--Fritz--is also not quite right in his role.
The film also has some dark undertones as some of the characters slip into the darkness of their souls.
Tekkonkinkreet also utilises a much more avant-garde style of animation which we are currently beginning to see more of in the western world as an increasing acceptance of things which are outside of the "norm" are filtering through, and it is certainly befitting of the style.
Tekkonkinkreet successfully delivers on appeasing any and all who are looking for high quality hand drawn animation which surpasses the eternally vapid conveyor belt of repetitiveness that is Pixar, but it also delivers on being more than just a "fighting" film.
However, it is not merely how much White relies on Black for survival with the treacherous confines, but it is also how much Black relies on White, as the director twists the uses of Black and White and indeed Good and Evil as roles interchange in all quarters.
It is also good to see Daragh O'Malley again as Harper.
When Sharpe and Harper pretend to be deserters themselves in order to join the Rajah's army, Sharpe will also encounter the beautiful and deadly Madhuvanthi (Padma Lakshmi), regent and elder sister of the Rajah.
This also may be Sharpe's most challenging assignment, with the fate of the Empire, as well as the honor and life of a general's daughter, hanging in the balance.
Sharpe also encounters again that pompous, cowardly aristocrat, General Sir Henry Simmerson, still played with lip- smacking relish by Michael Cochrane.
She is also spirited and conveys her feelings in that subtle manner we admire in British performers.
Toby Stephens as General Dodd also puts in an admirable and believable performance, and to his credit he had me disliking his character also immediately.
I think some credit should also go to the stunt performers and extras as the effort with which they throw themselves around the set adds to the action segments and makes them much more enjoyable.
This is of course unavoidable, partly because the cast are all ten years older but also because the first Sharpe film skipped over the Indian books and had Sharpe obtaining his field commission in Spain rather than in India.
The special effects are also very good, especially for a TV series.
Ironic too that Peter Krause should be a part of it, given that he was the featured character in what is also widely considered to be the greatest drama to ever air (Six Feet Under on HBO).
The best 6hrs of television you can spend, short of those amazing new fetal camera shows from National Geographic (the dog, the dolphin and the elephant, also great shows that aired last week alongside The Lost Room from Sci-Fi).
It also, like a movie based on a book, feels like you can only get the full story by reading the book.
So far, there is also the absence of the droll, overused idea that aliens planted things and are now watching us like some sort of big lab experiment.
There is also an element of familiarity between the little girl and Dakota Fanning, who has been very successful in pulling off the big-eyed, innocent parts.
Some of you may think you cant give a 10 but you some people also gave a Oscar to Cher because for a short moment she was a good actress.
Julianna Margulies is also excellent.
I also liked the fact that ordinary items, or 'objects' are used as props to advance the story in a very cheap yet efficient way.
You might also look at her work in "Rogue Cop", where she plays a singer, and "Walking my Baby Back Home", a musical she made with Donald O'Connor, as well as "Fearless Fagan" where again, she is a singer/entertainer.
It has humour and also has the amazing ability to make you cry - you can really feel yourself becoming one with the film.
Based on the comic by Matsumoto Taiyo (also Ping Pong), Michael Arius, who joined Animatrix production, directed the film.
I also impressed how this Anime can express things which I have not felt in the other Anime films.
It's also great seeing Kurt Russell & Kris Kristofferson back in the movies.
I fell in-love with this movie from beginning to end,the first time i watched it i closed my eyes in the beginning when i saw the horse "Sonador" fall,i cried through this whole movie and at the same time,had a wonderful smile on my face..Dakota fanning is just wonderful, all of my favorite actors in this movie, i wish it could have been longer and shown more of "Sonador's" recovery etc,,but the last 10minutes,the last part of the race i could feel the uplifting experience of "Sonador"across the finishing line,a baby could watch this it is just that compatible for families.this movie deserves an academy..so needless to say whenever it comes on,and i have also taped it, i have to watch it again and again.just to see the bad guys in it,if there are such things in this,loose...I fell in-love with the sheik when he spoke to Dakota about her horse winning,i would have loved to have seen them all sitting together tho at the races.the sheik the cranes and the wonderful Spanish horsey handler..it did my heart so good to see the Prince,stand up and acknowledge "Cale" and "sonador" in the winners circle...thanks for letting me express these feelings..god bless to all.
Kurt Russell is also good as Cale's father.
His daughter Cale (Dakota Fanning) becomes very connected with Sonya, and while the horse is rehabilitated, the wounds in the ties of the Crane family are also healed.
It also asks us to believe a car can crash through a solid brick wall and keep on going.
Kurt Russel also did an amazing job in this movie.
Dakota Fanning was also in "Hide and Seek," and did a great job too, as usual.
We also have a superb trainer, Ben Crane, played by Kurt Russell, and the doctor (Holmes Osborne), the written-off jockey (Freddy Rodriguez), the stable-hand (Luis Guzman), etc.
In addition to providing an inspirational message, this film also succeeds in vividly depicting a rural lifestyle in which horses and people are closely connected.
Just as the horse, Sonador, which is Spanish for Dreamer, struggles to become healthy, the family also struggles to become a caring, loving unit again.
Like Seabiscuit, this also is beautifully filmed.
The main storyline as described here is obviously very simplistic, but one could also claim there are numerous little sub plot story lines that are all terrific and imaginative.
This short features a lot more violence than usual, and it also uses a lot of stock footage spliced into the movie to add realism and special effects.
The finale where the Stooges are executed also seemed like this short was dark comedy.
Just a trivia ÂThere were 9 Turkish ladies who had come to see this movie and I think this was also the first movie of my life when I was the only male in the audience.
The four international leads Â Charles Bronson, Toshiro Mifune, Alain Delon, Ursula Andress Â are top-notch and the supporting cast also includes Capucine, Anthony Dawson and Luc (here billed as Luke) Merenda.
Two desperadoes Link and Gauche with the help of some professional bandits and Mexican outlaws, rob a train which was carrying gold guarded by union soldiers, but also on board is the Japanese ambassador who is heading to Washington D.C.
Anthnoy Dawson and the wonderful Capucine also show up in minor parts.
If that is not enough, it also starred Golden Globe winner Ursula Andress (Dr. No) and Alain Delon (Le SamouraÃ¯, The Leopard).
Spanish actress MÃ³nica Randall also gave us a skintastic display when in bed with Mifune.
What you get is a very bad movie that isn't funny or scary which is exactly what one would expect when combining characters from other movies that are also not funny or scary.
Brick Bardo (Tim Thomerson)teams up with Judith Grey (Tracy Scoggins, from Demonic Toys) to destroy the demonic toys who are trying to bring Satan back to life (Or such nonsense) also on-board is Ginger (Refered to as Dollchick played by Melissa Behr reprising her role from Bad Channels) now Brick Bardo must save his girl and destroy the toys and must not fail.
The build-up and execution of the dance scene is also about as romantic as I have seen.
The diversity of the three sequences are also extraordinary.
By the third segment things have gone downhill considerably, as Harry is a drunk who has a reunion with an old friend (who has also fallen on hard times) and for "old time-sake" they steal a body from an ambulance and find that it's a beautiful young woman, and things degenerate from there.
It also has to be said that the director has managed to convey a real sense of Bukowski's writings/life and that is no small feat in itself.
That's also the reason why he still hasn't experienced physical love.
Cars also feature prominently in all three segments.
As one of the songs of the movie puts it, love hurts but it can also kill.
If you willingly watch one, and don't get it, before firing up low votes and negative comments, please consider the possibility that, well, yes, maybe something was "lost in translation".. and it might not just be the lines, but also the tone, accents, gestures, dressing codes, cultural, social and historical background... For example, the attitude of the two girls, hanging around with two guys and hoping they will get food for free, might sound unlikely in a "Sex and the city" episode, but looks perfectly natural in the Rome of the seventies.
I've also seen movies featuring another of the 10 Tigers, Beggar Su, as a minor character.
there is a sub plot also, that which is of revenge, a nice new thing for kung fu films!
Killing of the "innocent" also clearly demonstrate that somewhere on the Path we have to stop using outside criteria for "good" and "bad" and use only our own, hopefully already developed at that point.
The final point is also a first point of new cycle.
This can result in junky, rough work, as Izo is at times, and also touch a pure cinematic form of pure feeling, that what was shown could not be done any other way.
Izo is this also.
I'll just say this felt like the truest movie I've seen of Miike's, the purest in feeling and heart, and also, by far, the most relevant and poignant.
Chronologicly, the movie is also hard to get at first.
), Izo also contains the key to Miike's personal creative philosophy.
I would suggest that the fate of the protagonist of Audition is also a form of rebirth.
He shows also how religion can be misused, in personal interest and how hypocritical it can be.
In the scene where he kills his own mother is also an symbolic example, his mother says "killing me is like killing yourself Izo", when a population corrupts and destroy there country they destroy there own system...they destroy themselves.
Not to mention the great songs by Japanese folk singer Kazuki Tomokawa also known as "The Screaming Philosopher", due to his somewhat gruff vocal stylings.
Nikita Taylor is not a good girl.She's a heroin addict who participates in robbing the pharmacy.It ends up badly and she's the only survivor.She's sentenced for life for shooting a policeman.But one day she finds out Nikita no longer exists and she has to work as an assassin.Things get more complicated when she falls in love with a cashier.Nikita is an action thriller directed by Luc Besson.In 1993 John Badham made an English version called Point of No Return with Bridget Fobda in the lead.In the French version Anne Parillaud does a great job as Nikita.Jean-Hugues Anglade is terrific as her boyfriend Marco.TchÃ©ky Karyo is brilliant as Bob.Jeanne Moreau is wonderful as Amande.Jean Reno is fantastic as Victor the cleaner.We all remember his outstanding performance also as a cleaner in Leon (1994), a Luc Besson masterpiece.The restaurant sequence looks quite awesome.She has to make her first assassination on her birthday.And the job she does with Victor, and he wastes all those bullets on those men and gets shot.I wish Luc Besson could come up with stuff like this some day again.Nikita is a great representative of the action genre.
This film may be another blood bath, but the philosophical content is also enormous.
It is also sickeningly violent in places.
You must also watch the movie in a very abstract level, as opposed to the "standard" plot, with the characters and places as symbols.
There's also some possibly gratuitous nudity and some certainly gratuitous scenes of swords appearing from places where they should probably not appear from.
It was also very funny.
I also enjoyed how the director set us all up and how he cut the scenes together.
Anyhow, highly recommend this film for entertainment value but also for some not too heavy philosophical thinking.
Musically, it is almost, also, perfect.
Palace, also known as "Princess Hours", is a Corean television drama, based on a concurrent comic book.
A whole new can of worms had also been opened as well on the royal family's past along the way.
Doris Dowling is also excellent, performing the suffering Francesca, a women abused by her scum lover.
But the Noir elements (also prominent in Visconti's 1943 masterpiece "Ossessione", based, after all, on Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice") are strong: the indoor lighting (check out those stylized shadows in the warehouse), the complex camera-work (that amazing opening dolly shot!!
But that's just the start: she also had the kind of body that makes men drool and babble, a fabulous acting instinct and a stormy temper.
The emotional range of her character (also named Silvana) is huge: strong and frail, simple and ambitious, healthy and neurotic, determined and insecure, jealous and indifferent, jaded and naive, compulsive and calculating.
The acting overall, is kinda average, especially by Kyle MacLachlan, but with an always impressive Dwight Yoakam, and a usually solid Martin Sheen, the movie also ends up succeeding here as well.
In 1995 when I first encountered this movie I also desperately wanted to believe every last bit of nonsense hurled at the viewer like a face full of compressed cheeze.
It also hurt Jesse that both his wife Vy and young son Jesse Jr. (Kim Greist & J.D Daniels), who knew that Jesse was telling the truth, were both made to swallow that made up story and having to see him humiliated in front of the American public and his friends as well.
The crash site was what I really wanted to see portrayed, as this hasn't been recreated previously on film (well, that's even mildly believable) and (if also based on fact) proved to be, the SMOKING GUN.
They are also Hollyweird actors, not schlocks so how bad can it be?
Unlike others, I also found it suspenseful.
Right yes, so Jade marries Steve for his money & business interests as she also begins to look down on the ordinary carnival people who befriended her (& she sacks Shorty!).
Edited & directed by Byron Mabe who also has an uncredited cameo as a police officer, She Freak is pure rubbish from beginning to end.
She Freak also makes the fatal mistake of being utterly boring throughout, I mean this is the kind of film that depicts a romance between two people by having them sitting on a park bench together, nothing happens of any note until the last five minutes when the 'twist' ending is revealed which you can probably guess anyway from the opening scene.
Having met the real-life person the movie portrays, I was also interested in how interesting this man's younger life would be.
You were also incorrect in your reference to the "dead child".
The father of the boy was also Mormon, and brought his son to Elder Groberg because of the trust he already had for him.
So if you attack him for being Mormon, you should also attack the others there that were of other religions.
It interests me that some people see this as a propaganda piece and also as a statement of the perceived supremacy of the "white man's religion".
This movie is excellent because there's action and also a good story that makes you think about how you live your own live.
(also based on a true story).This I've got to hand it to you Mormon producers, you are very truthful.
The protagonist has his detractors in the film also that he eventually wins over with his sincerity and goodness.
It's on the episode that also features The Viking Women and the Sea Serpent.
In fact, gypsies, homosexuals, politicals, and Jehovah's Witnesses were also given special stars and faced extermination.
The German Penal Code of 1871, Paragraph 175, states "An unnatural sex act committed between persons of the male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed."
There is considerable evidence that homosexuals were regarded as the "lowest of the low" in the prison pecking order and suffered not only from Nazi atrocity but were also sometimes savaged by their fellow prisoners as well.
That's the Nazi regime's code of stigma, also known as Paragraph 175.
It is the story of gays and although briefly, lesbians, during the early Pre-WWII years and also during the war.
I think that Klaus MÃ¼ller, who is a consultant to the Holocaust Museum, was also on the crew of this film.
From the outset, the pool of interviewees was certainly going to be limited, but also limited is the actual archival footage of life in the concentration camps.
The penal code stated: "An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed," But Paragraph 175 was never really enforced until the Nazi's came to power.
An atrociously made, acted and dubbed cannibal movie that is also very tame in terms of violence (except for a scene where a crocodile is skinned alive) and nudity (it must have been on the female lead's contract not to have a single nude scene).
From Bloomingdales to the bottom of the sea, this movie constantly finds ways to make you burst out laughing, while also making you burst out in tears!
I also must say that Daryl Hannah's tail looks stunningly real, with so many details that every time you watch it you notice something new.
That can also be said for the entire film!
Splash also feels different from Ron Howard's films of recent years.
It also marked the first of Howard's associations with Tom Hanks.
It has a few flaws, its a little too lightweight and the ending is slightly odd but its also a fun way to pass the time.
This is, by the way, also quite a date movie.
It may be a funny line, but we should also be able to identify with Allen's pain when he tries to come to terms with the fact that his love match is a... fish.
He also showed that he is the best in the business.
It was also well written.
The music is also delightful.
Maybe it was also to do with how it is sung; the vocals were sublime, and never spoiled the mood of the song.
Not only how it was filmed, but also the music featured.
I also thought that the movie's length was perfect, and the pacing was just fine.
The film also features SCTV alum John Candy and Eugene Levy both of whom are hilarious in this one.
Well of course the lady is the little girl mermaid and Levy's character who also encountered is determined to expose her for the half woman and half fish that she is.
But I offer this bi-line: Ms Hannah's character - or Madison, as she calls herself - is a mermaid, and therefor not only a different species but also a supposedly dangerous one of ancient folklore.
I used to watch this movie as a kid and occasionally when I was in my teens but I watched it again now (im 24) and I must say its an excellent movie, which also has a very good story line, and one you can relate to if you have been in a relationship where your asking yourself many questions about the person your with and things that do which don't make sense!
Its a movie of great comedy also!!
The only thing he doesn't know yet, is that the beautiful and mysterious woman named Madison,is part of his childhood and also has a nature different from the human.
Candy is also delightful as Hanks' irresponsible brother.
no, she was not stealing her schtick from Lucille ball (who i also love).
After the baby is born, the lawyer dumps her & she also feels rejected by her son (you'll have to see the movie to find out why) so she heads off to Texas to finally face her mom for some type of closure.
The movie also has a knack for capturing the New York Italian/American experience authentically.
I was also amazed at how popular "Gator" was all through the '80s and I had absolutely no clue who he was - that is until I seen this film.
This is a brilliant film and it is also brilliantly made.
He was also seen in almost every issue of Thrasher magazine either in an ad , doing his skateboarding thing or conducting his own interview.
This film also shows people that knew him , people who wanted to be like him and many of the jobs that he did which attributed to the skateboarding profession in the '80s.
I'm also familiar with "Space Age Love Song" and that's definitely not it.
Seeing Lance and Christian et al, was also awesome.
But its not only the directors fault, the dam writers are to blame also.
There's also a magnificent score by Bruce Smeaton that deftly blends the romanticism of Nino Rota with the majestic sweep of Morricone's best work and adds a dash of electronic dissonance for good measure.
"Paris" is also a society that depends on newcomers (accident victims/immigrants) for its' survival, but insists they keep quiet about where they came from and denies them any rights in "affairs of state".
This is an Aussie black comedy from the 70's and its also one of Peter Weirs first films.
the film is also worth watching for the performances of Bruce Spence & Chris Haywood because these actors are still working !
The pathetic impotence of the older generation is also a classic 1970's theme.
The rural location and inhabitants of the town are simply alienating in their welcoming vibe and also with an eerie score that gives out a groovy twang that works up the mood rather effectively.
Genre crossing, challenging and freaky, it also taps into some big themes about Australian identity and paranoia.
It also has director Peter Weir's film The Plumber (1979) as a bonus, plus interviews with Weir about each film, as well as trailers.
There also seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about the nature of the film.
But also why they did not fu the singer?
English subtitles also.
The viewer should also keep in mind that Belgrade is not a fair and complete reflection of Serbia and the Serbian people as would the rediculous idea that Paris is a reflection of France.
I was able to feel the love he had for his children and also the hurt when the truth was brought out in front of him.
Besides the message the film brought, it also gave the viewer a good dose of the italian countryside, Roma, and Milano.
you do not even have to leave your country, as this movie shows, to find yourself trying to make it alone, and trying to make your parents believe that you are OK. Of course, like in every good lie, some help from the person being lied is also needed.
It features strong performances from Michael and Mark Polish as the Falls brothers (Michael also directed, and the brothers together wrote the screenplay) and a marvellous performance by Michele Hicks, in her first major role, as Penny.
The catalyst of the story, the hooker played by Michele Hicks (who was also with them in Northfork) proves to be the perfect foil for the twins.
It was reminescent of the Broadway musical, 'Side Show', which also dealt with the subject of conjoined twins.
The film also offers analogies, puns, metaphors, and an interesting array of supporting characters.
There is also alot of "hidden" humor so watch carefully.
This also was the first film I saw Benicio del Torro in...and I think he is fabulous!
There's also her low voice, the way she talks; her lean figure, the way she walks.
Director/producer Wynorski (who also helmed the raucously cheesy Chopping Mall) proves himself to be the unsung B-movie hero.
Wynorski also succeeds in that his intentionally funny and over-the-top ending is actually funny.
There's also an interview with Friz Freleng, some footage of Mel Blanc, while Elmer, Sylvester, Tweety, and Foghorn also appear in the cartoons.
When MGM released "Bugs Bunny Superstar" on video in 1988, they also released the video collections "BUGS!"
This nine-cartoon compilation also features Elmer Fudd, Tweety, Silvester, Henry-the-Chicken-Hawk, Foghorn Leghorn, Porky, Daffy.
But I'll also bet that the majority of CURRENT cartoons are NOT known from generation to generation.
I also commented on Magnolia, if you want to check it out.
He is not only infinitely intelligent, being able to read and memorize everything, learn to play piano, carve beautiful figures from wood, etc., but he also develops "feelings", which none of the other robots do.
He also invents many replacement organs that become in widespread use among humans.
It will also make you do 2 more very important things.
Besides the similarities I found between myself and Andrew, I think I was also touched by many elements of the plot; independence, freedom, recognition, a spurned love...   And the philosophical issues, most imperatively.
The movie also succeeds in creating spellbinding images of the weddings and the romantic dances.
It was also exciting to watch the visions of the world in the 22nd and 23rd centuries but at the same time, the nuts and bolts aspects were deftly restrained (other movies set years in the future, such as The Fifth Element sometimes go gaudily overboard in depicting the future).
Andrew's romance with Portia was also touching and believable though I did not think about this while the movie ran.
The film is also outstanding from a technical perspective.
The supporting cast is also filled with fine performances with Sam Neill, Wendy Crewson, Embeth Davidtz, and Oliver Platt.
He proves that he can either play a 'funny wacky' character but also a serious character that will touch the hearts of the viewers.
Far better in my opinion than IA or I Robot who also took their cues from Azimov.
what makes the show good is that it can have you gripped to whats going to happen and also have you laughing.
Kelly Garret (Jaclyn Smith) is street - wise and tough angel, however she is also really sensitive.
Not only the girls add to the storyline, Bosley and Charlie also add unique points.
I would also like to add, that if you base watching the films on the programmes then you might be disappointed.Although the general idea is still there, the modernised version has certainly made it more male orientated with a lot of the scenes, especially the "Bay Watch" scene in film two.
Shelley entered The Townsend Office as Tiffany Welles, an Ivy League scholar who also was a graduate from the Boston Police Academy.
She was not possessed with Farrah's hypnotic charisma, but she was also a bit more generous with the other actors than Farrah had been.
The scenery and costume design are also outstanding.
Tomas Milian is an ennobled street bandit also fighting for Mongo.
A whimsically breezy surface makes way for a bang-up, ball-breaking and noisy spaghetti western by the talented Sergio Corbucci (the man also behind "The Great Silence" and "The Mercenary").
This movie also has the best action scenes of any Spagstern I've seen so far.
The professor also leads a rival rag-tag army of students who are fighting both the Mexican Army as well as Mongo's men with Lola (Iris Berben) as the professor's second in command.
There's also a fairly interesting 15 minute interview with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian and Ennio Morricone where they recount their experiences while they were involved in this film.
What matters is the hope that so many Europeans had in that time for some kind of revolution here also.
In the (incredible) end, when everything about this wonderful, crazy song you hear all the time makes sense, you are so captivated that you would never forgive Yolaf for making any other choice than the one that you also would have made given the chance.
The cinematography is beautifully filmed by cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa who also filmed other excellent Spaghetti Westerns.
There she meets Adolphe Menjou who is also on vacation and traveling incognito.
Raplh Bellamy is also fine as the managing editor of a newspaper, where gossip is always welcome.
Perhaps not the most kind thing to do but you also have to remember that this was 1894 when these sort of animal vaudeville acts were very common and part of everyday's life.
They also put the lead male in a financial trouble bringing funny performances from Nicholas Turturro and Harry Connick Jr; and chose the best person to look out for Emily: Christopher Walken, who end up a step away of stealing the show: the thief does that.
I like the fact that not only does the DROP Squad address the problems of Blacks self-exploiting racial stereotypes for personal financial gain, it also questions the tactics that must be enacted to solve these problems.
But she's also a kind and caring one and that comes through with all the people we see her interact with.
The picture must also be valued for the cohesiveness among the people of the town.
But specially by Jean Gavin who also played 'Maigret and the St Fiacre case(59)'.
In that film you can also see a young beginner named Lino Ventura.
"Maigret tend un piÃ¨ge" is at first sight a serial killer story ,but Simenon is too subtle a writer to be content with that.And I'm sure that Jean Delannoy had seen Julien Duvivier's sensational film noir "voici le temps des assassins "(1956):not only he casts Jean Gabin as Maigret,Gabin who was the hero of Duvivier's movie,but he also uses Lucienne Bogaert ,who was his ex-wife in the same movie.Bogaert portrayed a drug addict abominable criminal in 1956;in Delannoy's film,she is an over possessive mother,proud of his son who could have been a sculptor,a painter,an artist,a genius,had they not thwarted his outstanding gifts.
The film also features in a supporting role the actor who, for all intents and purposes, replaced Gabin in French filmgoers' minds as the brooding action hero, Lino Ventura, but it's Annie Girardot (as a neglected but ultimately self-sacrificing wife) and Jean Desailly (as her impotent, mother-fixated artist husband) who leave the best impression in the crowded supporting cast.
Inspector Maigret is celebrated French pulp writer Georges Simenon's most famous literary creation and had previously been portrayed on the screen by Pierre Renoir in one of his brother Jean's most elusive films, NIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS (1932), and also by the great Charles Laughton in Burgess Meredith's intriguing directorial outing, THE MAN IN THE EIFFEL TOWER (1950) - neither of which I've watched alas - and would go on to be impersonated by a variety of formidable character actors among them Rupert Davies, Gino Cervi and Michael Gambon for TV!
The choice of having Mike Scale is also a very poor choice.
But the two stars, Marcel Schlutt and Mike Sale, are a pleasure to look at, there are some very hot scenes, and there are also some surprisingly good non-sexual moments.
There is also a very graphic rape scene, which, if it had not been integral to the plot line, could never have been acceptable to any audience.
There are some amusing scenes also, such as when Hilley teaches her daughter how to parallel park, by driving through (and over) the graves at the local cemetery.
This story is all the more intriguing because it is based on truth, and apparently John Homan (Hilley's beleaguered husband) was also murdered in a bizarre robbery incident in 1989.
Kevin Kline was also incredible with his portrayal of someone with a schizophrenic disorder before the time when that sort of thing was recognized.
There is a rawness that remains untouched by many filmmakers superior to he who directed this, Alan J. Pakula, who also adapted it from William Styron's novel.
Streep makes her tremulous and lovely, nervous and chatty while also politely flustered, and there are moments when she's radiant.
I won't rank her performance in 'Sophie' above Jessica Lange's "Frances", which also came out in 82.
He also is quite civil towards Sophie, business-minded and somewhat unsure of himself.
Kline throws himself into the role of the "fatally glamorous" Nathan and also displays impressive range: he goes from charming to menacing.
I would also hold this film up as another example, along with John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy, of a film which depicted Native Americans as a noble race, victimized by the march of western civilization, long before the advent of films such as "Little Big Man" or "Dances With Wolves" The White Man is clearly the villain in this and the Ford films.
Early on, Cody admonishes a Government representative, telling him that Yellow hand (Anthony Quinn, who also plays Crazy Horse in "They Died With Their boots On") is a Prince of his people, and should be treated as such.
There are already too many comments on this one, but ... As usual, lots of people seeing this movie were looking for characters to "relate to," and feeling jaded because not only is there a dearth of such characters, but the film also forces the viewer to re-evaluate his or her personal belief systems.
we're also amazed to see this kind of men, the white collars, be shown that way while they usually are shown as example for the american dream of the individualism and economical liberalism.
And yet it is also Chad who makes his way upwards through the corporate ladder, Chad who charms his way into Christine's life, Chad who goes home to loving wife.
Stacy Edwards as the deaf Christine is also very strong; in fact, when I saw her in another movie speaking normally I almost fell out of my chair.
Howard is also a very real character, that type of stupid guy with lack of personality and self-esteem that is easily used by others, becoming a loser in the end.
LaBute did not just give us impassioned characters with devoted actors, but he also gave us an amazing story.
I also heard that it was a comedy.
This is a riveting movie, but also an unexpected one.
But I think most people missed this is also about the workplace, specifically the Alpha Male in the workplace, and how he got that way.
The other man is Howard (Mike Mallory), Chad's colleague at work and also a former member of the same college as Chad.
Chad was also good at choosing a victim who would fall for the plot, just as he chose an accomplice effectively.
And just because you're black.Joel Katz' documentary from 2002 is very touching, very moving movie about one stain in American history.There are Abel's sons, Michael and Robby, talking about the song, about their father.Pete Seeger sings a piece of the song and plays with his guitar.Again your eyes get wet.Amiri Baraka, Don Byron, Abbey Wilson and Cassandra Wilson are also talking there.This movie makes you mad, it makes you sad.There is a stain you can't clean.
Not only do we delve into the racism that bore this song, but also the interactions between racism, the early labor movement, McCarthyism, and popular culture.
I also think Marco Mendoza is the absolute best bass player around, at least in the style of bass he plays.
Don't worry, the film also provides the viewer with the token blonde "final girl" in Laura Ramsey(..one of the new horror "it girls", having starred in such recent flicks as "The Covenant", "Venom", and "The Ruins") so that all the slasher guidelines are fulfilled.
If you like gentle comedy, this film is also for you.
There are many funny and touching scenes, as when Keiko tries stubbornly to provide Yamashita with a lunch bag against his will, and the many nightly fishing trips, where our hero releases the fish as soon as they are caught, are also unforgettable.
There is also a great sense of humour to this film, which may seem weird at times, but always funny.
This movie also has what could be considered as one of the greatest endings of all time.
Chow Yun-Fat gets a chance to prove his great acting abilities, without so much use of a gun(he also uses a gun, but rather rarely).
The comedy part is also all right, but a Western audience might find quite a few of the jokes a little TOO chinese for their liking.
Andy Lau also gives a very note-worthy performance, as Chow Yun Fats sidekick (even though this is a much younger Andy Lau).
Watching the once happy elderly couple, now battling family issues/ health problems (which is the main drama driving the story where there are numerously scattered human interest subplots), but also the changing neighbourhood of Coney Island as young jive talking hoons run wild (which populates mainly the beginning and ending but still feels secondary) is engagingly passionate in its ups and downs.
I saw this when it was released and never forgot it, most of my friends also remember it clearly!
I should also mention the special non-effects by Bad Film legend David L. Hewitt, also a director of such legendarily horrific outings as "The Mighty Gorga," "Journey To The Center of Time" and "The Tormentors."
The only completely satisfying performance in the film is by Diana Rigg as the Countess, who brings so much more to the role than the screenplay allows and also surprisingly gives the film its loveliest musical moment with her rendition of "Every Day a Little Death."
The Count also has a gorgeous solo in the show called "In Praise of Women" which was also cut.
They also cut "The Miller's Son" a powerhouse of a song sung by Petra, the maid.
1980 also included Ordinary People, Raging Bull, Coal Miners Daughter, Elephant Man, etc so it's odd that this one for both screenplay (Bo Goldman) and supporting actress (Mary Steenburgen), neither of which make any sense in retrospect.
It has also a first-class appetite for the story and the world it describes.
There are those movies which convince us that by the cinema art the greatest things can be done;and there are also the delightful unpretentious films that convince us that cinema is at least first-class fun.
Mary Steenburgen is also perfect in what must have been one of her first films.
There is a certain joy of life depicted in this film that is in some ways also bittersweet (and yet refreshing).
Of these, the finest was, beyond a doubt, Melvin and Howard.Based on a twentieth century addition to American folklore( the improbable saga of Howard Hughes and Melvin Dummar), Jonathan Demmes' film tells the story of a chronically unsuccessful Everyman, Melvin Dummar, who claimed to have unknowingly picked up Howard Hughes one night in the Nevada desert, and who also claimed to have been written into Hughes' will.
Yes, we may disagree with the statement in a film, but we can also begrudgingly respect its professionalism.
I also liked the performances of Van Heflin & Dean Jagger.
The film also is very dark - even the outdoor scenes are dark, with the indoor scenes just dreadfully difficult to look at.
Third Leo McCarey was also a devout and practicing Catholic.
Fourth Leo McCarey was also one of Hollywood's bigger alcoholics.
Since McCarey also wrote and directed Going My Way and created McHugh's character he certainly could do what he wanted with him.
There are also a couple of songs that were in the Broadway version that got cut from the movie.
There's also various other characters that have names like Earthquake McGoon and Marryin' Sam.
We also have a sequence with some muscular handsome men are shown only wearing shorts.
Incidentally, the loutish Earthquake McGoon is less of a grotesque this time around; Abnerâs parents, though, still look like they belong on another planet â also, Robert Strauss (very popular around this time) turns up under heavy (make that filthy) make-up as Daisy Maeâs opportunistic close relative, whereas Jerry Lewis does a very brief uncredited cameo as a dopey-looking character called Itchy McRabbit!
My only regret is that they cut his brilliant "Progress Is The Root Of All Evil" number from the stage version.Stella Stevens is also well cast as Bullmoose's mistress Appasionata Von Climax.
I am a pure Hanna-Barbera fan and a pure fan in animation also!
also Colleen Camp is awesome and did a lot of cool movies in the 80's...'Valley Girl' & 'Clue' anyways...I'd buy it if came out on DVD...of course I'm a Bette Davis fan and to all the the negative people making comment's "She'll take a tumble on you, role you like you were dice until you come up Blue...She's Got Bette Davis Eyes" ....well the movie is worth seeing for her alone and I to wish she was in it more but at least they kept her scenes and it's funny with some of the cracks like the Joan Crawford picture & when she's on the phone and there's a huge picture of Bette from the 1940's on the side of the wall.
As I feel that society is becoming more and more immoral, not only through homosexuality but also through corruption, violence, paedophilia, lies, greed ....it is necessary to take stock of and protest against this every time it occurs - albeit in the course of a film.
It is also interesting that one of the weapons of the bigots is to reduce someone they do not like from a person to a symbol.
It also astonished me that no one thought to ask why the grandmother was insisting on the child calling her 'mamma'.
Seven out of ten mostly for the delectable and dexterous Bai Ling and also for one truly nasty, skulking-around-places gangster-type villain.
And not just emotional growth, as modern animation is often so limited to, but also that he is maturing in a natural/physical way, so that you can really imagine him becoming a strong and brave prince.
Fortunately, Bambi will find some support from his friends, Thumper (Brendon Baerg) and Flower (Nicky Jones), but he'll also have to meet his soon-to-be rival, the mean deer Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), for the first time.
Making a follow-up for a classic like "Bambi" is not easy, but the fact that the writers (Director Brian Pimental and newcomer Alicia Kirk) decided to explore an entirely "missing chapter" in the life of the young deer instead of making a proper sequel, gave them enough freedom to create a story that not only is fresh and original on its own, it also gives continuity to the original without disrespecting it or blatantly copying it.
I love Disney animation (I also enjoy drawing drawing it to), but usually second takes to the films animation is terrible.
But she also meets wealthy young Lord, Robert Montgomery and through him gets invited to old dowager Duchess Jessie Ralph's for the weekend.
It was very funny yet it was also a strong story showing Bambi getting to know his father, very emotional at some points!
I also felt the animation was of a very high standard and it evoked memories of the original film.
Not only we get to know the relationship between Bambi and his father, but also to know his father better.
We also get to know Ronno when he was little.
I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films.
I also enjoyed this new chapter into Bambi's life as he is learning how to become a prince, but still holding onto his childhood and his favorite friends.
Bambi is having a hard time, his father has to take care of him but his father also has no respect for him since Bambi isn't as brave as he is.
Bambi is also having to learn how to grieve the death of his mother and make sure that he doesn't meet the same fate as she did.
The plot of the relationship between Bambi and his father, basically the ideas of love and growing up, and the feel in general of Bambi 2 are almost exactly like those of original film, and the music, voices, and sensational character and background artwork are also very similar.
In addition to appealing to those who loved the original, Bambi 2 is also filled with humor and adventure that kids of this generation would enjoy.
Joan Crawford is a jewel thief trying to break into society in "The Last of Mrs. Cheyney," a 1937 film from MGM also starring William Powell, Robert Montgomery, Nigel Bruce, Frank Morgan, and Jessie Ralph.
It is also impressive how far a stressed person with culture and education may go and how amoral can be her behavior staying alone with another disturbed and lonely person that she can not understand.
As he tears away at her bathroom, he also tears away at the line that seperates the classes.
The dialog reeks of upper class English nonsense also.
It is also noteworthy that two of the ships in the cast, HMS Cumberland and HMIS Delhi (formerly HMNZS Achilles) were actually present during the original events.
It is also good to see that real ships are used in the general shots, instead of models in a bath tub, and some of the camera shots of the battle are excellent.
There are also plenty of nice little details that often get overlooked, such as the gun-muzzles that become smoke-blackened after use.
I also like the way we patrol with the fleet as the dawn breaks on a clear morning.
Unfortunately, while this film was big on realism, it also will probably seem a tad dull to the average person because it did stress realism and not huge name actors and unnecessary action.
They will also find the use of models for some of the battle scenes less than convincing when compared to the larger-than-life realism of computer-generated imagery.
Actually, this is Jones's second collaboration with, and the second feature film of director Brendan Foley, following his equally disastrous debut The Riddle, where Jones was also the lead.
Having the characters come together gradually was also clever, I like it when films do this, because it shows that all the characters had a life before the event, and not just the main character.
I also recall the hot, sexy Heather Thomas appearing on this show once or twice.
I would also like to see BJ and the Bear as well.
LOL Deputy Perkins (Mills Watson) was so funny also, he was practically joined at the hip to Lobo-LOL I guess he should since they were brothers-in-law.
"Lobo" came along at the same time as the Dukes, it was also set in the South, it also had car chases, and it also had scantily-clad women.
He also engages in an affair with one of his students.
Unlike the two men, she has no buried intention to compensate for or hold on to days gone by, not just for the reason that it's upsetting, but also because she is altogether here and now.
It's also the first film to unite Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi.
Interestingly enough, in THE RAVEN such a confrontation also occurs, but this time Lugosi is the evil guy.
Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads.
I always found the movie vague, as you can read in an earlier comment on the movie, although this has changed recently because I decided to watch it again for a report I had to make for religion class (I recommend you to also watch this movie if you need to make a similar report).
It does not only provide much information about what we know of the Celtic religion; it also shows the practical side of the Celtic forces.
The score is also quite effective.
Peter Greenaway also plays with the lighting and exposure of the film in one of the few multi-shot films in the series.
The consensus favourite, the short film by David Lynch, is also one of the most original in the program.
It also contains multiple shots (and even the continuity transitions are creative, including flames, as though the negative catches fire).
Lynch also provided one of the more agreeable interviews, relating that film is "a magical medium that makes you dream."
It also appears to be a consensus that the strongest entry is David Lynch's bizarre sci-fi collage, but I'd say closely followed by:   *) Zhang Yimou's nice reversal of the "old-fashioned" setting initially presented... and one of the few pieces with any sense of humor...  *) Helma Sanders' beautiful four-dimensional 'painting with light' which makes a virtue of the film stock's limited range of contrast...  *) Claude Lelouch's vertiginous kiss as camera technology evolves in the background.
I also found some of the simpler ones quite charming, including: *) Jaco van Dormael's portrait of a kiss by a pair of special lovers, *) Peter Greenaway's floating numbers of time *) Wim Wenders' quiet and simple re-visitation of his angels *) Jerry Schatzberg's snapshot of urban scavenging and *) Bigas Luna's portrait of a nude woman nursing in a field.
Many of them turn the project into a commentary on cinema in some form - Boorman films Neil Jordan at work, with the actors looking quizzically into the camera (a common device here, also used by Angelopoulos and Costa-Gavras); Lelouch has a sort of reverse version of the Vertigo kiss, designed with great panache.
Having said this, I must also say that the actors in Naked are very talented and they kept me watching this very silly story to the end.
The movie is based on a play (the title is "Happy") written also by the director of the movie and this theatrical origin is very obvious and... enjoyable.
Their supporting cast is also incredibly weak, at best they "try" to be theatrical.
He is also the one who could be blamed be blamed for the rushing.
My favorite part also is when the Medal of Honor is shown to the two Marines who snap to attention and salute.
-- but do not note that LCDR Coleman, in the scene where DiNozzo reveals CPL Yost's Medal of Honor, also snaps to attention but does not salute (she was not covered, being indoors; her hat was under her arm).
This was also my favorite episode of NCIS.
Yet D'Amato's tale also stands as a critique of the kind of male fantasizing behind this kind of sex movie, always keeping itself self-conscious that this is some male inadequate's masturbation material.
The students are also rewarded by ending up with the stolen loot, just like the paid sex performers in a porn film are rewarded by their bags of (also probably mob) cashÂ D'Amato arranges a psychologically suspect but nevertheless adept plot of sexual partnering whilst continually re-enforcing the idea that the sexual scenes are just that, sexual scene in a movie.
I know that this has been said a million times, but this episode is also the saddest...
It's also SO depressing.
I had just finished watching Cold Case, which also tears me up, and wanted to watch something light and funny.
Robert Keith is scornful as Leffingwell, a weasel of a man who knows his limitations but who also knows how to survive through cunning and maleficence.
It also, in many ways, hearkens back to the early westerns of William S. Hart which date from 1914 to 1925, when movies were still in their infancy.
But, also like almost all of the early 30's horror films, it is unique, ingenious in it's way, and still worthy of discovery by a new generation.
Jean Harlow also puts in a too brief appearance, and is mostly window dressing.
The film also opens and ends with a silly statement condemning gangsters--it was probably put in to pacify censors--this film was considered extremely violent for 1931.
THE PUBLIC ENEMY takes it's place alongside LITTLE CAESAR and SCARFACE in a cycle of early 30's gangster-themed films that aimed to entertain and shock the filmgoing public with their social realism, whilst also sending a strong message that crime doesn't pay.
Apart from struggling with an underwritten role, Harlow also seems to be far from the Platinum Blonde beauty that would define her screen "look".
There is also, remarkably, a suggestion of Cagney being raped (!)
Cagney has a heart, for he respects his family and wants sincerely to help them, but he his devotion to a life of crime also makes him a consummate anti-hero.
The appearance of the boys' sister and brother ("sissy" Mike) is also confusing.
(But the Police Department, Fire Department and the Chicago Junction Railroad were top choices, also).
During this time they also got acquainted with some big time organized crime bosses, including Westside Outfit guy, "Nails" Nathan.
We also learn that Poelzig had betrayed Werdegast during WW1 and caused him to spend the last 15 years in prison.
Howver we also learn that the evil Poelzig, who is also a satanist by the way, has "married" the now grown daughter of Werdegast.
Not to be confused with Universal's "The Black Cat" (1941) in which Lugosi also appeared.
She also barely appreciates Mike's sacrifices (he goes to fight in World War I, and gets gassed, and while Tom's material wealth increases due to crime, Mike is only able to get a job as a streetcar conductor).
Mike's lecture to Tom concerning Tom's lack of heart and brain also gives pause, so that (if you agree with the filmmakers) one can define very simply the typical gangster's actions.
When Jane (Mia Marvin) seduces a drunken Tom, their morning-after becomes not only a surprising slap in the face for all concerned (including the viewer), but also sets up the motivation for Matt's (Edward Doyle) demise.
There is the usual macho posturing of right vs. wrong, but there are also undercurrents of gray areas.
Beryl Mercer as Ma Powers also evokes some surprisingly-good emoting.
This might have been partly just humility on Cagney's part, but I can also see it borne in Public Enemy's somewhat half-baked script.
Matt also is one of those who yearns for power.
This movie is not only one of the best horror films of Hollywood's golden era, but it is also one of the most bizarre movies ever made.
It is also of great historical importance because it is the first movie that paired Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, the two most venerated iconic figures of the horror genre.
In the film there are also some naiveness and clumsiness, though.
I am also extremely liberal in politics, and as close to an atheist as someone as spiritually apathetic as I can be.
GL is also surprisingly brief, under 90 minutes.
From it, I also learned that Tim Thomerson apparently starred in the "original".
The framing in the car-motorcycle-chasing scene is also far above what was state-of-the-art.
Stelvio Cipriani again provides an excellent score, the film looks good visually, no more than you'd expect from a director who used to ply his trade as a cinematographer, there's also a very memorable chase scene that livens up the film immensely.
Another film in the collection, "The Raven", also stars Lugosi and Karloff duking it out, and is just as un-"Poe"-etic as "The Black Cat", despite its title.
It also manages to use the Romeo and Juliet Overture to disastrous effect.
Writer/director Massimo Dallamano (screenplay also credited to Ettore SanzÃ²) crafts an involving tale, sympathetic to all afflicted by the matters at hand with time for emotional scenes as well as some nail biting suspense (including a sweet car chase) and a spot of pleasing bloodshed.
Ralli may also be known to Italian movie buffs for films like Sergio Corbucci's revolutionary Western "Il Mercenario" or Enzo Castellari's Giallo "Gli Occhi Freddi De La Paura".
My favorite film from Massimo Dallamano will always be his Giallo-masterpiece "Cosa Avete Fatto A Solange" ("What Have You Done To Solange", 1972), but "La Polizia Chiede Aiuto" is also a highly memorable film.
From the director of the excellent what have you done to Solange, Massimo Dallamano, here is a strange Italian giallo, more a police procedural (an a really lurid tale, a ring of teens used as prostitutes by people in very high places - that was the time, in Italy, when several directors and scripwriters tried their hands on very hot subjects, like this one) than an Argentian thriller (but it is scary enough in a few places and also very gory).
The film deals with a teenage suicide which eventually uncovers a child prostitution ring which, as usual, includes not just the petty sleazy oddballs (here personified by Franco Fabrizi) but also high-profile professionals (a celebrated doctor) and high-ranking government officials (a Minister).
), Mario Adorf as the policeman who finds the first body and also discovers that his own teenage daughter was once a âvictimâ of these perverts, the afore-mentioned Fabrizi and Hollywood veteran Farley Granger in a smallish role as the first victimâs father.
And despite her early days as a hoofer doing the Charleston and other dances during her flaming youth, it's also easy to see that dancing is not her strong point.
She also pleaded illness when she was afraid to attend the Academy Awards--afraid she might lose--but put her make-up on for the cameras when the radio announcement came that she won.
Joan's makeup (not the blackface, the regular stuff) also struck me as a little off--in the scene where she tries to adjust the clock with her eyes closed her face is a full three shades lighter than her chest.
The first of the two scenes comes when Jenny attempts some everyday tasks as a blind person--she tries to set the clock, as I mentioned earlier, and she also tries to make a phone call.
Marjorie Rambeau (playing Joan's mother) is very good also and was actually nominated for a Best Supporting Actress for this.
He is a sympathetic gentle character who also has Dutchess, a boxer seeing-eye-dog to keep him company.
As the night and next morning ensue, Werdegast's and Poelzig's sordid past is revealed, and Poelzig also decides that he must have Joan for a satanic ritual.
Actually I was a steward on this ship in real life but I also played a very tiny role in this movie.
It also lacked a 'big name' movie-star to help secure its recognition.
It is also one of the best among the movies that paired Lugosi and Karloff ("The Body Snatcher" is another great one), and as written above, Lugosi's best performance ever.
Gene Polito, who later shot WESTWORLD [1973]), imaginative settings (by the veteran Alexander Golitzen), often disorienting editing (the expert work of Folmar Blangsted) and an appropriately weird score (by Michel Colombier) Â the film truly can't be faulted, but it also benefits from a largely anonymous cast.
Joseph Sargent's able direction, working from a smart and provocative script by James Bridges, not only wrings plenty of tension from the arresting premise, but also relates said story in a taut, involving and above all convincing manner.
Interesting sets are also a bonus, as well as a climax involving a Satanic mass and a torturous comeuppance for Karloff.
Dr. Forbin, after activating his new computer, attends party at the White House and publicly states his wish that not only will his machine prevent war, but that it will also herald a new age of human advancement, in which famine and disease and pollution and overpopulation will be eliminated with the help of Colossus' vast computer power.
When it is brought on line it discovers that the soviets have also completed a similar computer.
The lower floor is an expressionistic prison, also clean lined, but still dungeon-like with its windowless walls of exposed board-formed concrete.
It is pure logic, and that is what is also scary -- making decisions without regard to the value of a single, human life.
There has to be logical consequences for their misbehavior also -- which are horrible to even think about in the human mind, but in the computer mind, it is "Necessary" for the good of all concerned.
Unlike most other shorts from the filmmaker, this one was also hand-tinted a variety of bold colors, which gives it a different look and feel than others from the same era.
"Le Chaudron infernal" (also known as "The Infernal Boiling Pot" by some sources) is a movie about an evil green-skinned Demon (Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, of course), who works as an executioner in Hell.
Despite this problems, "Le Chaudron infernal" is definitely one of the most interesting movies done by the legendary French magician, not only because of its inventive use of color as a special effect, but also because of its place in the history of the horror genre.
I would also like to mention that the original film from 1968 is great as well.
Notable performances were also put in by William Butler and Katie Finneran as Tom and Judy Rose, two sweethearts who as naive as they are, have smarts of their own to help them survive.
When the original Night Of The Living dead came out, it was very scary, and also original...
The movie also gains a lot from not trying to be shocking.
Sometimes characterized as a scene-for-scene remake, those critics should open their eyes a little wider because the end was completely different from the original, as was the beginning -- also taking the second paragraph's points into consideration as well.
George A. Romero also wrote the screenplay for this one, too.
Producers of the original 1968 film-Russell Streiner and John A. Russo are also producing this remake.
DVD Quality of "Night of the Living Dead" remake is very good with an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan).
Romero also Executive Produced the film.
This remake was a wonderful surprise for me: It is also a great movie, with some minors modification in the story.
It was also poorly pulled off.
The make-up is also rather nifty, with the ghouls sporting not-too-OTT dead complexions and hideous milky eyes, and several of the corpses featuring some nice individual touches (there's a drug-addict corpse with a needle in its arm, and one with a knife in his chest).
This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected).
Karloff is evil, yet magnetic, and Lugosi's hero is sympathetic and well-intentioned, but also callous and overtaken by some far less admirable traits.
Tom Towles also does a good turn as a truly dis-likable refugee.
Supporting cast McKee Anderson, William Butler, and Bill Moseley are also effective.
There is also an eerie and very effective music score throughout the movie.
The Nazi-art theft theme was also a revisionist topic of the day.
(And while this pic isn't The Lion in Winter, it's also hard to see how it's worse than Beckett.)
They'd also be talking stuff about low material redeemed.
Maj.Grau also ends up making a fatal mistake, in him mistakenly feeling that the assassination was successful,in jumping the gun in trying to arrest the psycho killer German General.
Fast forward two years, and the three generals  find their duties also deliver them to Paris, where promoted  colonel Sharif eagerly awaits his reopening of the case.
Pettet and Courtenay's romance is also a little silly.
Finally, there is the murder of the holocaust, which also has an explicit portrayal in the film.
The music score is also a credit.
I also don't think there's been a film with so many actors cast against type.
It's also full of surprisingly funny lines (especially from the Donald Pleasance character), of the understated kind - "Do you really think anyone's going to believe you?"
The answer depends on whether the country involved is willing to cover-up for them, and also successful in the war.
I would also agree that the end of the picture, which takes place in the 1960's, is somewhat anti-climatic, especially after the shocking scene of Grau's murder.
Its also one of the few occasions that Edgar G. Ulmer was able to show how talented a filmmaker he was.
The point I wanted also to make is that, unlike your "factual errors" there were in fact several Regular German Army units and soldiers who were later brought into the Waffen SS.
The reconstitution of the period is also fantastic, specially the scene of the madness of General Tanz in a block of Warsaw, when he burns and destroys many buildings.
I am a fan of foreign art films, but I'm also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies.
Renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters, and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie.
The first of them, "Complainte de la Butte," which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score, is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it.
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.
That is OK, but why do they try so hard in the advertisements and so on to show it as a "historic movie" And if the movie is really an action movie, why do they depict Turks not only as villains, but also ugly and stupid?
The film has its pros, but also unfortunately (IMHO) several cons... My explanations will follow...  *Spoiler Alert*  ...The beginning seemed a bit strange for me... Why is Fandorin running and shooting Turks?
It suits him well... Kazanzaki (he is credited as Kazinaki on IMDb - LOL) was also, as I imagined him... Mizinov (Savelich from "Russkiy bunt" and Gryaznov from "Marsh Turetskogo" - sorry for the pun here) is great too... Zurov is a bit strange here - somehow I think it's not a role for Pevtsov (IMHO again)... McLaughlin was too, as I imagined him... Petya reminded me, of course, of Tolik from "Nochnoy Dozor"... Now I don't even know, who is funnier...
Film is based on a Russian - Turkish war, and that war is not based on strength and power of two armies, it is also based on smart tricks, (like assassinating the general by pretending that Turks are giving up).
there were many replicas copied from Hollywood film-making also such as focusing camera on objects very fast and too much mise-en scene.But usage of maps as a very dynamic part of film was very original and entertaining.
This movie is inspired from Italian movie Desica's Girasoli, I (1970),neverthless no complaints because i don't believe in originality.The movie is worth watching because of good story and flow of the story.A.R.Rehmans score and P.C.Sreeram's camera is beautiful.The movie has romance and patriotism.Good natural performance by the acting team also.Maniratnam was in great form during this period,he gave continuous hits of Mouna Ragam,Nayagan,Agni Natchathiram,Geethanjali,Anjali,Thalapathi.There were many cute scenes in the movie.It is also visually stunning.
"The Black Cat" is one of the quickest film experiences you will ever have, but also one of the most disturbing and enjoyable, too.
The deep struggles endured against militants who are humans also are brilliantly depicted in the movie.
He should also be credited for getting the best tunes of a innocently brilliant music genius.
For once it is reasonably clear why the heroine falls in love with the hero, and also the motivation of the hero, even if it is unlikely, is well presented.
Acting is solid, especially from Pankaj Kapoor as the terrorist leader, but also from Arvind Swamy as Rishi (except perhaps when he goes into patriotic overdrive).
The story also shows how carefully Reavis planned his fraud though many years.Fuller was able to have as a cinematographer the great James Wong Howe, who wanted so much to shoot the picture that agreed to have a lower salary than usual.
Civilians and their different ways of dealing with the occupation also have a place, giving some surprising nuances which most war movies (including the technically infinitely superior, but plot-wise arguably inferior 'Saving Private Ryan') lack.
The supporting cast,especially Drew,also perform well.
Reed Hadley who narrated the film also played the part of the rat catcher.
I was thoroughly captivated by this unique and well made story which to my other great surprise also happened to be true, the attempted theft of the entire state of Arizona by a schemer apparently without equal.
as if this wasn't enough he is also a knowledgeable surgeon, author, recording artist, amateur sleuth and in the due course father converted husband.
not only has he have to be insinuating himself through those arduous 93 minutes - he is also required to suffer from gall bladder removal, be fluent in hypnosis and in the art of being invisible to others in those daring final minutes when all is revealed.
He also hypnotizes Ann and has her steal the Randolph therapy session recordings and puts them in a closet in Randolph's house.
Aside from the obvious plot holes, there is also a distasteful conceit being peddled by the film's screenwriters here.
The dubious and subjective 'profession' of psychoanalysis not only is depicted as being highly 'scientific' but is also placed on par with practitioners in the medical profession.
WHIRLPOOL also features: Charles Bickford, Barbara O'Neal and Constance Collier.
Standards and practices in psychiatry and psychotherapy have changed considerably since "Whirlpool" was made and anyone watching it now will need to make allowances for this and also suspend their disbelief at a couple of the plot's more bizarre twists which come over as much less credible now than they may have seemed at the time.
Their scenes together, where he can hardly conceal his lust for Tierney and desire to break up her happy home are electric and he also gets a lengthy scene where he hypnotises himself against the excruciating after-effects of his self-conducted gall-bladder operation.
The direction is taut, the cinematography excellent, the settings convincing and I also especially appreciated the excellent use of music to dramatise key scenes.
She comes under the influence of a calculating and dangerous hypnotist played by Jose Ferrer, who not only wants to fleece her financially but also has a strong desire have her in some weird way where he can win over her husband, whom he seriously resents for his successes and recognition in his work.
It uses her blankness to advantage, and this script also gives her the pathos and confusion to vent full emotional range which is rare for her films.
(To the observant person, it also displays the flaws of her presentational acting style; as when she breaks down in a torrent of bitter tears, and looks up afterwards Â dry eyed and serene.
Charles Bickford also gives a marvelous performance in a smaller, yet layered role as the rumpled, grieving Detective.
Richard Conte is also very good as Ann's concerned husband; he knows that his wife is not guilty but he's frustrated at the lack of inaction on behalf the local police to prove her innocence.
The issues of hypnotherapy, especially with the idea that hypnosis can make people do stuff they don't want to, is also interesting.
Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they`re classed as obscene .
But La Femme Nikita, for the most part, also works on emotional levels too.
Besson won't be above throwing in a hard-boiled killer in the midst (Jean Reno's Victor, my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes, and a precursor to Leon), but he'll also subvert it just a tinge for good measure.
This isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities, if only from my perspective: the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller, yet sometimes it's also a cross between a soft-core porn and Weather channel muzak; the ending felt abrupt, or at least on a first viewing (albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile?
The Monogram Chan's, apart from falling production values, were also marked by more and more action scenes with or without cliffhanger music and less on the explanatory dialogue so necessary with the Fox's.
It's also my first for the Monogram entries, of which this one is the second.
The monkeys also make crazy faces from time to time.
I also like the fact that there is no sound when the meteor hits, but you hear the surge afterwards.
They also use good dinosaurs for the film and stick to the right era (unlike in the "Land Before Time" films, although they're good as well).
Nimbly directed by Eric Leighton and Ralph ("We're Back!ÂA Dinosaur's Story") Zondag, Dinosaur" starts with an incredible ten-minute sequences that not only sets the story into motion but also showcases the impressive advances in computer animation since "Toy Story."
It's cute, but with a very ordinary story; besides, there are some important errors here, specially in the beginning in the part of the meteor, when everything is destroyed in the Plio's island: That Impact would kill not only the lemurs,but also many of the dinos.
this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.
It also detracts from the illusion the film so effortlessly produces on the screen at the start; it all just becomes so standard an routine when it seemed to be so much more.
I was also very touched by Aladar's attempts to save the old dinos, and although I'm a grown-up, I jumped in my seat when the carnotaurs emerged.
I also enjoyed the married couples side conversations - very comical and a refreshing change from the serious situation with the gangsters.
I have to say that I find it interesting seeing the interaction between the black characters; it was very funny and also quite ahead of it's time.
The film is also a great early showcase for future talent, and although he's not really the star of the film; it isn't surprising that it's Humphrey Bogart's face that adorns the front cover.
The German tank with the American crew also explodes, but no one comes out.
He also does a great job wringing out the atmosphere as the viewer can really get the feeling that they are in this desolate cafe in the middle of nowhere with a howling wind and blowing sagebrush.
This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.
As you also see his respect for the elderly in one moment where he chastises Alan for speaking poorly to Gabby's grandfather.
The costumes and sets are also good for a made-for-TV production of this era.
Bette Davis made her film debut in 1931 in "The Bad Sister", a movie that also included Humphrey Bogart.
Tobin is also a very attractive lady!
Humphrey Bogart is also great in his breakthrough role as Duke Mantee, the notorious killer.
The supporting performances are also of note too, particularly that of the excited grandfather often ready with invented tales.
When Warner Bros. bought the film rights they wanted Howard but also wanted Edward G. Robinson for the Mantee role.
The two black actors (Thompson and Alexander) were also in the New York stage production.
Bette also has to contend with former college football star Dick Foran and his clumsy efforts at courtship.
Duke Mantee (played by Bogie in a superb, breakthrough performance) is also a relic, but from a different period, that of the Roaring Twenties.
Bette Davis is also strong as the waitress who Howard shares his secrets with.
As a result, this is noteworthy also as Bogart's big breakout movie, and it would only be a few more years before he would hit super-stardom all on his own.
Humphrey seems to put a lot into his gangster character, investing Duke with the necessary evil demeanor, yet also with a hint of heart and soul.
I also liked the actor Ian Ireland, who played Sir Henry.
Waylon Payne was equally convincing as the slightly psychopathic con-man, charming and full of bravado but also dangerously impulsive and rough.
Not only does he defeat the Sycorax leader in a well-staged sword fight, but also brings down a British Prime Minister ( Penelope Wilton ) who has had the aliens killed as they retreated from Earth ( an effective if none-too subtle dig at Margaret Thatcher's sinking of the Belgrano in the Falklands War ).
Billie Piper is also very natural as the doctor companion.
We also hear what I think are is the first reference to Torchwood.
The cast also includes the always entertaining Anthony Zerbe and William Shatner too!
This version of the classic tale deserves it's reputation as a cheap and cheesy TV movie, but it also deserves to be remembered as being hell of a lot of fun!
But there IS also considerable 'evidence' for the theory that they may have been captured by the Japanese.
I also thought Geraldine James was wonderful.
she also worked with Angelina Jolie on a number of films.
the director of this film, Reverge Anselm, also wrote and directed the execrable "Stateside".
I would like to make a negative comment also.
Then again, it was also the director's decision to include the exposition filled voice-over.
There also seemed to be forced "tender moments" that don't really resonate.
It is a rather slow movie compared to your typical Hollywood movie, but then again the story and characters are also stronger.
The rest of the cast is also truly great.
The cartoon makes fun not only of movies starring Errol Flynn (whom Daffy mentions by name), but also of everything Hollywood-related.
While Scorsese's Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas are also great films, they are so highly stylized, scored, and choreographed that they attain mythic qualities, and are shorn of much of the realism Cassavetes' filmic world inhabits.
He also depicted his society with the same level of universal realism as Yasujiro Ozu did Post-War Japan.
In watching the two versions of this film, made available as part of The Criterion Collection's five disk John Cassavetes Five Films collection- the original 135 minute 1976 release, and the 109 minute 1978 re-release, one also gets a good representation of how greatness can be achieved.
Seymour Cassell is also good as the untrustworthy and two-sided mobster who wants to take Cosmo down.
It is also an endurance test: scenes are stretched to mind-numbing length, sloppy, improvised dialogue flies by and crashes to the floor, and the bulk of the film is devoted to watching the pathetically unrealistic floor show at a strip-club/cabaret owned by Gazzara's "Cosmo" character.
Tell Me Something is also one of the only movies I've seen in the past few years that has a surprise ending that is genuinely surprising.
Part giallo, part procedural, part character study, it also has some surprisingly black-humored moments -- like the murder of one character by weight-machine, or the impossibly overstated catastrophe that follows the disposal of a victim in the middle of a highway (Hollywood 'thrillers' END with huge car crashes... this one has its big explosions in the middle, and ends with quiet horror).
the things that were definite drawbacks and did Not make sense were more mundane; the cops have a very laissez-faire attitude towards their guns(and even More annoying,each time it's an obvious Portent Of Doom :P ),those dippy cops also missed a handful of important and somewhat obvious clues at first glance(even second and third glance).
He also neglects to take down the licence plate, or, apparently, to tell the rest of the police department to look for that car in the area.
And, there are obvious nods to not only Se7en, but Silence of the lambs (1991), also, particularly the cinematography and scene construction.
In another scene, Cho is in an elevator and looks up to see bright blood dripping from the hatchway, and then also dripping down the wall; suddenly, the hatch breaks and buckets of blood cascade onto him.
In a way, I can also compare this film to the manner in which David Lynch constructs his films.
Now the characters don't develop too interestingly and also the film hasn't got any real message to deliver and thus is "only" a serial killer horror film, not much else.
Many have compared this to the US film maker David Fincher's masterful tale of wickedness living inside ourselves and our society, Seven (1995), but that film is not only visually much more stunning and brilliant than Tell Me Something but also has its message and themes to make the whole piece much bigger and more noteworthy.
The typical "traumatic childhood thing" feels also pretty stupid and like it was just fastly written to give some kind of a motivation for the killer's act.
Traumatic childhood and horrors related to it is a very serious subject matter in cinema and in a film like this, it feels a little unnecessary and also even repellent.
The positive things are also there, fortunately, and especially the few shock scenes (like the head on the seat of the car) are truly effective and done with great fast editing and merciless elements on the soundtrack.
Worth mentioning is also the "kubrickesque" elevator scene that has a remarkably effective soundtrack behind it and making it stronger.
The silent scenes and especially the face expressions and eyes of the female lead are also very impressive and once again show how much more powerful cinema can be without words, silently.
Also the scene inside some industrial building (followed by a brutal murder) is effective and uses the daytime setting, empty room and distant sounds in the sountrack very effectively and gives also a strong feel of loneliness in such a big city.
Similar scenes follow and the film also includes one of the nastiest highway multi car accidents I've ever seen, and that is definitely an unusually horrific scene!
It all comes also a little gratuitous as sometimes the real suspense and other more noteworthy horror elements suffer and leave on the background due to these easier scenes.
The film includes also one brutal killing that definitely belongs to the mentioned category of being noticably calculated.
Therefore, when Amanda runs into a Hollywood tour bus guide, Harold (Jeremy Piven) at a bar-for-the-stars, she is excited to learn that he is also a screenwriter!
The acting is also remarkable, just as the sublime black humor that surfaces once in a while and the outrageously gory moments that will leave You gasping for breath even if You've seen many gorefests before.
They also won't see the radical differences between this badly done version and her book.
I also thought Julian Rhind-Tutt captured the awkward academic Calgary very well.
But I suppose those that oppose this new series also didn't appreciate "Kiss Me Kate" as it wasn't the original Shakespeare, or the miniseries "Pride and Prejudice" because new aspects to old stories had been added.
They also did a good job of inventing the linking of Gwenda with Miss Marple.
I found all of the main characters to be very likable and also found the writing to be stellar, at worst.
The thing about this age is you also don't know how to handle heart break and that was a tough thing to learn.
I also check the tv guide weekly to see if it will be on tv at all.
Anyhow, it one of my favorite movies and it made me laugh even though it is dated it is true to how people would react in that situation, I loved the ending also.
There was also the beautiful song titled "Simply Jessie", among others.
I also watched him on Solid Gold and Pirates of Penzance.
It's not the most chatty movie going Â I often wished for more to be said between Jessie and Michael that would cement why he was also attracted to her.
Maia Danziger as the relentless flirt with Michael gives a wiggy, stoned-out performance that just makes you laugh Â because we also all knew girls that acted like that.
And I think not a little of the credit for the film's theatre-grade quality comes from the very capable, brilliant hands of the story's authors, Carole and the late Bruce Hart, who also wrote for Sesame Street.
I rented Just Write for Valentine's Day, largely due to the reviews I read on this site (my adoration of Sherilyn Fenn had a little impact, also...).
I also like the dialogue between Kirk and Spock in the briefing room when they finally put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.
I'm also not a fan of the special effects.
Sometimes I also think the actresses who voice Lucy have had too strident of voices, but Robin Kohn isn't strident enough and by far, Pamelyn Ferdin is still the best Lucy voice actress.
The songs are also, I'm afraid, not memorable.
I'm guessing also Snoopy's thinking she will appreciate him more than Charlie.
This also gives us an idea about the origins of Snoopy and his original owner Leila.
The soundtrack is also great.
Woodstock also has the loveliest whistle of all time - he really whistles beautifully!
There is also some spot humour, much of which is caused by Woodstock's erratic flying and Snoopy's constantly being taunted by the 'No dogs allowed' signs permating his venture.
There is also a huge dose of simple humanity added to this magical recipe, thus separating it from any danger of mere pedantry or instruction.
It is also missing the intro, which (if my memory serves me) had a radio announcer waxing philosophical on air, and sped up footage of car lights on busy multi-lane motorways.
It was also neat how, in order to gain life as a dinosaur, you had to eat your victims.
I'd have to say the only other game in this series to really get the nod of approval would be Jurassic Park for Sega Genesis (where you also could play as a velociraptor).
This game also features music from an amazing young composer: Michael Giacchino.
I also could not help but imagine how a film depicting the events in Iraq and the Mideast during the period of the 1990's into the present circumstances, will appear to viewers when it is seen and commented upon, at a site such as this, say, around 2050 or 2060.
Generally, I thought that Peter Redgrave as Fowler (a middle aged, jaded British journalist) and Audie Murphy as "The American" put on pretty decent performances, I appreciated the look (somewhat limited but still present) at Vietnamese culture, and I also appreciated the portrayal of the very early years of the Vietnam War, when it was still the French dealing with a Communist insurgency in what was then an integral part of their Empire.
He is duplicitous and double-dealing, but also naive in his own ways.
The way in which she is 'colonised' by first Fowler and then the American (Pyle in the novel, but not named in this film) is a comment on the way in which the foreign landscape is depicted and also on how the country has been colonised.
Despite this she is also manipulative.
I would also recommend for light relief that viewers watch the Mash Season 2 TV series in which we see Colonel Flag of the CIA raising a few loud laughs.
Due to the typically remote backwoods setting and the archetypal redneck characters, the script is also stuffed with references and little tributes towards tons of other 'Hicksploitation' movies, most notably "Deliverance", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Just Before Dawn".
It turns out that Kathleen's brother was also kidnapped and killed by the crazy family years before.
Dean is also sort of repulsed by the idea that humans are behind the disappearances.
But, unless Dean took the time to also pick the lock on the handcuff side that was still attached to the cars door, it just doesn't seem to make sense.
Episode also tries to tell us that you don't need supernatural stuff and monsters to make a scary TV show episode or a movie, humans will do just fine !
When Sam vanishes in a parking area, Dean asks for help to Officer Kathleen (Jessica Steen), whose brother also disappear a couple of years ago.
Harry Reems (who starred in the legendary "Deep Throat" the year before) is also good as the man who offers her an escape from the street life.
If they had dialled it down a kilotonne it could have been at least comparable to "A Very British Coup", which was also a lefty daydream but much more realistic.
It's also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a "cleaner," a role he made famous four years later in "Leon: The Professional."
It also had a nice horror setting; the underground subway system.
The movie always cuts right to the chase, which is also the reason why the movie itself is only 82 minutes short.
The build up also certainly isn't helped by its at time weak editing and stupid camera positioning.
The acting is unfortunately also below par.
Alix Koromzay is fine and she is also definitely helped by her looks but Bruno Campos is horrible as an extreme stereotyped New York cop.
The movie also makes some odd choices with its characters.
I remember that the first "Mimic" movie was quite fake looking in parts but I believe that also has to do with Guillermo del Toro's own unique style.
Best of all, while Emmanuelle 1 seems horribly dated today, thanks mostly to the 1970's philosophizing of the Mario character, along with the tacky theme song, the second one has dated beautifully, thanks to the truly elegant and timeless fashion choices for Kristel and the rest of the cast, and also to the gorgeous soundtrack by celebrated composer Francis Lai.
I also recommend seeing the original first; it is not as good as this one, however it is still a very good, and important film, as that is the one that started it all.
I also have a tendency to forget films fairly quickly if I haven't seen them a few times.
It's also wonderfully gory in some parts, although it's mostly bug gore, but that tends to have a higher "ewww" factor for me than human gore.
*bows to the creative genius of Kripke and co.* The reintroducal of Ava and Andy was brilliant, and they worked brilliantly against the two new characters also.
And if loosing Andy and Ava wasn't enough, we also had to say goodbye to Ash!?
(no offence meant) also round of applause for Jensen's comic timing which turns brilliant writing into fantastic delivery!
They also find new special children, Lily- who stops peoples hearts when she touches people and Jake- who seems to have super strength.
Aamir is doing very good films, and by chance Rang De Basanti was also full of touch of patriotism.
The expressions on Kajol face when she meets Rihan after having here eyes in her house not knowing him are also very good, the illusion she has is nicely filmed.
Rishi Kapoor, Kiron Kher & Tabu have also been impressive as usual.
Lyrics are very melodious and the music is also very good that gifts us the hit song of the month "Chand..."
We should not support these types of movies, if we are really Indians and we supports our nation then we need to burn the movie and also the actors they played in this movie.
Because of inefficient and always loving characters our ancestors we lost our great India now also we are doing do same mistake and we going to loose our India one day.
In fact the final struggle is also similar.
It's also about making the right choices, and listening to your heart, which is cheesy but kind of true.
Zooni travels to Delhi with her friends, who are also her dance troupe, for a performance, and secretly hopes to bump into love on the way.
I though Aamir was very good also but just could not match her.
'Dekho Naa' is also worth a mention, I loved the way it was used to create a romantic mood.
The tittle song from Kank he also sang brilliantly but he sang this song even better.
I would also give Sonu for best playback singer from Tere Haath mein Mera haath ho.
I would also give the award for best story and dialogs .
The ending sequence was also brilliantly handled .
also recommended to those who want to see real and Believable and emotional performance.
It also asks, importantly, how much can love forgive?
The viewers will also enjoy a ride of convincing and innovative action sequences.
It was also unusual for a blind Muslim girl like Zooni (Kajol) to indulge into a physical relation with Rehan (who did not pledge any commitment to their relation) so early.
In addition, this is Kajol's first film after a self-imposed hiatus, while Aamir Khan, paired with her here for the first time, is also seen infrequently on screen due to his reputed fastidiousness in choosing movie projects.
Differing perspectives of nationalism and terrorism are exploredÂone man's terrorist act may also be looked at as a fight for an independent homelandÂas well as conventional familial and romantic relationships.
I also noticed that there is no plot or storyline.
The movie experience was almost like getting sucked into a novel possibly a modern day Camus perhaps.The story also perhaps was focusing on the lack of a social support structure in modern societies.
On the other hand, it might also broaden your view of yourself and the world, and impress you again with the fact that no one is weird; people simply are.
I probably would also be distracted by the growling sharks.
I also have a toy shark that squeaks.
People who loved this movie will also love:  ~Open Water II (make sure you watch it on an old TV, because will be throwing things at it) ~Shark attack 3 - Megaladon (contains one of the most amazing pick-up lines ever)  I will give it a 3.
As well as killer sharks they had an alien plot and an assassin twist to it so that made the film the same as the others but also a little bit different at the same time.
One that apparently also provides them with super powers, like the ability to growl while they are under water.
I must also say that the Sharks in this film growl & roar like Lions or Tigers which is plainly just absurd & makes the already pathetic attack scenes unintentionally funny.
And remember as you come to the conclusion that there is a lesson here: There are literal Raging Sharks, but there are also metaphorical Raging Sharks: Humans.
To this point I rated "hotd" worst movie I've ever seen but also most funniest movie I've ever seen and great for enjoying some cold beer with friends and making fun about errors and bad acting.
I also got the feeling that some important things were left out.
It was also full-screen, and I suspect it looked a lot better in widescreen given that it deals with wide things like trains, and bridges and so on; the color was nice.
Flavorful music by Loren Newkirk also really hits the spot; the film does slow down ever so slightly at some points, but successfully maintains a sense of urgency, as the cops are never really far behind.
"Jackson County Jail" qualifies as one of those great legendary rarities: it's a 70's redneck drive-in exploitation movie that not only delivers the goods and then some, but also the kind of gritty, top-notch, fairly plausible flick that both wholly earns and completely lives up to its killer cult status.
Loren Newkirk's melancholy, harmonica-heavy, nicely down-home country score, the often razor-sharp dialogue (when Yvette tells Jones to be careful when he faces off with the pigs at the film's thrilling conclusion, Jones responds with this choice fatalistic retort: "I was born dead anyway"), the unsparingly bleak and harsh downbeat nightmarish tone, and especially Bruce Logan's agile, polished cinematography (the use of hand-held camera for Jones' climactic face-off with the law really does the stirring trick) are all also highly impressive.
The film also benefits from the reality lent by the dilapidated and run down buildings in the various towns shown in the movie, rather than the cheesy 'gunsmoke" type sets that are normally seen in films of this genre and time.
There have also given punch and excitement to the presentation, something which works equally well for action sequences like the tense final standoff, as it does for dramatic scenes, such as the verbal showdown between Mary Brian and Helen Ware.
This is one of the most legendary lines in Western movie history as exchanged between Gary Cooper and Walter Huston (Cecil B. DeMille's 1914 version also has a variation of this dialogue in the intertitles).
There's also the amusingly gravelly voiced Eugene Palette as Honey, one of Cooper's friends.
Joan gives a great performance as usual, of course Joseph is also perfect as the man she falls in love with at the same time saving her life.
My categorized comment about the whole movie is like this  Acting : 3.0/4 Direction : 0.5/1 Screenplay : 0.7/1 Cinematography : 0.9/1 Sound : 0.8/1 Music, Dance n Song : 2.0/2  in all 7.9/10  All in all it is a very good musical movie, actually its songs are very good and also the choreography is exceptionally good.
dixit has come back with great style... one wud expect otherwise because of the years spent abroad and the difference in culture, also influencing a person over time.
she apparently is still Indian, and I'm glad :) i'd give this movie a ten out of ten, because the acting is great and also the dance..
Aaja Nachle also fails to inspire, it fails to indulge you into the lives of the characters.
"Tara Ra Rum Pum, Jhoom Barabar, Laga Chunari Mein Daag and Aaja Nachle also fails to live up to the expectation.
All the supporting actors have also performed very well.
"The first opening shot sets the tone of the movieÂ its about dance, music, art and also it is about happiness, love, culture, goodness in human beings.
Also the child artist who plays the role of dia's daughter is also good.
What people also forget is the wonderful ensemble cast this movie has.
The songs are also pleasant and fit in perfectly with the pace of the film,not once do you feel that they are out of place.
Divine and David Lochary put in fine performances and Mink Stole is also awesome with the rest of the cast effective too.
for an independent film, this movie not only touches on familiar conflicts in life (such as trying to make life not "suck"), it also has a somewhat sarcastic flair that would make anyone smile.
My cousin told me that they were filming another movie in Lebanon (also the location where a medical movie was made, but I can't remember what it's called).
I remember also meeting Jessica Wesson.
It also strongly point's out that a "book should not be judged by it's cover".
The background score is also tremendously strong and emotional.
They also have the poor girl married off and going to India (Some traditional family from India will ask for her hand) which doesn't make much sense because it seems to defeat the very purpose of uprooting the entire family from India.
The setting of the place also blended very well in the story.
Kal Ho Na Ho is directed by Karan Johar's associate director Nikhil Advani and produced by Karan Johar, who has also written the screenplay for the film.
To Eureopean tastes, and probably also to American tastes, many aspects of the movie seem to be implausible.
You have managed to create what I didn't think was possible in todays world-- a Bollywood film that makes you laugh, cry, feel sad and yet happy at the same time, and also doesn't make you ashamed to take your non-indian friends to.
They now make perfect sense (in the same way that the songs of KKHH also improved after watching the movie)  The look of the film, the humour, the choreography, the set direction, the cinematography, the everything of this movie are outstanding.
Aman knows he cannot be with Naina so he tries to serve as a matchmaker between Naina and... Rohit, who also fell in love with her!
Its set in NY, and its has Western culture blended into it also.
The hugely talented Jean-Hughes Anglade (of Betty Blue fame) shines in this film but of all the male roles, Jean Reno (also fabulous in Luc Besson's Leon)is outstanding as the completely unbalanced Victor The Cleaner.
He is also a typical Gujarati, whose father (Satish Shah) runs a business called Dial A Dhokla.
Jaya Bacchan is also worth a mention.
The sound is also impressive.
Saif Ali Khan is also incredible.
Kuch To Hua hai is also much better on screen.
:-o - I also particularly enjoyed the running joke about Aman and Rohit being a homosexual couple - one could indeed ask oneself who is really in love with who here?
It's also perhaps significant that it is Rohit rather than Naina who stays with Aman to the last.
This is a movie Bollywood had been long waiting for.... a perfect ROmantic movie with Comedy and Family values... Great ENough to entertain the entire family... Not just the American-Indians but also the Gujratis, Panjabis, Christian-Indians and all the Indian population and the Indian movie lovers.....  Kal ho na ho is a MASSIVE entertainer... i know its 3 hours long but still every minute of it is PUT to correct use.... this movie proves in every way that it is better for Hindi movies to stay Hindi with u know reasonable drama comedy songs dance and all that.I am not saying that Hindi movies should not make movies like Maqbool and other serious movies...
Claire also has a "wild" friend Valerie.
There is also the matter of Rebecka's costar for the film, Jake Fields (Jeremy Sisto).
:-) There's also a reporter on their tails with blackmail material and lets not forget the cold blooded agent/mum of Liz.
The acting also detracted from developing a potentially great theme.
It was also known as DEAD EVEN..
Bethany also wants to make sure that the hot and heavy work Jack's doing in his love scenes with Rebecca on the set are strictly professional and nothing more, ha ha ha.
There's also a number of people in and around the movie set that end up getting brutally murdered including both Rebbeca's mom and Jake's wife.
Rebecca early in the movie drives out to a nearby town and picks up the local bar/saloon stud who also ends up dead with his throat slashed, was this her way of perfecting her acting as a serial murderess?
We also see the ghost of the real Belle Gunness, Loana Prvelescu, pop up every now and then in the movie giving Rebecca tips and advice in killing off her cast members in the film.
There is a predictable ending to "Belle", and a surprise ending to "Method", which is also predictable.
The second series was filmed in Cornwall, UK where there is also a village called Hersham consisting of six houses while the main Hersham has population of some 18,000 people.
I really hope that a 3rd series comes along soon and I also hope that the Americans when making their version do not miss the vital comic dark moments!
Angus Deayton is also superb as Don Cole, who is facing a very difficult situation, as is Rebecca Front as Cathy, a really sympathetic character that we constantly feel sorry for.
Hobbes also gains an unlikely companion in Michael Pinnocchio who robs him of his wedding ring minutes after entering Harsh Realm and continuously threatens to eat Hobbes' dog, Dexter.
The episode also features two well known cameos for fans of Carter's other more popular shows The X-Files and Millennium.
I'm also surprised that no other network picked it up and continued it...
You can also purchase it new from National store chain Best Buy for about $30.00 I hope my description helped you in deciding if you wanted to purchase or view this show.
If you liked this one donÂ´t miss "Joy Ride" starring also Leelee Sobieski, trust me you won't be disappointed.
Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi.
86+ hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia/action stories, but also to be a great family drama, a shocking character study, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil, and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one.
Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer, he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of "Saturday Night Live" skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates.
The series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary (usually violence and foul language).
Seasonal extras are also worth note including names like Steve Buscemi (great!
Prior to this she also squanders a million opportunities to escape or blab to the authorities, but instead chooses to make things difficult for herself by only trying to do eiterh of those things when nasty Stellan Skarsgard is around.
I also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel-voiced Dom Chianese as the bewildered but murderous Uncle Junior, silver-haired Tony Sirico as the perpetually perplexed Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the duplicitous, tough-as-nails Carmela Soprano.
Every episode also features Tony's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano (Edie Falco).
I also love the Malaprop's.
This show is also very versatile.
Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy.
But it's also one of the most fun.
But I also couldn't pull away from it, I never took my eyes off the screen the entire time the movie was played.
Ruby Baker and Rhett Baker's parents die in a car accedent and have to go and live with the glass's and they also inherit a lot of money.
The excellent production design, cinematography and poignant music moved the story forward, but while I loved this subject matter, I also felt the transitions between three very distant locations caused the film to feel somewhat disjointed.
In addition, the way the arms-smuggling angle was covered was also very deftly handled.
i enjoyed this movie.it has suspense,action,drama,and decent acting.it has a pretty dark tone to it,which i liked.while it have the same high octane adrenaline rush of "Joy Ride" which also starred Leelee Sobieski and also came out the same year,it's still pretty good in its own right.there's more of a slow build up to tension in this movie.i also think this movie demands a bit mote of its actors,especially for the the quiet dramatic moments.the cast acquit themselves fairly well here.the movie is fairly well written,though not wholly original(but there are some original elements to it)for me "The Glass House" is an 8/10
We are also introduced and/or reminded of the ugly side of humanity as to why certain countries will never be able to have peace because people are just too selfish fighting out their own agendas to spare any thought for another person.
Not only does he sell the newborn man, but he also makes you feel a certain sense of sorrow for him.
In this one like Keanu in Matrix, Rufus also possesses the power of the changers, somehow lacks the brightness, smartness of Matrix.
They find out much to their surprise that Rufus can also 'tune in' like themselves.
They soon discover that john also has this ability, which is impossible as it would take a normal human a few lifetimes to gain the ability to "tune".
This film also raises several important questions about Kiefer Sutherland.
Our hero is also followed by an honest detective, Insp.
Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does.
He has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to "tune", which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone.
Which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end.
The strangers' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity.
Not only was Dark City first, it also handles the subject much better and more adult than Matrix.
Not only does this film deal with reality, it also deals with humanity, something which lacks Matrix.
The film is also very well put together technically.
There are also terrific performances turned in by Glenn Close as the Vice President who deals with the terrorist's demands, and Gary Oldman in a scary piece of acting as the lead terrorist.
The other actors in the movie do a good job also.
It has its thrilling sequences, the story is okay, a bit suspense, and the end is also okay.
I also must admit that I watched only 30 minutes of this piece of garbage.
Bush has also gone on record many times for not negotiating with terrorists and takes a hardline approach similar to Harrison Ford.
It also presents documentary evidence of things we were mislead about.
It is also inhabited by the sole survivor of an earlier expedition, Henry Brandon.
It's made with some skill; director Virgil Vogel was also at the helm of other fantastical films from the era such as "The Mole People" and "Terror in the Midnight Sun".
Enjoyable, yes...but also bad in many ways.
She also, in true 1950s form, appeared to be narcoleptic, as she fainted on three occasions!!
Others are also Good.
'Memories in the mist'by Dasgupta artistically and metaphorically inter-wovens the memories and fantasies of a man of his beloved and lost father.Set in the backdrop of North Kolkata,the story paces to and fro between past and present,between reality and imagination,between innocence and lucre!Amongst the numerous metaphors used in the movie,the one which cant be helped mentioning is the reference of the piper which beckons the man to his past,his childhood and his unfulfilled dreams.With this movie,Dasgupta has also endeavored to find the base of our relationships.At the end of the film,the man reveals himself to his father and thus to the audience,and thus forces us to remind of Apu who would,despite hostility as conferred by fate,love and wonder!That is probably the reason some critic has mentioned it as'the closest modern equivalent'to a Ray movie.But whatever international applaud it gets,it may not get along too well with the Bengali audience because of its sheer lack of bangaliyana(Bengali traditions and customs)as compared to a new wave cinema by Ray or Ghatak.
But, bleak elements aside, this was also a pretty funny film as well.
The other actresses are also good, and most of the scenes they share together are enjoyable to watch.
I've also seen 'Thevar Magan' & its Hindi remake 'Virasat', but they were different.
This time there is also the sea and an aeroplane flying right outside the open window.
I had read also in the trivia section for Shawshank that Alfonso Freeman had several cameo's in Shawshank, and when I saw his name appear on screen in Sharktank, I thought I would enjoy him.
The guy in Tim Robbins role was also a very close likeness.
It's funny, yes but it's also very touching and very well made.
And all those kids on there are also very fortunate to grow up in a loving environment, too bad so many people in the outside world don't see that.
They also call each other "dude" a lot.
"The Glass House" also provides a fresh, unique outlook on villains.
I also have seen at least four cars over here in England that look like Herbie and have various 'HERBIE' personalised licence plates and markings.
I had seen it before, except I just didn't remember much about it, and my friend loved it a lot, so I knew it was going to be good when I was in for a re-watch.It turned out to be very cute and humorous at times, and Herbie was so sweet and cool as well.They also did a good job at building their characters, for all of them were really likable and nice.
The film also never gives questions it doesn't answer.
It also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he's-not-really dead ending.
It's got laughs and also plenty of heart and soul.
One criticism I have of the later movies is that I would like to have seen Herbie stay with his original owner Jim Douglas, and follow his adventures with that family rather than see him owned by lots of different people - partly because Jim, Tennessee and Carol are great owners for Herbie, but also because how does the poor little car feel being passed from owner to owner?!
It also shows that Sandra can act (unlike one of her peers Julia Roberts).
But his character also went from bad to worse in a quick turn of events.
The engaging story is a sort of complement of "Hotel Rwanda" and "Shooting Dogs", focused in the romance of a Canadian journalist and a Tutsi waitress, but disclosing also the genocide of the Tutsis in the landscape of a troubled Rwanda while the West simply ignored and turned back to the fate of millions of people.
Luc Picard has a magnificent performance that would deserve a nomination to the Oscar, if this award was really concerned with great movies and performances; the gorgeous Fatou N'Diaye has also an awesome performance in the role of Gentille.
They're Bankhead's initials, of course, "Connie Porter", but they also hint at "Communist Party."
The film was also nominated for Best Cinematography from Glen Macwilliams and Original Motion Picture Story for John Steinbeck.
The other characters (William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Heather Angel, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee) also have their quirks - and secrets.
OK, YES, this IS one of the greatest chamber-pieces of all time, set on the open ocean no- less, but also...
The movie, while wonderfully developing its own nine characters, also raises questions aimed at the viewer, pointedly questioning how each one of us would react in those certain situations.
John Steinbeck's story was cleverly adapted by Jo Swerling, although it appears Ben Hecht was also a collaborator in the screen play.
Walter Slezak's performance is also equally satisfying.
It also had the benefit of a cast of recognizable supporting players, most of whom had appeared in countless "B" westerns.
The film is set in World War IIÂ An Allied ship was sunk by a German U-boat and a mixed bunch of survivors got away in the lifeboatÂ The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboatÂ   At first they were prepared to throw him overboard Â but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took commandÂ Unknown to the others, he was stealing their rations to keep up his strength, and directing them towards a rendez-vous with a German supply shipÂ  Tallulah Bankhead, incidentally, dominated the acting of the whole fine cast except possibly Walter Slezak, as the NaziÂ As the woman journalist, keeping close to her material possessions, and only emotionally more friendly, she gave a performance with the power and the pain of a thirty feet salt waveÂ  It is ironic that the film's propaganda message, which I believe weakened and over-simplified it, was widely misunderstood at the timeÂ Hitchcock intended to show at that stage of the war that the democracies should settle their differences and unite forces against the common enemy, who was disciplined, strong, and knew just where he was goingÂ Instead, a lot of people attacked the film for showing the strongest character as the Nazi!
also, very few of the films are even analyzed or even discussed in any depth.
But it also reveals how versatile genre is, and so we have the best ever critique of Thatcherism (with Harold Shand an embodiment of entrepeneurial culture, beset by the same problems that would dog the Tories (IRA, Americans, drugs etc), but also a hangover from the Welfare State in his misplaced loyalties - this schizophrenia tears him apart); a great London film, with an insightful sense of change and place, and meanings bound up in different spaces; and an extraordinary character study cum love story, which becomes an existential journey in the Bressonian mould.
The rest of the cast is truly excellent also from Helen Mirren's performance as Shand's  business-like wife, to PH Moriarty's role as one hell of an enforcer aptly  nicknamed "razors", this movie really does send a chill down your spine.
It's probably also uncharitable to point out that Shand is a bit too old school to be taken seriously as a gangland emperor and it's not helped by umpteen films and TV dramas since then showing the London underworld who don't hurt women or kids and who don't grass .In other words it's all a bit clichÃ©d this gangster lark innit ?
DMDWP was also one of the rare occasions where he had the opportunity to flex his considerable skills as a writer.
Moriarty) "...from little acorns" (referring to kids who extort car valeting money from Hoskins)...the actor went on to play gangster boss Harry in Lock, Stock...Harry also being the name of Hoskins character.
The movie is also a detective's mystery.
On the next level, this movie is called The Long Good Friday, because it is also a religiously symbolic movie.
Interesting also as a historical snapshot of a period in London's history (the redevelopment of the Docklands) now gone.
His world is also introduced to us through very good use of London iconography as we realise he's rich, got plenty of friends and also has a good looking girl; with his biggest problem seeming to be what nationality to make the chef for his next get-together.
What's also good about the film as well as fascinating is that it takes a certain detective route.
It is also very interesting to observe him as his grip upon his gangster empire on brink of creating a partnership across the Atlantic slips through his fingers because of a mistake.
I also admit that going in I knew that the combo of Steve Martin with Carl Reiner's direction it was going to be somewhat silly but wow, it was done wonderfully..AND again I had a fun time.
Richards' comments are just insightful about Berry, the influence of Berry's music, and the influence of Johnson of Berry's songs; they're also fascinating in just watching and listening to Richards himself - part mystic, part philosopher, part drunk.
Again, too much "talking heads" between the music, but the point of the rehearsals (we're told, but can also see), is to witness the incredible coming together of the band as they learn to play with each other.
Robertson also mis-reads Chuck (I thought it was pretty funny), when he calls Chuck's second prison term, "running into a brick wall".
Robertson also seems amazed that Chuck never took drugs.
In this tribute, there are also many interviews and archive footages with Chuck Berry's parents and siblings, and artists like Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bruce Springsteen, Roy Orbinson, Keith Richards, The Everly Brothers, John Lennon, Eric Clapton among others.
There are many compliments, praise and recognition of his magnificent work from the interviewees; however there are also many obscure moments that deconstruct the idol.
It was also the same year the Berry was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in it's inaugural class.
As a producer he also did the documentary When We Were Kings.
The great Mark Benton was also excellent.
Also, the end of the movie is also stupid, with the thugs turning out to be brainless.
He also has a knack for hanging out with all the real artists while they do good things that he mocks with his bad products.
So to be honest this movie was not only full of super hot, some of which get fully naked (yes inclusive with cock shots), but it was also believable, enjoyable and ridiculously funny to the point that I was screaming.
I also found it surprisingly well-paced (due, I'm sure, to the new writer/director who apparently learned a thing or two about tempo and rhythm from years of working as an editor).
Michael Mann, director of Heat, has assured direction here, he knows what he's doing, and he does it well, his script for The Insider is also well thought-out and amazingly clever.
When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut.
We're also hit right off the top by the irony underlying everything.
The battle between Bergman and CBS, also under pressure from the industry not to air the story, and vulnerable due to the network's impending sale, is well portrayed.
Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor.
Al Pacino also gave an excellent performance.
It also goes to show that the best movies are almost always based on true stories.
I agree on most of the Oscar Nominations, but I also feel that maybe an Oscar was warranted for best screenplay which is probably the best part of this motion picture.
This film also is one of the reasons I had issues with the movie "Forrest Gump" winning an Oscar for special effects.
It is also believable and entirely convincing.
There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman, giving them depth and human dimension.
Michael Mann is the film's director, who also directed the 1995 thriller "Heat" starring Val Kilmer, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino.
Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography, taking the view of the character, and close up shots.
I do think that the movie also had the worst reputation ever by the viewers.
It also has some hysterical visuals (Martin's balletic dodge of Alan Ladd's bullet).
I also found it absurd to define a true story been filmed as a teenagers daydreams.
Thanks to Serdar Akar for his plain directing and also would like congratulate Serdar Orcin for his great play as a psychopath.
The film does not have the virtuosity of Haneke, but it also does not have Haneke's patronising, barely disguised sermons against bourgeoisie.
It is also damn good at explaining the influence of this system on different parts of the society.
This movie depicts human relations.It shows the inevitable gaps between people and like the movie "Babel" it also shows how important communication is; because most of the things throughout the movie happen because of lack of communication.
It also questions the judicial system in Turkey.
But I also like Lindsay, Sam, Bill, Neal, Nick and Ken and the other Geeks.
They also did well to cast teenagers who actually look like teenagers, almost unheard of in the world of " One Tree Hill" " Gossip Girl" etcetera.
He also interestingly alternates with Linda Cardenelli in the role of the straight man.
Bear in mind that I was in high school about the same time that this story takes place, I am about the same age (and gender) as the show's creators, and I also grew up in the same area, at least the same area as Judd Apatow, the executive producer.
I am also a freak and a geek watching a show that is basically a love letter to freaks and geeks.
Before Judd Apatow was famous for directing great films such as "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" and before producing "superbad" and other comedy films, he made the TV series "Freaks and Geeks".I used to watch this show back when it was on during 1999 and 2000 but I was young so I didn't understand all the references and jokes.Watching it now I understand all the jokes and find the show to be an interesting and accurate portrayal of high school life.The show has all the high school cliques such as Geeks,Jocks etc.There is also a good mix of comedy and drama.The show also jump started the careers for many of the cast members such as James Franco(spiderman) and Seth Rogen(knocked up).If you can find this show anywhere like in syndication or something, watch it!.
Just as Undeclared, which also got canceled after one season, this show is a stroke of genius which every fan of a good TV-show and yet every fan of something good at all, should watch.
While it was canceled by NBC after its first run, it also happens to be, in my opinion, one of the finest shows that they have ever committed to the small screen.
It also allows for some drama as Lindsay's parents are concerned about the direction their daughter's life is taking.
Sure, many might feel some of the comedy falls flat, but I think Martin(..and Ward & Carl Reiner who also directed)is perfectly cast.
The show also rises above most of its competition due the talent of its cast.
But the show also manages to pack in some humor without being a laugh-track fest like "That '70s Show".
Freaks and Geeks also gives us two of the great television characterizations that I've ever seen, Bill, played by Martin Starr, and Nick, played by Jason Seigel.
I cannot say that this would be why other television series surrounding high school would also be canceled.
It might also be that the show was never given a fair chance.
I would also like to say while I adored nearly every character on the show (except for Nick who's obsession with Lindsay transformed him into not only a bizarre, but a boring character), I thought Martin Starr was the best as the witty Bill Haverchuck (I love his Bionic Woman bit when he is getting his costume ready in the Halloween episode).
He always tried his best to be a good friend to everyone and, he always had some of the funniest lines in th show (Joe Flaherty, as Sam's dad, also had a bunch of good one-liners).
And, while he was not in the show but sporadically, I also loved 'Harris,' the Geek mentor who always seemed so confident about everything.
Purists might be shocked to see classics cannibalized for a comedy of all things but I feel there is also a reverence angle that can be introduced to the argument.
It also can intensify exposure to a larger mass audience and thus promoting growth.
It's also a very funny watch.
But it's also vastly different.
A liar, also.
Not only were they a pair of human gateposts, but they also lacked conviction, talent and any kind of visual appeal.
There are also some cameos by Carvey and Glover A light film.
Nicolas Cage is also fine as Sean's goof-off buddy, yet the slim screenplay hasn't enough meat on its bones and the middle portion of the film goes around in circles.
Personally I also liked Henry's father, who had his own way of giving fatherly advice to his soon, but clearly also understood what he went through.
And also keep an eye out for a young Michael Madsen.
So, mostly because of the acting (and in some part also the fun to see well-known actors in the beginning of their careers)   8/10
This was a modern-day version of a 1940s narrative gangster film, also known as film noir, but with a different twist.
I would probably recommend it to my wurst enemy...  What ever you do don't watch this movie.. it's not only the wurst Science fiction ever seen it's also the wurst movie ever...
It also helps that Miklos Rozsa was the man composing the music, as everything shows a cohesiveness that is hard to distinguished in what was shot in 1982 and the old movies.
Universal also gave him veteran action director Raoul Walsh and a supporting cast that knew its way around the set of a western.
John Wesley Hardin(1853-1895), one of the most notorious of bad men in the old west was also one of the few who actually got to put his story down for posterity.
The movie also had solid special effects.
The comic relief in the later half also reminds us (after some darker parts) that this film is not to be taken seriously at all.
device turns out to be an important part of the plot and also seems to be a way of using the strangling scene that is taken from the Bette Davis movie - it is also a chance for Steve to get in a very tiny element of his 'wild and crazy guy' persona, which he substituted with a more suitable [for parody] 'straight' performance).
Now, this is not near close to the worst movie I have seen, I have seen far, far, far worse, but it is also quite far from the best movies.
***SPOILER*** I also appreciate how he is never vanquished by the end of the movie.
But it also stands on its own much more than some similiar Nightmare knockoffs (Leprechaun comes to mind, in fact this film plays like a much more effective Leprechaun 4: Lep in the Hood).
Unfortunately there are also parts that are just plain stupid and other parts that are gross just for the sake of being gross.
It also has plenty of things that are clichÃ© then there is the racially clichÃ©.
It's also very funny.
A group of teen wanna-be DJ's (who also just happen to be the children of Bones' old associate) decide to fix up the mansion and turn it into a happening nightclub.
This movie is not the worst of horror movies that I have seen, however it is far from the best also.
R.Dickerson who also directed the not so good but entertaining "tales from the Crypt: Evil Knight" assured that this movie had elements from Italian horror cinema, I donÂ´t know but perhaps there is one: The warms.A homage to Lucio Fulci?, I know there is many homages here but it is the same for other movies and the cocktail is far from being so effectively combined as here.I donÂ´t think they are going to make a sequel, but I am looking forward eagerly the next movie from this director and I wish "Resident Evil" was so satisfactory.
He also doesn't have a glamorous job (I mean, really, who knows any gay men like that?)
It also portrays every gay man as a vicious queen.
My online search indicates that the series is also available via interlibrary loan from Idaho State University.
ALIEN WITHIN showed on TV and came out on video from a small outfit, MNTX, which also released Brett McCormick's MACON COUNTY WAR (with Dan Haggerty).
The photo is also very nice, this movie remained me the spirit of the 60's, how the teens were at the time.
The show also stars Sheryl Lee (John Carpenter's Vampires, Twin Peaks) as Miguel's coke-addict wife who aside from being his wife is also his and his other associate's lawyer.
The mini-series also has the story from the D.E.A.
It is also true that today the blood bath seems to be many times worse than when the movie was filmed.
Agent Flores and Miguel's wife, Marlene, were also both very appealing, as strong, independent female characters who have their own complexities and motivations, rather than being overshadowed by the male characters.
Written by Robert Sherman and directed by James Frawley, the film also sports a great Patrick Williams' score.
This movie also ain't no documentary and its something that is somewhat between a full length movie and a fake-documentary, like "Nanook of the North".
The movie is also supported by a really nice musical score by Virgil Thomson.
it's also possible that his venture into feature films came after he reached his peak.
All the actors appear to be locals - this adds authenticity, but also presents a problem in that they are not greatly skilled when it comes to delivering their lines.
I also found myself switching opinions on who Loxi should be with--Sea man John Wayne or Lawyer Ray Milland.
Speaking of Morris, I had just watched him in Cry Wolf where he also plays a prep school student and his character seems to have walked out of that slasher movie into this one.
This movie has a great cast that includes Ray Milland, John Wayne, Paulette Goddard, Raymond Massey and also Susand Hayword and Charles Bickford in small roles.
The two youngsters also learn, that despite losing everything, in this new world, having each other is their most important possession.
I also love the fact that this film is dealing with more than just destruction.
Unfortunately the film also has two serious, but not fatal problems.
It's also hard to follow at times, and leaves a lot of loose ends.
The narrative is so gummy, at first I couldn't figure out if the building was also used as a hotel, or if Leigh's character was planning on living there full-time.
Credit should be given, also, to the set design with it's seedy candy apple red painted cinder block walls, stark bare light switches and yards of metal conduit lining long hallways off of which open rows of cribs which we come to realize housed all sorts of perversions.
We learn that her uncle not only pandered to and reveled in those same perversions but was also willingly sacrificed his own life by enslavement to those same twisted desires and actions.
This was a timely and bold film, also, because it dealt squarely with the oncoming invasion of the heterosexual world by AIDS at a time when most straight folk still believed themselves immune.
They also highlight her courage in trying to make it on her own in a world ready to accept that she is merely weak-minded and unable to cope.
The film, which is better directed than it is written, should be seen simply for Leigh's performance but is also a stylish little horror film with a few genuinely scary moments.
It was probably inspired by the two Polanski films; and Catherine Deneuve's "Repulsion" character was also named Carol.
I should also say that a group of 20 16-17 year olds watched it and we had 4 girls up for most of the night as the film seemed a little scary but the DVD comes with a cut version which may be more appropriate.
I would also recommend seeing it with a group of people, because it's very interesting to gauge everyone's different reaction right after viewing the film, there's sure to be opinions ranging from emphatic agreement to stern disapproval, but that's what's great about it.
It's also pretty cool to see the main villains being crafted with various deadly weapons and different personalities.
Classic martial arts movie scenes like the bamboo forest also get featured in this movie, though the forest did look a bit sparse, since it was filmed in a sound stage.
The relationship between Fang and his wife is also highlighted, with both Wang Yu and Chiao Chiao performing well.
The Technicolor treatment is certainly one reason, but I'm also hooked on DeMille's better films(In spite of several other fine '39 westerns, "Union Pacific" is my clear favorite for that year).
It is also commonly compared to Wayne's latter film,"The Wake of the Red Witch", which I have not seen, but is said to be largely a reworked version of the present film.
I also enjoyed Lynne Overman's portrayal of Captain Phil, a classic old salt and grandfatherly figure.
She also sings that alphabet song.
But as Elephant Man showed us, he is also a master director, who can control himself and a major production to perfection.
As Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Dr showed us, Lynch's world can also be lots of fun.
There is also enough action to satisfy kids and adults, and the film is effective especially in conveying the harsh realities of children living in the depression.
The performances were also astounding.
John Cusack is also impressive as the drifter who tries to convince Natty that the open road is no place for a young girl.
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
A young Susan Hayward also showed her stuff with Robert Preston.
The cast features Meredith Salenger, John Cusack, Ray Wise and Scatman Crothers who all put in terrific performances (special mention also goes out to Jed the dog who plays Natty's wolf companion).
This movies also boasts some incredible outdoor photography and a memorable music score by James Horner.
When Natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by Harry(John Cusack), who is also riding the rails.
It's funny to see Tom and Jerry tormenting each other at times, but sometimes it can also be revolting.
It also has good artwork, despite the fact that its backgrounds are nothing special or exotic.
Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia also star.
De Palma, who is also known for directing the classic bloodfest known as "Carrie", wisefully mixes in the sequences that either have action or Hitchcock-like suspense and squeezes in the ethinc conflict (Italians and Irish).
De Palma also makes Ness' work seem more personal, because he has a wife and children for whom to care.
The other actors are also well-cast, especially Robert De Niro, who is famous for his mobster roles.
As in most of the films that he scores, the music becomes an essential part of the work; not only do certain scenes become firmly implanted in your mind, but also his music for each scene.
It also could have been the first gangster film i ever saw.
the performances are also impecable too with sean conerey's secne taking,giving him a much deserved oscar.
A mention should also go to ennio moricone's wonderful score and stephen h burum's elegent cinematography making you believe you are in the 1930s.
She travels to Charleston to defend Jack and convince the ship owner to give the position of captain of the new steamship of the company, manipulating the powerful shipping company lawyer Steve Tolliver (Ray Milland), who also falls in love for her.
The lines are also excellent, having right doses of humor.
This type of format can be very entertaining in the medium of film also provided that producers and directors are honest with the audience and do not deliberately mislead viewers into thinking they are watching something that resembles real history.
Movie fans can enjoy this film at the level of entertainment alone and not worry about the bad history but for one problem where the first defect also intrudes on the acting.
Make no mistake, the real Al Capone was an amoral monster who ordered the murder of many people who got in his way and civilians were hurt also.
Also memorable is Billy Drago as Capone's most psychopathic henchman Frank Nitti (not only does he get some powerful scenes; he also dies the most extraordinary death in the whole film).
The story is, as most people know, loosely based on the actual events during the prohibition era in USA in the 1920s (the story is also based very, very loosely on the series that go by the same name) which to some extent means that what we see on the screen is real making the characters and general story seem that much more believable.
This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in.
To add to the realism of the film the dialog is also very memorable and there are some great one-liners including some of my all time favorites in this film.
Not only does he steal every scene he is in but he also brings the certain indescribable something to the character that he always does and in every situation you feel with him (as you do in all his films whether he is a villain or a hero).
He also got a well deserved Oscar for his performance.
The film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made.
It is also odd seeing Wayne (on his way to super-stardom after STAGECOACH, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME, and DARK COMMAND) in a supporting role, as was Hayward.
Ving Rhames's character is also from Atlantis who tries to teach AC (Aquaman's stupid carryover monicker from Smallville).
I don't want to give too much away, but another character - McCaffery (who will try and convince Arthur of his true destiny), soon reveals himself, and Arthur will also encounter a creature from the deep.
The directing also needs to improve...Emotionally it's "tacky."
They also tie in a lot about missing people in the Bermuda Triangle and how these people return.
The battling of the sea creature named Nadia is also a cool plus.
John Stockwell and Michael Dudikoff star as two private dicks who emerge from a fallout shelter in the future after the bomb has dropped, once there we witness our two heroes fight mutants, midgets, cannibal hippies and a terrorist group, they've also grown up on 50's style literature and music so their whole "Gee whiz" attitude contradicts the mean world outside.
Stockwell is also very bad, but he's a veteran of terrible movies and his presence always guarantees badness.
Though undeniably enjoyable, the popular poliziottesco subgenre - which proliferated in Italy throughout the 1970s - is also frustrating because one can never tell the quality of a specific title until one has watched it himself (this is mainly due to the fact that this type of film has been largely dismissed by the critics, while at the same time turned into a cult by fans): the thing is that a handful of titles definitely merit a critical re-appraisal, while many others are overrated by the aficionados.
The film is clearly inspired by both DIRTY HARRY (1971) - the taciturn, iconoclastic cop hero with a dead spouse - and THE FRENCH CONNECTION (1971) - the desire for revenge has turned Milian's pursuit of gang boss Gastone Moschin (who, like Fernando Rey in that movie, also hails from Marseilles) into an obsession; curiously enough, the dock finale of this film anticipates the one in FRENCH CONNECTION II [1975]!
Moschin (terrific as the anti-hero hood in MILANO CALIBRO 9 [1972]) is a credible villain here, also because the script has atypically made him a victim of tuberculosis.
Tomas Milian was outstanding in the role of the sadistic criminal Psycho he played in Lenzi's films, but, as far as I am considered, he is also the perfect choice to play the rough-and-ready copper he plays here.
Director Stelvio Massi was mainly a very good cinematographer, and this is also visible here as the camera work is very good.
The score by Stelvio Capriani is also great.
Alan Hale jr-look-a-like Van Johnson (MST3k's "San Fransisco International") gives loooong expositional scenes, and John Saxon (MST3k's "Mitchell") gets his head twisted backwards (and apparently the killer also switched his right and left hands).
Elvire Audray is a nice girl but not an actress and also Wandisa Guida only sexy and not so much.
Here I was under the impression that I finally tracked down a copy of "Case of the Scorpion's Tail" and then it turns out this is an entirely different movie, actually one that is even more rare but also a whole lot worse.
Aside from the intriguing title, it's also directed by Sergio Martino; the same man who made some of the best Giallo's of the seventies with films such as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh, it's written by Ernesto Gastaldi; whose name will mean a lot to every Giallo fan worth their salt as he has written many of the best films that the genre has to offer, and on top of that - we've even got a performance from cult actor John Saxon.
I also get a kick out of how protective he is of the kids.
There are also plenty of amusing pop-up captions that comment on the action.
I also like the the way Bernie talk to the viewers during the show.
They have also been able to develop the characters and the situations in perfect harmony with the age of the show and all of the children actors (in other words, no stupid season plot lines that are forced by cast changes or whatever).
I will remind you then that I would also notice more quickly if there were flaws in the writing.
It is rumored that Holden is also one of the extras in the prison yard in the James Cagney-George Raft film Each Dawn I Die.
Of course the sawed off shotgun was also an evil weapon in the wrong hands.
There is also Powell marching with a group of boy scouts in the woods.
He is also pathologically mean with money and counts every penny obsessively.
The strange thing is that there are documented cases in the annals of psychology of this sort of amnesia-associated personality change taking place, and also of the reverting back.
Unfortunately it also doesn't have that adorable dog Asta.
After saving a life, William Powell becomes the victim of amnesia in "I Love You Again," a 1940 film also starring Frank McHugh and Edmund Lowe - this having the distinction of two Philo Vances, Lowe and Powell, in the cast.
They've got the keys, they've also got the whole Punk District of Edge City after them!
Loved the film, and great music Starring John Stockwell from "Christine" also with Michael Dudikoff from "Bachelor Party" , Michele Little From "My Demon Lover" and George Kennedy from "the Naked Gun films", All up I give it 8 out of 10
When he comes to, like in Random Harvest, he discovers his former identity which is that of a confidence man and as it turns out McHugh also is a full time grifter.
But he also finds out that Loy was planning to get rid of him.
It gave rise to my hopes of hearing something by TomÃ¡s Luis de Victoria, also from Ãvila and coinciding in time with Mother Teresa, one of the great examples of early polyphony later taken up by the Italians.
Mother Teresa herself wrote a lot, including poetry which later became categorized as `mystic', a leaning also taken up by Juan de Yepes y Ãlvarez - San Juan de la Cruz/St.
But in this excellent production, directed by Josefina Molina, who also carries out her own particular masterpiece, Ms Velasco reaches the absolute peak of her creative ability.
And as an American poet, who also read St. Theresa's autobiography, wrote -- "that is that, is that."
i'm willing to give Catherine Deneuve a lot of slack, because she is so beautiful to watch, but the thing that's troubling me here, in part, is that both she and Malkovich are lending their names to a film where they do little else, as also in the otherwise wonderful "I'm Going Home."
They also exhibit huge political and cultural bias, which makes them sound even more hollow, and, arguably, at times questionably motivated.
I also thought it was nice to witness a healthy, positive relationship between the mother and daughter.
We also learn about a power struggle over 2 keys that could fire the last nuke left on Earth.
The PI's rescue a damsel in distress (who also happens to have one of those keys) from some mutants and agree to get her to the closest phonebooth (like the telephone infrastructure will have survived WW3 or been rebuilt in 15 years?)
He also purchases a doll at one of the ports of call, in Morocco, I believe, and there is a parallel story of countries, politics, and possessions, for which the doll is a metaphor.
If hers is also De Oliveira's definition, then all the more so.
We also see in some of the ports of call a famous woman boarding the ship, but they don't appear until the last segment of the picture, when the captain, John Walesa, invites Rosa Maria and her daughter to join him at his table where Delphine, Francesca, and Helena, are sitting.
John Malkovich and Catherine Deneuve have also worked with the director before, but this is not their film, they just happen to be there at the end.
Stefania Sandrelli and Irene Papas are also featured in the film.
It's amazing that not only this film but also HOUSE OF HORRORS tried to make a horror star out of this stiff.
He also kills anyone who gets in his way.
To give some measure of sympathy to the titular figure, we also get a subplot in which he is sheltered by a blind pianist (shades of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN [1935] and THE FACE BEHIND THE MASK [1941]): eventually, though, she allows herself to be used as bait in a trap set for him by the Police (with flustered Donald MacBride at their head!).
There are also points, such as the gin rummy sequence, where the picture ought not to be taken too seriously.
He also befriends a pretty, blind piano teacher, who naturally doesn't recoil automatically from the big lug's unique physiognomy.
Rondo Hatton, better known for his role as the "Creeper" in the Sherlock Holmes movie, "The Pearl of Death," also plays the Creeper here Â this time without Sherlock Holmes Â but with such a depth of feeling that audiences more accustomed to hating and fearing monster-murderers may feel pity for the vengeance minded killer instead.
There is, however, no cheating in the use of classic ideas; they are combined so craftily as to create a new legend of Gothic significance and intensity, one which is also true to historical accounts of murder and realistic in a frighteningly everyday way.
I was also thinking it must have been difficult for him on a certain level to be hitting Curly when his kid brother was obviously not well.
All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts!
I believe the beautiful Christine McIntyre is also in this with a believe it or not very dark hair color!
I was also surprised to see the low rating of this great little film.
The first person they meet is a revolutionary rebel by the name of Miles Archer (Lisa Blount, who I also remember from another of my favorite guilty-pleasure 80s flicks, "Nightflyers", as well as "Blind Fury" and "Prince of Darkness").
A Mexican-American dragged across the border, he shows the lengths he is willing to go to return home and prove he is an American, but there is also a sensitive and heart-warming touch to his range as he proves he is also a good guy and not just some clown.
Daniel Stern is also a hoot as an opportunist, and Paul Rodriguez flexes his comedic muscle that we his fans appreciate so much.
Even though I am having trouble finding reruns of it on TV, and I must resort to watching YouTube clips permanently downloaded on my computer, they are enough to drown me in childhood memories and also memories of that silly Polkaroo.
I am 18 going on 19 in February 2010, and also I am autistic, but this show was the GREATEST kids' show EVER MADE.
Romola also takes a striking turn in the lead as the sensitive, wiser, but younger sister.
Henry Thomas also turns in a very sensitive performance.
And it also did make sense, why did the girl wrote him a list of things that she is getting.
Both Romola Garai and Rose Byrne not only suited Cassandra and Rose, but also suited being sisters.
they took important bits out and added useless bits in in their places, we lost the motherly characters for rose and Cassandra when Mrs blossom was just a dummy we saw in the corner of the screen and ms Marcy was just a school teacher with little say in their lives when both characters had a great deal of say in the book for as i said they add a kind of motherly atmosphere for the girls for they have no mother and it shows just how much they miss their mother but in the film without them they also loose the atmosphere for rose and Cassandra and their lose and suffering without their biological mother.
I also miss details like Topaz and Rose having long blonde hair (described beautifully in the opening pages of the book) and Thomas being 15 - so not quite as precocious as he appears to be in the movie.
The book is insightful and  touching but also very funny, with some really wonderful, original language.
This is probably more the director's fault than the actress's, although some blame should also go to the screenwriter, who has the unfortunate habit of substituting her own annoyingly mediocre narration and dialogue in place of the often brilliant language that's readily available in Dodie Smith's novel.
The writer also seems to have felt the need to invent more than one scene completely out of nowhere; one huge scene in particular  between Cassandra and her father is not only NOT in the book, but it contradicts everything the book stands for-- and in such a maudlin, obvious, movie-of-the- week type of way.
She also changed some scenes in a way that made them not only contrary to fiction, but also to the real era in which the events of the movie are supposed to take place.
Billy Nighy also chips in as the father of the family Â a failed writer who suffers from chronic writer's block and is moody and self-indulgent because of it.
I CAPTURE THE CASTLE, despite its protagonist being a young 17-year old girl, offers a universal theme: love is beautiful and great, and it can also hurt.
It's a magical time in a person's life, but it's also extremely frightening and confusing.
So wander through the mine fields of love with care, but also know that the hurt can't possibly last, and will soon enough be replaced by another love.
Wuornos also shows her hands to Broomfield and they have the distinct markings of someone who has certainly slept in the rough.
It also states that she had the 'reputation' of the town tramp and as a result was ostracised and hated by the small community, especially by other girls.
Aileen also states that the guards are trying to poison her and she must wash her food.
She claims that the whole time she was murdering her victims, that she was also being followed by unmarked helicopters.
The tragedy of Aileen Wuornos is also the tragedy of western society.
We the audience also cannot help but feel pity.
Not to be confused with "Aileen Wornous: The Selling of a Serial Killer (1992)", also by Nick Broomfield, this film provides background on Wornous who was selling sex for cigarettes as a 9 year old child in Michigan and follows her life from criminal trials to death row up to her execution (which was not shown).
We invented it along with the Greeks "   Broomfield is very much anti death penalty and he's also very much against the cheque book circus that surrounded the case , but perhaps the beauty of this documentary is that despite being biased Broomfield doesn't feel the need to twist facts into lies or treat the audience as retarded schoolchildren , if you agree with the death penalty this documentary won't change your mind but does raise serious questions about the American legal system
The director also receives sole writing credit, which rather explains the filmâs relentless self-indulgence â padding a wafer-thin plot with lame attempts at characterization and dreary passages of local color!
It's also hard to see his movies in tv.
A clue to its filming location is the lopsided anvil-shaped mountain in the background that dominates the long scenes not only in "Ace High" but also "For A Few Dollars More" and "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" the way that the Paramount logo mountain stood out against the studio sets in the old "Bonanza" TV series.
It also has it's funny moments but isn't as humorous as Hill & Spencer's later spaghetti western; THEY CALL ME TRINITY (1971).
Sound is also good with English subtitles (if necessary) and another excellent score by Bruno Nicolai.
Like Star Trek's "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield," which I also used to think was obvious and beneath me, this one now wows me.
to say nothing of the director, who also wrote this mess.
At any rate, we already know that burning books is bad and I don't know that we need an entire twilight zone episode to show us that the next step of killing librarians is also bad, but it's an entertaining enough episode.
A lot of other IMDb users have complained that this episode is preachy, and I agree to a certain extent, but I also think that any film or story or TV show that shows the dangers of government can't be all bad, particularly given the astonishing political banditry that we have witnessed in America for the last 8 years.
In his spare time Virgil has also created horrible little killer dolls to do his bidding, first George Warbeck (Nicholas Worth) & Mercy Shaw (Jodie Coady) are taken care off then Virgil turns his attentions to Harrison Yulin (Warren Draper) & his scheming wife Moira (Debra Mayer) who just happens to be a dominatrix... Has Virgil met his match at last?
There's also a pointless double ending like in Clue (1985) where one thing happens & then an alternative it could have also happened like this ending is shown which just makes the whole film even more pointless.
Virgil also has a faithful band in a cage, a rock anti-Spice Girls (each member of the band has a `Baby' nick-name) who play dark, death-themed background music on command Â or get shocked.
This film also marked Jenny's decided career directional change away from mainstream film and into indies.
I also wished that Wright was the heroine of the story who saves the day instead of that silly looking creature.
some of the acting is deliberately done bad, actors sometimes have to do this to make the movie look more enigmatic this seems the case with the lead actress jenny wright, I've seen her in other movies and she can most definitely act, the movie also has this 50's look about it, as the killer time travels his way out of her book.
The killer's motives are actually quite good & have at least some thought put into them, his connection with Virginia & why he focuses his attentions on her is also believable & not just coincidental like her being in the wrong place at the wrong time, there's a method to all the madness in I, Madman.
The acting is very strong throughout which also helps give I, Madman a certain credibility that other cheap horror/slashers simply don't have.
Written by David Chaskin, whose credits also include the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" sequel.
It also benefits from the simplicity of the sets and the always-present black and white format, which I believe creates a greater focus on the characters.
The graphic violence is also memorable, reminiscent of "Dawn of the Dead" in the way that the gore comes off as cartoonish instead of realistic.
All of the other titles also show a 1958 release, but in checking the calendar, both 1952 and 1958 the dates all fall on the same days.
The storyline is also unique in that the main WWII theater of operations setting is the Northeast Pacific and the Aleutians.
It's also about gay people who manage to hold their religious ground in spite of all the bigotry that they refuse to believe is inherent in God's word.
We also learn that James Dobson, one of the most indisputably renowned and respected evangelical Christian leaders in America, chairman of Focus On the Family, a nonprofit Christian organization, believes that homosexuality is a preference that is inspired through a child's surroundings.
And, also in the name of anit piracy.
Photographs were also used to depict the children and their families in the past.
I must agree with them, and may I also suggest putting it in every church too.
It also excludes The State from potentially representing any kind of theocratic totalitarianism (which is just as bad).
I also saw the film at Sundance and being a Christian, I can say that Karslake left out some of the stronger Biblical passages that were in the New Testament, but I don't believe he was shooting for a theological argument.
They also cover a number of other subjects throughout the movie such as the literalists' view of the bible, genetics, common misconceptions, and so much more.
It quietly points out that the Bible DOES condemn gays...but it also says eating shellfish is an abomination too.
The filmmakers point out how the misuse of the Bible by Judeo-Christian leaders has created not only an environment that leads to shaming but also condones "sanctified violence" projected toward gays and lesbians.
The film also addresses the real reasons why people are afraid to admit homosexuality is real and normal.
Boy, does this alarmingly abominable and mind-numbingly moronic bilge strike out something stinky in every conceivable department: We've got uniformly awful acting, dire dialogue, flimsy plotting, no tension or suspense to speak of, poky pacing, ragged editing, ugly, eye-straining cinematography, wafer-thin characters, a horrendously redundant and annoying score, tacky gore, and flat-footed (non)direction by Stuart Segall, who also helmed such hard-core porn classics as "Teeny Buns" and "Insatiable" under the unlikely pseudonym of Godfrey Daniels(!).
Too much time is also spent on a father chasing his daughter that isn't really connected to the main story.
The music was also very annoying - horrible clicking sounds.
There is also another scene where two victims are watching an unknown film in their car, the guy says "what a turkey!"
and "this plots been done before", you will know exactly how he feels, I also wondered if his dialogue was included by the filmmakers as a little self referring joke, it sums up the film well.
The ending is also one of the worst ever, nothing is concluded.
They start the investigation at the drive-in where the owner is a foul-mouthed and acerbic character, and also interview a janitor there named Germy, a dozy but amusing simpleton who is possibly the only slightly redeeming character involved.
There are also at least three scenes that last for five minutes that is nothing but a guy driving around a parking lot looking for a place to park!!
John also talk to the world's biggest azzhole drive-in manager Austin Johnson who hates, and I mean HATES, everyone.
I also enjoyed the opening beheading..but director Seagall doesn't quite match this with the subsequent killings(..one victim's head falls off and a couple is skewered by the dreaded sword while hugging).
There are also some awkward transitions in the plot.
Naushaus, also appearing here in his only film role, was the embodiment of the anal-retentive schmuck we all endured at our first summer job.
The doc is also peppered with small interview clips from the likes of Sid Haig, Joe Bob Briggs and the master of no-budget spat-fests himself, Mr. Hershell Gordon Lewis who all give their take on what it takes to make it in the world of horror cinema.
Garetano also interviewed such horror veterans as Herschell Gordon Lewis, whose advice to filmmakers is to make a movie FOR the audience, NOT for yourself and "The Devil's Rejects" Sid Haig who gives his opinion on when a horror movie goes too far.
It's also an examination of the spirit one tries to hold onto in a harsh business to enter, let alone prosper in.
We also spend some time on the set of Zombie Honeymoon, where director Dave Gebroe aims for a more dramatic, character-based conflict amidst the body parts, courtesy of FX master Tate Steinsiek.
And with Brian Singleton, who works on his own documentary of the paranormal and his own sci-fi/horror hybrid flicks with no money, time, or apartment to his creditÂ   We also visit on set with Mark Borchardt, who indie and documentary fans will remember from 1999's American Movie.
Other amusing sequences also, and I can sum up the film using an expression of Dennis's (one of the characters)... "Yeah!
I think you will also.
It's a strong and independent woman for her time (the movie is set in the 1850's), yet also spoiled and stubborn, who of course eventually has to pay for her deeds.
Bette Davis plays a role in which she could had easily gone over-the-top with, since its a very stubborn and spoiled character but instead she plays her role more humane and realistic, which also keeps her likable.
Western expert actor Henry Fonda also plays one fine role and I especially liked the work he did with the accent within this movie.
The movie further more among others also features the always great Donald Crisp.
Donald Crisp was never an actor who played the main lead in a movie but he always played small and humble but great roles, which also should be a reason why he got cast in so many fine and well known movies throughout his career.
The same somewhat also goes for George Brent, who plays Buck Cantrell in this movie.
It's a well cast movie with fine acting performances, which mostly also carries the movie.
Max Steiner also delivers one fine Oscar nominated musical score for this movie.
"Jezebel" isn't even nowhere close in the same league and epic proportions as "Gone with the Wind" and "Jezebel" is a more light and less complicated one, that has a totally different style and breaths a total different atmosphere, not in the least also since "Gone with the Wind" is a movie in color of course.
It also has some amazingly funny moments thanks to the Blane character.
Jezebel was released in 1938 and also stars a young Henry Fonda who at times had to take leave from production because of the birth of his daughter Jane.
Fay Bainter by the way also was nominated this same year for best leading actress for her role in another movie titled "White Banners".
This autobiographical character study of real-life New York City detective Eddie Egan, who also served as technical adviser for the film, is definitely underrated.
He's better in this outing than he was in Let's Get Harry and Falling Down, which were also, arguably, some of Duvall's best works (that some could say were ruined by bad direction and a bad supporting cast).
Though what we call "a gangster film" in the 1970's bears little resemblance to the classics of the 1930's, it is still a film about big-time criminals and organized crimeÂ Only the baddies have been changed to assist identificationÂ   "Badge 373" is a case in pointÂ It is a simple story, based on the exploits of Eddie Egan, a real New York policeman who also, for good measure, plays a part in the filmÂ  Ryan, a New York detective, is suspended for causing the death of a Puerto Rican dope runnerÂ Taking a job as a bartender, he learns that his old partner on the force has been killedÂ Then, with the law against him because he is no longer a policeman, and harassed also by the villains, he sets out to avenge his friend's murderÂ  The twist is that these villains are no longer liquor and heroin smugglers, big-time gamblers or bank robbersÂ They are Puerto RicansÂ Some of them are men who seek to foment a revolution on their island; others, led by a sinister figure in dark glasses called Sweet William, are the crooked element who will supply the necessary guns and ammunitionÂ Ryan, played by Robert Duvall, wages his own solitary war against both partiesÂ  It's a rough, tough and ruthless film, in which Duvall is as brutal as his adversaries; towards the end, he callously chops down a night watchman in order to gain entrance to the Brooklyn docksÂ In fact, it is very difficult to have sympathy for any of the characters in "Badge 373."
A good part of the film is just Zwigoff using his camera to get into the main mind-set of Crumb, not just necessarily with interviews with his family members or friends and co-workers (though there is a lot of that), but also through the presentation of his work, often in medium close-ups, with awesome blues melodies and tunes in the background.
The film also focuses on Robert's family.
It has him talking about his life and his work along with interviews with his family and friends also discussing him and his work.
We also see oppossing or agreement from other art critics or artists.
R. Crumb is also extremely anti-capitolistic.
We also meet some of his friends and people who find his work marvelous and others who despise it.
That movie is also an adaptation of a comic book so maybe it was there that Crumb's influence was made.
His brothers are also great artists but are even worse at functioning in the world.
But be forewarned he is, to put it plainly, perverted and incredibly eccentric but also honest and self aware, take it for what you will.
It's also interesting as a true look at mental illness, not the candy-coated or nightmarish visions typically put forth by the media, but mental illness as experienced by everyday people.
The terror of the yellow fever is also excellently conveyed, and the images of countless bodies being carted away is still very powerful.
He also maintains an honesty and a level of integrity that is just not seen these days, the exception being Dave Chapelle when he walked away from $50 million.
It also sheds light on his dark childhood and how he turned out to be the "normal" one.
In this excellent film, directed by Terry Zwigoff (who also directed the excellent, and also comic book related, "Ghost World" and "American Splendor") Crumb starts out by telling that he hates just about all the work he is most famous for.
"Crumb" is an excellent portrait of an exceptionally talented artist who also happens to be a total pervert.
The absolute thoughtless cruelty of the royal class crushing the common citizens into poverty is shallowly and inadequately reflected in most history books; as it is also in this film.
It also dramatizes the so-called Affair of the Necklace much better than the 2002 film of that title.
A radiant Gladys George is also on hand as his famous mistress, Madame DuBarry.
Shearer's silent film techniques are also put to good use near the end of the film when the totally distraught and prematurely aged queen is awaiting execution in her cell.
Maybe if it concentrated on the "Yellow Fever" epidemic it could have been (but then, the 1938 audience had also seen MGM's YELLOW JACK, and was aware of how to tell the story of that scourge).
Actually, despite her being shown to be simple-minded, Butterfly McQueen's "Prissy" is also more memorable than her equivalents in JEZEBEL.
No expense was spared in this lavish production which features sumptuous sets, intricate costumes, beautiful cinematography, and also some top-notch acting.
Tyrone Power is also in it, although he is pretty much wasted in a rather small role.
I saw the original release of "Marie Antoinette" - I did not see it again until last night and also tonight; I had bought in on eBay.
It also doesn't help that she's way too old to play the part.
Marie's over-spending is also glossed over.
Acting also must be mentioned.
Â She also won her second Academy Award for the role.
They also introduce innovations that have since become clichÃ©s and the hallmark of 'women pictures' everywhere.
He also got an assist here from uncredited French genius Julien Duvivier.
The costumes were also specially constructed to shine, glitter and shimmer on black and white film.
Besides giving Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch her immortal theme, he is also one half of the composing team that produced the operetta "Rose Marie".
Robert Morley, a character actor who made his film debut in MARIE ANTOINETTE and went on to appear in many films until the 80s, is also dead-on as the awkward Louis XVI and was also nominated for his supporting role but lost to Walter Brennan for KENTUCKY.
He also is ridiculed by his cunning cousin, the Duke of OrlÃ©ans (Joseph Schildkraut) and the king's mistress, Madame Du Barry (Gladys George).
There is also character development (for some characters anyway).
The music score was also really good.
It is, for the most part, a bleak, rather disturbing film, but, for those along for the ride, it's also somewhat cathartic in that it allows the viewer to vicariously get back at those who break the law and have no regard for others' feelings, property or wellbeing.
I was also impressed with the ultra-stylish musical score by Herbie Hancock, who lets the music express itself and it's fun to listen to.
William Wyler directs this lavish melodrama quite well, and all the actors are well selected ("Little Rascals" fans will also have fun spotting young Stymie Beard).
The bottom line is that Bronson was a bad ass in this film and all the rest of the Death Wish films which I also enjoy very much.
I knew that there was also a kind of historical context for the times, of how it was in New York City as well as in others during the 70's (though especially in the 70's)- I remembered my mother telling me about how the atmosphere of 'Death Wish' with its thieves and rapists and abusers was for real, that they were around every corner, and that crime was indeed at an all-time high then.
But there is also a sense of overall tragedy to it all.
Michael Winner, the director, is also an asset with this, in giving to the film its gritty tone.
He is also inspiring other people to fight crime.
He knows he will never get the actual gang who harmed his family, but he also realises that crime in general is spreading through the city like a plague.
The film is also noticeable for an early appearance by Jeff Goldblum as a slimy thug.
The movie also ends on a very satisfying note.
Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.
Charles Bronson is Paul Kersey, a New York architect whose wife is killed by a group of muggers ransacking their apartment, an attack that also leaves his daughter catatonic.
He also witnesses a live reenactment of an Old West shootout, where frontier justice was administered at the end of the gun.
This may be due to his friendship with director Michael Winner, who also helmed several of his other films.
This is a 1938 film also starring Henry Fonda, George Brent, and Donald Crisp.
The movie is also funny at times, and director's direction is excellent.
Kind of a coming of age story for an urban girl, but also has message for all of us about what life is all about.
Close lives also Mrs Koide with whom she used to play when she was a kid.
Surely the development of Naomi, how she grows up - and indeed has to grow up - through friendship and also sorrow, is the driving force of the movie.
It's also one of Scorsese's lesser-known gems and as far as I'm concerned, everything the man has so much as ever sneezed on is a gem.
I love GWTW, but "Jezebel" works as well or better at capturing the same basic period in US history, while also keeping you waiting expectantly for the heroine's next outlandish maneuver.
The rest of the cast, including Arquette, Linda Fiorentino, Cheech and Chong, Teri Garr, and others, is also absolutely wonderful.
It is also a great cult film by director Martin Scorsese that came and went in 1985 with little attention.
It also helps that she is extremely hot.
It's also funny to think that five years later, he and O'Hara would play the most loving parents to a boy who would be the biggest box office draw in the early part of the 90's.
There are also a few cameos from actors who were primarily known in underground movies where Scorsese started his career and even a few seconds with Cheech and Chong.
It is also very darkly funny.
A superb cast that also features Donald Crisp, George Brent and Fay Bainter.
*SPOILER ALERT*  AFTER HOURS has typically been viewed as one of Martin Scorsese's minor films, but this excellent, frenetically-paced dark comedy works at a number of levels, while also Â perhaps unintentionally Â raising a few provocative questions.
Minor quibbles aside, this is a remarkable piece of work Â the pacing is exhausting (Scorsese manages to very realistically reflect the sensory-overload rawness of New York), the ensemble cast is consistently (occasionally shockingly) great, and the use of music to advance the story (The Monkees, Joni Mitchell, Bad Brains and Peggy Lee all help to advance several great scenes) is also stunning.
I also want to mention the camera work by Michael Ballhaus, the German cinematographer who has made fabulous in their beauty films with Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
The story also focuses the outbreak that happened in 1853 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where thousands of residents died.
The sad thing is that most of the characters he meets are also just looking for a soul mate too, but the yuppy world that Paul comes from makes him too prejudiced and unable to see through their apparent weirdness to the lonely person underneath.
Her suicide contributes much to Paul's emotional weightÂ-how exactly did he contribute to it?Â-and also to the comedy's being so black.
The picture strikes me as being linear, yes, but also kaleidoscopic: Paul meets and re-meets the same characters throughout, but each time this happens, his circumstances have taken a new turn.
The story is also full of strange details that help knit the whole together.
Is she also trying to kill him?
I also think this is Griffin Dunne's pinnacle: he perfectly inhabits a role where everything is falling apart around him but where he hangs on and finds something inside that keeps plugging on until the sun rises again.
We also get to witness suicide, murder, robbery and vigilante mobs in this tale of big city madness.
The tension in this film is also intense, and that is amazing for a light hearted comedy.
Trouble is, BLACKENSTEIN is also incredibly, unspeakably dull.
Of course, they also decided to remake Frankenstein.
You also will probably notice how odd Los Angeles is in the film.
They are also oblivious to the fact that he gets out at night to embark on nocturnal rampages.
The Halloween-style sound effects are not to be missed, and also don't miss the scene inside a nightclub that features Cardella De Milo, prefaced by an emcee who delivers a painfully unfunny joke.
The attack scenes are also executed with a complete lack of suspense or logic, with many of the "victims" hurling themselves directly into the monster's outstretched arms.
The story is also something.
Even though it also expresses a common theme of "even trusted friends are capable of betrayal," there's no reason to be sad from seeing this movie.
**SPOILERS** Nostalgic 1977 movie that's more like a 1940's film-noir crime suspense/drama with an over the hill private eye Ira Wells, Art Carney, teaming up with a middle-age hippie Margo Sperling, Lily Tomlin, to solve the murder of Ira's long-time friend of over 30 years, and also private detective, Harry Regan, Howard Duff.
Ira also has to puts up with the New Age Guru-like Margo, who he gets to like despite her almost talking him to death.
Lily Tomlin is perfect as the over-age hippie Margo Sperling who also begins to take life seriously when she realizes that she and Ira's lives are in danger in an elaborate scheme to distance the Whiting murders away from those responsible for them and make them look like a robbery gone wrong.
Virgyl is also helped out by his good buddy, the great film actor Michael Bower, and is taught how to sweet talk the ladies, master the difficult art of putting a condom on, and what are the best magazines to 'jack off to'.
There are also people that have compared Jezebel with Gone with the Wind.
I also love the new look of Godzilla he looks meaner and more destructive even though he's a bit smaller.
Godzilla 2000 Millennium also has moments of humor as well as scenes which give us insight into the lives of the people tracking Godzilla and who must then deal with an even greater threat.
Godzilla 2000 Millennium also vindicates the traditional Japanese way of making giant monster movies.
also, though the middle 40 minutes has no godzilla, what many people fail to mention is that it has a big ol' UFO that flies around and blows things up, plus a pretty good bunch of plot advancements.
I am also very glad they did, since this shows exactly how to make a G-movie...you use the original Big G himself!
It also starts transmitting message words such as "Millennium," "Kingdom," etc.
After Godzilla trashes the UFO, Orga proceeds to beat him silly (also telepathically controlling what's left of the UFO to bash him around with it!).
This also accounts for some of the higher-angled placements of the camera, which have the audience looking down on Godzilla (without the jet or helicopter POV as in previous films).
It's a great start to begin the Millennium series which also has some really good films, among my favorite.
There is also a bit of dead zone where godzilla isn't around between godzilla's first encounter the flying saucer and the final battle, but it is not to bad.
Though on the whole, it's nice to see Godzilla back in form (somewhat) and this Toho production firmly returns their most beloved creation to dominance, it also suffers a lot from the problems that have plagued its predecessors, and some of those problems may have been due to Roland Emmerich's 1998 Americanized version of the big green guy.
Godzilla himself has changed a lot, with massive plates that line his back and he's also been given a pretty nifty set of fangs.
Best selling novels often make bad movies but with writer director Michael Crichton (who also wrote the book) does what most others should do: FOLLOW THE BOOK AND IT WILL USUALLY BE A SUCCESS!!
He also makes the most purple faced cholera corpse on film (you have to be there to understand why).
But Crichton also notes the irony of the way the public attack the train thieves while embracing the idiots running the Crimean War that the gold was for.
To do all this & the climactic robbery, Sims assembles a colorful crew: theater actress Miriam (Down), who's also his mistress; pickpocket & "screwsman" Agar (Sutherland); driver & strong-arm Barlow (Downing); and "snakesman" Clean Willy (Sleep, in a unique & outstanding role), who can reputedly climb "a wall of glass."
As comedy, it's direct and nice and sometimes also grim; as an action outing, it's straightforward and suspenseful.
If you stop the frame where the killer is standing outside the building after doing the deed you can clearly see the man is definitely older and shorter than Sean Connery is and he is not dressed as well, he also is not carrying the cane that Connery was holding earlier in the tavern scene.
The film apparently is a fairly accurate adaptation of the novel although the end is changed slightly & a subplot involving a 12 year old prostitute was also dropped.
The acting is very good with Sean Connery making a very likable villain but one who also has a dark side when needed, British ballet dancer Wayne Sleep did all his own stunts including scaling that prison wall while there are numerous other notable faces involved.
The outfits also appeared to me to be brand new on everybody.
He solicits the help of fellow pick-pocket and lock-smith ("the best screws-man in England) Edward Agar (also a real-life figure involved in the 1855 heist) played by Donald Sutherland, and the beautiful Leslie-Anne Down as Miriam.
The script will also give you an entertaining lesson on the life and lingo of early Victorian England.
The film also benefits from a lot of well-placed humor.
She was actually considered for the role, but Warner told Selznick that they wouldn't agree to loan her out unless he also took Errol Flynn for the part of Rhett Butler.
It also follows the life and times of one very spirited woman named Julie Marsden (Bette Davis), who could have been Scarlet O'Hara's soul mate.
George Brent (with whom Davis also was rumored to have had an affair) also turns in a strong performance as Buck, the honorable gentleman who duels his best friend to defend Julie's honor.
It is about 25,000 pounds in gold bars placed in strongboxes and taken by armed security guards to the railway station...  'The First Great Train Robbery' is about the fastest pickpocket you'll ever see, a suave and daring gentleman who never tells the truthÂ It is also about a bunch crooks that can steal your heart with the company of a fascinating disguised mistress who suspects that her father breaks his own regulation for each morning of the shipments...  'The First Great Train Robbery' chronicles the grandeur and hypocrisy at all levels of England during the Victorian Era, and proves that the cleverness and prowess of a criminal mastermind is elevated to heroic status...  With excellent photography of Ireland beautiful countryside, and great music score by Jerry Goldsmith, plus the costumes and sets, Michael Crichton's movie gives train heist's fans the pleasure to enjoy a very entertaining period thrillerÂ
This wonderful movie co-stars Gregory Harrison, whom she would also act with in the AIDS-drama "It's My Party," and also marks the acting debut of her daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, whom, much later, would become an international singing sensation in her own right.
Olivia's real life daughter Chloe is also in this movie and she does an excellent job of acting herself.
Chloe and her mother Olivia also star in another movie together called The Wilde girl's which is also a movie to see.
In the case of "Il trionfo di Maciste", the boyish Kirk Morris (alias Adriano Bellini, a Venetian who also starred in Riccardo Freda's "Maciste all'inferno") is to be admired in the muscular chariots scene at the middle of the film, where he offers such a picture of sweat, fatigue and effort as to become a minor cult classic for voyeurs.
The best news tho is that the new DVD edition of "There's Nothing.." not only has a MUCH better transfer than the earlier video release (and is letterboxed), but also a bunch of fun extras and commentary.
Hayden is superb in the role and gives a very naturalistic performance in what is in some ways a semi documentary style of film, there's also a host of great supporting roles for the likes of Ted de Corsia and Charles Bronson who complete the hold up gang and also a really entertaining and utterly scene stealing "performance" by the truly psychotic Timothy Carey.
Crime Wave is really well paced hard boiled Noir and at a paltry 73 minutes it passes all too quickly, it also has the distinction of being a rather important influence on Kubrick's The Killing which has a similar look and also most of the same cast.
As my first viewing from the newly released Warner Film Noir Volume 4 boxset, I found it an unmitigated success, there's also a hilarious and very entertaining commentary from Noir luminaries Eddie Muller and James Ellroy, although the latters barking like a dog does grate just a little
The actors are also so bad that you'd swear it was a sketch from All That except THOSE sketches actually are amusing at times.
But when Bingo himself winds up into trouble not only does it complicate things for him because of the crooks, it also complicates things for Chucky.
Phillip Glass's creepy little score also disappears.
I also liked seeing tough guy CHARLES BRONSON in one of his early roles.
There's also one scene during the festival when a cop is running after Donna, it seems reminiscent of another movie....oh yeah Double Jeapordy!!
And she's also the prime suspect ya-da ya-da ya-da.
while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies,i didn't' like this third and(so far Final)installment.i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much.there's a lot of filler here,which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie.i also wasn't too impressed with the acting.there was a lot of overwrought theatrics.as well,there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies,basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore.maybe i'm just imagining things,but this is my opinion on things.finally,this movie has none of the style of the second movie.adding it all up,this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts.my vote for Candyman 3:Day of the dead is a 3/10
This also features an early appearance of Charles Bronson as one of the ruthless baddies and another reason for making this a must see.
The story contains some decent creepy ideas that really appeal to me also.
There are also scenes that try to be too intelligent and could lose the viewer.
And, If that weren't enough, he finds that tragic incident also beset him with a peculiar sort of obsessive stalker which eats away at his peace of mind and infects his relationship with his girlfriend, Clair (Morton), until he finds himself slipping over the brink of destruction.
Director Michell and the adequate Daniel Craig successfully manage to keep us guessing that Joe may also be losing it.
The films camera works are also used brilliantly, and the visual style from director Roger Michell, and Joe Penhall screenplay helps adapt Ian Mcewan's novel.
Since each character is obsessional to varying digress, the film is also an exploration of how sane or insane loves makes us feel.
My version was also bundled with Decoy (which is actually referenced in the commentary to Crime Wave).
Decoy is also a gem.
But on reading it, I was also struck by how much like a thriller it seemed, with its plot centred on a character who undergoes an experience both frightening and unusual; in fact, so unusual that it isolates him from others and forces him to handle it alone, with an ever-increasing sense of paranoia.
An element of playfulness present in the text has also failed to transfer to the screen.
Which would also explain the tension between Joe and Claire, who as an artist is presumably of the opposite view.
All of the cast do exceptionally well.Craig crafts a perfect portrayal of a retiring English gent desperately ill-at-ease with the troubling situation in front of him.This is the making of a promising new English talent we are seeing here,following on from his success in the lead role in Layer Cake.Ifans,usually a comedic actor (sometimes even in films where the tone is pretty serious),here successfully starts to broaden his range with an impressively unhinged portrayal of a man unable to let go and desperately trying to make sense of the demons burning inside him.Supporting players Morton and Bill Nighy are also very good back up to these two actors who are shining their socks off.
Director Roger Michell also keeps us somewhat in the dark about Joe.
Ifans is excellent, also, but that's to be expected.
I also loved Jeremy Sams' score, which had a Carter Burwell flavor.
She links up the Sebastian (Flynn), a musician, who also happens to have a brother that is in music too.
The other actors(especially Eleanor Parker) are also quite good and the film is quite a change of pace from the swashbucklers,war filmsand Westerns Flynn was in a lot.
The character is feisty but also more of an ingÃ©nue than Lupino, whose strong appearance and voice made her a leading lady almost out of the box.
For big fans of Errol and big fans of period romance musical comedy/drama combo,this movie will deliver the goods.The story hits the spot for the genre.Very good music,very good cast and acting as well.What kpt this movie from becoming a classic though was the low budget and average directing.The cinematography was also below average.But still,Errol Flynn is so charming here as usual and for the right audience,it's still a winner.This film was unfairly under rated due to the dreaded anti-Flynn syndrome bandwagon......
She brings a sensitivity to the screen but also strong-willed and her own person.
Lupino also compliments Errol Flynn as a great on-screen couple.
A "Woodworks" film, "SSW" was written and directed by Gary L. Wood (who also wound up performing in the movie when a key actor failed to show up on "shooting day").
Then Susan B. Anthony goes on trial (also in New York State) for daring to try to vote in a national election.
In the decades from 1870 - 1920 many woman suffrage figures, like Carrie Nation, were also outspoken supporters of prohibition.
Scarlett Johanssen also is pretty cool.
It also seems to be telling the viewers that it's impossible to be an individual in this world, and that you'll always be just another [ insert a subculture or a name here ] to people, which I don't agree with personally.
I am also a huge fan of the graphic novel, and all similar comic books.
**** SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN ***  There were a lot of things I liked about this movie: the humour and the characters, but it was basically Thora Birch that carried it - the character of Enid was terrific, reminding me a lot of Daria (who I also like).
Sketches are also how Enid describes the reality around her, by drawing on her diary.
His character is also in many ways a caricature, but he gives it real depth.
Enid also reflects that she will miss the geeky classmate who she will never see again- a familiar sense that "what is to come" may also be a disappointment.
And the other main character, Seymour, is also great.
So watch this film, is funny thanks to the great satire to the society but also is sad thanks to one character who doesn't know what to do with her life and is quite disappointed with the rest of the world.
It's also interesting that Enid and Rebecca are only sexually attracted to specific types of boys.
One can view this ending with optimism, but it's also naive to assume that Enid's internal "problem" can be solved by changing her external surroundings.
I guess you can also equate it with Antonioni's work, though his films deal less with the artist, and more with the disillusionment that comes with perception.
What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for, they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is, because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times, leaves the other types left out, where do they go?
From the comic-book which takes a perverse delight in celebrating the geeky side of all of us, "Ghost World" is profane and cynical, but also surprisingly blithe and bright.
Meanwhile, they play a prank with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-age collector of long-plays record that feels also difficulties of relationship, and Seymour and Enid become friends.
The caustic and mature adolescent-coming-to-age story is centered in the weird and rebel Enid facing and overcoming the need to join the real world after the high-school period, and is brilliantly directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also writes the wonderful screenplay with Daniel Clowes.
The performance of Thora Birch, probably in her best role, also deserved a nomination to the Oscar.
Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi and the supporting cast are also awesome.
Terry Zwigoff ("Crumb") directs this film based on a script by Dan Clowes, who also created the original comic book.
He also feels very frustrated that Ben can guess his thoughts.
I also enjoyed the many POV driving shots!
It's not bad but it's also not very good.
I was disappointed also with Everett's performance which lacked the spark or energy shown by Jeremy Brett when he played Holmes in the TV series.
We also get to watch Inspector Lestrade perform an L&O-style big whupping on the suspect.
The reality is that new stories can also have value of fleshing out and perhaps exploring situations we have not seen Holmes in before.
Ian Hart also makes a different sort of Watson, but there is chemistry (and a bit of underlying tension!)
Holmes is also made to deploy a Mary Poppins aphorism about pie crusts and promises--perhaps you remember it from your childhood Disney viewing.
He also is intense and honorable when he's on a case, even a little vulnerable.
The story also is off-beat sexually, and not just games with a handy footman or two.
On the lam they hold up with also ex-con Steve Lacey (decent leading man Gene Nelson) with his wife, but what they don't know is that he's already been tapped by the cops, specifically Sterling Hayden's Detective Sims, who is so hard-nosed he could cut through bricks with just a stare and some tough words.
It also can't be stressed how awesome an actor Sterling Hayden is.
I love the old 1984 series with Jeremy Brett, which I'm sure a lot of other Holmes fanatics also enjoy.
But in all other instances, I adored Jeremy Brett and both David Burke and Edward Hardwicke for their performances, since I take also take Watson to scrupulous account ever since Nigel Bruce.
This wasn't the Holmes I read when I was seven, just like Nigel Bruce was in no way the Watson I had adored also.
The fact that they also kept trying to make it seem more Holmesish by inserting various dialogue from other stories was in itself a bit irritating.
He said so in "Man with the Twisted Lip" and also in another story.
He gives off a much younger energy (which also made the much later time frame seem odd), but definitely captures the aloofness & arrogance of Holmes.
It also shows how not all the Jews were as passive about their fate as some have claimed, often opposing the Nazi officers and paying for it with their lives.
Along with a brief adulatory featurette with various noir historians and Oliver Stone waxing lyrical about the film, the DVD also includes the original trailer introduced by an in-character Hayden telling us "Murder is my business and midnight is my beat."
The routine way in which the graphic results of the gas chambers are displayed for you serve only to increase that horrifying perspective of what we as humans are capable of: not only by inflicting such horror, but by also standing-by & participating, in any manner of self-presevation.
You see the direct results of the violence, but you also see a more complex story of the repercussions of choices made, & a questioning of the cost & meaning of survival.
There are choices we all make to ensure our self-preservation, but there also comes a time when even amongst the worst of what humanity can wrought upon itself, there is hope.
This is very grim stuff but also an extremely moving and thought-provoking look at what human beings in the most miserable of circumstances will do to stay alive, and how through it all they sustain their desire to ultimately fight back.
Known for his leading role in O Brother Where Art Thou, he also wrote and directed O, which was shelved after the Columbine massacre.
For above all else, this is a story that not only succeeds in answering the question of why Jews would volunteer for such a duty, but also allows the viewer a stunning and horrifying look into human psychology and the politics of oppression.
And also the visual, with very strange colors, almost candy-like.
We also like small movies.
There's also an entertaining tough-guy type played by Charles Bronson.
Its a movie I can comfortably watch with my parents without making them uncomfortable also.
I also got an opportunity to hang out with Ms. Parmar, the director of the movie, who I interviewed for a magazine.
The Red Skull, also, hates what he has become, and Captain America resurfacing represents a part of him he wishes was dead.
It has a government-conspiracy plot worthy of a Dean Koontz novel, and it also throws in a lot of comic-book silliness.
The opening half hour rushes by with grace, ending with a fantastic battle inside a Nazi stronghold, and the climatic battle between Cap and the skull at the end is also unbelievable.
Captain America is also another Marvel movie miss.
We also find out that Acne Man has magically transformed into Incompetent Plastic Surgery Man (whom I will refer to as IPSM from here on).
My next stop is also an early nineties cheese-fest, this time about vegetable-lovin' freaks: "Troll 2".
It was also pretty much true to the real event also.
Andre de Toth's direction also was terrific.
Jay Novello as the veterinarian ex-con also was really interesting.
Dad's favorite part was also mine, the part where Keaton sits down in the conductor's seat to find an obstructing rail car that he just disposed of has miraculously reappeared, and then a moment later he sits down to find that the car has vanished once again.
We also write a short review for each and every film.
It was also an interesting theme that Keaton got all of his motivation from the girl that wanted him to enlist, and all his inspiration from his other love, The General.
Buster Keaton who also co-wrote and co-directed the film is utter perfection as the title character.
Not only are his facial expressions when he realises that something has gone wrong on the train hilarious but one must also give him credit for doing most of his own stunt work!
There is also a lovestory between Lenny and Lea, two shy and private persons.
In addition to being the prettiest of his films, it also features among the best characterization for Keaton--with a full and rich plot.
This also makes him a very charismatic character.
It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures.
But his competent, ingenious and athletic character in The General, who is also modest, tireless, and underestimated, comes much closer to his real nature.
What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor Â a movie like this couldn't be made today.
It also suffers from the same budget issues that many shows coming out of England from the early 70's faced.
As for Joe, he got in also, having a neck full of back stage passes.
It is also arguably the single biggest charity and cultural change event ever in terms of not only it scale, but its impact.
The point of the event was to raise money, yes, but also to put the issue of extreme poverty on the political agenda.

Major disappointment aside I still stayed in to watch the rest of the concert most of which I watched on my sister's portable black and white TV and it wasn't until a few days later that I started digesting what a monumental event it was where Queen stole the show with their medley , where Bob Geldof swore live on air ( In those days bad language on television was still very rare ) , the dominance of British music that saw every act at Wembly hail from the British Isles and where a third of the acts at the American concert were also British , and the strange fact within a couple of years many of the acts at Wembly had disappeared from the charts altogether .
Queen was amazing; three friends & I saw their very last show as a group a year later at Knebworth House, 120,000 people were also there too!
It's the weakest film in the Historical Classic package, which also contains COLOSSUS OF RHODES and LAND OF THE PHARAOHS, which are much better and more entertaining than this static, tacky disaster.
This Classic movie is one of the best ever made.Not only does it have excitement but it also is very entertaining.I like the movie because it is similar to Bonnie and Clyde.I have several DVD's In my collection and hope one day to add this DVD also.Bobbie Jo and the outlaws is one of my favorite classics.As all movies in this era this movie was well directed and casted with some of the best actors and actresses of this s time period.Bobbie Jo and the out laws has a great plot and is a fast action movie.I recommend that any one who loves classic movies to watch this movie if you ever get a chance.You will enjoy this movie if you like gangster movies.Thank you for your time and please do watch this movie,I think you will enjoy it,I know I enjoy watching it.Thank you.
A young lady named Belinda Balanski plays her friend, and she's also a beauty, also a fine young actress, and also topless.
It also includes appearances by John Durren as Deputy Abel Gance, Peggy Stewart as Bobbie Jo and Pearl's alcoholic mother Hattie, Gerrit Graham as commune leader Magic Ray, James Gammon as a leather salesman, Gene Drew as redneck Sheriff Hicks, Virgil Frye as Joe Grant, who makes the mistake of challenging Lyle on his quick-draw abilities, and future director Chuck Russell (also second assistant director here) as an unnamed deputy.
There is also a secondary story about the budding relationship between a video store clerk and a well-read waitress which is as sweet as it is subtle.
He also makes striking use of selective coloring, with colored objects popping out of black-and-white frames.
's collaboration should also be celebrated.
I should also mention that the performances of the three main characters were absolutely believable and fun.
The film are also filled with nods to exploitation cinema (clip from Lustig's "Maniac" & "Vigilante", "Andy Warhol's Frankenstein" etc.).
I also saw this movie at the Brooklyn Film Festival, with my husband, and we LOVED it.
The plot is clever and interesting, in fact, I think it is one of the most original scripts, but interestingly, also one in which most people can relate to (or if not from New York, at least have heard about!).
The soundtrack is great also,the music flows so well,it kinda reminds me of Star Wars episode 1 &2 theme songs.Its cool-it rocks.What can I say,It's my favorite movie of all time without a doubt.I want to add also,that this movie deserves more credit,it really was a brilliant movie-it deserved a sequel(...Just think,Imagine what adventures Ben,Darren,Wolfgang and Amanda would be having with their technology?).
Being born in the 80's myself and interested in the teen/adventure movies like "Stand By Me" and "The Goonies", I learned about "Explorers" which also featured the late River Phoenix.
When meeting the aliens, one learns to not take so much for granted, one has an unexpected adventure and flirtation with a troublesome girl alien, and one learns to believe more in himself and also learns a bit more empathy for his dad after meeting the father of their alien friends.
A sub-story about Leo's buddy searching for a girl relieves the pressure a bit, which is for the better as it also adds depth to the movie.
I remember also that I was going to go see it again but it was gone.
Film buffs may also remember Jason Presson (Darren) from "Stone Boy", but not much else.
Overall, Explorers is immensely entertaining, but also wildly uneven.
A few surprises are also included as well in this one.
Yes, the film is a symptom of its time; I also watched 'Queen Elizabeth' (1912) today (it wasn't a very good day), and both are arid and static adaptations from the stage, histrionic acting included, but without sound, or any other qualities of the theatre.
But maybe i am being a little silly through my love of the film, which also i must add, has one of the best themes.
The purpose of Documentaries is usually to inform, but they are also the best character studies, filled with real people in real situations.
I always knew,also, that you would stick with the acting thing.
Hooper manages the neat trick of paying homage to the slasher tradition that he himself launched so long ago with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" while also adding some dimension and wit to the proceedings by virtue of a nicely detailed Hollywood urban legend angle.
This movie also has a kooky supporting cast that is also well played out one that stands out in remembrance is the character of the weird and shy repairman, his look is that of a grungy, careless non responsible individual and often leads you to believe that HE could be the man behind the mask....is he?
He has approached this "exploring the unknown" in several films including "The Funhouse", "Poltergeist", and of course, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Toolbox" really brings us back to the classic form of screen terror we have longed for since we traveled to "Salem's Lot", which was also masterfully done by Hooper.
Rance Howard is also notable as the gentle old resident who gives Bettis' character hints along the way.
I also regret that the murderer becomes so similar to his predecessors at the end.
It also has mysterious symbols covering it's walls in key-locations.
As well as Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane, the cast also features Johnny Sheffeld in his first role as Boy, British actor Ian Hunter and Henry Stephenson.
At first Tarzan becomes jealous of Jane's full attention towards the child, but in time becomes fond of him also, and being the "father," names him Boy.
It's also been mentioned that is was Weissmuller who personally selected little John Sheffield, out of hundreds of candidates, for the role of Boy.
There is also a subplot involving Professor Mathews and Barbara (Aileen Pringle), a teacher and confidante of Betty's , who had faced the same dilemma when they were young, decided not to marry and lived to regret it.
There is also to me a bigger message about the danger of censorship in our society.
The first date scene was at its best, also.
He also does a credible job at it.
I am also a big Kyra Sedgewick fan so I hung in there hoping something(anything) would happen.
Average family comedy/drama movie that had a great cast but average story/screenplay.The script was above average though and the performances was also good.The cinematography was bad and so was the lighting.Story deals with adultery and the trials of fixing a marriage after the affair.Nothing spectacular.Only for family soap comedy/drama fans and big fans of the lead actors.....
At least the scenery in Beaufort, S.C. (also the location of "Big Chill") is interesting.
I also think you can get past it, and I think this character did.
Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse HallstrÃ¶m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema.
This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives!
This is a great "woman's" picture that is also very entertaining for anybody.
There are many other relationships that are also very vital to the story just like they would be in real life.
The choice of the title also didn't make sense because the song really has nothing to do with the movie.
I also want to bring attention to the fact that Julia Roberts was about 27 when she made this.
That's no surprise--it was written by Callie Khouri who also wrote "Thelma & Louise".
And it also makes for a perfect date movie too, with a reminder to bring along some Kleenex for the finale.
(America Ferrera also has a small role as a college student from the states who smuggles babies across the border to help reunite them with their patents).
She also sends presents that make her son the envy of the town where he lives.
It also pulls at your heartstrings.
We also get a good profile of the mother, her best friend and a wonderful man she meets during this story, which takes place in one week.
Its significance is found in its simplicity Â while our heart strings are being tugged, our eyes are also being opened.
Ligiah Villalobos's lean screenplay never loses sight of the prize long enough to find itself off course but it is also never afraid to talk about the reality illegal immigrants must face on the streets of a supposedly great country.
While we want with great desperation to see mother and son reunite, we are also exposed to the reality imposed by our own ignorance upon such innocent hopefuls.
Before the half of the movie I presumed the big twist about the Nick's character but it was hidden and portrayed in a fine way that when the answer is shown to the audience, you don't feel so much surprise but also you don't feel cheated in any way.
My overall reaction to this lame flick is one of disgust---disgust with the dolts who wrote, produced and directed this waste of cinematographic effort, and also with the fact that this movie is so incredibly insulting to those who are disabled.
I was also left thinking that the movie industry must truly be at the bottom of the barrel if a movie based on such an intelligence-insulting script was even produced and expected to be digested as actual cinema.
Hope Marie,(Taryn),"Nactropolis",94, worked together with Donna and also showed a great deal of her body parts.
If you like this film you may also enjoy "Against Their Will: Women in Prison", starring Judith Light as a woman who was unjustly imprisoned.
Mr. Clinton also did nothing.
Susan obviously is the focus of this film but the personality is from a GA women (Daniel in the film) who also was released.
Then of course it was also the beginning of end-less violence and computer generated special effects which youth saw and popularized as an extension of their video games.
It's also a movie that makes you sad that you don't see Melanie Mayron more.
As a loveable sleazebag, Martin is great...and, of course, Joan Cusack is also great.
There are also many humorous quotes that apply to everday life.
Vinnie also goes through a bit of character development like Barney, getting out of the business and eventually to start saving up to build a baseball park.
The movie also has a really strong supporting cast, with some big and well known respected names in it.
Rick Moranis also has never been more appealing as the unfortunate agent who handles Vinnie's affairs.
Fred also partners with Ginger Rogers in I'll be Hard to Handle.
There were also the exquisite, exciting, beautiful gowns and furs.
Her portrayal of this character shows also the same neurotic qualities we see in Allan.
The whole idea of Humphrey Bogart teaching him how to get women was just hysterical to me also.
While I like the extreme silliness of these earlier starring films, I also see this as a welcome change and his most personally engaging film--it really has a lot of heart.
At the same time, Linda and Dick (Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts), his married friends, also make their appearance and try to see if prospective matches can take Allan off of his arrested development.
It's also a bit strange and almost comical to hear Dick threaten to kill Linda's lover.
As much as he feels sympathy for his friend Dick's dilemma Allen is at the same time also in a way embarrassingly impressed, in he fact that Dick unknowingly thinks of him as being a big ladies man, by it.
it was also strange that even though Dick knew that Allen was with Linda all the time he was away from her and that she even mentioned his name in her sleep Dick for the life of him couldn't put two and two together.
There's a fine balance struck between what one would see in countless other Allen films involving the neurotics in relationships, the mockery placed on the 'normal' people who just cannot connect with the Allen persona, and also with a side of the wacky comedy bits that one sees in Allen's writings at the time (lots of homage, parody, self-referential dialog, etc).
I think it also helps if you are a Bogart fan, such as myself.
I also like the 1950s remake: "Lovely to Look At".
The only woman who seems to be ideal for Allan is Linda Christie (Diane Keaton), a close friend and, also, the wife of Allan's best friend, Dick (Tony Roberts).
Credit should also be given to Ross for bringing Allen's picture-perfect screenplay to life and also to cinematographer Owen Roizman for capturing the picturesque San Francisco locations while evoking classic Hollywood in key scenes.
His best friends--couple Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts--try to help also.
It's also somewhat dated in 1970s dialogue and fashion.
There's also a running joke involving Roberts and telephones that doesn't work today.
It is an affectionate take-off on "Casablanca" and other old films also.
She turns out to be a little more unhappy than he is but is also very funny in her darkness.
Bogie also appears - flawlessly portrayed by Lacy - and attempts to assist Woody out of his doldrums with decidedly mixed results.
This film also features the first screen pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton, who would, of course, go on to make Allen's masterpiece 'Annie Hall', along with Tony Roberts, who also co-stars here.
The humour in this film is awesome and also amazingly funny.
As the man festers in his own pathos; we can really believe it, and this gives the film a great sense of believability and also offers up a prime example of Allen acting at his best.
The film isn't a complete one-man show, however, as the underrated Tony Roberts, along with Diane Keaton also give grand performances.
Pretending to be interested in buying a house for their poor, aging father they meet the housing project's head-honcho, who is also the first resident of Oasis Plains.
He also explains that John does care about Sam and checked on Sam all the time when he was at college.
First of all HE'S adorable, so that helps, but it's also just a cute little glimpse of his life.
I wonder why it was named Â¨La Frontera.Â¨ I also wonder why Maite does not go with Ramillo.
The acting was also excellent.
Caper movies are among my favorites (maybe, it's because I work in a bank) but this is a very mild addition to that exciting thriller subgenre Â chiefly because of an unconvincing plot also involving child kidnapping, a counter robbery from a church to mislead the Israeli police, the gang donning a series of silly disguises and, ultimately, a burglary which remains unfulfilled (again, a fashionable twist in the cynical 1970s but rather ludicrous in this context!
This is also Katt's original material.
Usually I'm more into cartoons meant for grown-ups (Rocko, Ren & Stimpy, Simpsons, Futurama, Cow & Chicken and so), but I also do like stuff like Spongebob.
Not only that the verbal jokes are funny, but also the drawings are silly enough to make my flat mate laugh who isn't into cartoons at all.
And also: sorry if my English is not perfect.
10/10 and give the Simpsons also a 10/10
It won the Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour) (also nominated 4 times) and twice for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, and it was nominated for Outstanding Music and Lyrics.
The witty lines and many many pop culture, science, and sci-fi references are just as good as those used in the more widely known "The Simpsons", also created by Matt Groening.
Without telling too much more, Fry realizes he can start his life over, but he also realizes that he knows nothing about this world.
Some of the material was clearly put there merely to be controversial, to tick off the censors and/or otherwise provoke, and while there are points where you can definitely tell that PhD's wrote this, there certainly are also ones where it doesn't feel like that at all.
The characters in Futurama also have overbites like the characters in the Simpsons.
Fry also meets Amy, Hermes, and Dr. Zoidberg.
I also found some endings to Futurama are incredibly sad and depressing.
There is also a good collection of secondary characters such as Dr Zoidberg the incompetent company doctor who is a crustacean, Zapp Brannigan, leader of the Democratic Order Of Planet's military leader who is also infatuated with Leela.
She also supposedly supplies many of the costume designs for the characters in the plot (which were actually created by Bernard Newman, and were wonderful).
What also is very unique is the characters are all different and each have there own opinions which provide an excellent contrast in the series.
I've also given it to nephews and the children of friends.
There's also a nice moral at the end about little brothers and sisters.
this is one very well done film.i wouldn't say it is a comedy,but it certainly is a romance/drama.either way.it's very well written,with snappy dialogue,and great acting by all concerned.there are some real acting heavyweights of the time here.Clark Gable is the headliner,and it's no wonder he was a star.the guy oozes screen presence and charisma even on the small scree.Jean Harlow,called the the ultimate and first true sex symbol sex symbol by some(but also a very talented actress)lends great supporting talent.Myrna Loy(Nora Charles from the Thin Man series of movies,co starring William Powell)is also excellent.James Stewart shows glimmers of his greatness,in a fairly small role,only his fourth credited feature film appearance.there are so many other great supporting players in the cast too numerous to mention.when you have talent like this together,it's hard to have bad film.for me,Wife vs Secretary is a strong 8/10
The character of Whitey also has a heart and this is shown perfectly when she tells Linda to go back to Van or she (Whitey) won't turn him away when he turns to her.
It's obvious that Van is head over heels in love with his wife yet (most notably in the Havana motel room scene) you can also see that he's fighting an attraction to Whitey.
In a fascinating scene that takes place between Gable and Harlow in a Haitian hotel, the film suggests that the key to making relationships work lies not in avoiding temptation (which it also suggests is impossible anyway), but in knowing how to say "no" to it when it arrives.
This questioned is answered somewhat through testimonies but also quite literally by showing viewers photographs before they were cropped, such as the infamous leach photograph.
Morris also blatantly hints towards the fact that every cell block in every prison in Iraq is performing this sort of torture to this degree.
When it is revealed that during an amnesty period after the Abu G scandal was revealed many photos and other documents were handed in a shredded, we get, not just a slow mo of shredded paper falling through the air, we get also get an entire cell block filled with bits of paper.
I credit the film maker with allowing the soldiers involved to present some part of their story and also allowing one soldier to point out that only soldiers at lower levels would suffer prosecution.
The story of the period of between September 2003 and February 2004 at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq is so well known not only from the news media but also from the Internet blogging sites that it need not be outlined in a review of this film.
Given the atrocities documented by this film, the style of the film as a work of cinema deserves to be addressed also.
Morris also makes it clear that these low level individuals - many of whom have served time in prison for their crimes - were most certainly used as scapegoats for higher-ups in the military who managed to successfully deflect any personal culpability for the events that took place there.
They do admit their process included sleep deprivation, hypothermia, loud noises, and also, when they lost patience or just felt like it, random physical abuse.
We also learn that no worthwhile information came out of interrogations at the prison.
The score by Danny Elfman with its heavy-handed drumbeat sounds introduces frantic melodrama, also superfluous and in bad taste.
While England, Harman and the others were just following orders and living in a deeply affecting environment, they are also human beings endowed with free will.
Astaire and Rogers had been such a success in "Flying Down to Rio", that today the true stars of the film are almost forgotten (Gene Raymond and Dolores Del Rio) and they also shone in "The Gay DivorcÃ©e" (1934).
He is also angry at Stephanie for selling the dress (which she did under duress).
It's not only enough that there isn't much of a story(training, training and a brief encounter with the Germans), the film is also filled with silly dialogue and stupidity all along.
It's also important to note that everything about this movie is a pure clichÃ©.. Bolton's character and those around him are built around our expectations based on other war films like "The Devil's Brigade".
It also whispers silent movie, like the one part where the Doc goes in to do some surgery and there's no more gloves.
He also has a teenage schoolgirl boarded up in his basement, the less said about which the better.
The ending is also annoyingly empty of any kind of meaning at all, with the movie more or less simply being over at some point.
We've also seen events like the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina where social order has completely broken down, resulting in the kind of mind boggling escapades depicted in the latter part of the film.
We have to watch them again these old films, these first talkies, to ,be able to appreciate what modern films have to offer but also what we have lost along the way, a lot more than we may think, and particularly the magic of black and white illusion.
A third Hitchcock film, "The Birds", was also based on her work).
Pengallan was played by that old ham Charles Laughton, who also acted as co-producer and insisted on rewriting the script to give his character greater prominence.
Laughton was also responsible for the casting of O'Hara, even though Hitchcock had not wanted to use her after a poor screen test.
Nevertheless, the film is one of Hitchcock's weakest, lacking not only the drama and suspense we have come to associate with Hitchcock but also the touches of humour he often used to lighten the mood.
Randolph Scott, Helen Westley and Claire Dodd also star in this dated-but-generally fun movie.
Emlyn Williams also plays a delightfully sinister and menacing character -- I mistook him at first for Robert Newton (being prejudiced by the latter's subsequent typecasting).
While it was directed by Hitchcock, it doesn't feel like a Hitchcock movie at all, and the true auteurs of the film are the dialogue writer (separate from screenplay writer in the credits), Sidney Gilliat, and the star, who is also the villain, Charles Laughton.
This would also be part of the reason for JAMAICA INN's low rating - the following year Hitch would do Du Maurier's REBECCA, as his first Hollywood film, his first film with David Selznick, and it would be his only film to win the Oscar as best picture.
JAMAICA INN would also be the first of two films that Hitch made with Charles Laughton.
We also learn (this is no spoiler; we find out very early in the movie) that the mastermind is the effete, mannered Sir Humphrey.
The story is from a book by Daphne Du Maurier, who was apparently one of Hitchcock's favorite authors (he also did films of her "Rebecca" and "The Birds", both much more well known than this film).
I'm not a huge expert on Hitchcock in particular though, but I have noticed the humor involved in his suspense scenes, a device he also used in "The Lady Vanishes" and all the way through "North by Northwest."
Leslie Banks' work in the film was probably the most impressive in my opinion because he also had the broadest character to work with, and managed to make this character work as a human being.
Maureen O'Hara is also amazing in an unusual role in 1939 of a strong woman in her first lead role.
Irene Dunne reminds me of Greer Garson in having a certain soulfulness combined with innate gentility and enormous warmth - Dunne also happens to have had a world-class operatic singing voice (that in later movies, as operettas ceased to be appealing, was seldom heard).
Randolph Scott has a big, clean, very handsome, American quality that is also wonderfully suited to this part - one in which his character is candid, straightforward, easily swayed by others who are sophisticated -but at a certain point will act decisively when he comes to realize his judgment has been mistaken.
We also have a Georgian dandy in the person of Charles Laughton who has a lascivious eye for Maureen O'Hara.
It was also after being dumped by his girlfriend, who would later marry his best friend Bob, Elsie Reyonolds-Doe Avedow- and his brother Tim suddenly dropping dead, after having a violent argument with him, that changed Brady's way of thinking.
This lead to what is now known as the "Kansas City Massacre" that cost the lives of a number of FBI Agents who were taking Lazetti, who was also killed, to Washington to testify.
On top of all that there's also a federal charge in the murder of the FBI Agents, as well as fixing both federal and state elections, also hanging over Brady's head.
If you liked Asphalt Jungle you probably would also like The Boss.
In the days before social welfare became a responsibility of government, these bosses while they enriched themselves also fed a lot of hungry people, giving them food and fuel for a winter.
Truman himself was honest, but he also winked and nodded at the corruption of others and some of the cronies he put into office as president embarrassed him no end.
It's also quite true that Pendergast did make a deal with organized crime there who did open speakeasies in Kansas City like every place else in the USA.
agents and also killed the crook they were trying to rescue, Frank 'Jelly' Nash.
The infamous Team Rocket is also in this, but their role is very minute and does not have any purpose.
I also recommend the reviews by the eminent British critic Philip French, who has much of interest to say about the sources for Greene's screenplay.
There's also clever use of a cat involved in an eerie scene that reveals Harry Lime.
All in all, top notch, an improvement over the previous Jirachi the Wishmaker, also a much more mature story.
Along the way, the American also encounters the beautiful Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech national with forged Austrian papers, who agrees to help him.
As expected for a noir-film, there is also a dangerous femme fatale who becomes a prominent player as soon as the main protagonist reaches Austrian soil.
In addition to strong dark overtones, The Third Man also boasts a great deal of nihilism.
Not surprisingly, The Third Man works incredibly well not only as a non-stop adventure film, but also as a realistic depiction of a world struggling to recuperate after an enormous tragedy.
If anything, there is a strong anti-romantic sentiment here, not only because Anna has been irrevocably separated from Lime but she also will not be the one whom Cotten's Martins gets at the end.
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
It also helped that a great director, Carol Reed, brought it to the screen.
Many parts of this doco spell out the conflict that exists within the band, but there is also a genuine feel (especially from Lars and James) that they'll sort the problems out themselves.
I also believe Holier Than Thou, Don't Tread on Me, The God That Failed, My Friend of Misery and The Struggle Within are underrated.
I also agree with you that its not their best.
He also was intrigued with the new 3-D process, which was to be used in the Grace Kelly/Ray Milland potboiler.
Gwyneth Paltrow as Emily Bradford Taylor is also a great character, because although she is having an affair with another man, she's prepared to come clean with her husband before he tries to have her murdered.
She is also tough and resourceful enough to survive the attack, and then smart enough to put the pieces together afterward.
Emily obviously would not protect Steven at that point since she not only didn't love him anymore but also had a reasonable belief that the thug was hired by her husband to kill her for her inheritance.
"Wizard" is also laced with running themes about Hollywood union lock-down.
The central set piece is well executed, and the build up to it is well done also; but it has to be said that the film starts to fall apart a little after that.
There were also some LOVELY things to see in this film like, the Turkish baths and messages.
I really liked this movie and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Vincent Perez and who also likes good French films.
The costuming was also really good, with an accurate portrayal of what society would wear in that time period.
Another note, I also really liked the music used in the film, it portrayed the wittiness of the dialogue.
The right dating seems to be 1750's, when Diderot should have been about his 40, as it comes also from his daughter age and from Boucher's painting, which the company views during the sideshow in the end of the movie.
The Planet is an interesting summary of today's environmental problem, covering such topics as global warming, but also less well known topics (albeit still very important) such as resource exploitation and waste management.
The mood of the movie is also set by rather dramatic music, which clearly emphases that these issues are important and have to be taken seriously.
The movie is not only about experts telling us about the situation today, but you also get to see "normal" people that have an opinion about the subjects in the movie, like the Chinese businessman and his take on resource exploitation as well as global warming or why not the workers from waste centers in Nigeria.
This dramatical tone is also what drags the movie down somewhat, as it can be too intense and too much to swallow, particularly if the topic's are new to you.
Wendell Mayes' hardened script (who adapted the screenplay from Daniel Ford's 'Incident at Muc Wa') is precisely stimulating in its text be it personal or tactical, but also worked in is some welcoming humor.
Despite the cheap origins 'Go Tell The Spartans' is an accomplished effort deserving a lot more merit, both meaningful and scathing without being pushy in its text, but also visuals.
The replacements are a really mixed bag, a sergeant who Lancaster has served with before and respects highly in Jonathan Goldsmith, a very green and eager second lieutenant in Joe Unger, a demolitions man who is a draftee and at that time Vietnam service was a strictly volunteer thing in Craig Wasson, and a medic who is also a junkie in Dennis Howard.
It also leads me to consider this an anti-war film.
Lancaster also disregarded a serious knee injury he suffered in order for him to star in the movie which had him limping all throughout the film!
The intent here is to entertain, nothing more...but also, nothing less.
Remaining still existing pictures of Lon Chaney in full make-up effect added to the hype of this movie and also the fact that this Tod Browning movie features vampires, 4 years before he made the horror-classic "Dracula", starring Bela Lugosi.
It's an attempt to retell the story and show how the movie must have been like, also with the help of persons who had actually seen the 1927 movie at the time of its release.
It makes the movie confusing and also from an engaging one to watch.
A 1935 sort of remake of this movie, also directed by Tod Browning and starring Lionel Barrymore and Bela Lugosi.
Like mentioned before, the make-up effects also looked really convincing and are now part of the movie its legacy and status among movie lovers.
The use of stills also probably saved us from being distracted with some ham acting as well.
It's also a very funny movie.
A further link to The Blood Drinkers is Amalia Fuentes, who also produced CurseÂ under her real name Amalia Muhlach for her own production company.
Mathis is also way off as a park ranger, or something like a park ranger.
The music also (composed by Hans Zimmer) is very good.
There's also the underlying meanings of piece hidden under the rising bodycount.
There's also some talent on show.
it's a terrific parody of the inner workings of Hollywood, and it's backed up my absolutely amazing animation and special effects by Mr. Jittlov, who also does a wonderful job as the main character (himself), and the police dog.
I also liked the character's here, the relationships between Hale & the sexy park ranger & between Hale & Deakins in particular, I just thought the character's & the way they were written & developed were better than the average action flick with themes like friendship & betrayed.
This is one of the finest piece of action escapism in years, it's also one of the most stylish ones.
The film's plot resembles that of the previous year's hit SPEED, which may due to the writer being Graham Yost, who also wrote that recent blockbuster hit.
The love interest isn't an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something, but a park ranger, also doing her duty.
(I also recommend Jittlov's many short movies, such as Animato, Good Grief and the original short version of the WoSaT.
I also think that filming this on video and using footage from the video camera in the film enhanced the realism.
An employee in a bank, he also lives in a modest suburban house until one day, his former chum approaches him again to prompt him to attend a TV show about celebrity doubles.
An outstanding performance then from him but also from his two co-stars the beautiful Julie Depardieu and the always disconcerting Jean-Paul Rouve.
For example, were this Diana character a prostitute from the start, it would not only explain why she doesn't complain to the police about her obviously illegal treatment at the strip club, but also would make her transformation at the end at lot more profound.
The film also claims at the start to have been based on a true story.
Yes, it's one of those "little guy vs. big business tyrant" films, but it's also very different, because in this case, it's about a special-effects/animation geek, a character which, if it has ever been portrayed in film, would still be nothing close to this because the man playing the part is a real special-effects designer, animator and editor.
I also rated that film 9 out of 10 stars, here on IMDb; and, feel that NAKED FEAR is a very modern adaptation of the story.
And, we have someone, who is a big game hunting enthusiast, who also helps keep the local population of strippers & prostitutes down by taking them out to the wilds in his airplane, stripping them, and giving them a head start while he tracks them down & kills them.
We also have a local sheriff's deputy, one who got a bit mouthy at a previous job that he no longer has, who is champing at the bit to put two and two together and figure out why there are so many missing girls in this town, but the sheriff (Joe Mantegna) doesn't exactly appreciate his efforts.
He is a genuinely talented person who deserved better than he got from his business partner, who played the evil producer in the movie and who also screwed Mike over royally on the movie.
Eberhardt also underplays the gore as he never shows any of the torture the hunter inflicts on Diana before letting her loose in the wild.
And then there is Wallace Ford, who was just okay in this movie and who was also underused.
Christy Cabanne, the director, would use Wallace or Wally Ford again in his later movie, The Mummy's Hand, in which Wallace Ford gave a wonderful comedic performance in what was also a much better movie.
I love the dialog in this film - particularly that of Grapewin but also of Wallace Ford as the "Great Luvalle" and Fred Kelsey as Sheriff Jenks.
EXTRAS: This version also includes some very nice Â if all too brief Â featurettes on the careers of its stars Rosiland Russell and Cary Grant and the making of the film.
There's also the original theatrical trailer.
It also spawned a slew of imitators, not the least of which was TV's *Moonlighting*.
It boggles the mind to think of how even MORE nifty the film would be is some financial angel would come along and give him the $ to complete it, creating a "director's cut" for release on DVD, with ALL his equally great short films available on the DVD, as well as other extras that Jittlov could add to the DVD also.
Even his web sites are more magnificent than most also.
This also means that any company is allowed to throw a poor-quality print onto DVD at practically no cost to them, so this is something to be wary of.
For his remake of the 1931 film 'The Front Page' (which was directed by Lewis Milestone and starred Adolphe Menjou), Howard Hawks took the story Â complete with all its witty, rapid-fire dialogue Â and changed the male character of Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson to a female Â Hildegaard 'Hildy' Johnson (Rosalind Russell) Â and also the ex-wife of the newspaper editor, Walter Burns (Cary Grant).
While Grant is no sleepwalker and puts to work his skills at being charming and amusing while also playing a conniving persona, Russell puts everything she's got into a character that is probably far stronger than Bruce can take and is just about an even match for Walter Burns's double-crossing.
The film is also perhaps the perfect example of Hawks' trademarked rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, which has never been as fast nor as furious anywhere else before or since.
Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police, and City Hall, cynical politics based on a man's life, and questions about privacy and a free press.
And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone, the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies.
He also had the cast move FAST so the film looks totally frenetic from scene to scene with no respite -- either from the laughs or from the action.
After hearing his voice from outside the window while conducting his chorus in rehearsal, Mr. Parry (Edward Chapman) manages to convince David to sing in his choir and gets him a job at the mines where he also works.
His son, Emlyn (Simon Lack) also works there and is engaged to Gwen Owen (Janet Johnson).
The BBC2 programme he did this for, also featured a few seconds of footage from proud valley.
It was also one of the best movies I have seen in a while.
It's also better because it recycles footage from the first two.
It's also cruel to a step beyond the first two--Brandon Lee grieved, Vincent Perez went masochist, but William Atherton smiles like a killer clown.
This movie also isn't as dark as the first two were.
There is also a fair amount of female nudity, as one of the settings is a strip club.
No hot guys, while there are plenty good looking girls, most of all are the "slutty" type, and there a few scenes in a strip club, so there's lots of female nudity and stripping, which they also added in unappropriate parts of the movie.
It's also a must-have for any cult film or obscure cinema collector to include in their video collection.
yes you read that right I love these movies the only reason I haven't watched The Crow: City Of Angels (1996) is that I cannot find it no matter where I go this villain is one of those "I want him to die" villains I also had never ever heard of these actors (which they were very good) besides Kirsten Dunst which we all know from Spiderman (this movie is way better) now the plot is The third entry in 'The Crow' series follows Alex Corvis, who was framed for the murder of his girlfriend and is executed.
But I must disagree, and I'll also ask if all those Crow 1 / Brandon Lee fans would be so adamant that the first film and that actor were the best thing since sliced bread if Brandon hadn't tragically died at such young age.
Erin's father Nathan (William Atherton) is also having trouble coping.
Not only the acting of the player is perfect but also it is almost unbelievable that none had every acted before.
As for the girl, she is disturbed by having a peasant boy around the house and treats him as rudely as she can though she is also pretty much interested in catching attention of Recep.
I live in Ankara capital city of the Turkey and I also went to Kutahya before.
On the side, Recep is also trying to build his own movie theatre with two friends.
This is the third film in a Rock and Roll series that also includes "Ferry Cross the Mersey" on Friday, 9/18/09 at 7:30 pm, and "The Big TNT Show" on Saturday, 9/19 at 7:30 pm.
I also saw this movie when I was young on TV in Los Angeles.
I'm somewhat afraid that it would be laughable, but judging from the other comments, I also wouldn't be surprised to see the opposite.
Apart from Nicole Kidman, there is also the very special soundtrack, which combined with the directing, create an atmosphere of intense pressure, eroticism, beauty and darkness altogether.
The "Spin and Marty" serials were also used for this purpose.
The story is told in a realistic way and all of the actors are also realistic in their roles but still the story comes across as unbelievable and not credible.
Perhaps this not only due to the story but also because how the story is told.
There are some artistic and original sequences that I rather liked, although that also is what makes "Birth" a movie that not just for everyone.
You have to be a regular movie watcher that also is able to appreciate slowly told dramas with lots of flair.
In a way it could also fit into the mystery genre.
It's probably due to the way they made it very 'comedial' and some of the ways characters talk, and also how they look.
There are plenty of mystery you can try solve in each story (Later episodes reveals the answers to the mystery, so I recommend watching them in order, it is also hard to solve the mystery with anime version due to lack of details in the story compared to the original novel).
It also boasts songs from Killa's new album, also titled 'Killa Season'.
It also tells you a little about how they came up, and how they got started.
Other characters in the film are also believable, even if not always to one's liking (hey, did someone say "true to life"?)
Tony in order to satisfy his sick sexual urges also rapes and violates the womens after he murders them having him dubbed by the local newspapers and police as the "New York Necrophilia Rapist/Killer".
There's also a ton of pointless female nudity which has nothing to do with the plot.
Seeing a survivor talk to the guards is very interesting, but they also needed someone neutral, as Vann has no patience for their explanations.
But, if this film also looked at those who did it and why, it would have been much more effective.
One of the hardest things, even now, is these perpetrators see themselves also as victims.
While it is powerful evidence, many viewers might find it emotionally less satisfying than more box-office friendly film by Roland JoffÃ©, The Killing Fields, which (symbolically) suggests the West's responsibility by the journalist who 'uses' his Cambodian friend for his own ends, and also has more of a story.
It is also kind of dry, since the movie takes place only within the walls of S-21, involving only the few survivors of the prison and some of their former jailers.
The film also comprises many talented stars, including Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Charles Martin Smith, Paul Le Mat and Harrison Ford to name but a few.
Each character paints a bold picture of the times that they are living and they are also important in the overall progression of the story.
The film is also backed by an excellent soundtrack that set the mood for each of the scenes and enable you to relive the times.
The film also has unforgettable scenes, including the drag racing scenes, the school dance, the loss of the police car axle and the cruisin' scenes.
There are also a lot of references to American Graffiti in Indy 4, by the way.
I will not mention them here, but it is obvious that you can draw references to other projects by Lucas - even to the computer game Maniac Mansion which also portrays a lot of young people who are quite similar to the characters of American Graffiti.
The film also features a young Harrison Ford (before he proved himself to be a good actor).
This movie also paved the way for future stars particularly Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, and Harrison Ford.
The movie is basically about a eventful but hectic night in 1962 that has friends cruising up and down the main street and also some wild escapades involving mooning, spraying shaving cream on car windows, and tying the wheels on a police car to break apart.
It also includes interlocking stories that eventually meet up in the last fifteen minutes of the film.
also make appearances.
This friend also has only one more night together with his beloved girlfriend.
It also does not contain those elements that are omnipresent in modern versions; unnatural lighting, a unrealistic script, profanity.
It is also a trip back to the last days of childhood, when everything was cool and easy, but we reluctantly started to realise that it would not stay like that forever.
Of course, the main protagonist is the rock'n'roll station, which broadcasts not only some of the greatest singles ever heard, but also the sum and substance of a way of life.
All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties, not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be, but also, because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...(Even Big John Milner)...
A lot of which are also really funny, and this is where my favourite part of American Graffiti comes in.
By recording each couple with hidden microphones, Werner hopes to uncover the group's plans to overthrow Hitler's regime, whilst also gathering material for blackmail.
Last but not least also the soundtrack is wonderful, beautiful pop-songs math perfectly to the story.
I liked it much more than "The Edukators", because it's more honest in a sense that it doesn't camouflage it's intent, and also because it's much more satirical.
I also really loved it, because it's so different from the standard European art-house flicks.
I also found each scene in the film to be well written, like some great scripts of the past like Good Will Hunting and the Deer Hunter, both great films.
I also give it 10 stars...
There's also a saccharine and quite repulsive score by Benny and Bjorn pre-ABBA.
M. Night Shyamala tackled a simple and realistic story and it worked, no ghosts, no superheroes, no aliens, no giant porcupines, and no water-nymphs, just a boy going through what boys go through, pure existential crisis (or in another word, "puberty") Of course it's also his lowest-rated movie on IMDb (not counting "Praying with Anger") which shows you something about the modern world.
I also liked the fact that there is very little dialogue in the movie.
However, "Wide Awake" isn't really a comedy in the same sense that Shyamalan's subsequent film "The Sixth Sense", also dealing with matters spiritual, isn't really a horror.
I had only heard of Mr. Shyamalan's "Praying With Anger," when I saw this movie, nor did I realize that he was also the director of "The Sixth Sense," which was in theaters when I saw this on pay-TV.
It is more than a movie to me.I could really relate to Joshua as i also used to think a lot about God at that age partly because i was born in a very religious family.The feelings Joshua goes through in his search for god and how it changes him to a certain extent for eg, when Freddie Waltman-a boy who has bullied Joshua since 3rd grade has to leave school...instead of feeling happy he feels really sad for him... have been narrated on screen beyond words...only a genius could have achieved this.
It reminds me very much of "The Cure", which I also enjoyed.
The film is not just a story of faith but also of growing up and realising the world is not a simple place with absolutes, rather things may not always be what they seem.
The ending turned out to be a real surprise, but I was also impressed by the portrayal of boyhood that the audience receives in the process of getting there.
But Ann Hecht also wears a red wig instead of her usual blond hair and I didn't know who she was until I read the credits at the end of the movie.
For me though Ryan Reynolds stole a lot of the scenes, as he is absolutely hilarious, and it has some great eye candy in Bridgette Wilson and Alyssa Milano, but they also give good performances, plus it's very well made and written.
One of the funniest parts in the movie for me is when Ryan Reynolds announces at a wedding that he is a raging homosexual, and also when he thinks he has slept with a man, plus it's good natured as well.
Also what I found interesting is the comic way the movie speaks about love.There was also a David (Jerry O'Connell)'s quote that called my attention which is something like this: "The worst thing is not to live a life time alone expecting the write woman to marry, but marry the wrong woman and spend the rest of your life with her" Almost every woman in this movie is gorgeous, so if one of them feel curious to know me just contact me by my e-mail.
It also faces everyday problems with dating and finding the one.
There's also the staging of the battle sequences that, like many films of this era, seems rather dated today with all its hollering and men falling over.
I also saw this movie uncut on T.V.
Everyone says it is propaganda.Did not the Germans also have their own propaganda?
They also decide they must take action themselves to stop the Germans.
And as her friend, Diora Baird was also quite convincing - and a dynamite screamer.
This sequel, or rather prequel is also a lot better than the only sequel I ever saw to the original The Next Generation as that one wasn't very gory at all and itself was sort of a remake of the original.
And as a pleasant bonus, we also are given glimpses into why the "Sheriff" is such a twisted wacko.
I also think many will be surprised at the ending of this film.
Its original in this...but its also very, VERY stupid!
The Vietnam War is cynically exploited to analogize two characters "coming of age" and "becoming men" while suffering the torments of the savage Hewitt clan (also given an un-ironic layer in R. Lee Ermey's war veteranship).
John Goodman was also very good as the police partner of Pacino.
The movie also reveals the hypocrisy, cowardice and basic stupidity of the film establishment.
I was pleased to see that Mr. Glazer has also directed Sexy Beast which is another excellent film and one of my personal favorites of the past 10 years or so.
Keller also notices that of the almost 100 personal ads only three were with rhymes or poems on them and two of those men who put poems on their ads were the two men who were found murdered.
Gruber, Richard Jenkins, whom she married, and feeling alone and spiritless over it he feels that if he retires from the police department the emptiness that would envelope him will also drive him over the edge.
They figure out pretty quickly that all the victims' lonely hearts ads were presented in poem form; they also believe the clues point to a female killer.
Al Pacino is simply perfect, showing a perfect chemistry with the sexy Ellen Barkin, who is in the top of her career, and also with John Goodman.
The soundtrack is also one of the most beautiful of the cinema, and the CD with eleven songs is fantastic.
This is one great movie, not only a thriller which it is also.
Within a kind of light and shadow there's almost a trademark photography for a film noir movie, and "Sea of Love" is a film that takes place in the shadowsÂ   Al Pacino plays Frank Teller, a self-conscious detectiveÂin search of a serial killerÂdrawn into a torrid sexual relationship with an attractive young woman he met in a super market when all the good citizens of the city are asleep and the people who are walking around are the ones who are leading the most solitary livesÂ   Helen Barkin is just so right for the partÂ You can believe her when you see her dressed in her red leather jacket and tight jeansÂ She's a lady of the night, sexy as hell, and a woman who can take care of herselfÂ Between her and Pacino, there were enough attraction that's deep but also there were feelings of vulnerability and suspicionÂ
Its also ironic - the crime-ridden world of this film is anything but a sea of love.
In fact,I realized how many things in the movie made me think for a moment (which made me watch it immediately again)and also made me feel what a true herculean effort writer/director Kamal Ahmed put into this almost,under-the-radar indie.
He is also the brother of actor Tom Noonan (You might remember him best as Ripper from The Last Action Hero), does an amazing job as a crazy old man that just might be God.
Similar to the style of Reservoir Dogs and Clerks, where the majority of the film is based on clever dialogs, the film also has that similar feel being generally filmed all in one location.
The rest of the cast is also good.
This Mr. Reincarnation was accurate down to the smallest details of how his actions should be as an adult while also displaying how his vehicle was still that of a child's.
"Amar te duele" is a word game, which is in my humble opinion, an extremely  nice addition; besides the normal translation of "Love hurts you", it also means "Loving you hurts" and "To mars it hurts", the last phrase refers to a song (which is in the movie's soundtrack) that begins saying "I will love you from here to Mars".
Thousands, sure... but art is also found in interpretation.
I should say that the way they met is also very realistic.
A great film, as soon as I saw it it made my top 10, I see almost every mexican film that comes out, and this is close to a masterpiece, the story is a little cliche, but it has a good screenplay, and the photography is just wonderful, and includes camera effects that are new in the mexican film industry; The soundtrack also integrates perfectly to the story, and is reduced to mostly mexican artists.
Mr. Sarinana also gets great performances of the large ensemble cast.
The fact that we do not dismiss the reincarnation idea as completely ludicrous owes much to the fantastic acting - not just by Kidman but by the supporting cast also.
They earned a few dollars ( both men being broke ) and also gained the attention of the son of the the bigwig.
Moody, who is also a drifter, is a most persuasive character ( a "skill" he has acquired via his many years on the road) and he has little trouble in tricking the reluctant new owner into parting with the dog.
This also created the infamous thing-hits-camera-and-camera-goes-blank.
Finally a Dutch movie that dares to handle the subject of immigrants, in a fun and yet also critic way.
It's very direct in its storytelling and it also doesn't hold back.
It does give the movie a sort of natural feeling at times but also at times the weak acting worked distracting.
Like many European countries, who has seen an increase of immigrants from North Africa and Turkey the last couple of decades, Netherlands also has it's own share of imported culture.
They thought that the film didn't have the intention to enjoy native Dutch people also, and as a consequence little riots broke out.
Later on Michi and two other co-workers notice that within Taguchi's files there is a strange picture of his own room and what seems to be Taguchi standing still to the side of his computer, which is also showing the same image.
Apart from the many problems I have with the movie in terms of production-value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring.
It was also too difficult to believe that Joseph, Anna's family, and the child's parents would permit him to literally move into Anna's apartment.
She captures Anna's desperation and fragility, but also her privileged lifestyle and upbringing, and the mad undercurrents grief has brought about.
All Japanese are also known for being very polite, but with this comes a sort of isolation with avoidance of almost any physical contact.
If this piques your interest, don't hesitate to see it, and it's best to watch it at night by yourself, or at least with a friend who also wants to concentrate on it, because it has a profoundly atmospheric, desolate, and almost dreamlike mood that shouldn't be broken by side conversation.
Along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled.
Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, "Pulse" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors.
The script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & Kairo is also the most downright boring film I've sat through this year.
There's also a heavy emphasis on the evils of suicide.
Not to mention, the lighting and cinematography in this film is also really well done, and adds a lot to the completely creepy mood throughout.
I also don't like nonsensical supernatural horror that uses creepy images as a gimmick without actually bothering to make any sense.
But he also thinks that, as a professional Hunter, Dean should be able to understand the bigger issues here.
("You took care of me, you took care of Sammy...") And that was also just hours after the events of "Devil's Trap," where John heard Dean begging Sam to not shoot John, stopping Sam from killing the YED once and for all.
We are also reconnected with a character from the past.
There was actually another craze that swept the western world during the early part of the decade also; What was it you may ask?
It was inevitable of course that these seemingly semi-mystical beings would break out into other entertainment mediums also.
Unfortunately, our veteran ninja is also being hotly pursued by a fellow ninja from his clan (Kosugi) who is incessantly intent on sending him to the great beyond.
It's also disgusting.
The movie is also lighthearted as Dai's friends provide some comic relief.
It's also of course got a few nasty scenes.
It's also got a bit of comedy in the movie too.
Germans or Japanese who fought against the overwhelming powers of the Allies committed also "heroic" acts (and wasteful as well!
This exaggeration is self-deceit and also very dangerous, because it blindens oneself for reality which in the long run has very negative effects.
With incredible graphics (the characters are a far cry from the blockyness of 7) and a new magic system, 8 also has an intreguing storyline that follows young squall around the world.
To Hell and Back is his story, but it's also the story of the men who served with him, those who came back from hell and those who remained.
To Hell and Back also shows what a roll of the dice combat is.
It also shows the sorrow and tragedy of war very well, throwing in some romantic moments here and there, which is nice relief from all the action.
Although Col. Tom Moore was only an on scene adviser he also relived some of the scenes(his own admission) that were depicted in "..Soldiers..."
I was very disappointed, not only by the movie, but also by the commentaries included in the DVD (American edition).
I also found the movie very arrogant, in the sense that it made me think that Fellini wanted the audience to believe that they were watching not only a movie but "art".
Unpredictable action is revealed particularly at the end but also throughout the movie where we do not know constantly what is ahead of us, like it is the case with the future.
Claudette marries George Brent and they raise the son she has by Welles and they also have a son of their own.
Its irritating aspect is coupled with and impossible to separate from the grasp it has upon the potency of what our psyche hides in among its hidden, ancestral folds - in this case, Marcello Mastroianni's character's but also our very own.
I guess the fact that things are rarely LITERALLY represented in his later movies (post-La Dolce Vita), also contributes towards this, making everything more symbolic and hence, universal.
But CittÃ  delle donne is also a shrill, over-the-top movie, grating in some ways, ridiculous, dated in others.
But the movie, though flawed and a rehash of some other familiar Fellini themes treated more successfully elsewhere, is also delightful in parts, with a power in the use of visual symbols that I have rarely seen before, even in his own, more overall successful movies.
When it finally arrived as a pay-less version, it has been TANGO DOWN!I read, somewhere, that must be also a motion picture in production, based upon the Clancy's Novel.
The way to play is here: you choose the weapons, the equipments and the men, you can made a plan, and you got to accomplish mission, such as defuse bombs, rescue and escort hostages... you CAN KILL TERRORISTS, OF COURSE, BUT THEY ALSO CAN KILL YOU, OR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS, OR THE HOSTAGES, so you must TOOK CARE... when the character that you're using dies, you get the control of another team member since they're all gone (you loose) or the mission is accomplished (you win), but you also loose if hostages are killed, or the bomb explodes, it depends from the mission.
In this sense, also knowing how Che's story ends, and regretfully waiting for it to come, proves to be an exercise in death as his own life was, accepting it in many forms with clear revolutionary ideals, fighting to the death against oppression and "sheephood" in a way that simply doesn't exist anymore.
The look into Che is also a contrast to American assumptions (especially today when everyone is clamoring about how we're becoming a communist state)
There is also--and this is the big giveaway about who this epic was made for--no hindsight critique of either Che himself, nor crucially of the manipulated peasants who eventually sell him out to their own government.
With these, he also maintains this title as an auteur.
That audience is one not just willing and interested to learn more about this iconic and influential revolutionary and historical leader but also one who can appreciate the angle which Soderbergh is going for.
Even when his moves and postures express the work of someone who has intensely studied a historical figure and traveled for his purpose and God knows what else, his collaboration with Soderbergh is also crucial.
We may never know how accurate it is historically speaking but both Part I and Part II of CHE prove not only Director Steven Soderbergh's sharp skills in the art of film-making but also Benicio Del Toro's ability to make us believe he is Che Guevara.
The story also has a good amount of comic-relief played by some of the characters within his little army.
The New York scenes also illustrate the opposition to Che, both within the UN and out on the streets, which give the film an added depth politically and socially.
The film is also helped by Soderbergh's wonderful visuals - the forests look amazing, and the streets gritty etc, and the careful use of music.
Che also spends more time doctoring, reading and tutoring math than engaging the enemy, though he does manage at one point to assert action hero status grabbing a bazooka from an inept subordinate and firing a direct hit.
Soderburgh also handles the action set pieces with great sound and charisma.
A fine example is when two brothers of only 16 and 14 wanted to join the revolutionaries, they were with some other people that certainly also wanted to fight and the brothers were the only ones who knew how to read and write, they will stay and we will see how when all of the revolutionaries had the last chance to stop fighting they will not leave Che and they will have the option to leave the fight but certainly with their honor intact.
But he is also a hated figure by the anti-Castro Miami Cubans, not least for the bloody executions that followed his socialist revolution (a period conveniently ignored in the movie.)
Of course, apart from the OceansÂ series of films, Soderberg has shown he is socially aware by also directing Erin Brockovich, Traffic (again with Del Toro), and The Good German, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised that he decided to tackle the story of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.
He also was not afraid to lead the charge and stand at the frontlines without fear of death.
Along with the battles, these scenes also help to break up the slower parts of the film.
The black and white scenes are also well shot, without feeling out of place.
Che may also be shown in a better light than some would like, although honestly I feel the film is fairly accurate in its portrayal of the man and the history.
I always find director Steven Soderbergh's experiments interesting because they challenge the spectator and they go beyond the common.The Argentine also falls on that category.This a fascinating movie and it clearly is one of the best I have seen this year.Soderbergh made a wonderful work as a director because of the excellent performances he got from the cast and for his extreme attention to the details.Benicio del Toro brings a monumental performance as Che Guevara.He completely becomes on him and he never seems to be acting.DemiÃ¡n Bichir also brings a magnificent performance as Fidel Castro.This movie kept me very entertained and it brings a very valid and important message.The only fail I found on this movie was that it was a little bit long on a specific moment.But that's a minor fail.The Argentine is a fascinating experiment I liked very much.This is one of that movies which challenge the spectator and have something to say and I really admire that.I totally recommend this film.
The fact that Del Toro is fluent in Spanish also helps, as does a rallying and unknown supporting cast that work well as a low-key ensemble.
So what we get in Part 1, the conventional "Rise" of the character in the story, is the tale of how to do a revolution right- or rather, how to take over a government by military force, and it's Che as a man who pretty quickly becomes a natural leader, a stern taskmaster and also someone who "loves" as a revolutionary must, Che says.
On top of the Soderbergh's own lush photography I was also stirred by Alberto Iglesias' insistent, original but unobtrusive score.
The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat, leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.
It is also very tight.
There's also a 'guest star' role for Jack Palance who plays a rival gunslinger.
He is also reunited with his Django lead man, Franco Nero (here speaking for himself rather than being dubbed, which is very welcome), as well as having prominent Italian actor Tony Musante and Hollywood veteran Jack Palance on board for his most high-class line up yet.
There had also been a growing use of symbolism in Corbucci's pictures and by this point he was become almost arty.
The Morricone piece which accompanies this stand off Â a triumphant Mexican march which would later be plundered by Quentin Tarantino for Kill Bill Â is also comparable to that composer's work with Leone.
While, the army might be on the rebels' tails, but also too is another gunslinger that has a score to settle with the two men.
Sergio Corbucci direction is the key also because the story isn't planned out with any real sort of purpose but just to stage one comical scene or action packed moment.
Despite her belated entrance in the film, Giovanna Ralli makes quite an impression as a fiery Mexican woman who hitches up with Musante; Euro-Cult and Spaghetti Western regular Eduardo Fajardo is also on hand as the requisite figure of oppression (who, at one point, is made to eat a living lizard by Musante!).
While Paco is a crook, but also an idealist, becoming more and more idealistic after his troop is joined by beautiful and idealistic Columba, a woman whose father was a revolutionary , the Polish is a typical anti-hero, witty and cool and somehow sympathetic, but mainly concerned on his own benefit.
In many ways it is similar to Companeros and if you liked that wonderful film you will also love this.
There is also a nod to Macbeth when Paco's woman uses his power drunk naivetÃ© to convince him to turn against Nero.
For fans of Japanese transgressions I'd also recommend "Flesh Meat Doll" series, "Niku Daruma", "Raping My Virgin Slave", "Death Woman", "Squirmfest" and some nasty Nikkatsu pinku eiga.
The main story is about war surround by a love story between Rinoa and Squall (Rinoa has txhe best outfit in the game) Seifer is also a good character.
It is my personal observation that the Soong sisters are also the 3 major representatives of the Chinese people today, but if only they could work together like the Soong sisters...
The main story is about war surround by a love story between Rinoa and Squall (Rinoa has the best outfit in the game) Seifer is also a good character.
Jiang Wen (outspoken Charlie Soong) also a favourite actor of mine, Winston Chou (charismatic Sun Yatsen) and Kuo Chiuwu (commanding Chiang Kaishek) are powerful and haunting.
This motif also reflects the increased role of women in Chinese social and political life, as they are liberated from the foot-binding that hobbled previous generations.
I also loved the theme music in the movie.
It also set the stage for two vastly inferior sequels (without Matthau or O'Neal).
It also makes great use of music from Bizet's Carmen.
It was also another starring vehicle for young and precocious Tatum O'Neal.
It was also a breath of relief for me, because the charactes were finally tall (at least compared to the other FF characters and just down right kicked butt)  So, despite the complaints of FFVIII being to futuristic and the not so great inplay graphics; the music, FMVs, plot, and characters will make up for it and blow you away!
Vic Morrow also stars as rival coach Roy Turner whose team is more focused than the other.
Not only that but the town rebel, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earl Hayley), with points to prove, has also been prompted to join.
It also delightfully doesn't resort to type for its finale.
One of the "rejects" not drafted by a Little League team, has a father who is also a City Councilman, can you say lawsuit?
A former minor-league pitcher (The late Oscar-Winner:Walter Matthau), who is now a pool cleaner and he's also a grumbling beer-guzzling man.
The Kids are also fun in this movie.
The movie manages also to have some strong dramatic moments (especially the late Vic Morrow as Matthau's rival in a standout scene towards the conclusion).
DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer, which it is also grainy at times but always sharp in the picture quality.
DVD also has an fine digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in the original Mono soundtrack).
This movie was a major surprise back in 1976 and it was also one of the top grossing films of that year.
It's also touching, as the portrayal of early-adolescent personalities is often quite moving, between gut-busting guffaws.
I think we go to the movies to be entertained, yes, but remember one persons idea of what is "Trash" can also be another persons "Tresure".
Buttermaker's solution to overcoming the Bears' respect problems also feels a bit of a dodge: He brings in a couple of ringers, Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neal) and Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley), both of whom add to the film, but water it down some, too, diluting the connection between Buttermaker and the original Bears.
Later he also manages to get another good all-around player, Tanner Boyle (Chris Barnes).
Joyce Van Patten is also good as the butch, outspoken league supervisor.
One of Walter Matthau's many triumphs, and Tatum O'Neal as the pitching ace is also terrific (especially in the dug-out scene where she tries involving Matthau in her life and he cracks, sending her away in tears: "You don't wanna go, fine, no big deal.").
It is also refreshing that the movie does not have the typical Hollywood ending, but instead one that is fitting for the team sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds.
Bad News Bears is also a great reminder of life in the late 1970s, the uniforms, clothes, cars, etc.
On a sadder note, I also couldn't help being impressed with how far this culture has regressed since 1976.
She also identifies the driver "Good Looking Freddie" (he isn't)(Matty Roubert).
The hero gets put in jail after the leader of the ring, Mr. Murray(who also happens to be a customer of his girlfriend), plants marked money on him and sends the cops in to arrest him.
The film humanizes the gay marriage debate, focusing not only on the emotional impact of marriage for individual same-sex couples, but also the under-dog fight faced by local legislators and those in political action committees who have devoted their lives to the issue.
This documentary should also be a must-see for any straight married couple - it may make them stop taking their union and each other for granted - after all, it's a right that is not afforded to all.
It also puts a face to this volatile issue, and it makes you confront your own prejudices.
This movie has also actually changed how much I value gay marriage!
Make sure to also see Saints and Sinners, directed by Abigail Honor, another great movie, dealing with gay marriage.
It can also be used very effectively as an educational tool when trying to educate straight audiences about this issue and why it has become so important to the gay and lesbian community on all these levels.
It gave it a real 'cliffhanger' feel, and I also felt like I was there in the middle of the action.
They also do a nice job fashioning a clear plot for the audience to follow and become emotionally invested in (I was personally moved to tears a number of times during the film) and did a nice job building the drama around the key turning points for the bills under debate.
This is also a film that is filled with passion and as you watch you heart fills with pride.
I could also understand her amazement at finding that her son could do more than she thought he could.
There is also a point made that moms who don't want to put their children into an institution are just using their kids to make themselves feel special.
I also have a problem with the all-or-nothing ending: David's mom surely should have found a way to see him daily, while allowing him the advantages that trained professionals could offer.
The always reliable Stockard Channing is also featured as her snobbish sister and Sam Waterston is charming as a man Alley gets involved with but this is Alley's movie and she forsakes any pretense of glamor to realistically portray an unsympathetic character in a difficult situation who somehow still manages to make us feel for her even though we know that a lot of what this woman does and feels is just wrong.
There are also interviews with the Producers, special effects departments, actors, directors, and more, more, more.
The show is hosted by Mark Kermode (also of "On The Edge Of Blade Runner" fame), who narrates the whole show, and is on hand to give little quips about the production of the films.
For the most part this is a sunnier and funnier than usual noir, particularly light in tone when the action goes south of the border, and some of this is probably due to the simpler charms of Payne Â no Bogart or Mitchum though effective enough Â but also the screenplay which keeps the hoods and pretend-hood switching guns and one-upping each other often enough that it becomes more than a little comic.
I was also surprised (in a good way) that the movie showed some of the police as corrupt - by showing a false arrest and eventual beating.
John Payne stars in "Kansas City Confidential," a 1952 noir also starring Preston Foster, Colleen Gray, Jack Elam, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef.
It has a considerable, significant dramatic energy and elastic vigor that might remind one of Welles' _noirs, but on a small scale, with humbler means, and also smaller ends, with a compelling dynamism and concision, explicit this time, but without Welles' inventive subtlety and hazy perspectives.
There are also a few plot contrivances and remarkable coincidences which have to be overcome, but it's easy in this case since the rest of the picture works so well - just go with it, or 'key flow', as they say in football.
Coleen Gray does her part very well, also.
The musical score is also excellent.
We also meet Quistis (their smart and incredibly hot instructor), Rinoa (Squall's love interest) and Irvine (a ladies man) along the way.
The movie also stars John Payne and Preston Foster.
Oh and he also seems to be nearly scared to death during the interview with Gorgoroth's Gaahl.
The documentary is great in that it is aimed at both fans of heavy metal, but can also be enjoyed by those unfamiliar with the genre.
The death and black metal scenes, often overlooked in mainstream metal, are also given a sizeable chunk of attention in this movie, and their analysis was perhaps the best part of the movie for me.
But in one of the film's most harrowing interview sequences, he also concedes that there are some bands that take the transgressive state of their cults of personality too far.
It's also become one of my most treasured and beloved games of all time.
Dunn not only maps out and explains the origins of the huge number of different sub-genres within the genre of metal music (something that all music lovers have probably wondered about at one time or another), but he also travels to places like Germany and Norway in search of many different metal bands and their fans.
There is indeed quite a deep and interesting flow to this documentary and Dunn not only managers to maintain a subjective and professional roll in his research, but also managers to maintain his integrity as a metal head - this is indeed, a credit to him.
It addresses the musics critics head on, whilst also providing us with some very funny stories from the lives of its subjects.
This is a solid and interesting documentary which I would recommend to everybody who loves Metal but also to people who are not necessarily fans of the genre but have interest in music or underground culture.
It is a film that is at once scattered in it's presentation but also held together by it's topic.
Two young actors who died too young - Richard Long and Natalie Wood - also appear in the "Tomorrow is Forever."
I am also a lifelong head-banger.
I also had to defend my love of this style of music to my parents, teachers, and friends, so I understand where his interest in this approach to the subject comes from.
I also like the fact that Sam Dunn has the educational background he does, and is obviously making something productive and positive out of his life because too many people do write off metal heads as being stupid, low class, criminal, uncultured, and most likely, introverted, out of touch, and mentally unstable.
The makers also don't shy away from the controversy that has been levelled at the music over the years and delves into the various court cases and why so many believe it's the devils music.
Dunn, of course, has his head totally together, which is how he can go head-to-head with metal legends &/or notorious sorts like Tony Iommi, Bruce Dickinson, Lemmy, Alice Cooper, Dee Snider, Dio and Rob Zombie (Geddy Lee is also among the big known interviewees, though it's strange to see him here when he's not really 'metal', at least in league with these guys).
Maybe there is only so much that can be covered in a feature-length film, but the subject matter serves to be even more looked into; VH1 had also done a heavy-metal documentary, and it lasted four hours.
It was also great to see '80s curiosities Accept and Quebec's own Voivod being represented.
- Selphie Tilmitt - a SeeD with a cheerful, spunky, and bouyant attitude who also has great fighting skills like Squall and Zell.
Not to mention, the dialogue can also be pretty hilarious.
Dunn also gives his thoughts about Metal's culture, viewpoints, religious standpoints, the fans and every other aspect of metal.
My girlfriend enjoyed this piffle but that's hardly worthy as she also watches Prisoner Cellblock-H, Neighbours and Sons and Daughters.
a brutal event (an airplane crash in "Lost", a hijacked boat in"Tribe"), leaves a group of very different people stranded on an island; second, these people, despite their very different personalities, are forced to organize themselves in order to live together, and this cannot be without some conflicts; other elements are also common to the two series: the island on which both "tribes" are stranded on contains some traps and there are also the "bad ones" (the "others" about whom the survivors in "Lost" are warned about by the French woman in Season 1, and the bad encounter that the group of people who leave the island on the raft make are obviously similar to the sea pirates returning to the island in "Tribe", etc... etc...)And the name of one of the major characters in both "Tribe" and "Lost" is...
I also had visions of Gilligan's Island dancing in my head when (according to the story) the rag-tag group managed to build very livable huts (with doors and beds no less) after just 3 weeks on the island!
Some of the characters are also reminiscent of the Gilligan's Island castaways such as the character of Lucille, who starts out as a snotty yet beautiful Ginger-type then turns into a fledgling Samurai under the hallucinogenic tutelage of a dead Japanese soldier because she just happens to be fluent in Japanese (as well as Vietnamese) and managed to translate the dead soldier's diary.
I think the narration by host "Brain Damage" is both funny but also a little too cheesy.
I used to watch this kind of crap all the time back in the day with my buds--and my friends also.
I was also surprised at Dr. Marsh's depiction.
There was also a Peter Pig, who did not fare as well as Donald in his movie career.
This film is also an important milestone as it marks the first appearance of Donald Duck, it remains one of his best films.
But this is also not particularly important--nor is the film unless you are watching it for historical purposes or if you are curious to see the most famous Black singing cowboy.
However, Alpha also specializes in some public domain and hard to find films where there simply aren't better copies available and it doesn't make financial sense to properly restore the films.
The characters are all terrific and among the most realistic seen in "high-tech" thrillers of this nature, while also adding a certain light-hearted feel at times.
The eerie feel is also realistic, with the Cold War having just ended and great uncertainly lingering as to the world political landscape.
It was also good seeing Redford and Sidney Poitier in their only team-up though technically Poitier was supporting here.
Dan Aykroyd was also funny about some "facts" only he believes.
The other members of the "Sneakers" each have their little eccentricities: "Whistler" (my favorite character), the blind tech genius played with amazing realism by the extraordinary David Strathairn, "Mother" (Dan Ackroyd), a conspiracy theorist who believes that the people who assassinated JFK also framed Pete Rose, Carl (the late River Phoenix), the boy hacker who was caught trying to change his grades through his school's computer system, Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier), an x-CIA agent, and Liz (Mary McDonnell), a former mathematics and computer intellectual who was a former lover of Redford.
It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!
It's also oddly nostalgic.
If I feel this way, then you know , other's must feel this way also.
Redford is really great in this movie as is Straitarn; Mary McDonnell is also very good.
And I know others who are much more intelligent than me and some who I would even guess are certifiable geniuses who also loved this movie.
It's also surprisingly timeless.
It is, perhaps, the last good "hacker" film (well, 23 (1998) also comes to mind, but that isn't widely available in English).
Also she had a power that bordered on the magical; heck they may as well have made Merlin the Magician a character also.
To see Danish Brigitte Nielsen in a big budget movie was also some sort of weird attraction to me at the time and I thought that I could at least have some fun seeing some banter between her and Murphy, but the expectation was far more attractive than actually seeing it.
The three Beverly Hills cops also reprise their roles here but the Lieutenant (now promoted to Captain) only has a couple of scenes and it is really totally unbelievable that Murphy's character and the Captain are discussing going on a fishing trip (could you even picture Murphy with a fishing rod?)
They also had cute looking ray-guns that resembled office staplers!
'The Bringers of Wonder' despite being very exciting is a ludicrous story in places, and 'The Taybor' despite having some good qualities also suffers from this weakness.
It was also class ham, far more 1960's than were most shows made in 1974.
In case of the Space 1999, there is also a strong context of reality.
Alanson, who is a singer, is also starred in some other films, which were disappointments, performed well enough to made the film best Turkish comedy made ever.
He portrays one of the funniest characters in the recent Turkish movie history and the on screen chemistry between the two main characters (who by the way, are also friends off camera) is amazing.
Their differences prove effective as the generator of the comedic effect, although -in my opinion- this movie is also a solid drama rather than a simple comedy.
Mazhar Alanson, who is the lead singer of arguably the best pop music group in Turkey, is also worthy of praise as the older brother.
The late master Selim Nasit also gives his last performance as their father.
Title song "Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter" is also a winner; however, it is not given a full performance in this film - and, it's an even older track.
I also enjoyed the scenes with the lads trying to earn money as construction workers.
this film also contains some of the lamest picture in picture effects I've ever seen.
Led by ruthless, fame-hungry female reporter Grace Forsythe (Helena Wagner) and her reluctant-at-first former lover Bob Manson (Claudio Morales), also a reporter, the crew and a guide eventually resort to violence to spurn a reaction from the docile natives.
Unfortunately, he also felt it necessary to include a real animal killing as well.
Alan Hale, Barton MacLane, Henry Stephenson, and Montagu Love are also worth noting; but, the film's main strengths are Mr.
I also was amused when one of the twins pronounced his family "TU-TOR" instead of "Tudor."
The film also stars Errol Flynn and Claude Rains.
He also takes the "switched at birth" motif and uses it in the main story of Chambers the slave switched by his mother Roxey with young Tom Driscoll the wealthy heir.
Edward is unfortunately forced to endure the poverty of Tom's social class, but also the brutality of Tom's father John Canty (Barton McLaine) who is a professional thief.
It also had plenty of humor - look at the business about the usefulness of "the Great Seal of England", which is typical Twain humor.
That story can be seen in the films Young Bess and also in Lady Jane.
This film also marks Flynn's first film with Alan Hale who appeared in eleven films with Errol.
One day, he and his buddy go to a rundown part of town to get high (this also happens literally five minutes into the movie; I guess these movie makers never heard of CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!).
It is also the only one of the 3 that is in 2.35:1.
You can blame the actors for sucking, but you can also blame the director for not doing anything about it.
You can also blame the producers for not realizing that toilet paper is worth more than that script.
It is still also one of the best.
There's also a noirish feel to much of the film, often accompanied by soft, bluesy-type music.
I also loved Golgo's character and the story moved pretty well also.
We also get to see some rudimentary CGI (which shows the ambition of the project), in the form a helicopter gunship.
The ending is also very unexpected and innovative.
And there also lurks the mystery that spurs the plot: exactly who wanted the junior Dawson murdered, and why?
This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist.
Amanda Peet was also good in her role.
We also have a small role for Paul Reiser as Jeffrey.
I also loved the ending playing on paris as she was a hooker and so was his mum it was a clever film, throughly enjoyed it!
There also is some great acting by Peet, John C. McGinley and Ray Liotta (who REALLY chews the scenery).
There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.
For a start,i would like to say that this film is worth seeing.It is one of the best psychological thrillers that exist so i highly recommend to those who like this kind of movies.The plot was very nice,the twist also and the cast outstanding.Cusack,Liotta,Peet and Hawkes did their best and the result was excellent.I liked a lot the flashbacks that were made -mostly in the beginning.
He also effectively creates two very attractive atmospheres, especially for fantasy fans--a "Twilight Zone"(1959)-like conundrum and a sustained dark ambiance.
The atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by the hotel set, which matches the Bates Motel from Psycho (1960) in dingy gloom.
The film also has a wonderfully nihilistic ending.
Most of them are lying to each other in some way when they first meet, and even some of the ones who know each other already are also lying to each other.
They also explore a more dynamic identity of action, as relationships continually shift throughout the film.
There is plenty of opportunity for you to nominate the "bad guy" and while you may be right in a sense you will probably also be wrong.
The same plot gambit was used by MGM in Operator 13 with Gary Cooper and Marion Davies in the American Civil War and also in The Firefly with Allan Jones and Jeanette MacDonald.
Rainer was also quite beautiful with high cheekbones and eyebrows as plucked as Dietrich, and received star keylighting from MGM.
Aside from racism, nationalism, populism etc., the film is also guilty of exceptionally bad film making.
Like the original, this movie also has a strip club sequence and as an added bonus, shots of scantily clad "Playboy" bunnies.
Russian girls who have emigrated to the U.S. will also stay there.
Afro-Americans can also live peacefully, God bless them.
The Russian and intelligent viewers will understand, also, that Danila comes back from a war.
The fact that he is such a calm soul while murdering people left and right, ironically, also ads to his charisma.
It also proved complete lack of sense of humor of American viewers.
Such lines as the lead, Tom Bastounes, who also co-wrote the script, saying to his long lost love, played by Monica Zaffarano, "You've haunted me for 15 years.
I also liked the way the blue-collar background of the main character, George, is juxtaposed with the high-falutin' milieu of the art (i.e., opera) world.
This movie also contained a brilliant cameo by a flawless look-alike of an aged Dave Jourabchi.
An also excellent sequel was made a year or so after this one,aptly titled, Taboo II.
This film also introduces for the first time comedy genius Chris Rock.
Lifeboat also had a good and sympathetic-til-the-end, rescued German sailer subplot that was effective in pulling our heartstrings until we saw that often things are not what they appear to be.
There is also something about the power of a film that isn't afraid to be honest to itself.
Walter Matthieu was also good, as well as mason gamble.
I also liked how Dennis kept outsmarting that robber.
Walter Mathau was also perfectly cast as the cantankerous Mr Wilson who just doesn't have time for small children and he has a very nice rapport with Joan Plowright, who played the exasperated Mrs Wilson.
I also have to mention Christopher Lloyd as he is totally unrecognisable as the filthy, slimy Switchblade Sam and how he is just hilarious as the hardened thief who quickly regrets ever meeting Dennis.
There is also few sugary, overly-sentimental moments that often crop up in family films.
Lea Thompson and Robert Stanton also make an appearance as Dennis's parents.
Who also produced this film manages to somewhat rip-off his "Home Alone" style mischief violence for laughs.
It is also a movie that kids will love.
The musical score was also excellent- whimsical, nostalgic, without coming across as cloying.
I also liked how they showed Dennis trying to resist the temptation to do something bad but can't resist.
Judge Reinhold, is also wonderful here, he is also HILARIOUS, seemed to be having a lot of fun, plus he he had a lot more to do this time around, and was very likable.
John Ashton is excellent here once again, he is also quite funny at times, and very likable, and also had more to do.
Ronny Cox is fine here again, but also didn't have that much screen time.
Brigitte Nielsen is good looking, and did excellent here as one of the main villains, and man was she big!, she was also very menacing.
There are also wonderful performances by George Brent and young Natalie Wood.
She paid Iris a compliment and also said hi but all she did was stare back at her-funny coming from those who complain about being ignored by the permanent workers because they were temps.
Hildegard is a schoolteacher, who takes her class (a remarkably mixed racial class for 1932) on a field trip to the New York Acquarium, then in lower Manhattan in what is still Castle Clinton National Monument (it was also, in the 1850s, Castle Gardens, where Jenny Lind sang to the public).
It is also the best, though Murder on the Blackboard is also top notch.
This group of movies also represented, I believe, an attempt by the studio to make Edna May Oliver (who was not British, by the way, but solidly American) a leading lady.
There was no telegraph, so they decided to pick those skinny guys, the equivalent of today's jockeys, and make them alternate, also switching horses, so in ten days the express mail would get from St Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento.
Cody's famous fight with Cheyenne chief Yellow Hand is also included here although that in fact took place in the 1870s not in 1860.
This film also marked the farewell appearance of Porter Hall who has a small role as another frontier character, legendary mountain man Jim Bridger.
It also gives us a look at a young Charlton Heston, before he became a staple of the large, big budget biblical epics.
This should also be shown on more channels, such as Cbeebies, it's WAY too unknown!!
The version with June Allyson and Janet Leigh is my favourite, however, I also enjoyed the other two versions that I have seen.
First off I thought that Mariel Hemmingway bore a strong resemblance to Katharine Hepburn who also played Jo in the 1930's film, and a number of times I thought that the boy who played Nat reminded me of Winona Ryder who played Jo in the 1990's film.
Anyhows, aside from the villains looking absolutely ridiculous and giving me a few reasons to giggle, we also get some of the worst characters in the universe!
Neon Maniacs,great movie by far one of my top 5 greatest films.The movie is so great because of the great original plot and characters...have u ever seen a movie when maniacs are killed by...water?No then check this out.I love alot of movies this definetly is one of them and its also hard to get so if u ever find it get it because even if u didnt like it its one of those movies when u cant not see it and u have to judge yourself!
Not only do we never find out why these creatures live to close to the one thing that can destroy them on contact, but we also never know where they came from or why they are killing people.
If you've read any of the other reviews of this movie on the IMDb, you already know that the movie sets up for a sequel that was never made (my good friend and colleague Christopher Brown makes a good point in his review, that the sequel may have never been made because Lightning Video went out of business, but he also makes a shocking miscalculation of the quality of the movie itself Â sorry Chris!).
I was also surprised that this film actually had decent acting, considering it was from the 80s.
Eddie Murphy stars in Beverly Hills Cop II.I think the first one was a tad bit better than this, but not by much.I think this is a great sequel.Eddie Murphy is funny as usual and so is Judge Reinhold.It also stars Brigitte Nielson and there is even a small cameo from Chris Rock.The film has Axel Foley returning to solve another murder with the help of his two friends from the first film.I think Beverly Hills Cop II is a good sequel to a good action/comedy film and I recommend it if you enjoyed the first one.
This is one of those little obscure and ridiculous yet fun horror movies from the eighties.The basics.Someone is going around committing horrid murders,turns out it's a gang of strange creatures that live underneath the Golden Gate bridge.What are these creatures?Why are they there?Well that is never answered.They are either humanoid or zombie looking.You have one that looks like a zombie solider,a weird apeman looking thing,a strange Native American monster and a few others.It also just so happens these creatures can be killed with water(why would something that is endangered by water live under a bridge?
But you can also enjoy this on tape, because VHS copies are still floating around at used video stores.
David Dhawan in 1999 after the superhit BIWI NO.1 with Salman repeated Salman and Karisma for the 4th time in his film with this film which released 2 months after the not so successful DHLJ  The movie is the same formula Salman, Karisma and Dutt have done for ages Similar to SAAJAN minus there Sanjay was the lead and he had a great role here he is just the typical no nonsense kinda boss who falls in love Even the music is ordinary here and also the romance  It's like 9 years after SAAJAN you make a diluted version which looks like a rehash of several other films   The film is nothing different and is actually boring to watch Remember DILLAGI, Remember SAAJAN.etc  Direction by DD is bad Music is nothing special  Amongst actors Salman does his usual stuff he did mostly those days though he was more lively and natural compared to today's comedies of his where he is bad Sanju seems bored Karisma does her part very well Dalip Tahil is okay Shakti Kapoor, Himani are routine Sushma Seth is good
Sanjay also agrees to marry Karisma.
While THE MECHANICAL MONSTERS is far from the worst of the lot (that honor goes to THE MUMMY STRIKES), it's also not particularly noteworthy and is typical of the low quality of the series.
As for the plots, cheapness is also the case.
They also can transform themselves into planes and fly to their targets (!!!).
Jeff Daniels' performance is also faultless as Carrey's sidekick.
It's also educational for me, we watched it in high school two years in a row, now isn't that awesome?
La Cravate, or the Severed Heads, also carries some unique traits as a Jodorowsky effort; the advantage of color is ever powerful and varied in tone from head to environment (different than what I expected from an underground director, especially as a precursor to Fando & Lis), but it's also a work that's usually more light than dark and more amusing than laugh-out-loud funny in its stabs of absurdism.
The music by Edgar Bischoff is also a factor for how sweet it is, contrasting the oddball mood of the material with melodies that sound like happy walks in the park.
The film also stars Jodorowsky's future wife Denise Brossot and American actor Saul Gilbert.
Compared to Jodorowsky's later films "La Cravate" - the original title refers to the tie worn by Jodorowsky's character - is very harmless and innocent, which also makes it a nice contrast to his other films.
That was seen also in "Little man Tate" or "Searching for Bobby Fischer".
A family movie , But it's also about life ,family relationships ,a purpose in life , spiced with comic moments and also with the dilemma : How you deal with genuine geniuses ?
But the movie also brings into focus the nonstop struggle the parents go through as they attempt to find a balance between nurturing and cultivating the child's talents, on the one hand, and not making a psychological wreck of him on the other.
He says he wants to play a concert in the Royal Albert Hall by the time he is twenty and also remarks that in order to make a lot of money you have to be really good.
He is also a very good actor.
I am the father of three (boy 30, boy 24 and girl 18) and also had a close relation with my grandfathers.
So, this is the story -- but the ability of the script and the director to move me into childhood, to remember what some of the issues of autonomy are, to see a family who loves and cares for their child, but also faces issues of financial pressures and job loss.
Even more touching was the one-legged veteran he meets who is also on the way home.
Additionally, the young soldier also happens to meet a pretty young lady on a train and falls in love with her (reminiscent of the film THE CLOCK).
While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather.
And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world, there is also a love interest: Isabel at age 12 (Kristina Lykowa) is his fun-loving babysitter and at age 19 (Tamara Scarpellini) is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus' life that otherwise would be empty.
The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing.
Other fantasies also play out in this completely guileless, charming story.
The 5-yr old Vitus also plays.)
It was also the country's official Acadamy Award entry for best foreign language film (though it didn't win).
However, the real life piano player who played the character was also excellent in his role.
I wrote, and helped produce and also threw in the voice of Ratso Rat some 27 years ago.
Why do I also remember something about: "It slices and dices and even chops, tomatoes and mushrooms and even old mops... but it won't work on steel girders..." How funny was that?
It's funny because we would ask people if they knew it and they'd look at us like we had three heads.I also agree it should be on TV annually.
Why do we suffer?Do we need to?Cant we just pray to god and try to be a good person?Takva is looking for the answer of those questions.Muharrem is a very loyalty man to all.He immigrated from Algeria but after his parents death,he started to live alone.He works for the man which his father also used to.He prays a lot and he just tries to be a good people.He is one of the members of a well known sect.He always attends to the ceremony of the sect and one day the leader of the sect asks him if he can work for sect.Muharrem accepts it and starts to do material businesses of the sect.After that his life turns to a tragedy.Because he is not good at accounting and starts to have sin which he hadn't before.He also sees some unwanted dreams which are sexual.he thinks thats the punishment of life to him.The leader doesn't does not understand his situation and muharrem gets lost in the darkness of his soul.All the things are meaningless for him anymore.At the last sequence of the movie,he follows the hero of his dreams under the rain and he faces with the fact.The hero of his nightmare is his leader's daughter..
I would guess that one could find his "state of mind" also with a range of uncritical believers of many religions who, although ardently believe stay shallow in their intellectual penetration of their believe and worldly life.
On the other there is a religious order, which although is directed towards spirituality is of course also involved in worldly enterprises and has of course it financial interests.
Nothing gets euphemised but the problems of both - profane and spiritual - get expounded in a way that a psychological profile of shallow but devote believer meets social criticism (not only hitting the Turkish Islamic milieu of its setting but also similar ones in other regions and religions).
Yes, Muharrem has an existential crisis, also familiar to audiences of Shrek 3 in another way ... dare I mention it, by profane comparison.
His naive will to live a life according to what he thinks is the will of God clashes not only with his unfulfilled sexual desires, but also with the mechanisms of power within the order.
The nurse is played by Talia Shire - it's only her 2nd film, so it's not her greatest performance, but hey... and this was also notable as one of Ed Begley Sr.'s last films.
The location was also memorable, but the sound staged sets were a bit weak.
The film was made in 1970, and it REALLY shows - in the quality of the film stock, and also in the hair styles of the characters (Dean Stockwell's perm is absolutely awful) as well as their dress (remember those bell bottom pants?).
They also avoid the most elemental mistake in Lovecraft adaptations, they never really show the "brother" who's part Old One until a quick shot at the end.
This would make a great double feature with "Simon: King of The Witches," also currently available on DVD.
Filmed shortly after this film, also has a warlock, and a lot of trippy psychedelic visual effects.
also i might add that at times the plot seems rushed-off, but maybe because is trying to pull the exact same dialogs-camera work-twists as in "the usual suspects"( one of the best suspense movie EVER!).
Set in the twilight hours in a no-names urbane city an ambitious DA named Ford Cole (Liotta, who is also a producer on this dreadful film) who is summoned to the police station when one of his younger protÃ©gÃ©es (and current lover), Nora Timmer (mannequin Blalock) has been involved in a lethal shooting after her claims of being raped by her assailant, Isaac Duperde.
Enter Luther Pinks (Cool J), who has some info on Timmer confirming she is not on the level and his identity is also in question (as is his purple prose involving his olfactory senses with laughable line readings).
Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
It's my belief that she was also an FBI agent.
She also new he would point out anybody as Danny.
Beyond the clumsy, inscrutable storytelling, "Slow Burn" also suffers from some of the most overripe dialogue this side of "The Black Dahlia."
I also liked that the movie didn't shy away from comments (however simplistic) about race.
The female lead, Blalock also gives a believable performance as damsel in distress.
If you liked Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107668/) I think you will also enjoy this flick a whole lot.
There is some ick-horror embedded here also-- and a little humor, but never overdone.
with a road journey he also shows the situation of Russia at 2nd world war.
Scott is a great actor and I also liked Brando's performance (he plays for 10 minutes or so in this 2-hours movie) but that's simply not enough.
Caine when within days Neeley's estranged wife Kay, Beatrice Straight, is also fund murdered in her Jacuzzi with the same murder weapon that murdered her husband!
There's also in the movie the husky voiced and very athletic looking Marthe Keller as Lisa Spangler in a role that she seemed to play in every film she was in back then; The mystery woman.
P.S The film "The Formula" has the distinction of not only having two Academy Award winners, Geroge C. Scott & Marlon Brando, for best actor in it but also the very two who turned the coveted Oscar down for, in Brando's case, political and, in George C, Scott's case, personal or professional reasons.
Okay, George C Scott is the kind of actor that never works on my nerves and he also was the only reason why I kept watching as this movie sucks... You can write thrillers and spionagescenarios but please don't forget that an average watcher cant follow thousand plots in 100 minutes, director John G Avildsen doesn't even give us the time to let us discover who is who as from the moment a new personage appears he ends up being shot three minutes later plus you are wondering what the hell it's all about....
Which was why the Nazis made damn sure to occupy the place and also wanted to get to the Soviet Union oil fields as well.
The former cop's widow Beatrice Straight is also murdered along with just about everyone else who talks with Scott during the course of the investigation.
Ike Eisenmann (from the Disney "Witch Mountain" films of the '70's) and Craig T. Nelson also turn up briefly.
Not that it seems that anyone else was so passionate about the film: there's no shortage of class talent here (John Gielgud and Beatrice Straight also turn up), but it's clear that the paycheck is of more interest to them than the script and they're just slumming it.
I suggest you see that one also.
Oh, but it's also in a different galaxy?
Adama also has a faithful black sidekick, called Colonel Tigh, who at one point is reduced to picking up everyone's laundry.
I could also mention the preposterous characterization of the humans, including weak-kneed pacifists who are quickly killed, the inexplicably evil and stupid Lord Baltar (John Colicos) who betrays humanity, and the unbelievably dumb Council of Twelve, who prove that democracy just doesn't work.
And I also love the characters.
And there was nothing on the surface of Kobol that indicated that the ancient people had any space flight technology to leave Kobol, which was also a little confusing.
THE LOST WARRIOR: I liked this episode, with Apollo (Richard Hatch), stranded on a planet due to his viper running out of fuel, and finding himself pitted against a Cylon (called Red Eye by the planet locals) who was also stranded on the planet, but with memory loss, and now being commanded by a local gangster-type on the planet.
Baltar is also in this episode.
Still today, I can watch the series premiere (which was also variously released as a TV movie, and even in theaters in Canada, Europe, and later the USA) over and over again.
I also liked the look of the battlestars and Colonial vipers.
Maren Jensen, Laurette Spang, and Anne Lockhart just also happened to be beautiful too.
---> visiting cast members like:  -------> Lloyd Bridges as Commander Cain was truly memorable  -------> Patrick McNee as Count Iblis was also highly memorable  -------> Ray Milland and Fred Astaire were good guest stars too  * the costumes  ---> I liked the Colonial Warrior uniforms - they still have a style to them today.
---> I also liked the encounter with the Ship of Lights and Count Iblis - this was especially well done.
There's also the stories involving the Ship of Lights, Terra, and other ships from within the rag-tag fleet.
We also have the Cylon music, very dark and menacing.
Her wish was granted in the fourth episode, leaving fans wishing that her son, Boxey and his yapping mechanical dog, Muffet, had also fallen under Cylon swords.
The story is OK, the acting OK, the cinematography also OK. Basically nothing in this film is more than OK.
But I give it 8 out of 10 because the plot is well done also the time scenery/clothing/atmosphere, and specially because it is a controversial theme handled deeply.
Other scenes showing the exploitation inherent in life as it was lived in Storyville in 1917 were also found to be disturbing by many viewers; and some comments even suggest a widely held conviction that we live in a more moral society today.
Brooke Shield's parents should have also gone to jail for making a little girl take her clothes off for a movie--they had no right.
In all fairness should we also have a movie about a 12 year old boy who prostitutes himself during the Depression Era (this certainly happened)?
It is also based on the story of Ernest J. Bellocq, a photographer who worked in the same area.
I was also captivated by the sub themes of race, class, and gender inequity were so subtly and effectively presented.
And to you Christians,don't forget that Mary was 13 or 14 when Christ was born,she also was betrothed to Joseph at age 12, which was the custom then.
It was also a notoriously scandalous film because of child pornography issues (the setting is a New Orleans brothel), which makes it a surprising choice for DVD release in this age of political correctness - although Paramount basically just slapped it onto disc, as it's a no-frills release (with not even a trailer to go with it)!
She's an odd mix of child and woman, the sort of girl who wants a grown man to have sex with her but also plays with the doll he gives her.
I also think that it is undoubtedly the most eye-opening film I ever saw in terms of the reality of the daily life of some people.
I was also surprised by the humor of drummer Kenny!
P.S I also loved Stracth the Robo Chicken and Grounder the Drill Arm Robot from this series.
There was also a tone of sadness underneath the shows exterior that one would have to find out by watching the series.
Remy even gives up his career in a cowardly way when he latches on to a newer lover, who also is a superior talent as a pianist.
And one feels sorry for his "new" lover, to whom the coward isn't even able to inform that he is also a musician.
Directed and co-written by master Russian filmmaker of a soviet era, and also a WW-2 veteran, Grigory Chukhrai, who was even nominated for this picture for Academy Award for Best Screenplay, the film is set during WW-2.
It's also quite remarkable how the script never reverts to being gratuitous exploitation, even though all the themes hint towards that direction.
The gameplay itself is also far better than the previous games and since the HUD is uncluttered I consider it slightly better than WC IV in that regard (the HUD in IV has a huge gunsight).
The also did it with a style, flair, and acting performances normally seen only in top-notch Hollywood films.
It was also great fun to see renowned British actors John Rhys-Davies (of "Indiana Jones" and "The Lord Of The Rings" fame) and Malcolm McDowell (of "A Clockwork Orange", "Time After Time" and "Star Trek: Generations" fame) both hamming it up in their respective roles as General James "Paladin" Taggart and Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn.
It was also cool to see Thomas F. Wilson (who played Biff Tannen in the "Back To The Future" trilogy) playing one of the good guys for a change, even though his character, Lt. Todd "Maniac" Marshall, and Col. Blair are rivals, and only sometimes friends with each other.
Mary's relationships with the other employees in the newsroom and also her apartment neighbours make the series.
Mary longs for romance but meanwhile has close, dependable friendships not just at her job but also at home.
Knight made it big with this series, went on to his own series, Too Close For Comfort, & also scored big in the original CADDYSHACK.
It also showed a single woman living alone and liking it--a rarity for TV on those days.
It also found humor in some taboo subjects.
The other characters, however, were also funny but not as Alex.
Contrary to Married with children (which is also an extremely funny and smart show), it depicted the ethics that most of the families miss today - ethical parents, democrats, charity loving and enjoy the bonds they have and though they play it so safe during the whole show, they still got you laughing in a joyous way.
He also tells the shrink that when he was a kid he was just as normal as any kid playing with toys and stock market.
He could also identify the coin's value from the sound after they used to cover his eyes and toss the coin for him to guess.
In other episodes we also see Alex so romantic in love with Elen and later hurt because she leaves him for dancing scholarship to France and then he falls in love with Lauren (Courtney Cox).
I also loved the theme song.
In conclusion, even though it can also be seen on Nick at Nite now, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.
I also cant believe that it finished that long ago.
On the one hand Family Ties always tackles serious issues on a personal level (death, trust, love, sexual harassment) but also on a social/ political level.
What I also find amazing is that they manage to pack a satisfying story in the fairly short format of less then 30 minutes.
High point episodes over the years were the Alex turns 18 one, the Alex rents out the rooms of the house one, and also the 4(!)
Show also must of set some sort of record with at least 6 or 7(!)
It was also way too sarcastic.
John Hodiak is a war vet with amnesia who searches for his identity and possible complicity in a crime "Somewhere in the Night," a 1946 film also starring Nancy Guild, Richard Conte, and Lloyd Nolan.
The film is directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and he also co-wrote the screenplay with Howard Dimsdale.
He also finds that the reason for all the violence unleashed against and around him is $2-million in Nazi money (which disappeared in 1942, the year he joined the Marines).
The only complaint I have is that the film was also low-budget when it came to sound quality, and a lot of the dialogue was hard to decipher.
The cast also includes Terrence Howard as a sympathetic child services worker, pint-sized Jamia Simone Nash as a powerhouse vocalist, Mykelti Williams as a kind minister, and Alex O'Loughlin of TV's "Moonlight" as Lewis' brother Marshall.
She also co-wrote the outstanding "In America," and has a knack for working with kids and finding the lyricism in storytelling.
In our attempt to demonize everything Russian, we also overlooked stories of individual heroism.
He also meets Shura (Zhanna Prokhorenko), a radiant young woman who, like him, hides out in a freight car.
It's the type of story that always comes out around this time of year, which is also the most sentimental time of the year.
I also like how it brought together modern rock, classic symphonic music, and modern symphonic music.
My father was also Irish and looked a lot like August Rush's father.
This is also a story about revenge or avenge if you will.
But it also has a sad undertone throughout.
A trio of beautiful performances form the heart of this film, although the secondary characters are also crisply compelling.
The other actors are all alright also.
The settings were authentic and the costuming was also superb.
Lucrezia was also well portrayed, she was loved by the citizens of Ferrara (home of her third husband) for her charitable works and they requested for her to be canonised but the Pope (unsurprisingly given her 'reputation') declined.
They may also make some of their money back!!
"Lucrezia," "Giulia Farnese," and Alfonso D'Este also are convincingly portrayed.
The narrative convention of the reporter and protagonist is also absurdly contrived.
Too much time is also spent with the Izzy character, especially in context with the Senator's wife, since again, there is no pay-off.
It also has many plot twists, and though it has be commented upon that it is too predictable, I thought nothing of the sort.
Henry is also gay.
The Rest of the Characters: Besides our lead, Henry, we also focus on his stereo-typical bigot Republican Father/Senator, and his "senator's wife" Mother.
Unrelated Chatter: Jack Noseworthy, the actor who played Anthony also starred in "The Brady Bunch Movie" and in his early years, "Cats" in the theater.
Next he's telling her that he also had sex with her boyfriend that gave her AIDS; we next see him caring about Henry, whom he had vowed to "out".
Like life, there are also parts that you may never fully understand.
Kingston is excellent as Flanders and the rest of the cast does well also.
This film is NOT to be confused with the disappointing film, "Moll Flanders", also released in 1996.
This is the low down on what happens: The Wolf is a wealthy playboy, Grandma is also filthy rich (and horny as hell) and Red is a flaming hot and sexy nightclub singer/dancer.
Working as a projectionist in the cinema I have also shown the toon, and on examining the print it is really noticeable that many frames have been cut out when "Red" makes an appearance.
Tex Avery's first excursion into animated sexual frenzy is his best, ranking as one of his three greatest cartoons (the other two, in case you're wondering, are "Who Killed Who?," also 1943, and "King-Size Canary," 1947).
The character herself is played by Meiko Kaji (who also took the lead role in the fantastic Female Prisoner Scorpion series) and while she is a lady of few words, it's easy to get involved with her thirst for revenge because of the interesting atmosphere surrounding the character.
I also think that all the actors did very good performances, especially the Bennet family.
He also had more guts than most men.
It was also very interesting to watch Darcy struggle with his feelings for Elizabeth.
The characters that played Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were also excellent.
The home interiors were also more elaborate and fantastic and more in keeping with my imagination of what I thought they looked like after reading Jane Austens book.
But I also feel that this is the best of all of her works.
The humour of the book is also carried through with the banter of Mr and Mrs Bennett which makes compelling viewing.
I also realized after watching the series over and over again the little things in between the characters stand out more and more clearly.
The sets, costumes and story-line are top-notch, and the film as a whole is a novel take on the rape/revenge exploitation genre also.
A two hour film could never capture what a six hour mini series can and I can only think that loads will have been missed out!In my parallel universe this would have been a film on general release and would have won the 'big five' at the Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actress (Ehle) Actor (Firth) and adapted screenplay (Davies) as well as nods for Supporting Actor for Bamber (Whitrow would also have been nominated!)
and Supporting Actress for Alison Steadman (Susannah Harker would also have been nominated!)
The film also has an outstanding supporting cast as well.
His friend, Mr. Darcy, is also eligible and ten times richer than Bingley, but is soon to be revealed to be someone disagreeable.
Even so, she does have a delicate tightrope to walk and I found myself liking Mrs. Bennet in the end and understood she was also a part of this enormous tapestry that Austen herself had woven so lovingly.
I tried to read P&P before but couldn't finish the first a couple of pages, under a false impression coming from reading the first quarter of sense and sensibility that the heroine in P&P was also full of vanity and conceit.
Carl Davis' score is terrific and fitting (also to the times).
Woody Allen failed to deliver the proper language in his attempt, succeeding only in capturing the imagery: This attempt by Adam Abraham and Gibson Frazier delivers the correct imagery, but also the correct verbiage.
Of all the films that Quentin Tarantino pays homage to in his Kill Bill films, Fujita's Lady Snowblood might have received the most because not do the Kill Bill films have screen shots almost taken directly from Lady Snowblood they also incorporate some of the music sung by Lady Snowblood's heroine Kaji Meiko.
Definitely recommended for those who enjoy swordplay and blood in their films and also recommended to those who enjoy older Japanese films outside of the canonized films of Kurosawa, Ozu, and Mizoguchi, but it might not be for those with a weak stomach.
Abraham and Frazier are also the film's producers and music producers, with many a-family members and friends included as part of the crew.
If you like director and choreographer Rob Marshall's musical "Chicago" (with Zellweger, Gere, Zeta Jones, Reilly, Latifah), also give "Man of the Century" a chance.
Meiko Kaji who plays Lady Snowblood, also known as Yuki, doesn't spend the movie wrapped in evil and revenge with anger on her face.
Many standards of this genre may stop you from watching this but watch it for the genuine heart-wrenching story of Yuki Kashima, also known as Shurayukihime, Lady Snowblood.
A genuine piece of cinematic gold that is also entertaining and worth a watch.
The Max Steiner score is also very good, although I wish it had been a little more sub rosa.
He also co-wrote and co-produced this daft little gem with Adam Abraham) just happens to be living in late 1990s Manhattan.
I've seen MotC on the IFC Channel, but it's also available from Netflix, so I highly recommend you renting or even buying it.
It also has some of the elements of stage drama a la Moliere.
There is also some racial humor in it as well.
Even the narrative structure was copied, and QT also used the theme song sung by Meiko Kaji for the score of his film (I see this as a tribute).
That's also unusual.
The soundtrack which I also have at home as a Saturday morning pick-me-up is cute and accurate for the feel of the film.
Particularly when conservatives are alleging Democrats are wrong on an issue, Alan seems to go off and talk about how some Republican also supports whatever the issue is.
Maybe shouldn't be too hard of the filmmaker(s); they did throw in token smart gal, who's also token the black and 50+ normal looking Kelly McGillis; both serving to placate women who would get mad if not for their presence.
Thank God the token black was also the token girl dressed modestly.
I must also congratulate the makers for such a high body count & surprisingly a lot of the cast die even some I was expecting to make it.
There is also a fair amount of CGI blood which looks pretty fake, almost like a solid red cloud.
Of course, I can't resist pointing out the fact that this is also an awesome revenge story.
Ahab who also wants to croak it.
Every confrontation with one of them marks a new chapter, resulting in an outrageous climax inside a restaurant (also clearly imitated by Tarantino).
This great actress also starred in the equally notorious exploitation franchise "Female Scorpion".
There's also the sad case of officer Baxter Slate, Perry King, who's suffering from very dark sexual hangups dealing with S&M that leads him to get involved with a dominatrix.
I remember a scene in the film 'Electra Glide in Blue' when a Vietnam Vet who was a highway patrolman gave a 'perp' who was also a vet advice that he couldn't use his service record as an excuse to drop out and behave badly.
), but it is also a very beautiful one.
she gets home to find her dad killed and finds that the crazy lady had something do with it so she decides to investigate what is really going on by visiting Silent Hill and also at the same time find out the truth about her "burning" past  -this game is pretty much a sequel to the first game with a lot of the characters from that game appearing in this which makes for a really great story because in it's own confusing way it actually helps the story from the first game make a little bit of sense.
He could also combine some elements from the second game since it has the best story in the franchise but whatever the case I have full faith in Mr. Gans and know he will make another masterpiece that I'll obsess over.
it's also played in the movie for the scene when Sharon gets a peek at Alessa's dark side when the movie begins.
She also has to navigate the subways, sewers, and office buildings...all this before she even gets to Silent Hill!
So there you have it, the atmosphere is also killer, I loved how you switched over to the more deformed and evil world and the puzzles were not to difficult to piece together.
It is also sometimes to hard as I had a bit of difficulty with the final enemy even on easy.
In ways, this is less hard than the others(on the other hand, it is challenging, yes, also on the easiest setting, of the three for puzzles and four for action... yep, adjustable difficulty, so anyone can play this).
That would also explain why this utter lack of anything of quality has such good distribution.
I find that the previous comment misses not only the subtle nuances of the film's plot, but also completely underestimates the quality of the actors and, especially, actresses (such as the stunning pathologist) that star in this cult classic.
These topics are subtly woven into the rich tapestry of the plot and I was left not only captivated and deeply moved, but it has also led me to reassess my outlook and attitude to life.
The acting is also very horrible, very amateur-ish and fake.
It isn't quite as manic as the Lone Wolf and Cub pictures (highly recommended), but more effective than the action in something like Sex and Fury (also highly recommended.
He also was in "Harlem On the Prairie" with Herb Jefferies in 1937 and appeared in a number of Westerns such as "Riders of the Frontier" in 1939 as Chappie, the cook (also known as "Ridin' the Frontier.")
He also was in "Harlem On the Prairie" with Herb Jefferies in 1937 and appeared in a number of Westerns such as "Riders of the Frontier" in 1939 as Chappie, the cook (also known as "Ridin' the Frontier.")
I also love how they sometimes speak in old fashioned English like "I am whom thoust seekest.
I also like the background animation, well-drawn wonky forests and paths.
I also like the song at the very beginning.
Apart from the gorgeous layouts, the brilliant gags and the wonderful performance by Mel Blanc, 'Robin Hood Daffy' is also notable for how Jones uses the characters, particularly Porky Pig.
I would also like to praise Mel Blanc for his brilliant voice characterisations.
It is from a time when horror was about more than hi-tech gory special effects and torture sequences thrown together to make a 'body' of work and although this Hammer box-set is of its time it is a brilliant collection that has also stood the test of time.
The music is also incredibly good, mixing traditional Asian music with this great theme song that Tarantino took from this very movie and placed it in his.
From the fifties on until today, we follow everything that happens in Italy: communism, anarchy, the Maffia, natural disasters, an economic boom, but also banal things like for instance soccer (in fact everything that has any importance in the history of Italy and the minds of the Italians) is shown in this movie.
If you take the time to watch it, than you'll not only get to see something of Italy's history, but you'll also get to know the cities, the landscapes, the people.
It also allows us to grow and change right along with the characters.
It's also obvious that Warner's wasn't afraid to spend more on their productions in 1934 than just a year or two before.
'La meglio gioventÃ¹' is a long movie written for TV, but also shown at the cinemas and which won the price at Cannes contest 'un certain regard'.
I think 'la meglio gioventÃ¹' is a very moving movie: Marco Tullio Giordana succeeds in describing minds and psychology not only of the two main characters, Nicola and Matteo Carati, but also of other people living their life around them: Giulia, Nicola's wife who takes part in Brigate Rosse actions, Adriana, Matteo and Nicola's mother, their father... Every one has his complexity, his human motivations and attitudes, his personal story which is always also involved with the general environment.
I also appreciated how subtle things were told.
There are a psychiatrist, a policeman, a lawyer and an housewife, but there are also their relatives, friends, in poor words there is the LIFE.
The film's main focus is on two brothers, Nicola and Matteo Catiti whose personalities are as different as night and day yet is also immediately apparent that these two love each other very much.
They're also very different, which keeps things interesting.
There's also a bit of cheesy makeup and blue screen, but that can be excused because this is really a TV production, as I understand it, not a big movie.
Some excellent ensemble playing was also achieved by the large cast in this series.
In consistent, glaring lapses of judgment the attorney general (Warren William) deems that the interests of justice would be served best by not only hiding his marriage to the embattled governor's daughter (Stanwyck), but also by concealing evidence!
U.S. mini-series were more successful as sweeping historical epics, even when they were also family sagas like "Roots" and "Centennial;" when the networks tried to interpret more recent history, as in "The Sixties," the set characters sped through "Zelig" and "Forest Gump"-like in happening to be at the right place at the right time; perhaps the several seasons combined of the NBC series "American Dreams" could be considered comparable in showing how the times that are a-changing affect a family.
Here is a view of how human beings can live the humanity so desperately needed in this crazed and warring world...also presented as an integral part of plot and interaction...and this done without any sort of didactic or polemic foisting...All achieved through the intimate and profound struggles of the film's characters.
And by the look of the Roman movie theatres heaving with people when I went to see La meglio gioventu' last week, they also agree that Marco Tullio Giordana's last effort is worth the effort of sitting in a cinema for almost 6 hours!
The two Carati brothers, Nicola (played sympathetically by Luigi Lo Cascio, also seen in Giordana's previous film, "I cento passi") and Matteo (the dishy Alessio Boni), are in some ways the main characters.
This is a depiction of human sorrow in nearly it's purest form, both at the deeply personal level and also on the international scale.
I would also like to respond to the review of May 16, 2005.
At the beginning of the movie the Jew husband (the always excellent William Fichtner) doesn't believe in miracles, but after his son gets better from a "miracle man", he changes his mind and begs that same miracle man --who has also slept with his wife in the meantime-- to come and help his son.
Afterwards the director, Peter Raymont, had a Q&A with the audience (there was also Dallaire's assistant from that period in Rwanda - his name escapes me), and he said that in Canada it will be playing on the CBC in the new year.
Umberto Lenzi manages to ensure that all of the major players are interesting, and Lenzi also ensures that all are guilty in one way or another, which ensures that everyone deserves what they get by the time it finishes.
The other "Paranoia" is also far superior to this one.
Besides "Orgasmo" and "Paranoia", Baker also made "So Sweet, So Perverse" and "Knife of Ice" with Lenzi, with "So Sweet" and "Orgasmo" being superior to the other two.
The supporting cast are also excellent with Rupert Everett being born to play the tolerant, witty and womanising King.
However, ironically, it also results in a pregnancy.
There were also a couple of consistency problems.
I was also struck by how Danes is developing into a fine young actress; she sweeps the audience right into her emotional world.
All of the above, of course, is also a strong reflection of the obviously considerable skills of the director.
The film is also unique in the way the main character deals with his self-awareness of sexuality and gender identity.
The romance is also tantalisingly developed - a rare element these days.
When he is on stage he's incredible and when he's off stage he's simply hot but also convincing when facing the greatest crisis of his life (in his role I mean).
She is strong, she is beautiful, she is courageous but also sympathetic.
Her reaction to her environment and the fact that she is also hiding who she really is give her a realistic ability to understand the man that Crudup plays.
But there are also points which are more general - like s*x in pre-Victorian London (high) society, which was more relaxed than during and long after, and I thought that was represented very faithfully in the movie.
Some of the negative critics' reviews on rotten tomatoes also have a problem with the representation of androgyny and sexuality in the movie.
It is clear that Julie's anguish perfects at Henry for his affair, but also at herself for not having taken him to a professional to begin with.
Yet Julie becomes pregnant by Alexy, and returns to Henry, who, we assume, has forgiven her, and we also left to assume that they go on with their lives, doing their best to support Nick's life as long as possible.
Lothaire Bluteau is also quite brilliant, presenting the almost sheepish, yet amazingly gifted Alexy with a natural charm and ease.
What I liked the most was the way the sexual ambiguity was portrayed - most of those scenes had a playful touch, so as not to get drearily heavy-handed, but I also felt a lot of the veering between seriousness and comedy was awkward where it should have been smooth.
I also have some friends who quibble with the depiction of Crudup's sexuality towards the end of the film (why can't a gay man BE gay).
In "killing" Maria onstage, he manages at once to work out his Othello-like ambivalence and rage toward a woman he also loves; to "kill" her affected stage persona; and to give birth to himself as an authentic actor in his own male body.
For when Charles II was restored to the throne lost by his father (who also lost something else of even more estimable value), theaters reopened but under an old law that forbade the presence of actresses on the stage.
Surprisingly, these two men have been able to create a film that is not only visually satisfying, but it also is an adult entertainment.
A glorious English cast behind the two American principals are gathered to play effortlessly the theatrical figures of the time, and also the King and his court.
Well don't, because it also happens to make a highly successful transition from stage to screen thanks to the genius that is director Richard Eyre.
So she's willing to fight tooth and nail for her son to live, but also in a way for her soul and spirit to survive.
That is where the healer comes in, and also maybe why he is able to spot her in that huge crowd as someone needing him.
Look also at the way she goes about her relationship with the healer.
The interface is also annoying and very slow.
USA(which, incidentally, is also the only "clean" one, no chemical/biological warfare) is the strongest, technologically superior, but also most expensive.
Henry is also the owner of the largest cocoanut plantation on the island, which arouses the greed of an unscrupulous white trader with a beautiful native 'ward'...  Ramon Novarro is charming in this, his final silent film.
Physically he is more beautiful than any man has a right to be, but his beauty also comes from within because he projects a warmth and humanity that few actors can convey.
It is also quite subversive as the Christian is definitely the bad guy, and a life of pagan lust and laziness is held up as the ideal.
The three other stars are also fine.
All of the other stars also do a superb job: Renee Adoree, Dorothy Janis, and Donald Crisp.
Viewers may also be interested to know that Novarro had attempted a legitimate singing career in opera and recitals, and it is his voice you hear in the overdubbed recording.
?There are a lot of very reputable and "connected" agencies in Ireland and the u.k that would love to represent this young lady i am sure.However my advice to her is to forget Ireland and actually go to the states where she is being looked at anyhow.Keep your agents to a minimum and go for the best in the business and not some mickey mouse operations that are run part time.You should try Lisa Richards in Dublin who represents Colin Farrell and also Lisa Anne porter.They are two of the best as is Karl Hayden by all accounts.
The story begins in Ireland, with a young wife and mother, who learns that her younger brother, Declan, (also an adult), is in a hospital, that he is gay and that he has AIDS.
Some gay friends of Declan arrive to help with his care, and Declan's widowed mother also comes to stay there.
And all the adults were also very human and real.
All the prehistoric lands Yor has wandered through are the result of a nuclear holocaust (apparently radiation also causes dinosaurs to return to the Earth).
Yor has to battle the evil emperor, who looks strangely close to the evil emperor in the star wars films and his evil robots, who also strangely look like Darth Vader.
Also notice the high tech control room the rebel city dwellers are in, it also bears a strange resemblance to the control room of a water treatment plant.
The fact that the movie seems subdivided into three specific sections also helps give it that "Saturday Matinee" feel.
Finally, William Fichtner, as Henry, is also excellent.
Reb Brown rocks, its amazing that in the time of dinosaurs, they also had hair bleach.
It also was the only movie starting when we arrived, to be truthful.
A theme tune that not only can inspire you to achieve great things in your life, but can also inspire those around you to become better people, and put their absolute trust in you.
It is a skill he uses efficiently in his other movie, Space MUtiny, where he also RUNS LIKE A GIRL, SCREAMS LIKE A GIRL and generally acts ALL GIRLIE LIKE.
A circus atmosphere, of the sort here anyway, is no more or less realistic than the other scenarios portrayed in Three Extremes, but Box also has the upper-hand of reality blending with nightmares, and what nightmarish qualities always come up from them.
The most artistic of the three, this is incredibly beautiful and dark, haunting and frightening, and also intriguing and thought provoking.
The second story, "Cut", also straight-forward, might be the weaker of the three even though it has some very tense moments: a director finds himself hostage to a situation with an actor who was little more than an extra, his wife attached to a piano like a puppet, and a child strapped against a sofa.
I am also not a fan of Atsuro Watabe, the male lead.
It's nauseating and twisted, but also says a lot about China's over-population and the resulting abortion culture.
It also has the most to offer cinematically, with real care put into editing, production design, imagery, juxtaposition, and whatever possible to embellish mood.
The pacing of the plot is also good.
"Cut" also has moments of levity and twisted creativity and is entertaining.
I recommend "Three ... Extremes" for fans of East Asian cinema and also aficionados of foreign films in general.
Primarily contemplative in nature, it's ambiguity also serves as its foil, as it's hard to draw anything more from the short than simple emotion and a sense of confusion.
There is nothing particularly compelling, also Dumplings does make a particularly strong effort and Cut is particularly vibrant, if a little shallow.
He has beautiful imagery in his films, it's just that they also tend to have some story lacking.
His segment also contains the most violent and gory images, as the house's artsy floor is literally flooded with blood near the end of the story.
I had a lot of problems with this story, first of all there were a collection of open flamed candles behind the director, I'm sure he could have used those to burn through the ribbon joining his hands together, and also there was a number of times were the extra came so close to the director that he could have easily swung for him, instead he just listened to him talk.
After I put both of those things aside I really enjoyed this short film, it had some very tense parts as well as some strong horror, 15 minutes through you get sucked in and wish it also had a separate feature length.
I looked forward to this the most of the three and was the most disappointed, there was hardly any dialogue so most of the film was purely based on assumptions, and it also got quite boring watching the same flashbacks over and over again.
Dumplings-Fruit Chan (Chinese Language) This little story is my favorite of the bunch and also very very disturbing and pretty gruesome.
Each section is like a dissertation in horror, although "Dumplings" could also be classified as an exploitation film.
They each show a lot about the culture of the respective countries they were made in and also provide new takes on the terrifying and the appalling.
Very good action movie that takes the Dirty Harry style more mainstream this time.The story/script here is only average and does not have much depth but the action and Eastwood's charm still makes this film one of the best action movies all time.The deterioration of Dirty Harry movies start with this one but you will still enjoy the action here.Just don't expect a masterpiece.The sound quality was below average.You can tell this film had a B movie budget.The cinematography is also just average although there are great shots of the San Francisco scenery.Only for action fans and big Eastwood fans.....
Sister Wanda was also packing a shotgun, in a house of God no less, and was just about to blow an unsuspecting Harry away.
"The Enforcer" also included an uncredited cameo of Joe Spano who few years later got an excellent part of Henry Goldblume in the magnificent television series "Hill Street Blues".
Not only could this scene have been shorter, but it could also have been much more exciting had there been adequate use of music and cinematography.
Magnum, he also uses higher calibers and even cars as weapons in this one.
Popwell had also appeared as a robber in the famous 'Do You Fell Lucky' scene in "Dirty Harry" and would appear again as Harry's colleague and buddy in "Sudden Impact".
Harry is asked to rescue the mayor and does so in a thrilling climax that also breaks Harry's Heart.
Harry also has got a catch-phraseÂ just 'marvellous'.
Not only could this scene have been shorter, but it could also have been much more exciting had there been adequate use of music and cinematography.
This movie has also got a pretty dramatic ending.
and displays unusual brutality in roughing up a man who feigns heart attacks instead of paying his restaurant billsÂ  Advertised as the 'dirtiest Harry of them all,' it is also the weakestÂ Without the experience of Siegel or Milius to help him, Eastwood took a gamble on James Fargo, his assistant director on some of his previous films and the result was competent action but a noticeable lack of depth and subtletyÂ
Irene Dunne is also fabulous, her timing is the best of anyone this side of Madeline Kahn, but Dunne was more sophisticated and played off Grant beautifully.
Too bad, he is also perfect for this film.
The ultimate post-modernist statement: not only the complete deconstruction of logic and convention but also breaking every rule of satire surrealism, and overproduction.
Also rescued was another survivor -- the robustly masculine, handsome, and athletic Randolph Scott, who is also in love with Dunne.
The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool.
In the 60s, it was ineptly remade as a Doris Day vehicle also successful and equally well crafted but not nearly as much fun.
FYI--The same year this film debuted, another film with almost the exact same story line also came out called "TOO MANY HUSBANDS".
It is also my opinion that Irene Dunne was a more natural comedienne than she was a singer...good voice though she had.
Nick gets himself into an awful pickle trying to find the right time to tell his new wife (whom he has been married to for only a few hours) what has happened, and also telling the children that the new lady that they are enjoying the company of is actually their mother.
He has some great classics below his belt, also prior to the release of this movie.
While watching this movie it by the way also made me think; 'Wow, this guy would had made a great James Bond!'.
He stars in this movie with Irene Dunn, with who he has appeared in in several movies together throughout their career, which also all happen to be the same type of movies.
Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.
Interestingly enough, Kanin took over the directing duties from Leo McCarey (an Oscar winner as Best Director for 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH, which also starred Grant and Dunne) after McCarey was injured in an automobile accident (McCarey also co-wrote the screenplay with Kanin and Sam and Bella Spewack).
The supporting cast is also diligently cast, although there's no animal scene-stealer, a la canine performer Asta's memorable turn as Mr. Smith in THE AWFUL TRUTH.
Platinum-haired beefcake Randolph Scott is fun as Grant's rival for Dunne's affections, and the fact that Grant and Scott were lifelong friends and roommates only makes their scenes together even funnier (there's also a hilarious sight gag involving the two of them that will have even the most reserved viewer rolling on the floor with laughter).
The appropriately rigid Gail Patrick plays the role of the stereotypical shrew as well as anyone could, and director Kanin also pulls natural performances from the two children in the cast.
Not only would we suffer dire consequences at that time, but our children would also suffer hideous deformities because of our ruined DNA and we would forever be at risk of having a flashback at a most inopportune time.
"Noose" also doesn't appear on any of the A&C compilations either, but it is now available as a single on DVD.
The film also features big Mike Mazurki and Fritz Feld.
I also noticed that Fezziwig was seen in a once shot but didn't get any speaking words.
I would also like to say THank you, Charles Dickens, he's long dead, but he's with us in spirit, for this great story.
Evans's innovative thriller is infinitely clever (with artistic nods to Toshiaki Toyoda's Pornostar and flashes of the inimitable Takashi Miike at his darkest and most violent) but also visually gorgeous: the composition and imagery is beguilingly rich and compelling.
The plot also faintly echoes Joel Schumacher's Falling Down as well as Martin Scorsese's seminal Taxi Driver, as a morality tale of an ordinary working joe who is given more than adequate incentive to revenge himself on society.
But whatever the influences behind the film may be, the writer/director has took the standard cinematic conventions,stood them on their head, and created not only the most unique and important Welsh independent film of the last decade but also the most unique and important British film of the last decade.
The special effects makeup also looked more like paper mache than deformed skin, apart from Dr. Satan, who does look very effective but is unfortunately severely underused.
Well, I can see that it might be annoying for some viewers, but it also adds a surreal quality to the movie.
It also leaves nothing to your imagination so that you dredge up in your mind what's happening as in the original "Texas Chainsaw."
It may also be the real truth behind Mike and Louise's cool attitude when they find a disembowelled cat mysteriously dumped in the back of their van.
It's also worth noting that Richard Casey didn't go for that old slasher chestnut of having a cast full of pretty boys and page 3 girls to dismember.
The movie also had strange flashbacks and flashforwards.
The film also contains a rather clever plot misdirection about mid way through, a subplot about cops and one of the victim's father that makes you think the plot is going to evolve one way, but then completely changes direction you.
On the road, they meet a pretty blond hitch-hiker who also knows about the legend of Doctor Satan...and a little more!
Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it, I wish to write a new Â more positive Â review, if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change.
There's also a surprisingly gritty torture sequence at the end, with the bad guys using a pair of pliers on Bond's toes.
There are also some funny bits, such as when Leiter manages to keep money away from one of Le Chiffre's henchmen.
I'm now sorry I missed "The Escapist" at Sundance which has also not yet been released commercially this side of the Atlantic.
The story as such can be told in it's entirety in a few sentences and scenes, which in fact it also is - the remainder of the of the movie just consists of endless, clichÃ©d retrospectives, soul searching dialogs, marathon shots of facial expressions, you name it...
The characters you mentioned played by Ewan MacGregor and Matthew Macfadayen, one who is not only caught in the candidness of Michelle Williams character, but also her husband's Supervisor giving his personal tickets away to save his own carcass based on probabilities.
Hellgate is populated with zombies/ghosts/whatever, who the heck knows, they act like zombies but they also disappear like ghosts.
But the film offers much more deeper insights than those alone and also a lot of hope for the future.
It is also curious that they have no family, or friends who drop by to comfort her.
It also takes the time to "explain" the resilienceÂ of London in a voice-over.
I also think "Incendiary" is not focused enough, as it tries to deal with too many topics including grief, guilt, quest for truth and the road to healing.
Equally good is Wayne Morris, as a cop who also falls for Luppino.
Dane Clark is also quite good as Barry, the convict.
But the movie is also a testimonial to the demandingly high standards of Hollywood studio production-- scope out the great farm house that almost looks like Katrina hit it, and the road project that looks so real, I expect it was.
There's also the exquisite b&w photography from cameraman Ted Mc Cord, along with expert direction from studio ace Jean Negulesco.
Speaking of the outdoors, it's also a measure of the film's underlying romanticism that the lovers seek refuge in the liberating openness of nature, and away from the blessings of civilization.
Actors Tim Peyton, Adri Curry, and Meadow Williams also did a good job and were pleasant to work with on set.
The "'Alien' rip-off" label is a bit of a misnomer, since 'Alien' is itself a rip-off of 'Planet of the Vampires', but accurate in that yes, the plot is basically the same, the setting being a genetic research station on a planet that just happens to also have the exact same rock formation that Captain Kirk fought the Gorn on in the classic 'Star Trek' episode 'Arena'!
Personally, I also enjoyed THE PIT quite a bit (perhaps also against popular opinion...)and definitely feel that THE PIT is the stronger of the two-so if you can find the double-disc for cheap and enjoy campy films-I'd recommend picking it up.
The episode also features an early role for one Robert Redford, who gives an early glimpse of his charisma in his role as the policeman.
Directed by William A. Levey, who also appears in the film as the severed head in the fridge, I though Hellgate was crap.
(Interestingly, apart from the actual Genesis account, a phrase from the Song of Songs is also used when Lot is offering his daughters to the mob outside, desperately trying to convince them of the attractions of 'woman').
She was also in the film version of Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess"(also directed by Preminger)and starring opposite Sidney Poitier,Pearl Bailey,and Sammy Davis,Jr.,and opposite Paul Newman in "Paris Blues",which reunited her with leading man Sidney Poitier.
She also made her mark in action films as well starring opposite former NFL-great Jim Brown in "The Split".
Even the variety show concept also featured African-American actors as well and during the success of Diahann Carroll's sitcom,two black oriented shows were launched featuring black women in their own weekly variety shows..one of them was Broadway sensation and actress Leslie Uggams whose variety show was on CBS,and the other was Barbara McNair whose variety series lasted one season for NBC.
Carroll played a widowed single mother Julia Baker(her fighter pilot husband had been shot down in Vietnam),who also worked as a nurse for a large hospital.
This film could be a real gem if it would not be a fake; it is largely sustained by the great performance of the 2 actors, also there is a pleasant and fortunate choice of characters around them, the screen play has wonderful passages but ... the whole is incredibly wasted under a ton of moralistic non sense mainly anti sexual: the lovers go around spending their passion in thousands of kisses but never are able to complete it with what you are expecting they must do; instead here is the punishment; after the last stupid, unbelievable and meaningless misunderstanding the girl run away and is knocked down by a car; he visits her at the hospital all seems OK but when he comes again the doctor says she is dead; what do you expect him to do, perhaps bursting into tears?
The whole sequence with a little duck, Napoleon, is also very amusing.
Considering humor, I should also mention Monpti and Anne Claire's first meeting in the park: "Did I really say that?"
It has melancholy, affection but also a great fun and vitality in some parts and, as a result, fits to the movie really well.
It is also another movie that "cured" Romy of the sweet image of Sissi and constituted a "preludium" to her French career (of course not the only film doing that but an important and an early one - 1957).
It's also a wonderful insight into a change introduced in cinema.
However, von Vaszery also wrote the script for the movie.
But I also claim that the film version is invariably so much improved, that only a formalist could prefer the book version.
Besides, the movie is also superior whenever there is no obvious difference between both.
I also meant that she is a skilled actress but not more skilled than many others.
Yes, a very romantic film and also a comedy ending up as drama.
He even does a nude scene - yes, that's right - he is totally nude and straddling the actress who play his steady girl - she is also nude and she is hideous to look at as well - she kind of has a MacKenzie Phillips look only harsher.
NONE of this is talked about, I liked Greta Saachi as Gale Sondergard WHO WAS NOT a major actress, She won here Oscar for her first performance & was in supporting roles ever since, I felt Goldblum was effective as Biberman also a minor writer of films,   as always   jay harris
I also met Francis Williams (no relation) an African-American cultural worker who played an important role in developing the script.
However, One of the Hollywood Ten does accurately tell the story of Herber Bieberman and his trials and eventual conviction of being branded a communist by the US Government, and the ramifications this had to not only his life, but also that of his actress wife as well.
I also appreciated the tenderness and commitment the he and his wife showed to each other.
You also get Mr. Kibbee, providing seasoned counterpoint for the upper-crusted Mr. Smith, and similarly dignified Henry Stephenson (as Havisham).
The well-staged street scenes and beautiful sets are obviously highlights, with the opening sequences most impressive - but also noteworthy are simpler scenes.
Mickey Rooney is also very memorable, showing once again he was a very dynamic and versatile child actor, handling comic and dramatic scenes very well - even in the same film.
(You should also check him out in YOUNG TOM EDISON for another example of this)  I actually think the 80s tele-movie with Ricky Shroder and Alec Guiness worked slightly better than this version does; the characters are a lot more casual in their delivery, and the story flows better.
Bartholomew is excellent as young Cedrick and Smith is fine as the crusty old Earl who learns to love his grandson, additionally Rooney as Dick the bootblack, and Kibbee as storekeeper Hobbs are also outstanding.
IF they do, hopefully they will also restore the missing scenes so the film runs its full length.
Character actor Guy Kibbee also seems made to play staunch anti-aristocrat American Silas Hobbs.
This was originally made for black and white with an excellent cinematography by Charles Rosher but there is also available in computer-colorized and the musical score is by the classic Max Steiner.
Newcomer Parisa Fakhri is also very endearing.
Speaking of bad movies, if you are lucky you will get the two disc set that not only has Hellgate but also has The Pit.
This movie, although Korean, also reflects on the other Asian societies where wealth, materialism and self-centredness are overshadowing the importance of kindness and virtue.
She is also a former Miss Colorado.
Grubeck is given his statutory one phone call which he uses to phone 976-EVIL a direct line to hell, Grubeck is given powers which enable him to astrally project himself while asleep & is also given the name of the drunk who meets a very sticky end that night.
It's pretty bland & forgettable stuff while the gore is also disappointing, someone is impaled, someone has a garden trowel stuck in them in a direct rip-off, sorry homage to Night of the Living Dead (1968), a few after the fact slit throats, & in the films best moment a guy is hit by a speeding truck & he just explodes everywhere, excellent.
976-EVIL is also one of those films where it's fun to try & spot all the continuity errors as there's plenty of them.
There's also Bob Balaban playing his usual fussy nebbish character, this time as a meticulous number cruncher who can't let go of his pencils.
The film also has some similarities to the brilliant 'The Body Snatcher (1945)', which also followed in the same vein and starred the ever-reliable Boris Karloff.
The camera-work also evokes some attention too; by holding together the films steady structure and menace by getting deep into the terrifying hysteria that this mess eventuates into.
The script too, is fleshed out rather well, by upping the suspense and surprises but also questioning that of morality and the backlash of this touchy subject.
The Flesh and the Fiends, also known as Mania, is one of those pleasant surprises.
The same can be said for Pleasance who also plays a bad man with such conviction.
Kudos also to Billie Whitelaw, "The Omen"'s nanny from hell, here playing a tragic pub girl.
The nice-looking widescreen DVD that I just watched, from the fine folks at Image, also contains the racier "Continental" version of "The Flesh and the Fiends," which adds little more than a few topless tavern floozies and a slightly more explicit hanging sequence; not much of an improvement.
Dr. Knox's condescending attitude towards his fellow colleagues also provides a number of entertaining confrontation scenes (my favorite line is during their face-off at his house, when he brusquely terminates the discussion by instructing them to "incline their heads slightly to the left...{in order to} observe the door...{and could they} please use it!
By the way, the producing team of Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman (who doubled as cinematographer) also brought to the screen the nefarious deeds of other historical figures such as JACK THE RIPPER (1959) and THE HELLFIRE CLUB (1961; upcoming on DVD from Dark Sky Films).
Image's DVD also includes the "Continental Version" which contains about a minute of more explicit violence and nudity (in the many tavern sequences) - though this only helps render it even more unsavory than it already is!
Two of the grave robbers, William Hare (Donald Pleasence) and William Burke (George Rose), however, have their very particular methods to bring in corpses that are especially fresh...  Aditionally to the terrifying and fascinating story and the gloomy atmosphere, "The Flesh And The Fiends" also profits from a brilliant cast.
Because of this, Flesh and the Fiends is also a tale of scientific-ethics--with a wrongheaded-ending!
Directed by Hammer-director John Gilling, it was also a minor-hit, and is easily one of Peter Cushing's best-performances.
Cushing's performance is also nuanced, illustrating the moral-dilemma that Knox must have felt utilizing the kind-of cadavers Burke and Hare provided him.
It has some weaknesses, and a most peculiar ending, but Cushing and Pleasance give two of their best ever performances, Rose matches them, and a young Billie Whitelaw is memorable also.
"The Flesh and the Fiends" isn't just a great historical film, it also is a praiseworthy horror achievement with a uniquely grim atmosphere and very convincing acting performances.
I kept waiting for Erik Estrada to make a cameo, everything else I've seen his personal butt boy (Bruce Penhall) in has also had Erik making a grease show of it.
The usual action flesh fantasy for male viewers, this Sidaris flick is not as good as a few others, but the girls looks great (there is my favorite Playmate, Wendy Hamilton, that doesn't show as much as I hope, but it's still a threat; there is also Julie Strain's Black Widow, with an opening scene Basic Instinct style that it's really good) and the action is good enough to let the 90 minutes of the movie pass without any boring moment.
Kathleen Turner plays Beverly, the seemingly perfect, cheerful housewife and Mom (who also happens to be a foul-mouthed serial killer on the side), in John Waters's consistently sharp, amusing satire "Serial Mom."
The satire, however, is not just aimed at Beverley, but also at her victims, some of whom are such obnoxious individuals that it is impossible to have any sympathy for them, despite their horrific fates.
Stubbins, who suggests that Chip is in need of "therapy" because of his love of horror films, is the sort of arrogant, self-important teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives, down to their taste in films.
Waters fans should also watch for cameos /small roles by Alan Wendel, Traci Lords, Susan Lowe, Mary Vivian Pearce (I only recognized her from her distinctive voice) and though he doesn't appear in the credits, Waters manages to work in Don Knotts.
In "Serial Mom", you also recognize Waters' strong taste for bloody, gore and horror movies.
She is also a serial killer.
Critics who have attacked Waters for being gratuitous are mistaken: he DOES show the consequences of the corrupt acts he depicts -- but he also reveals the sad truth, which is that no one really cares anymore.
Along with taking on our culture's passion for depravity, the film also addresses our OTHER potentially dangerous problem: repressed conservative housewives.
Still, there are a few good moments, such as when King Sunny Ade and his African Beats are playing, and also when they show any exterior shot (the movie was filmed around Mesa and Phoenix, AZ).
I completely understand the plot it goes like this :  - Girl without memory has face changed for some reason - The police changed her memory - She changed her face because she did a drug rip-deal - Here brother likes to kill people who look like her - Actually she is a Turkish terrorist - Jean reno is involved in something - The turks kill another group of turks in a bath filled with mint  Then it gets better :  - The girl is a ninja - The drugs are in an enormous cave filled with death people - The case collapses and Reno is death - No he is not death  Never mind all that the end is amazing :  - Reno, the cop, the girl, the brother all end up in Turkey - At the same time of course, the whole France police force is also there - The girl kills here father - The cop, reno and the police kill everyone else in the village - The serial killer brother tries to serial kill the girl  The best thing about this movie however is the final end :  - Switch of DVD player, throw disk in bin, and sue the french for wasting your time.
The players' Turkish was also so funny that I had considerable difficulty in understanding what they were speaking.
The story as an action-thriller movie (besides the Turk theme) was also unbelievable :)) How can Turkish mafia know very good french and know little Turkish?
You will find some similarities of the film with Crimson Rivers, which is also based on Grange's book and Jean Reno played the lead character Commissioner Pierre Niemans.
Anna Heymes (Arly Jover), the wife of a respected government official Laurent (Philippe Bas) is having a rare amnesia and nightmarish hallucinations of horrible murders, while in the Turkish neighborhood of Paris, Police Captian Paul Nerteaux (Jocelyn Quivrin) is trying to solve the possible serial killings of the illegal Turkish women with the help of an ex-cop Jean-Louis Schiffer (Jean Reno), who is also an expert in Turkish underworld and organized crime.
The film also has a hint of an Islamophobic air, given the current geopolitical climate, but not to the point of being overt.
A lot of ''serious'' film critics consider the ''New French Cinema''(with Luc Besson as the biggest exponent)as an artistic prostitution which destroys Godard's,Truffaut's and Rohmer's legacy.I have to say I appreciate a lot that kind of movies because they take the Hollywood's clichÃ©s and they give them ''new life''.In other words,films like Dobermann,La Femme Nikita and The Crimson Rivers take the typical clichÃ©s but,in the hands of talented directors and screenwriters,they take ''new life'' so the final result is something innovative.L'Empire des Loups is another example of what I just mentioned.This film adapts the North American clichÃ©s to the French style and the result is a very entertaining and interesting thriller with a lot of energy.Director Chris Nahon and his screenwriters(Nahon is also one of them)do not stop in giving too much explanations in this movie,so the spectator has to pay a lot of attention.And I really appreciated that as the best element from this movie.I'm tired of the Hollywood movies which explain everything thinking the spectator is stupid.Nahon and his screenwriters trust that the spectator will be enough intelligent for taking out conclusions.This film always keeps the suspense and there are some really unexpected revelations.The fail I found on this movie was that,near the ending of the film,there's an imbalance.I mean,this film has a mysterious noir style and near the ending,the film suddenly becomes in an action film with explosions,chases and shootings.That parts are fun and exciting for themselves but they seem like out of place.In spite of that,L'Empire des Loups is a very entertaining and tense thriller that I totally recommend.
I was pleasantly surprised by this film and have also wondered about the negative reviews.
And although the beginning was suspenseful and good, you will notice the point where the movie breaks ... where it won't only get ridiculous, but the movie also falls to pieces.
I'll never know, but I also don't care!
i also think that whoever enjoyed this one will love "Vidocq" and vice versa  summary-good points  great movie,nice performances-very good casting,excellent photography,AMAZING soundtrack,good thriller,beautiful locations  European cinema rocks once again
L'EMPIRE DES LOUPS is another intelligent, intense and very explosive thriller from the author Jean-Christophe GrangÃ© who wrote also the first CRIMSON RIVERS.
But never the less it's a nice piece of work for the positive points, in terms of quality, aside from the storyline, some thriller-like scenes are too exaggerated (almost like a bad horror movie), the same exaggeration happens with some action scenes also.
It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.
I also enjoyed the portrayal of a Music Professor as the action hero.
The Eighteenth Angel has some stylistic resemblance to The Omen (1976), which shouldn't be surprising because David Seltzer, the scripter, also wrote that earlier staple of the genre.
He also routinely incorporates a number of extended cinematographic techniques, such as different film stocks and a wide range of approaches to lighting and exposures--from "washed out", or "whited out", brightly lit and generously apertured snippets to shots with dark, chiaroscuro-like shadows and silhouettes.
I also loved Schell as the creepy two-faced priest.
The climax of the film also has somewhat of a "gothic action" feel, and there's a beautifully nihilistic denouement that should boost any horror fan's rating a point or two.
Mariska Hargitay is also good as Olin's assistant.
XX There Are Spoilers XX Disturbing crime/court drama based on a novel by famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz who also wrote the screenplay about rape deception and finally murder.
I remember the performances and the cinematography to have been excellent also.
The film is also a mirror image of Serling's "Seven days in May," and represents the only way a good guy (a true Washington outsider) could get catapulted to power (except for the Prisoner of Zenda-esque comedy "Dave").
His letter, which the film implies should be like an earthquake of drama shaking this family, is instead predictable and its tragic consequences are also predictable.
What I really loved about it is how the screenplay contrasts not just guilt and innocence but also knowledge and belief, loyalty to family and loyalty to the truth, and grief and guilt.
Burt Lancaster looked stunning, and also gave a decent performance.
Things unravel little by little until finally, their entire world crumbles around them, as if they were also living in a war torn, bombed out city.
That the film faithfully carried Miller's message of contempt and loathing not only for the worship of that false god(capitalism), but also for the whole Horatio Alger hero myth (that both American liberals and conservatives embrace) is quite daring.
It also reached back and had a feel of Cheech and Chong in it.
He is also aware that his father has a secretive side - one that he is sensitive about.
Lancaster, too, and his girlfriend (LOUISA HORTON) who happens to be Duff's sister, also bring the conflicts into the open when they start asking for answers and probing for the truth.
Mady Christians is also a standout as Joe's devoted wife, who herself is in denial that Larry is probably dead and knowing full well what her husband did was wrong.
I also don't like that Cartoon Channel is marketing "Grim and Evil" towards young children, when the humor---again, much in the vein of the wild and crazy "edgy 'toons"---- is gross enough to be considered adult.
This cartoon is great for teenagers and adults, though; they are also the ones who may actually understand the homages to horror writers or older cartoons that may go over the heads of little kids.
They also don't repeat new episodes enough, blah.
I watched the 1985 film Krush Groove yesterday, I must say I really enjoyed it.Now here's the thing about this movie.If you do not like rap, you will probably not enjoy this movie.If you hate very old-school rap(any rap song that came out before 1988), you probably will not like this movie.However, if you like the genre of music, you will probably enjoy this film.I really like this kind of rap.I also like old gangsta rap from the late 80's to late 90's.I also like other types of music such as rock, metal etc.Therefore, I liked Krush Groove.The plot of the film involves a man who is trying to start his own record label, his brother's a member of rap group Run DMC.He starts it after a loan, and it does work, however there is another big record producer who is stealing his artists.He also owes money to the man who originally gave it to him.Meanwhile, a rap group called "The Disco Three"(The Fat Boys), are trying to make it big in the rap game.The movie features music from artists such as Shiela E, Run DMC, The Beastie Boys, Fat Boys, LL Cool J etc.If you like old-school hip hop/rap, then Krush Groove is the movie you should see.
He also seems puny to the grown-up bad boy Sedgewick Bell, the student he tried to unsuccessfully "mold" into a moral man--Bell invites him to his huge estate, where he also announces his candidacy for Senator--it makes prof Hundert's moralizing seem a bit silly.
This movie is not only to have a nice evening but also to question your life.
The poetry exposed in Dead Poets Society is some of the greatest in history, so if you're a literature geek, you should also watch this movie.
The movie also shows that learning methods don't necessary have to be rigid or antiquate.
In general, Robin Williams is as humorous as usual in this movie, but we can also see some of his talent for drama.
Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse.
However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well.
An injustice has been committed, but it has also been recognized, and perhaps a lesson learned.
As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.
I thought Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) gave a true life twist to the film, Robin Williams (Mr. Keating or also known as Captain my captain) added an element of excitement, and Robert Sean Leonard (Neil Perry)added passion that leaves you mesmerized.
The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story.
Doug is given wonderful support from three excellent character actors: Warner Oland as a silly Austrian Archduke whose foolish behavior precipitates the movie's crisis; Jean Hersholt as a social climbing buffoon who gets more than he bargained for; and vile Donald Crisp (who also directed) as the villain who wants both Fairbanks' life & sweetheart.
His powerful personality & spectacular stunts not only dominate the movie, but also have ensured him an unassailable niche in Hollywood history.
Here as Zorro's son, we also get some neat whiptricks and the sight of 2 Fairbanks (as Zorro and his son) in addition to the usual acrobatic stunts.
Cesar also makes an enemy of surly Don Sebastian (Donald Crisp), a member of the Queen's guard, and both men fall for the beautiful Dolores de Muro (Mary Astor).
He also shows himself to be a dandy on the dance floor in a parody of a Valentino tango.
And it also proceeded THE EVIL DEAD with a story of college kids sitting around a disused cabin running afoul of some sort of hyperkenetic supernatural force of evil.
This style has resulted in some dreadful bombs for Altman, but it's also been responsible for some of his inspired classics.
He duly demonstrates his usual witty tough guy image, but there is also much grace and warmth brought with age in his performance.
Starring Humphrey Bogart {Ferguson}, Everett Sloane {Mendoza} and the excellent, and wonderfully named, Zero Mostel {Big Babe Lazich}, it's also thought that Raoul Walsh had quite a hand in the final product.
The book by that name actually came out in 1951 and also inspired this movie.
He was also referred to in the press as the only honest man in New York City, an exaggeration, but perhaps only a slight one.
We also see how the mob, now concerned about electronic surveillance has come up with code words like contract and hit to confuse law enforcement.
This concept, although very familiar to audiences today, was something very topical at the time of the film's release and also a matter of great public interest.
The colourful collection of characters featured in "The Enforcer" are brought to life vividly by the excellent cast and Humphrey Bogart is especially good as a man who is extremely determined and powerfully focused on his task but is nevertheless also very controlled and methodical when necessary.
ASPHALT JUNGLE and FORCE OF EVIL are also films with scenes of double-crosses and back- stabbing that I enjoy as much as THE ENFORCER.
DeCorsia is seen as the frightened witness and also as the tough racketeer.
It is almost a masterpiece, and unfortunately my friends, who are also fans of movies, do not know this magnificent film.
Ray Walston (also known as Mr. Hand in Fast Times at Ridgemont High) gives an incredible performance as the senile "Gramps".
What made this movie to Cann, and winning the Canadian film festival is, it bold production design, Very Brave to be difference, It also does capture and show beautiful scene though, While I was seeing this movie I just fell like I was in a real stage theater.
i also understand why some westerners may think the movie is strange and don't fully understand all of it.
He shows the ability to tell a story confidently and has no problems in going back and forward in time while he is unfolding the love story of the 2 main characters.He also has an technical ability not forgetting any detail showed previously in the film.
The songs are quite cool and the main actress is a not only beautiful but also she can act, the same can be said of the actor who plays the main male character, he's handsome and a good actor as well.
To conclude, this is a movie I recommend to see, not only because otherwise you'll never be able to boast you have seen a Thai western Âwhich is always a strange thing to seeÂ but also because is an entertaining movie with a couple of fine touches of comedy .
The movie breaks the illusion of being a movie very quickly, also.
It is also anachronistic, as there are cars available yet most use horses.
There is also a musical element to the movie.
A fun film, a weird film, and possible influences seem to be Guy Maddin & John Waters, so if you're up for a strange western with surreal sets and Thai actors, well, give it a shot, it's pretty strange but also rather astounding.
Dum (Chartchai Ngamsan), also known as the notorious Black Tiger, renowned fastest and deadliest draw in all of Thailand, has a childhood sweetheart in Rumpoey (Sttella Malucchi).
What a feast for the eyes, but the substance was clearly drowned out by the vibrant plateau of ultra-bright colours and by also the deviously campy style the director opted out for.
The pulsating score splashes out a variety of eastern, but also western themes.
I kept asking myself if I was watching a cartoon and that's definitely because of the look, but also the performances.
Dum (Chartchai Ngamsan), also known as the Black Tiger, is a member of Fai's gang, and obviously the fastest shot in all the (colourful) land.
I'm also convinced that the creators of this film took on a bet to discover just how much of the colour pink can be displayed in one movie.
The two best though, are Fai, a classic machine gun and vest bad guy who has the films funniest shot in his first shootout - look out for it, its quite subtle - and Mahesuan, Dum's right-hand man, who has the best evil laugh EVER, using it whenever he gets the chance, also one half of an inspired shootout or two.
His duel in the first half hour is also one of the funniest shots for any film fan.
While not exactly the same plot (it doesn't mention the transition from James II to William of Orange during the revolution, as it was set about 40 years earlier in history) and also a bit graphic, it is about an evil judge who delights in torture and rape to deal with witches...or pretty much anyone who doesn't do his bidding.
Jess Franco-fans will also recognize another regular in his films, Howard Vernon, who plays the executioner.
The executed girl's sister flees up the country and falls in love with the son of an eminent politician, who also happens to rebel against the corrupt English crown.
There are also darker and not quite so subtle themes where Milius' militant patriotism really brings uncomfortable undertones - most notably two scenes of killing prisoners, which is shown as almost glorified or at least self-explanatory.
wow.this depiction of the Spanish-American war,and one particular American regiment,took my breath away.there may be some historical liberties taken,but who cares.this TV mini series was outstanding.the battle scenes were something to behold.John Milius directed and co-wrote this movie.he also wrote several episodes of the TV series Rome.the acting her is first rate.Tom Berenger plays Theodore Roosevelt(before he became President)who led the regiment.Sam Elliot plays Capt.Bucky O'Neil,Gary Busey plays Gen.Joseph' Fighting Joe' Wheeler.also in the cast are Illeana Douglas as Edith Roosevelt,and Chris Noth.there are many others in the cast and all are superb.this movie is about 3 hours long,but it doesn't feel like that at all.this is one of the best war movies i have seen.9/10
Roosevelt was also a man who would stand for nothing less than the United States being nothing less than number one.
It not only documents his life... it also presents his great ideals and character as very 'Presidential' and to be desired.
this is an excellent film that most have never heard of because it was made for TV (turner)and never shown in the theater.not much to add except that the film sheds light on the short and little known 1898 Spanish-American war which while trumped up by the media(newspaper publisher William Randolph Hurst played superbly by George Hamilton)catapulted the up until then isolationist united states on to the world stage for the first time and which gave the united states control of Spanish territories around the globe-Cuba,Puerto Rico the Philippines,wake island,Guam and the Marshall islands.and allowing the united states to flex its military might globally for the first time.there are some historical inaccuracies(such as the imperial German army advisor's aiding the Spanish, director john milius also made the turn of the century imperial Germans the bad guys in his 1975 film THE WIND AND THE LION in which Brian Keith played teddy Roosevelt as president during an international incident resolved by his big stick diplomacy-sending the marines.if you liked rough riders see the wind and the lion.
It's also a fact that many of his Rough Riders did not get to go to Cuba for lack of space on the ships.
Great music also.
The music is also fantastic, like in every DÃ¶rrie film.
It was also fun to watch one of Rob Lowe's brothers in yet another B horror picture.
However they soon discover a jungle full of horrors including giant spiders, giant scorpions, flying dragons, a giant ape & a tribe of primitives...  Co-written & directed by Leigh Scott who also plays Dr. Armstrong in the it this is another terrible zero budget Asylum produced sci-fi flick that in this case is a complete rip-off of King Kong.
The island is also inhabited by some other group of people whose ship crashes on the island.
You also see one scene of killer scorpions, and then some "King Kong" ripoff giant gorilla stops by at the end of the movie to stomp on everyone.
You also see all of about two sorry minutes of him.
It also seems to suffer from being updated, maybe it would have been better to have set it in the period it was wrote in.
Their quest is also interesting, as they keep finding more and more planes that crashed on the island, which sets up a nice mystery, and then they're captured by the tribe of natives and we're pretty much in the B-movie fun zone after that.
I wish they'd have used black & white as the Ansco Color is also very washed out and the graininess and blurriness is very distracting.
It would have been a wasted trip, but for the fact that he also did Executive Suite in the same package.
But she's also sweet on Confederate captain John Forsythe and she's there to spring him.
*END OF SPOILER*  William Holden good as Captain Roper and Eleanor Parker as Carla also puts in a good performance.
  Good classic film that shows how the North dealt with the Confederates and American Indians at the same time during the U.S. Civil war.Good overall production and the ciematography was very good.To nitpick,the movie started slow and Parker's dresses were too unrealistic for the circumstances.Also the romance chemistry between Parker and Holden was lacking.The script could also have been a tag better.Still,the second half of the film delivered the action goods which will delight true Western genre fans.Only for fans of the genre who are not partial to the Confederate side and fans of the lead stars......
She would also appear the next year in another film--"The Naked Jungle"--featuring man-eating ants.
It's originality also help to make this movie a better than average one.
Nevertheless the love-story itself is also quite different and original, so it isn't as distracting as in most other genre movies from the same period often was the case.
It makes the movie look outdated but that also by now has become part of the charm of these sort of movies.
The supporting cast also pull of well, especially John Forsythe.
One can argue that Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, and starred in greater films than his neglected 1928 gem, The Circus, his last fully silent film, which he also wrote with Joseph Plunkett, but one cannot reasonably argue that he made a funnier film; nor can one argue that The Circus is not a great film itself.
We also write a short review for each and every film.
There are consistent funnies all along the way, but also an endearing story of his affection for a female horse rider from the show, who's sweet on someone else.
I was also struck by how creative and interesting so many shots were in this film, even more so than some early sound movies.
Jaws 3 also had some great actors, including Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong.
As was typical in most of Chaplin's pictures, there is also a love interest that forms the story's emotional heart.
These are both characteristic of Chaplin, walking around in a tramp's outfit on his own Hollywood studio, also the two opposite roles in "Dictator."
The film also raises the issue of spontaneity vs. meticulous rehearsal.
This turns dark and perhaps the darkness is implicit in the persona of the tramp and the venue of the circus, but it also has some breathtaking and very funny sequences before that final third.
It also has a great, poignant ending.
The acting is at the very top of the scale with Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong let me also mention Lea Thompson all three at this time were very young making this work their earliest roles.
He also falls in love with the ringmaster's cruelly treated daughter, which leads to a poignant ending.
His scores are always repetitive; but they're also sweet and funny and they enhance the action.
Gosling also did a pretty good job, though IMO some of his mannerisms didn't work.
The twist was also revealed in a rather convenient manner but the actual twist at the end was clever.
We also get a quick insight into his huge ego.
We also find that his wife who is exhausted by trying to kowtow to Ted's massive ego is in the midst of an affair.
Fracture is a solid but flawed courtroom drama/thriller that offers terrific acting and a compelling story, but it also suffers from typical "Hollywood-izing" that undermines the ending to the point of complete incredulity.
An officer can not fire his gun without accounting for each and every bullet, he also writes a report after every event that would have shown he had put his gun down while he turned his back, which he wouldn't have done to start with.
Only once, I think, have I ever proclaimed something "best movie of the year" and all that, because it's all too subjective and also a clichÃ© but that's how I feel about this movie unless something better comes along the last few months of 2007.
The camera-work by Director Of Photography Kramer Morgenthau should also be recognized, along with director Gregory Hoblit, who seems to direct very entertaining films ("Frequency," "Fallen," etc.)
Not only is this film packed with drama, excitement, and suspense, it is also dusted with just enough humor to make it one of the most supremely entertaining movies of the year.
It contained a very simple plot structure but also offered a very original take on a different type of court case.
The tagline of this film sounds interesting, but also shows the movie's thin plot.
"Fracture" (2007) is directed by Gregory Hoblit who has also made "Frequency" (2000), "Fallen" (1998) both of which I like and "Primal Fear" (1996) - his feature debut that I love.
I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance.
This move also features Old cowboys like Ben Johnson, Eli Wallach (co-star of The Magnificent Seven), beautiful Kathryn Harrold, and TV Roots, LeVar Burton.
Fortunately he looks pretty good in this film, at least better than he did in "Tom Horn" and "An Enemy of the People" and he also looks like he was having a pretty good time.
It was also nice to see him in his final film go full-circle playing a modern equivalent to his break-through role as a bounty hunter in "Wanted:Dead or Alive", which was where I first became a fan of McQueen's.
This movie shows him go after various people and also shows his home life...which is a bit unique too.
Someone who he captured in the past also stalks him.
I also really like the music.
also prove brave and honorable.
I would also like to mention Mariko, a minor character but still my personal favourite: she is a young girl who has the same mutation as Lucy, who does horrific things to people with the air of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass.
There is also a lot of nudity in the series that is so unnecessary and misused that it only adds to the disaster factor.
If you are knew to anime this is also a good show.
The Enlgish voice acting is well done also.
It also looks into the minds of characters, who have their own emotional and psychological problems (example: Lucy/Nyu suffers from split personality disorder) This also goes for its stunningly realistic artwork; I'm talking especially about its backgrounds (they remind me of old paintings somehow).
Despite the fact that it is a sublime, gorgeous story, it is also sad, heart-wrecking, and unfair.
The diclonius are a mutated form of life, they are recognized by a set of horns that look like cat ears, they also possess telekinetic powers through the use of their "vectors", invisible arms that they control with a number and a reach depending on the diclonius.
They are considered to be the new race of humanity but also at the same time incredibly dangerous to the human race.
She awakens incapable to say anything other than "Nyu" she is also completely docile and child like in innocence.
My only complaint is that the ending while very satisfying, also left me wanting more, i can't help but think maybe this should have been a few episodes longer.
The pacing runs perfectly for the main story but their were also a few loose ends that i wanted tied up, maybe i shouldn't complain though as the ending did a great thing and left me thinking about it, or maybe an OVA down the tracks, i would be all for it.
The rest of the music in the series, minus the ending theme, is also very touching and well composed.
It'll give you an entirely different perspective on Anime itself but also life.
The main plot follows the usual formula boy takes innocent girl in, falls in love with her, but there are also any complex character dilemmas.
I did not see too many anime to have an authoritative opinion on this, but I believe that the excellent soundtrack is also one of the sources of the emotional blend of sweet and bitter atmosphere in the movie.
One of the nice parts, and maybe also of the sources of strong emotions associated with the movie is the way in which the director develops some of the main characters in such a way that they are complete.
The overhead shots were also unnecessary.
Great film-making also!
This movie also scares me.
I also think that the way the scene was shot with the white mami was indeed in horribly bad taste.
Yes, I am aware of the fact that I'm ranting on and on, but that's partly also because there's very little to say about the film itself.
Arguably, the best element about the entirely pitiable project is the enticing title, and then that is also for about 99% inaccurate.
Peter Vaughan ( who played her Dad ) left also, and the role went to Tony Steedman.
Other characters also do their part well- Omprakash, Leela Mishra,Sujit Kumar, Vinod Mehra and others have done their part well.
The character of Anand is also brilliant as he is not just a neutral character.
Rajesh Khanna has also given an Oscar performance.
This film also shows Indains have talent and qualities as these people were born and brought up in India and were Indian by heart.
By, coincidence, the most respected, wealthy and influential elite of the city also finds solace in the company of this woman.
The scripting is also top notch and the music is well done.
There's also the element of industry that finds this way in this mix, especially because of the presence of human beings in this mix.
He also gets two interviews with women who were around when the war was there- one who is given no words for what she says except that her husband was killed, another who had a child with her and who is now traumatized- and somehow this too works even out of context.
But there's also a daring here that is totally unshakable too, and from a point of view of cinematography it actually goes on par (if not occasionally seems to top) what Kubrick did in 2001 or what Lynch could've done in Dune, which is that a filmmaker uses places and objects that are of this world, but then taking the audience to a place that is also assuredly not so.
It is obviously a contemporary urban area because we see highways, traffic, stoplights, and large buildings, but it is also obvious that it is not an American city.
Jaws 3-D (1983) was not only a sequel to the first two JAWS films, but it was also one of the few movies that took advantage of the rebirth of the 3-D fad that was sweeping Hollywood during the early 80's (see Amityville 3-D and Friday the 13th 3-D).
Sebastian (Aaron Patrick Freeman) along with his girlfriend Talia (Danielle Hartnett) & an idiot named Cousin Ted (Robert Berson) also turn up later on to join the party.
As the friends drive out to an isolated log cabin I was thinking The Evil Dead (1981) crossed with a bit of Cabin Fever (2002) & when I saw the woods I was also thinking that the filmmakers had recently seen The Blair Witch Project (1999) along with Friday the 13th (1980) & it's fairly easy to tell that these (& more besides) had an influence on Ghost Game, but then it goes into a slightly different direction with all the supernatural stuff & the game.
I also like Ultimate Force which is also about army life, but Soldier Soldier tells the stories of the lives of the wives and girlfriends as well as the stories of the actual soldiers.
There was also always an officer that was a hard ass and thought he knew it all.
It is the same sort of ghastly and expensive mindset that also gave us HARRY AND WALTER GO TO NEW YORK.
Dom Deluise also stars as the head of Rainbow Studios who came up with the idea of searching for 'The World's Greatest Lover'.
I also thought Carol Kane was wonderful as Rudy's wife Annie and Dom Deluise was as funny as usual as movie mogul Adolph Zitz, one thing you probably found annoying was Gene Wilder's constant screaming and going into hysterics all the time but he does it brilliantly, plus the character of Rudy was very high-strung kinda like Leo Bloom right?
We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock, for which we can at least be grateful.
He is also THE star of the movie.
It also goes a long way towards showing what CAN be done with no effects and no locations beyond the Studio Backlot and a few, cheap but decent sets.
High School Musical 2 is not only the best Disney Channel Original Movie ever made, but it is also sure to become a classic, and one of the best film musicals I've ever seen.
The "dumb slave" persona that he had in the first movie was really amusing, but it was also good to see him coming into his own in High School Musical 2 as a more developed and rounded character.
There's also something new this time around.
I also like that this film concentrates a little more on the importance of characters such as Martha, Kelsi, and Zeke.
One of the smartest movies to come along in a great while, it's also very funny.
He also happens to be up for re-election, so he tours churches, South Central clubs, and the ganglands around L.A., most of which are unplanned and infuriating to his staff, led by talented actor Oliver Platt.
BULWORTH has many scenes in the "hood", most extremely funny, but also brutally realistic.
However, no one's made mention that this is film is also brilliantly crafted.
I can't say this is a comfortable movie to watch, nor a family feature, not only because it has lots of bad words but it's also against other things that are apparently revered in this country, like the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules).
Halle Berry was beautiful as usual, but she also played her part well (she also plays her part well as usual, not implying that she is just a pretty face).
This film was made in 1999, but it also pertains to 2008.
There were also some important political messages that were delivered with a great amount of skill and intelligence.
Along with some very dramatic and meaningful moments found in "Bulworth," also contained is dialogue that is smart, witty, and at times hilarious.
The performances in "Bulworth" entirely demonstrate that Warren Beatty is not only able to direct, write and produce well, but also that capable to lead an all star cast, including Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Isaiah Washington, and Christine Baranski, into an Oscar worthy overall appearance level.
The ending was also exactly what I expected it to be - and what I felt it should have been.
I'm also not a fan of Halle Berry, but she was probably the best person for the role so I'm okay with that.
Of course at this point Beatty is also running from the hit man.
It is also a very disturbing movie.
Not only for the guts it took to so brazenly confront the modern political process (and how it affects race relations, the film industry, education, medicine, and so on) but also for the fact that he wrote it, produced it, directed it, and starred in it.
The supporting cast is also excellent, and Don Cheadle stands out as LD.
There is also a fine supporting role by Don Cheadle, who plays a "business man" who uses young children to sell drugs.
The story that's there is pretty much just a minor melodrama, probably more at home in a silent movie (in which most of the principal actors would've also more at home).
Once released, Bickford goes back to work as a steel miller and is startled to find an all-forgiving Irene waiting to take him back as are his old friends, including Linden whom he has obviously also driven into bankruptcy.
Salma Hayek and Pierce Brosnan have great chemistry as lovers, Brosnan and Woody Harrelson also... ?
But a local gangster (Cheadle), who also has plans for the diamond, befriends Max and now the twists and double-crosses begin.
The film also grotesquely fails as a study of relationships and what we find attractive.
But they also needed an engaging story.
It's also a set-up for a later payoff.
In the island, Lloyd teams up with the beautiful Sophie (Naomie Harris) a local intriguing cop who requires a big arrestÂ   On the scene also appears Henri MoorÃ© (Don Cheadle)Âthe biggest gangster on the islandÂwho affirms to Max that the impoverished people of the island need his help, and that a cash injection in tens of millions of dollars would relieve the entire CaribbeanÂ So, he suggests to Max a partnershipÂ He would give him what he doesn't have: access to the marina, the crews, rotation schedules, whatever he needsÂ   With picturesque sunsets, this colorful caper comedy has plenty of beauty, fun and humorÂ
Even in the 1970's when American films were some of the best ever, Film critics then were also not appreciative of what they had before them.
The best support, however, comes from Rachel Griffiths as Joe's girlfriend, also a cop.
Agent Nine (Sam Neil) tells her she's a hero who saved Russia and that same night she also ends up in his bed.... Not knowing what to do Joan returns to Australia finding out that she is pregnant.
As a son who grew up in a family of communists, I found this movie very insightful: the twists and turns of what fervent idealists took to be worker's paradise through the 50s, 60s, 70s and then to the end of the dream in the late 80s/early 90s was very well portrayed, especially with Judy Davis' stalwart commitment, which was portrayed quite sympathetically; the dark side of her family relationships was also poignantly sketched, as were her son's struggles with history: both global and personal; all in all, a superb blend of the comic and the dramatic: a genre it's very easy to screw up and is rarely, if ever, handled as deftly as it was here.
We simply see the research station from the outside in a screaming snowstorm...but we can also hear Vogel inside screaming in panic.
Her despicable stepfather Lucas Cross (Arthur Kennedy, who at this stage in his career masterfully portrayed drunken lowlifes), rapes her (which results in a pregnancy which Selena later miscarries), and her mother Nelly (Betty Field), who also happens to be the MacKenzie's maid, discovers this and commits suicide.
Mildred Dunnock, Lloyd Nolan, Leon Ames and Lorne Green also have notable roles.
Many people seem to have ragged on Diane Varsi's performance as Alison, but she's fine and Lane Turner also turns in one of her best performances as her mother.
And Dr. Swain, as dim-witted a practitioner as I ever hope to encounter, doesn't think to point out that life in prison is also (duh) life without Ted.
Diane Varsi, as Turner's daughter is also the narrator, occasionally brilliant, but somewhat monotone in voice.
The cinematography of the Camden, Maine location, by William C. Mellor, is also outstanding.
The movie have its share of dated trappings and mistakes (as a previous IMDb user commented, the film is set during WWII and the 50's fashions don't match the 40's setting) as well as the Hays Office mandates were still in effect, which also explains why some story lines were purposely watered-down or even censored.
This aspect of the story also had a lot more potential that what was seen, and again, its (sad) resolve was too pat Â although truer-to-life than some of the plots.
Peyton Place as a character itself also goes through a metamorphosis in the film.
Some other reviewers have pointed out that the movie was called "A Cold Night's Death" when they saw it - that was also the case as far as I was concerned.
This film has many good moments, the best one when the doctor exposes the wounds and the truth about the dwellers, but also shows lots of clichÃ©s.
I did not expect the novel verbatim but also did not expect an entire whitewash of the true drama in life.
I saw the best and also the worst of what man can do to mankind.
I also thought Lee Philips was weak in a key role.
She also has terrific chemistry with Diane Varsi, playing her daughter.
There is also Russ Tamblyn, "stuck" in a failure cycle emotionally, and socially; Barry Coy, the wild son of the town's richest businessman; Terry Moore, the high school flirt; David Nelson, the boyfriend of Selena Cross; and Doc Swain (Lloyd Nolan), the voice of logic...
Katie Blake does a superb appearance as Helen, a teenager about to finish school and go to college, when "Dear Nobody" shows up and turns her world up side down with a tough decision to make and some well hidden family secrets to discover  Sean Maguire as her boyfriend also delivers a solid performance, but not quite reaching up to Blake's standard.
The film also adds some characterization and entertaining action sequences, and attempts, though not very effectively, to employ comic relief (Phill Lewis' character).
Gossett also has a 'day job' at an air force base which is due to be closed.
It was probably also fun for former 007 director John Glen to work with people who can actually enjoy their work without trivializing it.
Not only did I like their performances but I also liked the discussion sessions in-between.
I also like the full-length performances by the featured actors, because although I like hearing excerpts of things, I do like to hear them in whole too.
I also thought the contrast between the inmates' readings and the actresses' readings of the same words was highly intriguing.
I know that there are women out there who are in prison and are considered "a danger to society" but I also think that there are women who deserve another chance.
This film is also chockablock with dream sequences, which were a forgivable indulgence in `An American Werewolf in London', but in this seemed like a copout filmic device for audience misdirection that mainly seemed included to pad out a very thin script to feature length.
It's also got plenty of gratuitous female nudity, which is pleasant to look at, but kind of made me feel bad for the actresses, especially Lara Flynn Boyle.
It also put into perspective the pain and persecution Jesus went through.
Disney is no-doubt attempting to flex its CGI muscle as it transitions away from hand-drawn animation (also, see the theme park commercials, Mickey's Philharmagic, etc.).
Probably not as heartwarming and memorable as the first film ("Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas"), this one is also fun, entertaining and amusing (perhaps even more amusing than the last one)!
This is computer animated and also unlike the first film, has more stories.
The background song is entertaining and well-sung and this story is also funny, which is "refreshing".
The obscurity of this movie is also part of it's charm.
It was also a challenge to watch in some places.
There is a wonderful list of supporting actors like Cameron Diaz and John C. Reilly that also make this film a Hollywood Gem.
I asked my father who is also a big Scorsese fan .  "
We also see one of the most cynical episodes in American history where immigrants getting off ships at New York are immediately conscripted into the Union army unless they pay 300 dollars which eventually leads to the draft riots .
The film commences with no opening credits, just the company credits roll as we see Liam Neeson play the character of Priest Vallon, a highly admirable Community leader also fighting for what he believes in, the safety and prosperity of the Irish people based in New York.
It also made me feel like I was there, witnessing the poverty and brutality.
It's also a film that's not afraid to show war in its total uglyness.
Leonardo DiCaprio really proved that he's not just a pretty face and that he does actually have a great deal of talent (which can also be seen in his other movie of the season, "Catch Me If You Can").
Cameron Diaz' performace also proves that she can do much more than the standard romantic comedy.
Actually it's a great movie, however it's very very underestimated also.
Second reason lead us not only everyday fascism but also (and because of first one) state fascism.
As a person seen almost each and every Turkish movie made for the last 5 years, this is possibly one of the best five and in my point of view it can also compete in the international area.
He maintained the look Branden Lee originated, and also made the martial arts natural and well-integrated into the action sequences.
It also has a funny soundtrack.
"Shadow Builder" doesn't only dispose of the ugliest VHS-cover in the history of cinema, it also is one of the most ineptly bizarre films I ever had the (mis)fortune of seeing.
This is not only one of the quirkiest, bravest, and flat out funniest comedies of it's decade...it is also among the handsomest and best cast "Period Pieces".
I could also go on for many paragraphs about the sensational supporting cast....every member of which was perfectly chosen....I have to at least mention Cameryn Manheim....who glows with such sexy charisma that she dominates every seen she appears in....So refreshing and erotic in the modern Hollywood universe of undernourished Barbie Clones.
Dana Carvey, John Cusack, and John Neville also have great roles.
Good acting, good story (the side story fits in perfectly also) and good jokes.
I was also disappointed that some of the facts were changed (Dr. Kellogg, for example, stayed fit and healthy well into his 90's) to please the anti-fitness people.
He also learns that Luke Darcy, played by Chandler, was the reason behind his wife's death and the ranch being lost.
I also knew that I was going to see the leads 'behinds', which I thought would at least give me something to be happy about in case I didn't like the movie.
Nene wants Angel, who also wants Nene but feel guilty (the "voices"), and El Cuervo makes fun/gets angry at them for being gay.
Unfortunately, the casino is also booby-trapped.
Genre fans will also note that, during the first big set piece, the crew are startled by an unexpected alarm and deviate from their mission to investigate a derelict spacecraft - events which end with a nuclear detonation in space.
Not to mention its own borrowings eg Ikarie's robot Patrick, inspired by Forbidden Planet (1956)  PolÃ¡k's was also responsible for an intriguing Nazi time travelling movie, with a small cult on its own account, Tomorrow I'll Wake Up And Scald Myself With Tea, made in the late 1970s.
That the only real threat the crew face is an external one is significant, and also primes the dramatic moment that begins the narrative.
Here, amidst the dark clutter of its interior, are found signs of gambling and money, coded elements of capitalist speculation, just as fatal as the death gas and nuclear warheads also there.
Through the hypnotic rhythms of Zdenek Liska's striking score, the astronauts take part in something akin to a weird 22nd century disco, their slow somnambulistic movements reassuring while also slightly disturbing.
But at that time (1962) and I think nowadays also it is a remarkable novel and movie also.
We also get the dangers and rewards of hurling ourselves into the vast darkness.
One would also assume that a movie made in a Soviet influenced country would contain a certain amount of Communist and Pro-Soviet propaganda (for example, Planeta Bura).
That, and also it felt like the concept may have been an idea for a short but was then stretched out into a "feature"...
Brandman also directs this stylish charmer and has at his disposal actors not usually associated with a more serious type of story.
the actors act like there acting in quicksand also it remind me of Home Alone 15 years later... All in all it o.k to watch if you have nothing to do and I do mean nothing.. One more thing if you're Brandon Lee fan, the main actor could pass for his long lost brother bad-actor-Lee... Bruce Lee be glad this guy isn't your son.....
This is a film full of beautiful color cinematography (it earned a deserved Oscar nom in this category) that is also extremely accomplished in the difficult tracking shots that put us right IN the races.
This sequel rightly makes the point that 'entertainment' is not exclusively words and music and backs up the point by including snippets of comedy and drama at which MGM also excelled.
Kelly also breaks up the film with a brief vignette on location in Paris, where MGM Oscar-winning blockbusters 'An American in Paris (1951)' and 'Gigi (1958)' were set.
series, I think, is that not only can we relive all those precious classic moments, but we can also learn of the more obscure musicals about which we would otherwise have known nothing.
I was also disappointed that when musical clips were shown, the movie they were from was not always identified.
They are great performers, but Kelly, who also directs, insights on these pseudo-clever song introductions to each sequence of clips, which is a waste of time.
Kelly himself is not only seen in the archive footage, but he also directed, and choreographed all the new scenes and dance routines that link the classic clips together as well as pulling presenting and narrating duties with another old friend and M-G-M stalwart Fred Astaire.
Nene is beside himself and goes into town and has sex with another guy in a tea room and also with a women he meets at the fair.
It's also a delight for fans of both Astaire and Kelly when these two dancing men, you know... dance together again.
About the only flaw with it is that it simply couldn't be better than its source material... but that's also what's so good about this film.
I also have a complete aversion to Parker Posey.
He also seems to have scripted a larger amount of the film, since the scenes are almost all structured for the delivery of a single joke (which is true of most comedic films).
The characterization is also dull and uninteresting, including none of the over-the-top stereotypes of his previous films (which I assume are meant to satirize said stereotypes and their use in film) and instead pushing the same characters (without the exaggeration needed for humor) we see in all self-referential films.
(This characterization is also the subject of the best line in the film, as Catherine O'Hara tells Shearer, "You play the actor very well.")
I had seen "Waiting for Guffman" which is also good.
We're also stuck with actors who are less-than-hilarious: Ed Begley Jr, Jim Piddock, Jane Lynch, Bob Balaban, and a woman who has gotten progressively worse in every Guest film to the point I now consider her completely talent-free: Parker Posey.
Christopher Guest has been making great comedies for years, his true to life warts and all mockumentaries have not only been the source of much amusement but have also paved the way for shows like 'The Office' so it no surprise that his latest offering has Ricky Grevais in it.
It's not as laugh-out-loud funny as "Best in Show" (few movies are) but I liked it better than "Mighty Wind," which I also liked.
I'm also surprised by some of the negative commentary around 'For your Consideration'.
The narrative structure also prevents Guest from relying too heavily on cuts to b-roll sight gags that, while funny, are never more than gags.
One also can speculate what his wife must have put up with back in the day.
Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, from the old Jack Benny television show, also is in here, and sometimes feels the sting of W.C.'s racist remarks, which he could never say today on film, and justifiably so.
I also think getting a DVD with English subtitles would make it even better, to catch all of W.C.'s lines, some of which are too mumbled to understand.
(The media also hardly covered the deaths of Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison.)
With all the shortcomings of the era being shown in full detail, we still have to also admit that the music then was great, and maybe even wish that music today could be so good.
The issues of the 1960s may have lost their gravitas today, but hopefully a film like Message to Love might reveal a failure of methodolgy, not of purpose, and perhaps even allow us to remember that Vietnam and the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK were among the most important events this country has ever faced--which might be why the music was also so timely and good.
"Message to Love" also opens a window onto the growing compartmentilization of rock, with three genres taking root at the start of the 70s.
It also leaves a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
I hope to rent this movie abroad and I also look forward to his next film about a lesbian love.
he also did an enormous amount of research on the subject but he also knew how to tell a good story.
Simply put, in Â»Agents secrets Â«, the device is also the goal, and this is why it stands out as a calm and articulated commercial film in the age of hysteria.
You're not in 'M.I.1' or in 'The Usual suspects' - even if I also appreciated these movies- , what matters is people, their relations, their perception of their job...
Agents Secrets is not only a spy / contra-spy thriller but also one of the best portfolio examples french cinema has nowadays.
There are also the ticker-tape messages scrolling across the bottom of the screen which you tend not to read the first time you watch an episode.
I found these particularly funny in the "hijack" episode (which is also my favourite episode).
Having real Americans playing the American newscasters was also a nice touch which could have easily been overlooked.
Anyone who enjoyed "Broken News" as much as I did should also check out the same team's BBC radio show, "The Sunday Format", which uses similar techniques to parody the content of British Sunday newspaper supplements.
There are also plenty of jokes and nonsense, but I suspect most of those are just there so you won't mistake the show for a real news network.
Besides showing an unusual homosexual relationship, the film also questions the relationship between sex, love and violence - even when the main characters turn "straight" violence and death hang in the air, with scenes sex often interspliced with those of death and agony.
It contains more laughs then "Terms of Endearment" and also less depth.
There's also the loyal housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross), who despite always being on her duties and quick to have a sarcastic comeback, is falling in love with the next door neighbor Arthur (Ben Johnson- in his last screen performance).
To wrap it up, it's a long movie with a lot of unnecessary subplots (the death toll was ridiculous), but keep in mind this is also based on the book, so do we blame the filmmakers or the author?
I also loved the story with Aurora and Rosie.
But the emotion of the film, like Aurora making the photo albums, her spreading Rosie's ashes on the beach (my favorite), Jack Nicholson also makes a nice appearance, and finally Aurora's death.
This is also why it went under a different name, because it was the same characters but a completely different plot and story.
However, the time that passed actually made this movie more believable as the characters had also aged.
This is also a film that treats a gay relationship with total honesty and truth.
It captures the self-worthlessness perfectly and also the stupidity of modern corporate America today.
The scenery was also nice, and the single real chimp they used in the film was a better actor than many of the humans were.
Casper Van Dien also had a nice body, which is always a bonus; it unfortunately does not make a movie good.
When Jane decides to follow her fiancÃ© Tarzan (Casper Van Dien) into dangerous territory, not only Tarzan must protect the city of Opar but must protect Jane also, while trying to stop Nigel Ravens and his men.
It's also politically sensitive, not portraying the natives as they were in those old Tarzan films from the studio days.
Working on this film with Marcelo Figueras, he also contributed to bring Ricardo Piglia's novel to the screen with unexpected results.
Eduardo Noriega, is also a Spanish actor that has done excellent work before and he shows his range in a magnificent performance as Angel.
The director pulls his punches and the the proceeding scenes afterward also lack any real bite.
Viewers like me wanting to see an early performance by Robert Englund will also be truly disappointed as he doesn't arrive into the film until it's almost over, as Michael, his role is of comforting friend, trying to snap Jenny from her emotional turmoil.
Leading lady Baumann (who has some brief nude scenes) was a former Miss Ohio and Miss America finalist who also appeared in THE THING WITH TWO HEADS (1972).
1975's "Slashed Dreams" should be on a double-bill with 1973's "Caged Terror", another film that strived for a (pretentious) "deep, man" message and also featured a young, white heterosexual couple out in the woods, skinny-dipping (no frontal this time) and being terrorized by two creepy men.
Both films also feature the man smearing something reddish onto the woman's face.
(The jerk boyfriend also made fun of Michael, natch.)
Not just a great gay film, BURNT MONEY is also a terrific love story, a heartstopping thriller, and an outstanding example of popular Spanish entertainment.
"Slashed Dreams" is probably also meant to suggest slasher films, but this is at most a proto-slasher; nobody gets killed, and the only slashing is of one bad guy by another.
There are also windows, and at least two large holes in the roof, so that when they say they wish they could lock the door, it sounds rather funny!
There's an odd sort of rape scene, in which one of the assailants seems to be at most dry humping a sleeping bag (and he couldn't get it up either, we learn), and the other also seems to be doing some dry humping, but also does some bruising face-slapping.
There is also a rather nice scene where the police officer patiently tries to take Cartman seriously, as Cartman reports the loss of the photograph of himself in a compromising situation and expects the police to help.
This is also the first episode to strongly suggest Cartman's sexual orientation.
I notice that Best Actress went to Helen Mirren - who's also deserved an Oscar for years - for playing a queen, and Best Actor went to Forest Whitaker for playing a king (the last one of Scotland, that is).
I also like the scene in which Ellen DeGenerous makes Steven Spielberg take a picture of her with Clint Eastwood.
There are also the usual Oscar surprises, such as Jack Black and Will Ferrell singing.
Like always, also, this goes far beyond of how long it is supposed to be.
I am also glad that Happy Feet won Best Animated Picture.
There also wasn't really one movie or person this year that I hoped would win.
The ceremony also wont be remembered as the most hilarious or legendary one.
But of course that all doesn't mean that DeGeneres also doesn't take time to make fun of some of the stars.
Same goes for Forest Whitaker who did the best speech of the evening, though he of course was also the one that could prepare himself the best, since it almost was a formality for him to pick up the award.
It was also weird to see Gore holding an Oscar, though the cause he fights for is of course a good one.
The setting also changed as the women moved from their homey/funky Village digs into some sterile skyscraper, and the show only lasted one season after Ari's departure.
It was also one of the few NYC based sitcoms filmed in New York City.
She is shown shooting someone in cold blood, but she also expresses deep human concern for the members of the orchestra and for children.
Joseph Mengaler is also portrayed in this movie.
Jane Alexander is also very worthy as the Director of the orchestra that Fania(Redgrave) is a part of.
Some video stores may also have a copy.
It is also much better than most of the trash that is being produced for TV and movie theaters today.
A surreal comedy that is also poignant and cruel.
Harmon Walsh is an absolute hottie, but he's also a terrific actor making his debut here as Johnny, the hero who finds himself with a big problem (aside from the Ice Queen) when he gets drunk and sleeps with another girl, Elaine, leaving his girlfriend, Tori, rather upset.
But Johnny is also very smart, and keeps his head under the pressure that he and his friends find themselves in.
With most horrors you can easily predict who is going to survive, unfortunately that is also the case here, for there is such a great group of people that one might find themselves hoping that they all survive.
I don't recall his name, but he commented that at first you may think the actor playing Dr. Goddard is a bit awkward, but when you realize the horrible lines and situations, and direction he had to deal with, you will also realize he must have the spirit of Brando in him to pull it off half as well as he did!
Besides having to survive the avalanche Johnny & his buddies also have to contend with the Ice Queen who kills on sight...  Co-edited, co-written & directed by Neil Kinsella this is yet another brainless straight-to-video/DVD low budget piece of crap horror film with lots of unintentional comedic moments.
Lo Lieh is also great as Wong's sidekick with the golden tonfa (one of the coolest weapons in any kungfu movie, it has a blade that shoots out of it so it can be used as a sword and it has a clamp that rips swords).
Not only it's very good but it's also very hard-to-find.
Not only it's very good but it's also very hard-to-find.
This film ranks in stupidity with "Funny Lady," which also starred Caan.
We are also quite a while from other Bette Midler films of the 80s and as a result FTB has a stronger solo spotlight.
James Cann is also very good and the production values are high well written and all in all much better than you might think.
George Segal who is Caan's gag writer also is Midler's uncle and he acts as cupid in this show business marriage.
He's the kind of man who will stop at nothing to climb the ladder of success, but he's also not a totally bad man.
And moreover, "For the Boys" also looks at the sorts of things going on during those wars, including Cold War-era red-baiting.
It also gives us glances at the high water mark of radio programing in the late 1940s (before television began to impact upon it).
She is perhaps also angry with herself for not being able to be enthused about performing for the fighting men of this war the way she was years ago.
Pirro used the footage he shot with Deezen and created a new character in flashbacks with him and also provides quite a few voices for some of the characters who were not available for adr recording.
Their destruction by Ladd is welcomed by the post-Pearl Harbor audience watching the film (although Ladd also takes a pot shot at Robert Preston, who is not a traitor but a detective, and does kill a cop).
I have 6 of the episodes on DVD, and all of them are really funny, and I also remember catching it everyday after school.
We average 10 movies a month on Netflix...we are also good people, and are spiritual sorts.
It also was released on a limited number of screens.
There's also a site www.onceuponafamily.com that has a great program to further reinforce The Ultimate Gift and really 'brings the movie to life' with a program of projects (activities) that help you and your family discover all of the gifts and live them on an ongoing basis... As a sidebar, they have a cool kit not associated with the movie called 'Dates with Dad' that looks like a great tool to assist in building a relationship with my girls.
I also learned that you can't always have what you want.
I also learned that you are rewarded for being charitable.
I also was very confused with the relationship between Jason and Alexia.
Corey Yuen is really a good director (I also enjoyed "the transporter" another Yuen's movie) and uses the camera with great creativity.
The beautiful Ali Hillis also delivered an excellent performance.
I also noted that my local AMC didn't have it on the big board of show times at the box office, which I found odd.
"The Ultimate Gift" stars James Garner, Brian Dennehy, Drew Fuller, Ali Hillis, and Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin, who recently starred as Olive in "Little Miss Sunshine," which also was nominated this year for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
In today's world, the pursuit of happiness for many is the chase for wealth, yet many rich people also find happiness alluding.
But it is also one that one must be ready to watch.
Flashbacks explain how father and son had a fragile relationship, also revealing that Jack went to Australia to patch things up, only to have to deal with Christian's death and getting the body back to the States.
We also have our first science/faith talk between Jack and Locke, although it's less of an argument, and more of Jack doubting Locke's explanation of what's happening to him.
There's also a chance to scope out Ebbetts Field and the Brooklyn Dodgers before both were torn down and shipped to LA.
It's also a pleasure to see the Brooklyn Dodgers participating in all the shenanigans at the ball park, with Leo Durocher in the limelight.
The baseball scene in here also was very good.
There's also a really pointed sense of humor throughout, as you get to see how some people are just destined to be exploited and can never quite escape the vicious circle.
Now I love Fassbinder, I also admire the work of Solondz, About Waters who's not one of my favourits I can say he's naughty, wickedly naughty(in a way I guess it's a compliment as well).
However, it will also make you laugh, smirk, and smile.
Each member of the Balatony family seemed to exhibit the physical and spiritual traits of an animal Â MorosgovÃ¡nyi as the lustful rabbit (compare his hare-lip), KÃ¡lmÃ¡n as the gluttonous pig (complete with truncated tail), and Lajos as the vainglorious bird (his gaunt face also brings to mind the skull traditionally seen in vanitas paintings).
Which is a shame because the film has the right settings to be politically meaningful and also the casting couldn't be more superb.
Our peasant is apparently also a pedophile, as we watch him lose himself in a fanciful fantasy world that involves a fairy-tale-like house and a girl barely 8 years old.
Cut to Hare-Lippy inside his shed: he masturbates to this imagined girl, and the director is even kind enough to show us not only his erect penis but also the semen that shoots out of it - all the way towards the night-sky, towards one of Earth's nearest stars.
Those familiar with European cinema will be able to reminisce with the many influences on show, with some scenes even harking back to Pasolini's epic, Salo - this is also combined with many other surreal influences.
Soon we are up to ears in car chases,gunfights and HK action fighting - all brilliantly done by Coery Yeun(who was involved with both Crouching Tiger and The Matrix) - there is a also a central bond between the two sisters that provides an emotional core that acts as a counter-balance to all the action.
The child grows up and ends up being a champion of speed-eating, he marries a woman (wich is also fat) and thus the next generation is born.
On the other hand, you might also keep on changing channels.
I don't think the film or the dance style are very special or well done, but they do show in one quick swoop the situation and subculture of these people and also their emotions, basically expressed in dancing.
It's also pretty depressing, since it shows how desperate people lift their spirits through something that doesn't really does anything else for them.
We also see that these are the kind of individuals who are naturally nurturing and mentor-seeking, as one explanation of how they sought out the arts and why dance speaks to them as a mechanism to work out their emotions.
LaChappelle takes the easy way out several times in this film, and ruins many moments that would be better left silent (also, there was no need for the overdub of "Amazing Grace," either.
Crip Walking is another popular dance out of the same communities that was also popular in the 1990's and 2000s.
Ultimately this movie has all three of these things, and profound emotion also.
And also don't miss the Ab soundtrack CD.
The film is also quite interesting from an anthropological angle in terms of how the documented phenomenon quickly takes root, consumes these good peoples' identities 24-7, organically grows, divides, mutates, rapidly spans generations and groups, sweeps up even infants who intuitively jack right in to the main line, and seems to strongly channel ancient ancestral rites straight into South Central, where it weaves a crazy web of hope and ecstatic optimism through the beleaguered community like beautiful wildflowers in a cracked asphalt lot.
The most recent game I got was Evil Dead Regeneration which was about a week ago.This is the newest game in the Evil Dead series of games which were based on the films.I have never seen the films.This game is not bad.Its pretty fun especially when you have the little midget sidekick named Ssam who you can kick around.He also makes funny comments.At first the game is pretty hard especially when you have hoards of zombies coming at you but after you get Sam it gets easier.This game is a horror/action game with comedy.Bruce Campbell who was ash in the movies is the voice of ash in the game and he has really funny one-liners.So does Sam Ash's half deadite sidekick.The game is about a man who must kill all the zombies.Evil Dead Regeneration is an alright game but I suggest buying it at a cheap price.
although it got really repetitive, also they could of gave Sam more weapons.
But I guess for those seeing "Evil Dead" on the cover and buying the game just because this fact is enough for them, if they are satisfied with playing their favorite movie character then I z'think I could also recommend this game to them.
(There is also a very ingeniously-worked little sequence in the park, in which a passing encounter with a complete stranger turns out to provide the subsequent denouement to the lovers' interview.)
The film displays dazzling invention throughout and is frequently hilarious, but also laces the proceedings with just the right dose of sentiment: the climactic exhilarating chase is spectacular and one of the very best of its kind, while the disruption of the marriage/abduction of the bride ending might well have inspired THE GRADUATE (1967)!
I enjoyed this film very much because of the many funny scenes that had me laughing all the way through; it also had me very nervous waiting for the ending.
Very funny gags, and also a sensitive way to illustrate love (such beautiful scenes are frequents in Harold's movie).
This is also a great opportunity to see the beauty and the talent of the wonderful Jobyna Ralston.
I think she also appears as the girl with the hole in her stocking.
I congratulate Luis Tossar for his acting and the rest of the cast are excellent also.
Anyway Billy meets a group of thugs and beats them up and so because of that the kill his mother so Billy decides to get his revenge, Billy also has other problem since his girlfriend's father doesn't like her being with him since "He's a Ninja and a very dangerous man."
Even as we move to the later films, there is also the Marx's brilliant sense of surrealism and absurdity, far beyond the capabilities of anyone else.
I also like Harpo's fantasy segment, one of the more imaginative musical numbers from the latter-day movies.
There's also a scene where four young kids play the piano like Chico, which is very charming.
We also are witness to a parade of on screen ethnicities; done up in the typical stereotypes of the day.
Despite a slight yawn during Tenement Symphony, the musical numbers were also entertaining - especially Harpo's duet with himself in the mirrors.
The Big Store is a Marx brothers movie from 1941.The plot is irrelevant as it is in any other Marx movie.All that makes any difference is how funny these movies are and I can tell you about this one; IT IS.This time the brothers go crazy in a department store.Groucho plays Wolf J. Flywheel, the private eye, Harpo is Wacky, his silent partner and Chico is Ravelli, the bodyguard of the singer Tommy Rogers (Tony Martin).The amazing Margaret Dumont makes her last appearance with the Marx brothers playing Martha Phelps.It was most hilarious in all those movies to watch Groucho court Margaret and at the same time humiliate her the worst way.She didn't seem to mind.The Big Store is an underrated gem that shouldn't be thrown away.There are lots of scenes that raise this movie higher than many modern movies would deserve to be raised.It's incredible to watch the brothers roller skating in the store.There are also some musical numbers in the movie.It's great to watch and listen to Groucho singing "Sing While You Sell".There's the lady (Virginia O'Brien) singing "Rock-A-Bye Baby with a frozen face.I just loved her!
The storyline is rather predictable, so also is the drama.
It's also not a great way to introduce anyone to their work (as they're likely to not be very interested in seeing more), and there are far better films for casual viewers who are not particularly interested in the Marx Brothers.
There's also a scene where four young kids play the piano like Chico, which is very charming.
When these two guys get together you know your in for a great laugh.The way they have to improvise when one of them makes a mistake is just poor class.As with there other video's which I also think are excellent if you in a badmood and need a little bit of cheering up look no further.I think that this video is ALMOST as good as some of the second season episodes and i hope they get around to doing at least one more bottom video
The supporting roles do not just reflect the incredible amount of talent for UK comedies, but also the reality of life: it goes on, outsiders will help you see the upside.
To make life more difficult for Maggie and Andrew the children come with their own different needs, not only is Georgia an environmentalist, she is also a vegetarian and comes with her own special dry sense of humour.
He also discovers girls, one in particular, Roxanne who owns a very large dog called Die Hard (you can sense the jokes that this brings).
He is also sick if he stands on his head for too long.
Their cleaner Liz is also on hand to help out but gets rather distracted by Tom, a builder, hired to add another bedroom to the house.
in another BBC1 sitcom 'After You've Gone' which coincidentally, also only lasted for 3 series despite getting decent viewing figures.
It was also surprising to see J. Carroll Naish,(Sun Yat Ming), "The Beast with Five Fingers"'46, who often played roles of Italian subjects in most of his films.
William Wellman, director of this film also created "Public Enemy" '31 with Jimmy Cagney.
Or did you also audition for this remarkable film and get shown the door?
It is also a delight to see carefully choreographed movements, instead of slide-shows with chaotic camera-work that makes the scenes completely impossible to follow (as in Ashes of Time).
But that's also a compliment for writer, director Larry Holden, and his remarkable directorial debut - because (I think, anyway) that's his goal: to try and speak the inarticulate speech of the heart.
B-movie but also a great piece of cinema: cinema as the product of the imaginary, creative and humorous human being!
I later discovered (from reading about it on the internet) that many hard-core porno movies would also shoot an alternate soft-core version for cable TV, and these movies would be released with different titles.
I saw the same impact of this film on my son (coincidentally also 7 years old).
They also have the characters spew out lines that sound philosophical, but are really just common sense.
Endless Waltz is, in my opinion, just as good as the Studio Ghibli films (to name a few, Princess Mononoke, Totoro, Laputa - also known as Castle in the Sky -, Spirited Away).
This new presence which threatens to shatter the peace treaty and destroy the sacrifice that was made by the brave men a year ago is also the same group of rebels that was lead by Zachs the previous year.
-Fans of the series will also be delighted to hear that we spend time with each of the five pilots and get to learn where they're from.
She is also so easy on the eyes that her anti-social job is acceptable.
and it not only answers them in full detail, but it also gave us a more clear view of our favorite Piolts past(s).
The movie follows the lives of normal people, with normal jobs, as common as they could be: a bar owner (there's at least one bar in every street here), as stall owner (there are lots of markets as well) and an old couple struggling to survive (as it happens, pensioners don't have a lot of money also) Their lives intertwine magnificently and you really feel sorrow and happiness for them.
The title not only refers to those small appetizers Spain is famous for, but also to the Spanish verb "tapar" which means to cover up, or to hide.
I also liked the play with the camera.
Kate Hudson (who also co-executive produced) seems to becoming a worse actress with every movie, as she plays almost every scene as Liv with the subtlety of a mime artist.
Hathaway infuses some of the needed poignancy here: As she really looks at her life when she talks with her dear friend, who also is Liv's solid brother Nate (charming Bryan Greenberg).
But it is also touching seeing Liv hug Emma's Dad.
One scene has Kate Hudson's character lying in bed with her fiancÃ©, expressing her sorrows at how alone she feels and completely ignoring his attempts at consoling and comforting her - while a particularly insulting moment in a film chock full of them, it also demonstrates how utterly unimportant the men in the film are whatsoever.
As such, Bride Wars is not only resoundingly poor on just about every possible front, but unenthusiastically so, making the film not only cringe-worthy to watch, but also rather boring.
She is a very talented actress but she can also let loose and just have fun and that's what her role in Bride Wars is all about.
"and you're starting a bit to think that it's a bit over exaggerated about all the pranks.But it also showed, above all these cruel and stupid pranks, what even best friend can do to the other one.
The pacing of the show is also superb as it kept me glued to the seat throughout the whole show.
I also thought the use of the old Carpenters hit "Close to You" in the early fighting sequence was a very special touch.
However my enthusiasm was quickly suppressed, and I realised early on that the movie might actually turn out to be like so many other, forgettable, overly sentimental and almost pointless comedies that Hollywood are also famous for producing.
The "War",or more like the "playground type spats" are also extremely disappointing.
I also couldn't quite get it round my head that two life-long friends that plainly love each other could actually be so cruel to each other.
"Bride Wars" appears also not that funny as it probably should be.
Summing up I think that "Bride Wars" is a motion picture made more for girls who also have bright thoughts about their wedding.
You see, aside from the fact that Bride Wars wants nothing more than to cater to cheap gags and sappy melodrama fit to please the Legally Blonde crowd, there also remains blatant problems in just about everything else that fills the movie's first two acts.
There's also too little moments that could have worked out - there's far too many soft spots where the film just rolls on without anything happening.
Donald Pleasance, who regularly appeared in Spaghetti horror productions (see also the much better films "Phantom of Death" and Dario Argento's "Phenomena") is clearly aware of the film's inferior quality and thus doesn't even bother to give away a half-decent performance.
It also in a way is more or less a sequel to "Columbo: Ãtude in Black", of one year earlier.
The movie also doesn't feature a lot of interaction between Lt. Columbo and his suspect, a formula normally used in a Columbo movie.
The Columbo character himself also looks 'cleaner' than normal and is it me or is his trademark raincoat in a different color, or at least in some sequences it looks like it.
Of course different doesn't also mean better but in this particular case I didn't mind some of these changes, since the movie obviously still worked out and can be regarded as one that is on par with most of the other Columbo movies and even slightly better than just the average ones.
It's also thanks to the settings and acting that this movie worked out.
It also helps the movie that it features Laurence Harvey as the movie it's prime suspect.
The directing is mostly formulaic and by the book but also features some good dream like sequences and other more different elements that are consistent with the '70's and less standard way of making movies.
Lau's script espouses a feminist message, not only with the sisters' high-kicking independence, but also with Hong's struggle in a male-dominated police force.
There's also a rousing fight between two handcuffed women within the claustrophobic confines of a parking garage.
He's also brilliant, but he doesn't recognize brilliance in someone posing a greater threat to him than the deceased chess champion - Columbo.
He also won't stand for Columbo's usual forgetful routine.
Clayton is also nearly deaf, a handicap that has both unusual advantages and unexpected perils.
There's a general feeling of 'life happens" pervading the film - as was also the case for the noir films toward the end of that genre as it faded after WWII.
Boone's job is to find the missing man, but also to find out why the courier was hit.
He hooks up with Maggie (Diangelo) who is a waitress who also plays the french horn saving for a trip to Paris.
I also think that it shows very well how it is extremely hard to maintain oneself on top once one gets there.
And while neither have been signed up for their acting skills, the same could also be said of Rutger 'The Hitcher' Hauer, who plays Real Madrid manager Rudi Van Der Merwe with all the conviction and passion of a man who's long abandoned hope of a career in Hollywood.
series, the sequel is also very good but not as good as the first.....
and then the whole mother thing was also very predictable.
Away from the plot, we also have to face up to the awful truth that the whole cinematography has been ruined too.
The ending was also as predictable as it gets, with the main character's new club, Real Madrid, winning the Champions League in a similar fashion as his previous club, Newcastle United, qualified for the Champions League in the first movie, coming back from 2-0 down to win the game 3-2 in the final few minutes.
The premise with two girls being an action team, one a computer whiz and the other a field agent, is extremely similar to the comic book "Birds of Prey", which was also a short-lived (but abominably bad) TV series recently.
Being martial arts assassins, the characters can also be compared with other comic book action chicks like Elektra or Lady Shiva, or, for that matter, Danger Girl.
Unfortunately, there is also some bad news: the story is pretty awful.
One of the girls has a crush on the female police officer, and while that's sure-fire fodder for male fantasies, it's also gratuitously voyeuristic.
In hindsight I think it has enough intriguing elements, also story-wise, to warrant an 8 rating, and that is what I have now revised my rating to.)
The transfer negotiations and trainings were also a nice addition to help understand how it works.
Stephen Dillane also delivers a fine performance as Santiago's former assistant.
Rutger Hauer also delivers a good performance; he's always the man.
J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven also stand out as they hunt down Dracula.This was the first vampire film to use Alucard as an anagram of Dracula.
There are some good scenes where Dracula and his bride turn into mist and the bat transformations were also well done.
(ohhh god , the monster)  No good story and the acting is also very crappy.
It also definitely beats any other movie with such a ridiculous idea like floating brains and creeping hands, with some of the freakiest scenes I've ever sat through and one of the best scenes of girl-on-psychic worm action ever plausible, with a great ending.
That is completely understandable but it is also a shame because with the exception of that shot, the film is wonderful for all ages.
Fox plays Dr. Benjamin Stone, who is on his way to Beverly Hills, where he has a well-paid job waiting.He takes a short cut to avoid the traffic jam but hits into a fence in a small town called Grady.He has to do 32 hrs of community service at the hospital.In Grady he meets all these people, like Dr. Aurelius Hogue (Barnard Hughes), Hank Gordon (Woody Harrelson), Mayor Nick Nicholson (David Ogden Stiers), Nancy Lee Nicholson (Bridget Fonda), Judge Evans (Roberts Blossom) and the most interesting of them all, ambulance driver Lou (Julie Warner).George Hamilton plays Doctor Halberstrom.Ben has all the reasons to leave the town as soon as he can, which is harder than he thought, but he also has one good reason to stay.He has strong feelings for the beautiful Lou.So will he leave or will he stay?
Beyond these three, the film also features solid supporting performances from Evelyn Ankers, J. Edward Bromberg, and Frank Craven.
In a rush I'd also grab the Back to the Future trilogy and half a dozen of Arnold's classics.
I also feel I should mention the music in the film.
Fox plays a hard charging Dr. Ben Stone, with David Ogden Stiers giving a world class performance as the small town mayor that needs a new doctor, and also knows a thing or two about happiness.
This is also a business.
As you can see in my profile i'm from Belgium so i saw the original version of this movie ( and it rules by the way :-) ) but when i heard that there was going to be remake done of this movie i thought "well maybe it wont be as bad as every other remake" ( cause American remakes of movies are always less then the original ( no offense ) examples: The Grudge, The Ring ) but again i was wrong, choosing girls in bikini's as the bad guys(girls) was a bad mistake same as choosing Queen Latifah as the cab driver and the way that the story is brought on to screen is also really bad, i also thought that a good point would be the car itself cause in the third original TAXI ( TAXI 3 ) the story wasn't that good but the car was one of the plus points, but that doesn't apply to this movie, so i'll give you one last advice : don't go and see this movie but try to get a hand on the original TAXI by Luc Besson and i'll assure you you'll have a great time  greetings from A.V.
It's also a classic example of what happens when you let lawyers and politically correct groups scare you out of doing things right.
Not only is the plot interesting, the film is also extremely well-executed.
By contrast, Quincy is very engaging but also optimistic.
Quincy is always professional but also personally engaged in the victim's plight.
I also think it's quite cool that Mark was actually a technician not an actor who is now a leading DNA expert!
On the other side he also liked to shoot the breeze, drink, chase woman and have fun.
This is a nazisploitation flick - there's a concentration camp for Jewish women (for coincidence, most of them young and pretty), there is a scene in which a woman is thrown to the dogs for feeding them; in another one young girls are standing side by side waiting to be raped by German soldiers; and there's also a sadomasochistic relationship between Commandant Starker and a woman officer and so on.....
But the commandant's obsession also offers her hope of salvation.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Getting the introductions out of the way, it is 2054 in Washington D.C. and Tom Cruise plays, John Anderton, a Precrime enforcement detective who heads up a crack team specializing in preventing murders before they occur, also arresting criminals before they kill.
You'd tend to think people get soft as they grow older but with regard to Spielberg's last two films, the director continues to, not only, challenge himself with complex subject matter but also reinvent himself as a director at the same time.
in both structure and spacecraft, but the limitations of the film's 21st Century setting only helps to demystify the unknown, making society much more familiar while also giving the audience an identifiable future to look into.
Although Cruise maximizes the role's potential, unfortunately, he's also bound by the film's pacing.
In addition to momentum, the story also suffers from certain logical loopholes with regard to the entire concept of "Precrime," leaving many unanswered questions when reflecting back on the plot, which could be interpreted as justification for such a fast paced adrenaline ride.
Assuming that Anderton didn't see his crime, and also assuming that Anderton was thrust into a position where he was face to face with Crowe, there would have been no premeditation.
As much as I enjoyed Minority Report, the film left me bruised with a few bumps on the head after my theater chair also served as an ejection seat which, at times, launched me out of the movie to the roof, then back again.
At times, Minority Report also upholds a level of class and orchestral dignity as Anderton also serves as a visual conductor to John Williams' haunting, mysterious and heart pounding score via visual precognition.
Spielberg has the infallible ability to combine mainstream with art when it comes to the medium of film, and this is the one quality which distinguishes him from other directors; and as mentioned above, it's also the reason why his movies are so popular and why he is so highly regarded as a director.
There's the artistic and technical side of the movie Â the brilliant screenplay, the outstanding visuals, the powerful themes Â and the entertainment factor Â dozens of chase sequences, futuristic weapons and the like Â and as a result we get a highly original movie, and one that also boasts the high IQ of the Pre-Cogs.
As far as plain entertainment value goes, it delivers here also.
But then he also had to trick his own associate, the main detective of this precrime police.
Max Von Sydow was also excellent, and the special effects are simply stunning, plus the chase sequences are awesome as well!.
I saw this a couple years ago and was unimpressed, however after upon 2nd viewing, I must say It deserves it's praise, so if you didn't care for it the 1st time, give it a second viewing, you may change your opinion.This should honestly be in the top 250 in my opinion, and there are some fantastic creepy moment as well, plus I loved the depressing atmosphere it had at times, and This is almost like The Fugitive except it's set in the future, plus It also has some very funny scenes in it as well.
The picture also is visually the best of the 40's Universal Monster offerings.
In a way it reflects America in the present also.
Minority Report is a shining example of that, which also has the grace of having an intelligent concept to start with, which so many sci-fi films lack much less summer sci-fi films (look at MIB2 to see what I mean), and also better than average acting.
Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that this film was a PG-13 or a "12" in England is shocking.
Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).
The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell.
The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story.
It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes.
This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders.
The cops are also really lame...you got the overly headstrong male cop who realizes only too late that he can't take on the werewolf with his gun, and the female cop who's supposedly smarter than anybody else but isn't always listened to until towards the end.
I would also like to point out that horror clichÃ©'s are like gold for a low budget movie.
It also contains a very clichÃ© moment in which two characters want to discuss a personal matter while trying to survive.
A bunch of idiotic 20-something campers are also on the mountain providing easy prey for the lycanthrope.
That she would, in the police station, with her sanity questioned, begin to ACT as though she were not quite right in the head was also predictable, with predictable results.
besides the obvious Rear Window storyline, all of the following in this movie are also signature Hitchcockian themes or devices .
I just saw this today, also thanks to TCM.
She could also, like Loretta Young, get stuck in B movies like this one and "Jeopardy."
The Muslims had been attacking Constantinople for centuries and were also attacking Christian Pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land.
Terry Jones is not only a talented comedian, he is also an accomplished historian.
If you enjoyed this work, I also recommend Terry Jones' Medieval Lives.
A worthy effort as a stand alone documentary this series also offers a historical foundation for a better understanding of present day tribulations in the middle East.
Forget if necessary that it's a Dracula movie and I promise it's worthwhile, and one of the best Universal monster movies (way better than the dreadful Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, from the same year and also penned by Curt Siodmak and starring Chaney Jr.).
But it is also a heartbreakingly kind and gentle film.
It's also quite easy to find several gaping logic and plot holes in here that differ from the norm of vampires, yet these spoil the plot and can't be revealed.
Louise has also just been dumped by her lover David (Van Heflin) whom she was very much in love with.
Apparently this plum role was first offered to Bette Davis (who also apparently foolishly turned down the lead in MILDRED PIERCE) but Ms. Davis was about to go on maternity leave.
Cultured (plays Schumann on the piano), suave but also a rugged individual in the best sense of the word (an engineer who invents a new girder and is sent to remote Canada to get things going).
(It's also somewhat surprising how tall that actor is, he really towers over Crawford) Detached and calm Â but underneath insecure and aimless -, he tries to reason with the woman he'd rather not like to meet again and who is becoming a living nightmare for him.
The term schizophrenia also plays a big role in Possessed.
The movie also ends with Crafword prostrate and desperate in an aseptic cell of an institution.
It also marks Lon Chaney, Jr.'s sole appearance as the Count; Chaney was the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major horror figures- Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, Dracula, and of course the Wolfman, for which he was most famous.
It has all the elements that are associated with postwar film noir, but it also has the gloss one expects from the "women's pictures".
It's also told by Carol's father that Pauline was very sick and what she thought or said, about him and Louise having an affair, was just wild and unfounded thoughts that she conjured up in her both sick and confused mind.
This movie has nothing to do with the 1931 version that also Joan Crawford.
From a cracking screenplay by Silvia Richards and Ranald McDougall (who also wrote "Mildred Pierce") the picture turned out to be a splendidly absorbing drama thanks to the smooth and solid direction by Curtiz Bernhardt, the stylish and sharp monochrome cinematography of Joseph Valentine, an effective score by the great Franz Waxman (featuring Schumann's rhapsodic "Carnaval - Opus 9" "played" by Van Heflin) and most of all to the outstanding performance of Miss Joan Crawford.
In spite of the title, Chaney is not the focal point here, it's Allbritton, who's also engaged to mortal Robert Paige.
The chic blonde beauty, here in a dark wig to contrast her sister, played by lovely Evelyn Ankers, is superb, especially after being transformed into the undead, and disclosing her true plans to Paige, also fine in his tormented portrayal.
This of course leads to some very funny situations- The supporting cast is also great with Vincent Dinofrio (Law & Order-Criminal Intent)in one of his early roles.
Mary Louise Parker is also delicious, the acting is great, the storyline very likable, timeless, then and now.
It is very touching during the ending of the movie, when we learn that her favorite food and color is ***SPOILER*** Clams and also purple ***END SPOILER***.
I expected some decent martial arts action since Bas Rutten is an all-time great fighter (Pancrase, the Ultimate Fighting Championship) and Insonato is also a martial artist herself but this movie can't even deliver that.
It also offers us the opportunity to see three of Europe's super stars being and looking 10 years younger.
And so much consolation in beauty is also something I'll never forget from seeing the film.
Beauty in the form of art, but also in the form of mementos left for the beloved death ones.
The stories are supported by footage of the private life of the visitors, and also by beautiful views of the cemetery and the graves.
These is also an almost incestuous feeling towards France as the foundation of francophone culture, and an obsessive determination to maintain the virtually exclusive use of the french language in Quebec.
Recently there have also been strong concerns expressed about the very relaxed social attitude which, what used to be a conservative Catholic society, now takes towards such social issues as nudity on TV, sex shops and striptease parlours in all major centres.
It can perhaps be loosely compared with the U.K. film Scandal (1989), and the recent U.S. film Farenheit 9/11, where the theme is also scandal in government.
The late Sony Forbes (from SCANNERS) also adds a performance
At about the same time, she also meets a rugged ship's captain (Bruce Cabot).
She also has a particular habit of fainting, which she uses to her advantage, whenever it serves her purpose or whenever she doesn't know else to get out of a particular situation.
He was a prolific supporting actor in movies in bit parts like this one and also made memorable appearances in 50s and 60s TV shows, like "The Addams Family."
Directed by Rene Clair who also made "Le Million", which I reviewed, and "A Nous La Liberte," (some say that is his masterpiece, but I have yet to see, but will) this is yet another example of Dietrich at her sexiest, and all Dietrich fans and film lovers should buy the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection with this on it and sit back and see one of the greatest screen icons ever!
While Young woos her she also attracts the attention of ship captain Bruce Cabot, who is more to her taste in form, but not in terms of money.
maybe the producers also think of the audience as shallow and there was no need to go deeper.
while it is true that movie making is also dictated by economic tides, it is also important not to leave out the essential and artistic aspects of making it.
Anak just goes to show that a movie dosn't need to have sex, drugs & violence, and also not be a Children's movie to be excellent and a must-see for the entire family  10/10
The supporting cast ( especially Rita Wilson and director Rob Reiner) also do a great job.
Her performance is also superb!
He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.
With clever plot twists and a good dose of suspense, Siodmak's plot also feels like horror themed hard-boiled fiction.
It also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid.
He even manages to engage a little audience sympathy when constantly rejected by the virtuous heroine, a fact that also provides a little character motivation, unusual in a picture of this type.
There's also a nice "Bad Day At Black Rock" kind of feel to the small town in which O'Brien arrives, asking questions.
George O'Brien, best known today for the silent classic SUNRISE and for his work in John Ford films, can play an upper-class polo-playing young man, but he is also genuinely tough (not a surprise, considering he was a boxing champ earlier in his life), has a keen sense of humor, and has a warm screen presence.
He's also a fine horseman.
He is also a great actor, but I don't think his all of his talent was showcased in this movie.
When I rented this film, I did so on a whim, also because I knew a lot about the production from talking to many of the people who worked both on and off camera.
We also would concentrate on Luciano's years in America, which could be a familiar plot of the rise and fall of a gang boss.
The film was also translated and dubbed into Spanish (Pedro sin cola).
He is a kind cat, he find some friends in the city and also an enemy and his followers.
I also enjoyed the brief history of circuit parties.
I saw the movie with two straight friends and they also enjoyed it leaving the screening saying, "I didn't know there was so much to gay community".
Jack Sparrow, Ledger Joker, Guru Pitka  They were serious enough in their goals, but also they never took a path with the same seriousness.
Guru also meets the owner of the team, Jane, who he just falls for, so in order for him to get famous, he has to get Darran back with his girl and the team will start winning.
Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny.
It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him.
There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me.
All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts!
How I remember my earliest memory of this from Christmastime of 1972. also how hysterically I was Laughing @ hearing Curly say "Gimme the Ax, the ax,the ax,right in the neck,the neck,the neck.
"Then seeing it again for the first time in years some time in 1986.This time that I'd first seen it it was also after school & when it was too snowy out to go to my C.C.D.Class.Curly's Skunkskin cap is another interesting & hysterical aspect to give good color to this picture.
"You've just got to see the rest of it to understand & enjoy it for yourself also including when they're told by the Indians that they had until sundown to leave.They used the cabin for their scenery for "Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Steinbeck deliberately leaves her nameless,partly for symbolic value,but also to deliberately and permanently link her with her brutal,stupid,bullying husband.
B-Western star Bob Steele plays Curley with a hilarious, permanent sneer and a skulking walk; he also delivers his lines like a typical villain in a melodrama.
The most stupid scene is the romantic one, the girl go for some insulin and brings also the cello, the score for piano and cello and also the music stand!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The supporting cast did well, also.
You know she's bad but she's also irresistible.
This is a beautifully crafted version of the play adapted from John Steinbeck's novel, and while there are fine things in it, I also find glaring faults worth pointing out as well.
Not by a million miles, but there are problems with it, especially where the Steinbeck-as-biologist philosophy of life comes into play, and we realize that the author, for all his compassion and love for living things, also views all animals as the same.
It's also bad psychology.
As a kept girl with ten percent rebate on pedicure expense, though she is cunning in some scenes , but she is also deadly frightened.
There is also a vintage movie version which I can recommend.
On one level it's a superb comedy, but it also works as a drama.
GamerZ is also technically interesting - rotoscoping (or 'shadowplay') techniques are used to evoke the fantasy game world the characters enter.
The usual twists are also thrown in for good measure.
I am also a big fan of Lou and Andy.
I also fancy Ann (played by David), but that is manly because she's so funny.
Little Britain Series 1 was great, Series 2 was also great, but the usual comedy formula that third series screw the whole thing up (as it did to "The Fast Show") works on Little Britain, and we were let down by a rather disappointing Series 3 last year.
And, on that score, I did not read a single acknowledgment of the fact that the obvious homoerotic themes, not just that between George and Lenny, but also the "closet-queen" implications of Curly's overmacho stances, were not overtly noted.
Im also sure these two can write much better comedy and when they do I will happily write a glowing review.
Lou and Andy are also funny at first, but after a while I get tired of the 3 minute set-up for him to predictably change his mind about what he wants.
This movie is also called "Electric Shadows," not to be confused with the "Electric Shadows" listed in IMDb, which is a documentary about Hong Kong cinema.
When he finds her, she doesn't tell him why she did this(she also can't hear, it appears) but asks him to take care of and feed her fish Â knowing she's going away.
The daughter is told early in life that her real father is a movie star(which is not true) but this also keeps her fascinated to the screen.
It is a heart warming story but not mushy since the story is fictional, sort of like Mulan which is based on fiction but has its twists and turns and poignant moments also.
It's strength also came from the wonderful cast who brought their likable characters to life, and you cannot find better chemistry between the cast members even when some of them take up the same characters albeit for different age groups.
Lennie is big and strong, but he is also mentally handicapped, and George has to look after him.
Most of the other cast members' performances also stand out, and it helps that they were clearly given a good script.
This adaptation of Steinbeck's novella was also very nicely filmed.
The film sequences from old movies are also great!
We also see that some terrible things must have happened to Ling Ling.
before this film i usually used to say 'no' to his films, i saw solely this one because of Nicholson, i was not too sure this film amusing me as im a guy whom films normally dont impress but also i do not have a critic's eye, i'm like a normal film viewer.
but here i would also like to add, if you are a normal film viewer with no intense standard towards films then you probably should see this one but if you reckon yourself a critic who watches a film from inside out or every thin line comes on the screen then may be you must wait till you hear about it from a mate like yourself, all in all i generously hereby allow 8 marks out of 10.
John Turturro is also funny in this movie.
It also seemed to be indecisive about what type of film it was trying to be and this weakened its calibur as well.
Sandler is also good, and though he's most known only for Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Sandler was also hilarious in this movie.
We forget Of Mice and Men because we were also introduced to the Land of Oz or the plantations of Gone with the Wind or the Congress in Mr.Smith Goes to Washington, but unlike those pictures the movie relies more so on it's outstanding cast which give this picture more emotional weight.
I also like the music played in this film.
The casting of John C. Reilly was also right because he looks menacing enough and is still kind of soft spoken.
Of course the movie just heightens the emotions here, as Candy realizes he is also getting old and is not as useful and vibrant as he used to be.
It would also not be for anyone who would easily get offended by off-color jokes.
I think he owes that to Jack Nicholson's performance, since Jack can carry a film so well he also makes the jokes into perfect cues and great laughs.
It was also nice to see that this wasn't a typical Sandler film filled with predictable cameo's of his friends, so it showed that he could carry the film without doing the common predictability.
Al Lettieri plays Gutierrez, who is also after Taylor.
He is also on his last nerve, as  he finally gives in to his gun's quick justice.
Kilpatrick relentlessly tracks them down, even as they cross the border into Mexico, where Kilpatrick's progress is both helped and hindered by Mexican policeman Gutierrez (Al Lettieri), who is also after Brand but wants to do things the legal way.
While this Western (from a story by Samuel Fuller, also the original director but fired after disputes with star Harris) won't be for everybody because of its grim and sometimes ugly nature, there's no doubt that it hits a real nerve.
It also serves as a good contrast between conflicting ideas as Kilpatrick and Gutierrez strike up their rather volatile relationship.
He was funny mostly, but also very dumb.
It also helped Courtney Cox's career a lot, you must see this if you don't have a stick stuck somewhere hehe and if you like to laugh 8 out of 10!
It also bothered me that although Slim was complicit in George's act (by not trying to stop him), he stopped the sheriff to point out George.
One of the films on the card was "Zenobia", released the same year as this picture, and like this one, was also produced by Hal Roach.
Now finally Ventura learns the horrible truth that Einhorn is really Finkle and is also guilty of the kidnapping of both Marino and the dolphin.
I also think the plot is good, at least I didn't figure it out when I saw the movie for the first time!
The football players also do well.
Courtney Cox is also in the movie, playing an executive of the Dolphins named Melissa Robinson, Ace's love interest in the movie.
It's also funny because nobody takes Ace Ventura seriously because he is a pet detective.
However they are also met by Curley (Bob Steele) and his flirtatious wife Mae (Betty Field).
Life on the ranch is peppered with both opportunities of future dreams, but also with hazardous personal situations which seem innocuous enough, but are fraught with misunderstanding.
Nevertheless, the movie itself is filled with both compassion for life, but also in heartrending acceptations of natural tragedy.
There is also an appearance by legendary Miami Dolphin player Dan Marino (as himself).
this is another of John Steinbeck's novels brought to the screen.i thought it was well done.Burgess Meredith plays George,and Lon Chaney Jr.plays his travelling companion Lenny.Lenny is what you would call very slow and George has too look out for him and keep him out of trouble.he is a giant of man with the intellect of a child.the two men are forced to keep moving when George does get into trouble.they arrive at a ranch,and end up working.George has big dreams for the two of them.this movie is whimsical in tone at times,but also dark and tragic.Chaney is brilliant as Lenny.the dialogue is very good as is the direction.for me,Of Mice and Men is a 10/10
The funny parts are Alec guinness's eccentricities, Especially the dancing when he is arrested by the police and also his house on the pier itself, So funny to see him pacing up and down in his LITTLE house quite literally up and down.
You may also enjoy Hobson's Choice.
It also has waited that long to become part of our movie collection.
It is a bit dated and 'stagey' in its opening minutes, partly because it is taken from the play, not the novel, by John Steinbeck, and also because so many of the outstanding cast were only making their second or third film, and needed warming up and getting used to the camera.
Betty Field, also starting out on the screen, is superb as the young wife on the ranch tormented by boredom almost to the point of insanity.
There was also the things that I would hope to be -- gracious, exceedingly forgiving, and always hopeful.
I also liked how they chose to portray violence; they weren't graphic about it, but it wasn't whitewashed.
There were also some new styles of filming which I found to be quite interesting.
Such dedication to detail may add to the realism, yet it can also depress an audience looking for what movies do bestÂprovide escape.
Field looks the part of Mae, the cheap dame with dreams of Hollywood, but she's also stagey as heck, with one of the shrillest voices on record, such that It's almost a perverse relief when she gets throttled.
And also because it shows a lot of friendship and brotherhood amongst the POW's.
But it is also a transforming film, one that pushes the limits and boundaries of what it means to live out one's faith.
It also shows that when human beings act selfishly, they lose hope and end up destroying one another.
But when we act with sacrificial love toward each other, not only do we stand a better chance of living, we also keep from becoming savages.
Kiefer also had that same quality after he came to his senses.
They also learn from the more refined and educated among them the meaning of serving each other and their enemies, to the point of self-sacrifice.
I also recommend to watch it more than once because it has nothing to do with American fastfood film-making, so there might be things that are misunderstood during the first viewing.
We also started watching the older version of "Of Mice and Men".
(I also like the way that Al can swim underwater and resurface; at least it's better than drowning in chains in the first "Aladdin" movie.
It also becomes tiring to see Jafar so many times as a Red Genie.
Although based on Steinbeck's novel, the film owes much to the play Steinbeck also wrote.
A person may try to argue that any superhero acts in this way but a spiderman, batman, or superman all help people that need it at that time; they also never execute people.
This movie also happens to be completely unoriginal.
The director Lewis Milestone is superb in his making of this movie and also produced it.
all it was was a bunch of guns blasting all over the place, and ppl yelling out the f-word and ranting and raving about who to go kill next... and a gay transvestite cop, who was also an idiot (dafoe).
I would also like to get my hands on an uncut version.
Charles Bickford is also excellent as a rough and world-weary worker.
But much of what is great about Ford's film is also great about Lewis Milestone's, and he deserves credit for laying a fine blueprint for brining Steinbeck's beautiful and heartbreaking stories to the screen.
The whole "we're catholic, but we execute Mobsters" thing was also swill.
It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc.
It is mostly conventional, in fact, tailored for Christopher Reeve's pet project (apparently he got to star in this thanks, and/or no thanks, to Superman 4), and it is also tailored for what Reeve can do as a somewhat limited actor.
He also neglects certain things in the story, like the importance of Jonathan's own flaws and fooling around with a prostitute, and some details about him as a TV news reporter.
Since we never see him in the inner city until after he submitted the story proposal, that occurrence remains unexplained also.
In a role far removed from the calm, authoritative, and wise persona that has been his stock in trade in the years since, he shows his true range, portraying a cunning, ruthless and also intelligent criminal who can come off as genial and welcoming and then turn on a dime and reveal the ugly side lying underneath the smooth exterior.
There is also the parallel between journalism and prostitution.
It is true that Christ was fully human, but he was also fully divine.
I was also not used to seeing Jesus portrayed as...well...human!
It also shows Him to have emotion.
Ringo Lam"s first Hong Kong film after his try in Hollywood is an impressive one.The plot itself has so many unexpected twists that you can watch it easily twice and still discover things you didn't see the first time.The good camerawork gives the movies atmosphere of tension,fear and the supernatural an extra boost.The cast has proven itself already in several other Hong Kong films and also here they deliver an excellent performance.This movie is a good start if you're not into Hong Kong films but want to give it a try,for the real fans it's a must see!
The movie also featured some good performances.
Reg Gardiner and Martha Stewart are also great in their supporting roles.
The acting was more than acceptable and, although the genius of the child was, perhaps, not completely credulous, it also wasn't totally unbelievable.
James Glickenhaus, who also helmed the awesome Peter Weller/Sam Elliott movie Shakedown, did a good job with the direction and I also liked the score by Joe Renzetti (Child's Play, Frankenhooker.)
The prequel enriches Sadako's character with a somewhat moving back-story, showing her coming of age, discovering acting, which she also finds therapeutic and finding true love in the arms of Hiroshi TÃ´yama, (Seiichi Tanabe).
The film also features Malisa Longo, who adds to the eye candy.
Vito has also murdered Riccos' father, taken over his empire, and even taken Riccos' girl Rosa (Malisa Longo).
And now that he's been released, Ricco discovers that Don Vito (Arthur Kennedy) has also taken his girl.
Other than the convoluted structure and the highly effective plot twists, this undiscovered gem of Italian smut-cinema also features some of the most outrageous gore you've ever seen.
There's also a lot of graphic nudity and sleaze (or what else did you expected), provided by two of Italy's most contemporary popular muses, Barbara Bouchet and Malisa Longo.
He also kisses like a fish, rolls on the ground with his sister and her boyfriend because they're too happy to see him out of prison, feigns laughter when he nearly evades car accidents, blinks in close-up when he recognizes his mother and sister's dead bodies (that's emotion for you), heck he even karate chops people in a flashback to impress his father.
Are some viewers also sexually excited by this?
The production value is very good, might I add, and well shot and the acting is also believable.
Director Hasebe also directed the excellent RAPE, the satire RAPING!, the solid RAPE 13TH HOUR and the more well known BLACK TIGHT KILLERS.
Meanwhile, Ms. Vitti also has experiences that are quite fun, such as pretending to be a reporter and becoming a groupie of a famous rock band, and she has some terribly sobering experiences, such as saving the life of an elderly man who is attempting suicide, only to have him curse her for being a rich lady who has everything while he has nothing.
As soon as he speaks, we're sucked in, perhaps horrified but also morbidly curious... murder for profit... on film?
There's also a hint of lesbianism (very daring for 1958) and a constantly barking dog named Devil!
The Hitchcock also has a surprise ending concerning the star and his shower stabbing isn't so new, after all.
Here's how Brown's novel opens:   "The protagonist of Brown's novel, William Sweeney, is also a writer, a newspaperman.
Major Drango is appointed US military governor to a small Georgia community where tensions are running high after the defeat of the Confederacy .Drango himself participated in Sherman's march through the state and saw the devastation at first hand .Neither Drango or his men are welcomed in the community except by the small coterie of Union sympathisers  Opposition is lead by Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard ,in his first US Movie) the son of the local judge(Donald Crisp).The father -while in sympathy with the aims of his son -is less than impressed by the violent methods he employs.A confederate sympathiser is lynched and arson is also deployed as a terrorist weapon by the unregenerate Southerners.Drango -in addition to his professional problems -finds himself drawn to the daughter of the lynched sympathiser -winningly played by Joanne Dru  Chandler is a bit wooden in the title role -perhaps worn down by his production duties as his company produced the picture-but the rest of the acting is fine especially from John Lupton as an embittered Confederate Captain .The direction ,jointly undertaken by Hall Bartlett and Jules Bricken (who also scripted)is lumpen but the fluid and inventive monochrome photography by James Wong Howe is superb The movie is more intriguing than exciting but it is a striking and worthwhile movie with something interesting to say
Julie London and Joanne Dru are also effective in somewhat understated roles, even though important to the story.
The scene where Jerry plays a cop and pulls over a overweight speeder is also one of his funniest in years.
I also love the scene with the guru on the operating table, so funny.
too much sex and porn obscuring the plot, this film is fantastic!And also young Muhnihausen II is soooooo cute!^_^everyone on this planet should watch this coz it rules!!!!!!!
You can also learn a lot from this movie: What to do if it happens to you, etc.
Irene Dunne is also fabulous, her timing is the best of anyone this side of Madeline Kahn, but Dunne was more sophisticated and played off Grant beautifully.
Too bad, he is also perfect for this film.
Also rescued was another survivor -- the robustly masculine, handsome, and athletic Randolph Scott, who is also in love with Dunne.
The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool.
In the 60s, it was ineptly remade as a Doris Day vehicle also successful and equally well crafted but not nearly as much fun.
FYI--The same year this film debuted, another film with almost the exact same story line also came out called "TOO MANY HUSBANDS".
It is also my opinion that Irene Dunne was a more natural comedienne than she was a singer...good voice though she had.
Nick gets himself into an awful pickle trying to find the right time to tell his new wife (whom he has been married to for only a few hours) what has happened, and also telling the children that the new lady that they are enjoying the company of is actually their mother.
He has some great classics below his belt, also prior to the release of this movie.
While watching this movie it by the way also made me think; 'Wow, this guy would had made a great James Bond!'.
He stars in this movie with Irene Dunn, with who he has appeared in in several movies together throughout their career, which also all happen to be the same type of movies.
Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.
Interestingly enough, Kanin took over the directing duties from Leo McCarey (an Oscar winner as Best Director for 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH, which also starred Grant and Dunne) after McCarey was injured in an automobile accident (McCarey also co-wrote the screenplay with Kanin and Sam and Bella Spewack).
The supporting cast is also diligently cast, although there's no animal scene-stealer, a la canine performer Asta's memorable turn as Mr. Smith in THE AWFUL TRUTH.
Platinum-haired beefcake Randolph Scott is fun as Grant's rival for Dunne's affections, and the fact that Grant and Scott were lifelong friends and roommates only makes their scenes together even funnier (there's also a hilarious sight gag involving the two of them that will have even the most reserved viewer rolling on the floor with laughter).
The appropriately rigid Gail Patrick plays the role of the stereotypical shrew as well as anyone could, and director Kanin also pulls natural performances from the two children in the cast.
Masami Ohbari was also the creator and producer behind the Gowcaizer game.
Animation is great, music also and it's good they made some characters funny.
Highlights include the character Jeremy, some drunken teenagers, Carl Schoenborn, and especially Hethe Henrickson as Beloch, a rival archaeologist (whose last name happens to be Henrickson), who is also the ultimate in ham villainy, who is after the Infinte Power, which will make him shoot rays like Emperor Palpatine.
To somebody else however, the Prince of Egypt also has so much to offer: Great animation, a cracking story and a good dose of humour.
I have read that heavy accents worked against some actors in the early days of sound film, but I also think that people in North America were more willing to accept certain accents at the same time.
The strong Chinese accents of some of the actors may be authentic, but it is also obvious that some of the dialogue and accents are overplayed to the Chinese stereotype.
I was also amused at all the bad camera work.
But the problem with "Hood Angels" is not just the lack of budget; it is also the lack of talent.
There were however some disappointments, the acting could have been improved between some of the characters as they could have had more personality and the effects could have been a little better, also there is not a lot of action in the film until the final half an hour which is worth seeing.
Mr. Tibbett provides us with a clear illustration of the power of his vocal abilities and also of his masterful interpretation of any piece be it operatic aria, Negro spiritual, or drawing room favorite.
This, though he works all the time with one of the best actors in the business, who is also one of my very favorites: Edward James Olmos.
Alonso is very sexy, and also very realistic.
Counting the number of holes in Olmos' face of checking out Alonzo's firm contours and sensuality also helps in viewing this movie but the story is plotted well despite the reality that someone would have beaten the hell out of Danny for his annoying behavior.
It is also a realistic slice I think of a battling small business in a big city.
They also offer lodging for a period in the room of their son Danny (Steven Schub), who moved to Hollywood, looking for success as a performer and actor.
This is also an earlier cartoon too.
John Ireland seems a natural as the one guy who can and does (in some well done scenes) stand up to Queen Bee Joan, presenting his usual suppressed aversion to injustice while also straddling the fence.
It was a Crawford movie, indeed, but it was also an ensemble cast- the characters, Eva, Avery, Judd, Jen, and Carol were all part of one story.
Young innocent from Chicago travels down South to stay with her wealthy cousin, a society shark with an alcoholic husband who is planning on busting up the engagement between her former lover and a terrified girl who also lives in the mansion.
The supporting cast is also right on the money: the willowy niece, the bitter, alcoholic husband, the emotionally destroyed belle, the suave neighbor and his unstable sister.
I also slightly disagree with the posted comment that the ending was tacked on.
I would have also liked to have seen a small brief tribute to John Spencer for the style in which he brought two great NBC characters to the screen.
I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone, but those who have followed the show and developed the same attachment to the characters that I have will also find themselves with watering eyes.
The story reminded me a bit of the Lion King, the cartoon by Disney two years earlier .. also it was about a (sort of) king-to-be which goes away to another place, only to return to the hometown sometime later with a lot of vengeance towards a lot of people.
Along with Brown, Dvorak and Ellis also turn is nice performances.
Here she is bright and funny and a good singer (she also looks great); Dvorak is remembered as a B drama queen, but she started in the chorus (Free and Easy with Buster Keaton) and gets to sing and dance here.
But Hunter also has a partner (George Brent)and it's love at first sight.
This technique also helped the viewer to relate to the characters because we were able to see their desperation to appear "normal" (by begging Nora not to show arguments in the documentary), and normality is a quality everyone seeks in a relationship.
The use of the psychiatrist commentary also helped to break up the monotony of the film by adding comic relief and a professional opinion.
This also helped the movie move along, as it was nice to take the focus off the main characters every once in a while.
The complication of love and romance and how globalization has changed it is also one of the issues that are being address in the film.
There are also some well-made action sequences in the film to supplement the story.
It sounds like a bad idea to give the 'monster' a face and a backdrop story and yes, this is perhaps also why "Ringu 0: BÃ¢sudei" is perhaps not that great as a part of the Ringu series.
This movie is also less horror like and orientated as any other movie out of the series and it focuses more on the dramatic aspects of the Sadako character.
It's also then that the movie its horror elements really start to kick in and the Sadako character starts to become the evil spirit we all know from the other Ringu movies.
With a near perfect combination of acting, action, music and script it is also a thriller of the highest quality.
Ford is also at the top of his game in the action sequences of the film as well proving yet again that Ford is both a fine actor and a fine action hero as well.
There's also Henry Czerny and Harris Yulin as the me leading the war of behalf of their President (played expertly by Donald Moffat) plus there's Joaquin De Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Raymond Cruz, Tim Grimm and of course James Earl Jones.
Kudos also to Tom Clancy, director Phillip Noyce, James Horner's fine music score and the fine cast.
There is less of a character to Ryan in this screenplay, but he also strikes me as more heroic.
The film also has a good amount of name actors in supporting roles, such as Benjamin Bratt, Ann Magnuson, Williem DeFoe, Thora Birch, Joaquim De Almeida (from Despardo fame), and the late Hope Lange.
His actions may lead to the deaths of several drug dealers and their counterparts, but it also leads to the deaths of several women and young children.
Jack Ryan is also more interesting in this movie.
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, like the previous films, successfully thrills their audiences with exciting sequences that, also, manages to stay plausible and never too unbelievably silly.
Once more, it's also well-written on the screen and don't get wasted.
Speaking as one who enjoys Clancy's writing and his meticulous research into specific details of how these technologies and agencies operate, I also feel sometimes that it is simply too idealistic and overstates the utility and necessity of the vast US defense budget.
I also like this movie for its subtle dig at the American establishment and how it assumes it can coerce the weak into doing its bidding.
The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this.
The mayor's granddaughter, Clara(Charlotte Salt)is the one Mordecai has his eyes on, while also infecting the townspeople nearby with a type of mental sickness, and others with a black sludge-like substance derived from the muddy soil of the water covering Marienbad.
Mordecai needs Clara's submission while also awaiting the collapse of the poorly structured dam, built hastily 40 years prior, giving way to a massive crack running down it.Standing in Mordecai's way are Clara's mother, Teresa(Raquel MeroÃ±o), a would-be reporter returning home after a stint in London, and a recently arrived photo-journalist, Dan Quarry(Michael McKell) who is haunted by the death of his son.
There's a jam-packed climax which includes the bridge showing signs of crumbling, the earth trembling, a festival commemorating the 40th anniversary of the dam's building which turns into a crazed orgy of sexual deviancy and Dan, quite a skilled scuba-diver, who finds the chamber where Mordecai and his followers' monstrous remains are awakened(..while also holding a book of black magic spells Mordecai used to summon his dark powers)under the sea.
There's some decent gore here, there's some really cool looking rotting zombies, there are decapitated heads & severed limbs, the main villain like to rip peoples heads in half, someone chest bursts open, someone saws their own legs & hand off & there are also various other minor bits of blood & gore throughout although the murder of Luis seemed cut as there are noticeable jumps in the audio & too many 'reaction' shots of Teresa & Dan even though seemingly nothing has happened.
There's also some good underwater photography and a finale that throws in a number of bizarre horrors and even more bizarre sexual fetishes.
The score is also quite good and the directing is not to bad either!
So Â what we have here is, without exaggerating, one of the most promising horror premises of the past two decades AND you can also add several dynamite sub themes like nudity, child-kill, underwater zombies and even a totally gratuitous orgy complete with nuns and chickens!
Yuzna leaps from one subject to another without paying attention to continuity and for some reason he also inserts numerous tedious elements.
The film also feels very cheap; the poor acting doesn't help in this respect, and neither does the turgid script which is littered with trite lines of dialogue.
They also never really resolve the problem since one of the main characters for some reason has the power to stop seeing ghosts bought the book then his grandmother figured out that somebody is putting a spell on them.
For people who think comedy and thriller/horror in one movie is bad, then you certainly don't like this one and you don't like the American's "scary movie's" also.
The actors are good, special effects also good.
I also loved some of the humor thrown into the film that just had a smile on my face.
The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza.
But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane.
Yes Madam is a classic film that was also directed by Corey Yuen.
He also drinks snake blood which is shot in a single tracking shot from the snakes drained gizards to it being drunk out of a shot glass.
The action is also co-directed by Hoi Meng.
That scene also sported the best sound in the 99-minute film.
next thing, the heroes swap goggles for sunglasses and throw flares... so they outsmart the gangsters, but, perhaps more importantly, they also LOOK way, way cooler - and that is the whole point!
There's also the great bit with the man as a kind of cash-register of food as people sit down and at the flick of a button on his jacket get plastic forks and other things to munch down on their lot of good.
Ohh..and great soundtrack also!
This song is exquisite, and they also used Love Spit Love's 'Am I right' in the movie.
Angus also has a side kick little friend named Troy.
I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.
Although there is some comic relief ( as in life - there also is ), this is not what I would call a comedy.
The main actor was Chabrol's main screenwriter (Paul Gegauff), who also performs (with Chabrol's son) the 4-hand piano music used throughout the film (well, there is a one - pianist Schubert Impromptu at a key point).
This all lends a special intensity to the film but it also creates a lack of nuance.
George C. Scott and Kathy Bates are also at their best.
Angus also has a quality to it that was very reminiscent of the story it was based on.
Rick is also highly manipulative, as he uses his bullying tactics over Troy to betray his own best friend.
Music also plays an important role, as it balances teenage angst with feelings of longing and disillusion.
And I also liked at the dance how Angus told Rick off, that was a good scene, and the rest of this movie was just as well, filled with laughs, and pity for Angus and Troy.
It also features a heart wrenching monologue by Angus (played by Charlie Talbert) when he confides in his grandfather (George C. Scott), who's about to be married.
His wife, DaniÃ¨le Gegauff, plays second fiddle somewhat to her co-star, but also puts in a very good and believable performance.
The film really all centres on the leading man, which isn't surprising since the actor is also the scriptwriter.
We also learn more about Sadako and the circumstances leading up to her imprisonment and death, which deepens the horror by making the audience more compassionate towards the object of fear.
"Ring 2" also makes less sense than its predecessor and demands more leaps of the imagination than the first film did.
Rikiya Otaka also deserves a mention as Yoichi (the little boy from the first film) - his expressions of blank terror and occasional moments of rage are very effective indeed.
I may also add that  this sequel is more schizophrenic in its direction and visualization  than the first one.
This may have been intended by Nakata as  sporadic confusion that disturbs our sub-conscious perspective,  but it also prevents the film from being able to move forward to a  building climaxes, at least not as powerful and thrilling as in 'Ring'.
But the surprising appearance of Ryuji was a reward and it's  simulteneously disturbing to know that his soul is also trapped  within the well.
There's also an effective sequence where a survivor from the first film sets off the hospital television  and the other patients start to panic at the sight of the infamous well.
The confusing ending also gives us the  return of Sadako (now with the clayface of her real corpse) climbing up the well.
The scene where the reporter then tries to conveniently erase his guilt along with footage of Kanae backfires on him and provides one of the film's memorably eerie scenes (but also one of the confusing plot threads that I didn't really understand until reading the FAQ at RingWorld).
Free Webs(all one word).com/ Kayak-o-fan(also all one word with no dashes.
With the logical categories of position and negation, also the corresponding ethical categories good and bad are abolished.
The story is also better told from a movie technical point of view.
Unfortunately the movie is also filled with some 'silly' moments and at times poor acting skills which really brings down the level of this movie.
We also have our own dualities.
I was also really disappointed that in Rasen and Ringu 2 we don't see the wonderful Yukie Nakamura, who just knocks my socks off.
They don't seem to understand how beautiful and quirky people who are very intelligent, can also be really creepy, because they can see and comprehend things faster than the rest of us, but like Cassandra, are sometimes helpless to change things because everyone else is so slow.
Like Sadako, their blessing is also a curse.
To be fair, Miki Nakatani does a remarkable job filling the shoes of Nanako Matsushima as main character, and probably a better job than her, as Nakatani shows a freshness and charm that Nanako never showed (in this aspect, Naomi Watts was also better than her in the American remake).
The police, who are investigating the death of Reiko's father, are also looking for her, while Okazaki (YÃ»rei Yanagi), a work colleague of Reiko's, is continuing from her research on an urban legend involving a videotape that kills whoever watches it.
This approach creates mostly pros in 'Ring 2', but also some cons as well.
'Ring 2' is a nice mix of the best elements of its predecessor and some intriguing new material, but it's also a slightly uneasy one too.
Not only due to the step down from Nanako Matsushima's solid performance, but also as events seem to drop into Mai's lap at random.
T liked the original but found the suspense lacking and the film-making a nit bland, in this film however Hideo Nakata (who also helmed the original) gives the visuals a much needed kick and the atmosphere so much needed zing.
'Ring 2' is not only much deeper than it's predecessor, it's also a scarier and ultimately better film.
It's also nice to see almost the entire cast of the first film reprise their roles (even the dead ones).
You may also wish to watch Ringu 0: Basudei (2000) before Ringu, and for fun, the original "Ring 2", Rasen/Spiral (1998) before or after this "replacement sequel" (this one was produced when audiences were dissatisfied with the very differently toned Rasen/Spiral).
But there are also moments of brilliance, plus there is added value from the momentum of Ringu.
There is also an attempt here at explaining the curse, and it also ends up in sci-fi land.
In the finale, Nakata also more literally combines the ring symbolism with the series' ubiquitous water symbolism--water more than likely being used to represent a kind of unifying "spiritual" ("kamic" might be a better word) ether that permeates the world.
Yes, this is an R-rated film - also, for some language, clay-sex and drug use.
She's also not particularly attractive.
However, while the film MOMMY DEAREST was anything but subtle and was also poorly executed, this film was expertly and intricately woven.
A controlling housewife, Harriet Craig, she controls all of her husband's life, (portrayed well by a kind-hearted Wendell Corey), who you may also recognize as the long suffering husband in "No Sad Songs for Me".
Corey, the hapless husband, also buckles under his wife's overbearing personality, until Harriet oversteps the line and tries to manipulate his career.
Joan Crawford is "Harriet Craig," a manipulative, insecure woman who has to control everything around her in this 1950 film also starring Wendell Corey, K.T.
Pretty soon, he forgets that he's uncomfortable in his own house and that Harriet has isolated him from his friends and things he used to enjoy, and also that she can't have children - so she says.
She had to have been a lot more charming than Harriet and also, unlike Harriet, capable of letting down her hair once in a while and having a good time.
She also had issues with her cousin and went on a mission to ruin her relationship as well.
I also enjoyed the scene where she and Mrs. Harold lock horns about the running of the house Â Mrs. Harold isn't intimidated by Harriet, and gives as good as she gets.
It also offers an unadulterated middle-period glimpse of the controlling monsters she had begun (Mildred Pierce, Humoresque) and continued (Torch Song, Johnny Guitar, Queen Bee) to play on film.
The performances in this movie are also very good and add to the gritty atmosphere.
I also feel that Benicio Del Toro, as always, did a very good part in his role.
The film tells this through flashbacks which occur every few minutes throughout the film, and we also see a part from Ray's youth.
Although it is often pretentious and a little boring, it also contains many potent, unforgettable scenes, most notably those featuring Chris Penn, who I frankly didn't think could act until I saw this movie.
In the case of Beverly Garland, also traffic-cone-orange hair.
This was an excellent comedy, and Meg Ryan was great in the film also.
Dennis Quaid was great in this movie also, even confined to a teeny tiny pod floating around in Martins insides.
It's no surprise that Steven Spielberg often had a hand in the making of many of his films, though Dante infuses his own offbeat style to the proceedings; Dante's got a agreeable sentimental streak, but he's also got an anarchic one too, something that would reach full crazy fruition with Gremlins 2.
Meg Ryan is also very charming and engaging as Lydia (very cute too, in the days before she milked said cuteness to disagreeable levels in her 90's films), who tags along for the ride but doesn't get let in on the whole truth of the story for the most part.
The film is also hilarious, with countless great gags, a near-perfect balance between humour and excitement.
"Matinee" is my favorite of his movies, but "Innerspace" is certainly also up there.
Dante regulars Kevin McCarthy and Robert Picardo also star, the former as villain Victor Scrimshaw, the latter as Scrimshaw's associate Cowboy.
Martin Short is also a likable hero as Jack, although he does have a tendency to go over the top.
There are also a lot of things happening in this film, and not everything is tied up like it should have been.
I am from the town where the film was shot and I am also Cherokee and I must say .
Throughout the film he struggles with a difficult relationship with his father, made worse by Hunter's inability to play sports, to help his father work on his car, or to, as his name suggests, hunt (which is also a favourite pastime of his father).
I'm also fairly certain that they killed an actual rattlesnake in the making of SWAMP WOMEN.
I can also try to ignore the desperate attempts at trying to be new by putting every known western clichÃ© upside down, like the women are the strong ones kicking the guys butt, the black people are the cool dudes from da hood untouched by the slavery common a the time, while the white guys at best are stupid and pathetic cannon fodder, or at best evil and rotten to the bone.
In Cashmere Mafia, they show that women cannot only be sexy, but also deeply passionate about work, family, and relationships.
Just as people are quick to criticize clichÃ©s, they are also quick to criticize the different.
Sometimes, the show does make me wonder if these women work - the show is also supposed to be focused on their work lives, but we do not get to see them work very much.
There are, of course, lots of severed hands but also some decent severing methods like one guy who puts his hand under the wheels of a moving train, ouch!
It is also much closer to the Stefan Zweig short story that both films are based on.
The director (Xu Jinglei) who is also the main actress of the movie has created a very nice visual atmosphere to reflect a heartbreaking one-sided love story.
There are also several moments where Hamdo makes somewhat sexual advances toward Lala-Ru, much to the chagrin of his lady lieutenant Abelia.
It also deals with some very compelling character studies, particularly in the cases of the children held prisoner at Hellywood.
It's also pretty hilarious how none of the people who get shot appear to bleed, they just fall down.
This plot also serves the film makers with an excellent opportunity to show as much cleavage as possible.
One of the best scenes has Harry reciting "Star Light, Star Bright" in an aggravated Jack Lemmon voice (which clashes with the poem completely, of course), and it's also the scene where Ellen wishes on the star by saying, "I wish I were a lesbian, that's what I wish.
There were also a couple of songs by people that I did not recognize that had very bad unmusical voices.
Kiri Te Kanawa is also a marvel as is Michael Ball (who uplifts the most with his "Love Changes Everything" - which literally had me dancing on my living room floor because of the gospel choir backup).
Since this movie is an adaptation of Mr. Koji Suzuki's Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it's sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled.
The film is also poorly structured, keeping the stars away from each other (and from any enjoyable interaction) for laaaaarge periods of time.
This time Long John sets out to save young Jim Hawkins (played by Kit Taylor who sadly doesn't possess the memorable screen presence that his predecessor Bobby Driscoll put into the role) from a cutthroat pirate named "El Toro" Mendoza (Lloyd Berrell) but also added into the mix are a slightly more memorable crew of pirates following after Long John's lead and Long John's frequently comedic interactions with his main squeeze Purity Pinker (Connie Gilchrist), who has her eyes firmly set on marriage and settling down the old sea Captain.
Although the comedy wasn't as intense as in previous years, people have been going to not only see George the comedian, but also George the storyteller.
Essentially people listen to Carlin to laugh and also to learn something.
I could go on and on, but the ultimate genius of this bit is how society is "going to the dogs" and he touches on this not only in the Suicide Reality TV bit, but also the Eliminating Electricity to bring us back to primitive times and finally the Nationwide Natural Disaster bit as well as just the whole routine shows us what's wrong with society and that it's only getting worse, so what should we do about it...
Carlin also does something in this special that I liked that he rarely does: he referenced a joke from an earlier concert because he got mail from people who didn't understand it and chose to explain it here.
I also appreciated how there was much, much less time devoted to non sequiturs and more ramblings that were all connected, often in a very twisted and disturbing way.
I thought "Life is Worth Losing" was indeed one of Carlin's harshest acts, but it was also very funny.
Carlin may be getting older but I really fail to see how he's "falling apart" as a comedian here - I thought it was a great show and although it's his most bitter act I've heard, a lot of it is also totally true.
He also talks about mindless consumerism.
This time, with Life is Worth Losing, there is a lot more philosophy in some ways, and also a little bit of loss in some of the timing for a few good laughs.
A few Hollywood movies that paint the indigenous people of America before westward expansion as noble savages - also a pleasant fiction, incidentally - does not make up for a century of bias, misinformation, and outright lies taught to American schoolchildren.
A movie crew shooting "Vampires on Valium on Valentine's Day" also become victims.
Apparently they also meant high camp comedy to many in Europe.
Ole, the Swedish sailor also expresses his loneliness when they arrive on land and he tells the woman at the bar about how he hasn't seen his family in almost 10 years.
The first shot of the movie is also brilliant and if it wouldn't have been directed by Ford I could have imagined something surreal about it.
The crew talk and contend each other but also save each other from bombing and risks.
Hunter also appears in "Adventures Of Robin Hood" as a similar figure of dual identities, and I won't make the mistake of underestimating him again.
The plot is also pretty tenuous and episodic.
Mitchell and Wayne are probably the best known, but there are also Ian Hunter, Barry Fitzgerald, John Qualen, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, and many other great character actors.
Agatha Christie, the well known English mystery writer who also has had many books made into movies, used a similar motif in her book, Ten Little Indians.
The fighting sequences are extremely well choreographed and you also feel the passion within the main characters and I think that's what makes the difference in this movie.
Arguably Biao was also the better fighter than Chan, but of course Chan did the most amazing stunts of the three legends.
Rothrock is superb in the action department and has some great fights, amongst others a great fight with Biao, while Biao is also superb, showcasing some amazing moves and great stunts.
He exchanges blows with undefeated kickboxing legend Peter "Sugarfoot" Cunningham in a (POLICE STORY-style) glass-shattering fight, he also battles Cynthia Rothrock in an engagement of traditional kung-fu, acrobatic fight moves and handcuffs.
Actor Melvin Wong (EASTERN CONDORS and DESCENDANT OF WING CHUN- the film referred in BULLETPROOF MONK-) also gets screen time to execute some martial arts against Yuen Biao.
This film was also one of Cynthia and Biao's best performances in screen combat during that era but the praise goes to Cory Yuen because of his skillful direction and casting of martial arts action figures from both worlds to pull the strings.
The film had some big laughs, perhaps occasionally unintentional, but also some great action.
From wacky characters suitable for a hardcore sex-romp, it also features real sets, locations, and even costumes.
who would also star in the slightly lesser sequel CANDY GOES TO Hollywood.
The plot is of course secondary to the main action, but the story of the girl who suffers amnesia following a road accident is novel and also helps to make this a cut above the ordinary.
This episode should also be noted as not following thru with the incorrect notion that all the guys in the red shirts are killed (both victims of the planet's monsters wore yellow shirts) and likewise the equally inexplicable idea that all the black guys were killed (the minority in this case survived).
See, whether it shows a rainy night or shinny day, it can represent the beauty of both with contemplating also.
Magnum and friends have to relive their haunted unresolved past in Vietnam, prevent an assassination, not only in Hawaii but also in other areas of the world, and seek justice and retribution when the powers that be can not put Ivan in jail.
I think that it is a very good made film that also features some good actors including (Howard Vernon) who plays Count Karstien.
It is a very curious film and also very boring.
And then I found out that he worked with Orson Welles as assistant director for Chimes at Midnight and Don Quixote being also responsible for the butchered 1992 DVD release of the latter film.
There is also some gratuitous nudity that makes absolutely no sense the "story" but which is also not enough to make this a proper soft-core movie.
The man obviously had some taste, and I think many directors of erotica could learn some tricks from him in terms of set design and also the use of music and extreme closeups.
This also teaches some really good lessons, besides the ones in the stories.
It also shows some current problems today with the native American culture.
I have watched it many times, & everyone I've shown it to has loved it also.
It's an incredible story portraying Native American legends, and also shows the struggle that modern day Native American teens go through when trying to find their identity.
(I also recommend the "making of" that accompanies the movie).
Not only was the spellbinding special effects ignored but the jaw dropping performances of to many actors to mention was also forgotten??
In the beginning he don't want that but when he realizes that he also has 1 day to pay the money back to the gang than it maybe could be a good alternative to escape.
The maker of this movie also made Arabian nights and you can see it a little back in this movie because the setup is the same because in Arabian nights a woman tells a movie to the sultan she wants to marry.
This story really impressed me and i enjoyed it a lot, also because i am very interested in Indian tribes.
Rhys Jones, who also wrote the screenplay, does a fine job of keeping the quirkiness factor pretty high without becoming too over the top.
Does a film that you like that I don't (that has been funded by Government Filmcorps) also fall into the 'fraudulently obtained' category.
Enjoy also the interesting opening credits: at the corner of your eyes, you could notice there are 'extraneous' words or obvious name labels of things within each frame, e.g., grass, sky, wall, jeans, fence - as the credits roll on.
but most of all, everyone should see, what a human being is capable of, the love, the care, the beauty, the sensitivity, the tolerance, the acceptance, but also all the negative sides, the ignorance, the desperate moments, the anger..  the best movie ....
Julie Strain appears only in two erotic scenes (both with the porcelain twins, a couple of blondes resembling - but only for the face, as she as definitely better boobs - Italian pornstar Selen), while in the other five you have a couple each with Aria Giovanni (another goddess of this kind of movies), Mia Zottoli (also known as Ava Lake), Felony and Nicole Specht.
The movie starts well, with a pool scene among Julie and the Twins involving a silver dildo, but it becomes almost boring for the rest, apart from a few very good moments (as the sado-maso scene involving again Julie and the Twin and also the final four some, involving all the rest of the female cast), with really annoying fake moans, always out of synchro.
The father of the one dead boy also washes and oils his son's corpse.
Besides the swarming black blobs, there were also a few laughs in the "plot"; it was both humorous and painful to watch them try to take seriously the tired, over used, simplistic plot line.
There are also issues of grief, and hence part of this movie is these brothers journeying for some sense of resolve or closure.
I also like how Wilson, Schwartzman and Brody elbow one another in an intimate, familial way.
It also has that Venusian subtlety of touch that Wes Anderson seems to bring to everything.
Expect some laughs, maybe a tear but also, make the time to follow a great story line.
It wasn't only boring, it's also stupid.
This isn't navel-gazing (though there's that) but also discovery and wonderment.
They also went to India and took a trip before the writing, living the experience before they made it into a screenplay.
He's enjoying solitary luxury in a nice Paris hotel, when his girlfriend (Portman), also estranged, turns up.
'Hotel Chevalier' is a bridge into the full-length film, and was also a way for Schwartzman to readjust to working with Anderson as an actor after the long interlude since 'Rushmore.'
Francis, who bosses his other brothers around, also has a secretary and planner, Brendan (Wally Worodarsky) who prints up and laminates little copies of their itinerary, which changes from day to day, and has such tasks as keeping track of the brother's extensive array of custom Marc Jacobs Vuitton luggage, which belonged to their father, and finding adapter plugs.
On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals.
Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances.
Three good actors in three-well written roles in an open, exciting and unpredictable environment, while they're also stuck with each other in a cramped an uncomfortable train carriage.
Owen Wilson, as usual, is effortlessly funny as spiritually obsessive control freak Francis, but also brings a tragic undercurrent to his character, made more poignant due to recent real life events out of character.
Watch also for amusing cameos from Bill Murray and Natalie Portman (featured more significantly in the film's 13 minute prequel found online at www.hotelchevalier.com), and a somewhat forced supporting role from Angelica Huston near the end.
His character had to display the most emotional range, and was also the most physical, with some episodes of good slapstick.
The show also includes a few song and dance numbers that actually don't seem just slotted in for the sake of padding the show/film out (including one nude ballet sequence that really works).
Where gay marriage is normal in Holland, and gays are put to prison or to death in some other countries, sexual freedom is also not the same everywhere.
The silliness of the film also reminds me of films like Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing Up Baby--and this a a STRONG complement indeed!
The interface is also annoying and very slow.
Now, she's also cast as an understudy (or as they call it here, apprentice) in a play, and somehow the star dies, horribly, while sitting right there in the midst of her fellow actors.
USA(which, incidentally, is also the only "clean" one, no chemical/biological warfare) is the strongest, technologically superior, but also most expensive.
There is also a great bit when a girl explains sex to someone in a very frank way.
There is also some drugs use in it and several lovely babes but it is really more of a serious film than a babefest and would appeal to women as well.
The existence they led ends, and quite rightly the film ends also.
If you like this movie I would also recommend: starring at a bottle of peanut butter for an hour and a half, listening to Michael Bolton, and/or just getting a better taste in movies.
There is also a bit of insight in this film.
It's also important to note that this is not a Hollywood "teen" or "young adult" comedy - it's a drama with a lot of nonsense included, because that's what life is like.
He is also sleeping with Joey Lauren Adams' character, who happens to be one of his teachers.
It was also one of those movies that you either love or hate.
The happy ending (the good guys win from the bad guys) is also what I like in typical American movies like this one.
But they're also kind and charitable (as we see, they help out a homeless beggar in the street), you have to feel bad for them.
Of course, it also goes a little too far as times.
Rabid Grannies would also go on to inspire other rabid grannies in Peter Jackson's 1992 cult classic, Dead Alive (aka- Braindead), and Luca (Ghoulies) Bercovici's grimy little 1995 cheapie, The Granny, whose gore was not nearly as savaged as Rabid Grannies'.
So the film's plentiful, impressive gore effects can only be seen in a montage on Troma's DVD in the special features section- which is also missing at least one key gore sequence.
Patrick Lussier's direction was as great as ever, I'd love to see his take on The Crow mythology :) The additional characters were also great in this film, the two vampires during the opening and the two procurers in particular were awesomely performed!
I suggest also for people who like the story of Dracula to read Bram Stokers' novel, "Dracula" and read anything else you can about vampires, please also read Kim Harrison, Anne Rice, and Laurell K. Hamilton.
I was looking forward so much in seeing Rutgar Hauer as Dracula, needless to say I was also disappointed.
The acting is also a stink and you can see that the sword of the so called "Dracula" (that has nothing to do with the real Dracula at all) is made out of plastic or something weak.
The story was rather dull and pointless and also full of clichÃ©s - bad one's that is.
I also thought that they could have put a little more romance into it between Elizabethand Dracula and instead of what happened they could have kept him in alive.
Rutger plays like he drink-ed to much in the night clubs of Bucharest , the main actor is just another Blade , a vampire who is also a day walker.
The original things and new in it , were the vampire turned from a circus , a new weapon for the vampire slayer also combined with a bad whip.
The filming locations in Romania were good also, they had a good guide, they choose perfect places to represent a Romania affected by a vampire war.
I also love the fact that the three movies are different from one another.
One also has to admire Patrick Lussier's directing.
She was in Subspecies: The Awakening, and also the spin off movie of the Subspecies series "Vampire Journals".
Those movies and also this one make you feel like you are stuck in a time warp of sorts, due to them being filmed in Romania.
I also liked that the writers touched immortality and it's toll.
The Romanian actors in the movie were also a bonus (in the opening scene of the movie).
There was no face-to-face talks and interviews, only speeches to loving supporters and in a few instances, quips to the opposition that also showed up.
But this does also fall, even for fans, into that category akin to The Big One, which was, as this is, a travelogue of Moore going around on a tour to promote something with him as the focus really instead of something else like guns or GM in Flynt.
And also makes sure to offer them military enrollment forms as they are Bush supporters.
However, the possibility that there are Democrats who may also be intolerant isn't considered here.
I think this documentary also shows, unintentionally, why they ultimately failed.
The documentary itself is without a doubt good propaganda for the Democratic vote, but it also pretty good entertainment - it is very funny, and very, very poignant in places...  ....And the students love him.
I also like the head nurse, because although she wasn't thrilled about him at first, she grew to care for him a great deal, a must see movie.
Hanging over the head of the story is also the fact that nothing can be done for Mr Merrick.
We also get to discover some of Sadako's back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape.
Lynch's direction is also awesome.
The acting is also superb, especially from Hopkins and Hurt.
Of course the evil characters, Bytes and the guard, were also memorable.
The film is also ironic.
Aside from it's visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus.
David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience.
Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also.
Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.'
It also shows the detestable ways some people treat others.
It also has a great supporting cast which is mainly the "bad guys" and when they make Burt mad he makes them wish they didn't.
The murder of the priest is also religiously offensive but if you're a religious person, I doubt you'd be watching a film titled "Rabid Grannies".
Although, Tanner is the main obstacle, Valdez is also challenged by Tanner's formidable collection of professional gunmen assembled by his experienced right-hand man, El Segundo (Barton Heyman).
The film also boasts actual history events from the 1969 World Series and a finish which will surprise you, it's a movie that you really have to pay close attention to, but it's worth the lenght of the time duration, overall this film gets a 9 out of 10
there's a lot of emotional moments here and there, but there's also a mix of suspense which is surprisingly just right.
It also deals with "the space/time continuum" idea not all too far removed from "Back to the Future", but certainly not in  a comedy sense.
It  also manages to weave in a semi-interesting murder mystery.
Not only are the usual chase scenes exciting, but the interesting psychological aspects of the movie also work extremely well.
it also involves ham radio, an aspect not usually shown in movies.
It is action-packed and full of surprises but also emotional and touching.
I also loved the small hints and moments that are sprinkled throughout the film that tie back into the larger "time travel-ish" story, which makes it great on repeat viewings.
The thirty year anniversary of the death of his firefighter father (Dennis Quaid), is also approaching.
The son is able to prevent his father's death, but changing the past also turns out to have unexpected consequences with which the two must deal.
This movie also has some new faces you won't soon forget.
Remember to also listen to all of the songs Aly and AJ have written because they are all talented!
This movie is cute!It can also teach other rich spoilt children a lesson!Much thought was put in this movie!The movie started by showing the Callum sisters' lavish and luxurious lifestyle,how they only are concerned about their health,their appearance and mostly about what they can do to make themselves happy.Their father,the owner of a very successful dairy operation,was very disappointed with his daughters but decided to let it go.However,after Taylor and Courtney ruined their house kitchen the father decided to teach them a lesson,they got to work at his factory!When their father goes for a vacation,the company was in big trouble.THe company account was empty,not even a single cent!So,it is up to the Callum sisters to set things right but Courtney has a party to prepare and the sisters have to give up their lavish lifestyles to save the company.The Callum sisters face many problems in the process,like conflicts between themselves and Taylor had to sell her classic stickshift!How do they resolve this problem??
I also think this is a really good movie because both Alyson and Amanda M. are very talented not only in acting but singing!
I thought this would be the worth movie ever but I think it is extraordinary.This is a must see.It is about two spoiled girls who burn the kitchen and they have to take a summer job at there dad"s dairy factory, while he goes on vacation,but the sisters run into a lot of problems and they need to find the solution together.I liked the story,the acting was great and the best part is that I can watch this over and over again,not like a lot of movies.I also like the way the sisters realize that they need to think about other people not just themselves.so this is my conclusion:see this movie,if you like Disney,vote on it,comment.that is what I think of this outstanding movie
It was also an especially unrealistic, and jaded portrayal of rural life.
I also got a kick out of Hitler and Attila the Hun playing cards together...
I also enjoyed Hellcop, who's played by CJ Graham, who was Jason in "Friday the 13th, Part 6" and who is now a general manager at a local Las Vegas Casino.
This whole film is also one of the most peculiar comedies to come along.
And yet at that moment in the restaurant when Lenny breaks the news to Lila over that half-slice of pecan pie, our hearts just break for her, and Lenny's feeble, yet honest (although ultimately self-serving) attempt to comfort her also touches us, as does Kelly's joie de vivre and passion for Lenny, and her parent's obvious conflicting feelings of protection, love and knowing they have to let go.
This film is an absolute gem, hasn't dated one iota, and is a genuinely bittersweet comedy guaranteed to entertain, but which also somehow manages to resonate with some very real truths about love, relationships, ego and happiness.
But someone who'd spent three years in the service of his country should show a little more maturity than he does; the story recalls Tennessee Williams's play, and the much better film "Period of Adjustment (1962)" - Jim Hutton's character was also ex-military.
Note that there is also a Japanese film named Rasen (aka Spiral, 1998) which was meant to be a "Ring 2", but that was later superseded with the 1999 Ringu 2.
It would have also given the character more weight for the climax, which would have given the ending even greater impact.
The dialogue is in Kiwi, i.e., "english", but it would benefit from subtitles, also in English, as in The Harder They Come.
Anne Meara, Ben Stiller, and the lovable Richard Farnsworth are also in the film as well as the late Kevin Peter Hall.
Especially when I found out Danneel, Jensen, and Elizabeth were there, also and I adore all 3 of them.
I saw Elizabeth, Danneel, and Clea in the audience and they all got along wonderfully and then saw Elizabeth and Jensen at Comic Con and they also seemed to be very close.
I also have to say this really shows off the casts acting skills.
Everyone around me genuinely laughed and clapped and cheered something I also don't see much in movies and a lot of that was when the Priestly character was on screen.
I also want to say I didn't know that much about Elizabeth Harnois previously.
I had seen her briefly on One Tree Hill and liked her on there, and also found out she was Alice whom I really loved as a little girl when I watched the Disney Channel but didn't really know exactly what to expect until the movie.
I also feel the same way about Danneel Harris I thought she definitely played the character of Tish wonderfully, especially considering I had a good 5 min chat with her and she is absolutely nothing like that.
There where also a lot of things in that movie I could relate too as well along with making me laugh.
Although this happened in a few places in this movie, there were also many times where I guessed wrong.
Yes it had it moments when the wheels where spinning in my head and I was able to call it before it happened but it also keep my guessing and took a few turns I never would have guessed.
The film also had a great message attached to it that anyone can relate to.
It's also a movie about tearing down the masks and - simply - finding what's really important.
I also loved the feelings of camaraderie among the main characters in the film.
It certainly does not make this society a better place to live; It also has been proved that executions are not a deterrent to crime.
If you liked this movie, you may also like "The Life of David Gale" with Kevin Spacey; there are many thought provoking arguments here, decide for yourself.
Not only in the fine cast but also in their performances, the direction and the cinematography.
It also dips into melodrama in a couple scenes involving Dennis Hopper's stock villain, and some of the other characters needed to be fleshed out more.
I was also struck by the notion that love doesn't necessarily entail complete openness between lovers.
He also manages the near-impossible feat of keeping Francis, the lisping clotheshorse, to a minimum of cloying eye-rolls, with no small help from Powell's wry and charmingly self-effacing performance.
Kay Francis and William Powell are doomed lovers in "One Way Passage," a 1932 film also starring Frank McHugh, Aline McMahan and Warren Hymer.
Ames is also on board ship; she's dying of an incurable illness (probably some form of heart disease they couldn't do anything about in 1932).
"Barrel House" Betty is passing herself as the phony Countess Barilhaus, and a man from Dan's past, Skippy, is also finding ways to scam passengers.
Kay Francis was one of the top stars of the decade, and this is one of her best films; William Powell, also underrated, has never been more suave.
That version was not bad, but certainly an also ran compared to this film.
Sextus Petronius, by all accounts the Emperor's minister of good taste, or arbiter elegantium, not only wrote a number of short poems and epigrams, but also committed suicide after being implicated in a plot against Nero.
The somber sequence depicting the dignified suicide of proscribed patricians reminds us that many prominent persons who fell out of favor by their political affiliations were forced to abandon their families in this way which also included confiscation of their property.
In doing so, he also provides a remarkable journey into the myriad aspects of human life in all its richness.
the best scenes are the roman undergrounds full of whores and weirdos, also the big orgy scene is a classic with a very perfect direction, really good photo and artistic direction.
Fellini goes the other direction, and gives the other side of the coin - YES, the Romans were "like us" in many ways, but in other ways, they were also quite Alien, and UN-like modern Americans - VERY unlike.
It's also very sexy.
It's also interesting to compare this depiction of Roman society with our current one, and see if Fellini's view of same-sexuality and decadence has any resonance today.
Eumolpo, an impoverished poet whom Encolpio meets on the way there, despises the wealthy man, all the more so for being rich and for having the nerve to also call himself a poet.
This is where the young buck meets Ascilto and Gitone again, also captives of the tyrant.
Though admittedly unsavoury, I also find such elements to be archetypically symbolic, and ultimately fascinating.
The story also follows a journalist who has traced down Sadako, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, Sadako's estranged mother.
Reportedly a free adaptation of the now fragmentary writings of Petronius, the film also makes fleeting references to various scattered works and myths of antiquity.
There is also a bluish tint to many of these early scenes as if they were being viewed through water.
There are also many references to the supernatural and paranormal.
The film also presents a recurring symbolism of carved and imprinted heads eventually given great emphasis with Lica's startling decapitation.
If you enjoy "Fellini Satyricon" you should also watch Vera Chytilova's "Daisies" (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain" (1973), Guy Maddin's "Careful" (1992) and Tsui Hark's "Green Snake".
With some funny elements and also a different plot, ''Hghway to Hell'' starts when Charlie and his girlfriend Rachel are running away from their homes to marry.
However, at the same time, it also had wonderful acting and a superb script about people--something you often did not see in other episodes.
It also was nice that for once in this era a Black man and cast be featured in a mainstream TV show.
Serling's sensitive script and innovative direction also help create a beautiful and superbly realized story about the importance of faith, and the tragedy of the cynicism that age and experience can create.
There's no denying this film couldn't have been made five years ago, not only because the technology wasn't there to make the process of aging backwards look real, but it would've also been a completely different movie as screenwriter Eric Roth wouldn't have been able to bookend the film with Blanchett on her deathbed as Hurricane Katrina comes to literally wipe away her life.
Roth, who also penned the thematically similar "Forrest Gump" peppers his screenplay with many momentous events from the 20th Century, but those moments ebb and flow through Benjamin's life just as the other characters do showing us that life is made only of moments.
It should be one of those movies that hold audiences rapt in hushed silence, but it's also the type of movie that usually receives instant backlash.
The screenplay is a little slow and meticulous (Eric Roth also wrote the screenplays for Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer, Munich, The Good Shepherd) but the directing made it work perfectly (give me Fincher over Mann, DeNiro, Redford, Spielberg or Zemeckis any day).
We are also given a small window into the lives of the other residents of the rest home where Benjamin resides.
There are very few movies that have even dared to explore the hardships and also the small compensations of advanced age.
Falling slightly short in the affecting drama expected of its epic scope, Button still beautifully showcases romance with the constant gaining and losing of Daisy; action at sea with the patriotic Captain Mike (who is also reminiscent of a Forrest Gump character: Gary Sinise's Lt. Dan); and comedy relief aplenty, most memorably from a man who was struck by lightning seven times.
Contrast this to the far superior Forrest Gump, also penned by Mr. Roth.
Taraji P. Henson also shines as Benjamin's surrogate mother, who gives her son the support he needs.
As a humorous, romantic, melancholic and visually stunning tale of a sweet-natured man who's different from most people, the film reminds me of "Forrest Gump" (which was also adapted to the screen by Eric Roth), but it is even more groundbreaking.
The closest the film comes to a plot is the love story between Daisy and Benjamin, which is also the closest the film comes to displaying any sort of real conflict.
There is also a playful theme to summarize the entire film -- no matter which way you age, life will always f-ck you.
You can also tell why they had the affair in the first place: they wanted to find out to what it was like to be in love, or in the girls case: Benjamin's strange affliction.
It's also very long with a 168-minute runtime, it thinks it can spend all the time trying to win, but in the end, it fails.
Let us also remind ourselves both films are narrated by the hero who both happen to have interesting and 'profound' observations about life and their lives.
This film will certainly earn comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' modern classic(also written by Roth), but where that film had a truly fascinating central character, who experienced as many mistakes and tragedies as victories and happiness, Fincher and Roth's protagonist is a cipher.
"Button" is also the most technically well made movie of 2008, as the true standouts are the Visual Effects and the Makeup, both of which are Oscar worthy.
It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way.
The acting is also a thing of wonder.
The now famous Ben Stiller, in the beginning of his career, is very hilarious in the role of a cook, and also as Attila the Hun at the table with Hitler and Cleopatra.
I also thought the religion parts and especially Rachel's prayer in the beginning say it all.
"Legend" also has a strong Christian theme, but it's not overbearing.
Some of the Cafe scenes were also filmed in Robertsdale at Mac and Jerry's.
He also plays Craig David, The Bear, Mel B, Michael Jackson, Davina McCall, The Osbournes, Sir Elton John, Jonathan Ross (or "Woss"), Vernon Kay, Marilyn Manson, Will Young, Gareth Gates, Jordan or Jodie Marsh's tit, Harry Hill, Kat Slater and many more hilarious and gross celebrities.
He also gets beat up by the "preppy squad."
That is not only funny it might also be the hottest line I have ever seen in a movie.
It also features the smartest dog in the world (he does charades), a kick ass song by Cheap Trick and the gorgeous Jennifer Runyon (ghostbusters & Charles in charge, I don't know which credit is more impressive) along with some great race footage and hilarious dialog.
It is also hysterically funny from start to finish.
It also helps if there's a dog on hand like Chuck the Dog.
Nancy Gates as one of the hostages is also good.
And notice also how instinctively subtle is Sinatra in resolutely refusing to resort to a 'character acting'.
The film here is also deprived that all that was schmaltzy in the '50s, the schmaltzy approach of the '50s Â.
He also enjoys the odd bit of existential musing, and is always trying to win back his love, who happens to be a superior.
Woo (who has an unbilled bit as a bartender) has an incredible eye for action, aided by top-notch stuntwork from Kwok, who also plays the aptly-named chief henchman, Mad Dog.
Hard Boiled-a top notch action film from Hong Kong must be hailed as a true role model for all action films.It is one of the best action films of its kind where speedy action mixes freely with dramatic sequences.This is something which creates a feeling in the minds of viewers that they are not being taken for granted as everything that is being depicted is serving some kind of purpose.One of most amazing things about John Woo's film "Lat sau san taam" is that its actions scenes are truly unbelievable.They have been filmed with such an accurate precision that they would easily put to shame some of the most accomplished artists whose every stroke is the result of immense patience and concise concentration.Hard Boiled is also a film with a bizarre twist as we get to see some hardworking cops mixing freely with hardened criminals.Although gang violence is a core issue of the film John Woo has not deceived fans of melodrama by showing how difficult it is to lead a life of a cop.The best part of this film comes in the form of John Woo appearing every now and then Ã  la Alfred Hitchcock.
And we also have some suspense and emotional to along with the action since the hospital scene is very tense with all the babies in danger when Tequila tries to save them all while narrowly dodging bullets.
And also, the American audience probably liked the action because the setting was very different.
And it also works cause it's very unique compared to the same old American films that we get here in America.
The acting also works, Yung-Fat Chow, who is basically the Chinese Schwarzenegger due to his position as an action superstar is absolutely terrific as Tequila.
And his character also delivers one of the most recognizable quotes in film history ("You're full of $h!t, you know that?
And also, I'll remember his character for his face-off with that bad guy with eye patch in the hospital (forgot his name), and then one scene, they realize there are a bunch of innocent patients and they BOTH choose to let them go so they could finish their fight.
It is about why Hong Kong is no longer a decent place to live (from Woo's point of view) and also a tongue-in-cheek celebration of the very violence that his critics so abhorred.
I thought that this was the best actionmovie ever made, until I saw "The Killer"(also directed by John Woo and starring Yun-Fat).
Like his earlier film, `The Killer,' which also starred Yun-Fat, `Hard Boiled' pushes the envelope and will keep you on the edge, right along with the characters in the film, right until the very end.
Director John Woo has a powerful and explosive style that will leave you breathless after watching this extremely violent action flick.The camera is everywhere flying from place to place.And there are people everywhere.All of them firing a gun or two.I have never seen such energy before.The violence in "Hardboiled" is very brutal and well directed.The last half hour of this film,which take place in the hospital is full of inventive action sequences.Chow Yun-Fat is really good as a tough policeman and it's also very nice to see Anthony Wong("Bunman:Human Meat Pies","Dr Lamb","Bullet in the Head")-what a great performance!I like Hong Kong-action films by John Woo.Anyway, if you're tired of Hollywood's action trash,then this one is a must-see.Recommended!
This scene also signifies the violence in Hong Kong back in the days, but highly stylized to create a superb action experience.
Tony Leung is also splendid as the disillusioned undercover cop, who seeks to regain his humanity and reputation.
Instead here we have a production just as interested in characterisation and story whilst also being very, very scary in places, which is helped by the excellent photography and set design.
The main character also doesn't say anything relevant for much of the games.
Additionally the skip-feature is also annoying since it not only skips actions but dialogue as well and the feature should have been implemented a lot better.
It also goes in a couple surprising directions, which are noteworthy.
In "The General", we engage with Johnnie Gray almost immediately -- in "Battling Butler", Alfred remained a cipher for me until the moment when he nervously rehearses "Beatrice Faircatch"'s newspaper advice on making a proposal, with such an earnest air: it's funny, but it's also touching, and it's no coincidence that it is with his subsequent first steps towards standing on his own two feet -- tearing up and throwing aside the useless newspaper column -- that Alfred Butler may finally be said to have progressed beyond a simple one-dimensional character, and the film can really begin.
Buster appreciated the comic possibilities of this characterÂstarting out so helpless allowed plenty of room for dramatic development--and the role also suited his innate gentleness and quiet dignity.
There are also a couple of interesting moments showing both Jagger and Richards composing.
It is pretty graphic with the sex (chiefly on a plane we see some groupies getting it on with some members of the Stones crew, I don't think they were the Stones themselves having the sex, although they were hilariously shaking tambourines and beating drums like some tribal ritual), casual with pornographic detail in the nudity, and the drug use- primarily coke and heroin but also a little grass- is all real and done almost like it's nothing at all.
And yet, there is also another argument, and this even more-so could be said for today, that C***sucker Blues, in revealing what's shocking mixed with the banal dealings of hotel rooms and the fly-on-the-wall style on back-stage, is important in retrospect.
This is pure musical ecstasy, of people going full-throttle to put on a show for the crowds, but also just digging the music so much that it looks like nothing else matters.
While Mick discusses business with Ahmet Ertegum, Keith is in the next room nodding off in the arms of some groupie, who also nods off, leaving them in a tangled mess.
The film has a typical Italian-American guy named JR (Harvey Keitel, also his first film along with Scorsese's) who falls in love with a nice girl (Zina Bethune), and the film shows they're relationship, while JR hangs with his friends, contemplating his life.
There was also a unique observation made in the picture by Frank Sinatra's character, Johnny Baron.
Much of it owes a great deal to the French New Wave films that were popular throughout the 60s, and it also pays homage to the films of John Cassavetes, SHADOWS in particular.
His use of music here is also very interesting, and the songs he chose - most of it consisting of hits from Scorsese's youth - are inspired, to say the least.
The dialogue in the scene is also wonderful, and not at all plot-oriented - arguably because there was no semblance of a plot yet but also because both Keitel and Bethune speak and act naturally, as two people who are simply interested in what the other has to say.
Although he is best known for his collaborations with Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese has also worked to great effect with Harvey Keitel.
The rest are also very good--not a bum performance among them.
In many ways, the film is similar to the exceptional Bogart film, THE DESPERATE HOURS (which is also about a family being held hostage by a gang) as well as the real-life killing of John Kennedy in 1963.
Still the part of the kiss is such a magical cinematic moment and one of the most immortal kisses I've ever seen as well, not only because its achievement of what any fan of (Marilyn) dreamed of (getting a special kiss from her) but also because it was one unforgettable hot kiss in so colorfully sensual close up.
But, there were also a lot of things that seemed to me were supposed to be scary.
It's probably also telling that guns are identified with manly men and only a frightened woman, the mother, opposes them.
Players Club definitely shows that Cube also has the potential to write and direct more great films.
In his tale, where he also allows a role for him, we meet Diana (a powerful and gripping performance by Lisa Raye), a young girl and aspiring journalist with a lot of problems that drive her towards working on a strippers club, to get money and become Diamond.
What is also captivating and remarkable, is how much of him we can see in the film.
This is a fascinating western, and even with the photography of the famous James Wong Howe, it does not have the beautiful scenery of "The Tall Men" or "The Big Trail", also directed by Walsh, the idea was to give it a dark mood.
Teresa Wright also co-stars as the sweet Thorley and Judith Anderson gives a strikingly great performance as 'Ma' Callum.
Mitchum gives one of his best performance and the other actors are also excellent.
She is an underrated actress who must convey complex emotions, which not only contradict one another, but also are sometimes also false.
In his introduction to the video release of JOHNNY GUITAR, Martin Scorsese describes the film as "operatic," and the same term applies to PURSUED, which he also chose for the "Martin Scorsese Presents" collection.
The screenplay is by Niven Busch, who also wrote DUEL IN THE SUN, and what saves PURSUED from descending into camp is not a better story but restrained acting, crisp straightforward direction, gloriously dark cinematography and an ominous yet contained mood that feels like an approaching thunderstorm.
John Rodney is also excellent as Adam, whose envy and gnawing resentment destroy his decency.
PURSUED was also the first film to fully express Mitchum's persona as the eternal outsider, the man fundamentally alone and unable to fit into any community.
I also feel the acting is poor,not really funny characters,well rimmer is a little funny, the cat too,but lister is terrible.
'backwards' is again a brilliant idea, they finally arrive on Earth, after going through a 'time hole', to find time's running backwards, also a new version of Holly is introduced when he performs a head swap operation on himself to become a woman, and a new character joins the crew, a service mechanoid: Kryten and a new mini craft called 'Starbug'   Series IV: This is one of the somewhat weaker series but doesn't mean that it's not a good one.
also we see Ace Rimmer again.
This award winning series also provides the brilliant western episode:'Gunmen of the Apocalypse'   Series VII: This is the weakest series in the show, mostly because of Chris Barrie's (Rimmer) departure from the show, to concentrate on 'Brittas Empire'.
Kryten's famous catch-phrase is also introduced: 'YOU'RE LYING'.
Lister is also infected by a virus which is beaten by the sacrifice if his arm.
The show has it's moments of comedy brilliance but also has it's moments of comedy misses.
The show is also capable of being more intelligent than ever given credit for plus it has moments of impressive drama and wit.
The cops search the building and stores by the railway station to make sure that everything is secure for the president's stopover It also turns out the tip was real; three hired hit men are in town to pay the president a deadly visit.
Also this movie, unlike Ring 2, has a completely new storyline to it, i also thought Yukie Nakama who played Sadako was totally awesome, her acting was just brilliant.
There's also a talking computer called 'Holly', played first by Norman Lovett and then Hattie Hayridge.
It was also a hit in America, and they attempted their own version, from all accounts it was not very good.
First there is Dave Lister, who is a slob but is also a deep down very caring and compassionate guy and to the writers credit, they really make it so that just when you think Dave is just a useless slob they write an episode which reveals more about that character and how he is really a good guy.
Other than making me break out in fits of laughter every other line, it also offers intense entertainment through its action and adventures.
Some of the lines were priceless, but the timing was also important and the team must take full credit for their part.
Johnny is also a very interesting character, he joined up in the foreign legion to see the tropics but, we are told, ended up waiting table at headquarters in Avignon.
The plot is so complex it will demand several viewings.A lot of elements interfere :a serial killer who kills male and female prostitutes ,a transvestite whose father has just been arrested for pedophilia -which might or might not lead his son (Stevenin) whom he abused to lead such a life-; the "sens interdit" (one-way street) gay club where you can see a drag act , the "twin duet" featured in Demy 's "les demoiselles de Rochefort" ;elements of melodrama : the past of the characters recalls those endless novels from the nineteenth century when the characters did not know exactly who their father was;and a love the hero feels for a so-called straight mover (who's also a gigolo) .
Some are also prostitutes and are falling prey to a serial killer who disfigures each of his victims in a vicious way.
The excitement of the suspense drama is heightened by Girod's stunning direction and by the completely convincing acting of Robinson StÃ©venin, but also by the superb characterizations by Richard Bohringer, StÃ©phane Metzger, William Nadylam, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Pellegeay, Ginette Garcin, StÃ©phane De Groodt, and Charlie Dupont.
Jean Hersholt also has a good role as Ed Munn, and a lovely comic turn on the train into the city.
Our little "Rebel" also prances atop a figurative soapbox a couple of times, spouting environmental doomsday pap.
Made for TV movie also featuring Candace Cameron who is repeatedly abducted and probed by space aliens is desperate for help.
Markie Post is reliving nightmares as well and then it comes to her that she also was abducted and probed by these evil space aliens.
Katie also got very bright during her sleep-walking disappearances knowing more about politics in getting her dad Bryan ,Stephen McHattie, who's running for city councilman elected then his entire election staff put together.
She also finds that their somehow connected to what her daughter, Katie, is having now.
But there's also no laughably-bad one, either.
The so called hero melded into the likes of peasants and kings alike, as to become insignificantly overvalued as not to definitely imply the obvious that he would decide the outcome, which he also didn't.
The story is of an Outlander from a different planet who ends up in a ship crash on NORSE territory-planet earth!But the ship has brought along an alien trouble-a species called Moorven/Moorwen.Kainan(James Caviezel) is treated as an Outlander,he has to prove his worth and also tell the vikings of the alien trouble he has bought along.And henceforth the plot flows.
The production design, the sets and the costumes were also very good, but what really impressed me were the flashback sequences of Kainan's life before falling down to Earth.
the time shifts were also guilty of this - leaving the viewer frustrated "get on with it!!!".
There's also an unexpected and quite gratuitous nude scene by Kristin Minter but, hey, who's complaining.
It also shows that the typical "armpit of America" slam I sometimes hear about Bakersfield does not take into account the many affluent citizens who own high-dollar extravagant homes.
I'm also aware of the fact that most extant written history of exploration of the New World was written by English authors so it's probably: bad Spanish explorers, good English explorers.
The lead character also spends the rest of the time walking about like he fried his brain on drugs.
Cabeza de Vaca carried a Christian cross, and his initial captors decided he should be sent to a shaman who also wore a cross, and be put to work tending the needs of a spoiled armless gnome.
The director suggests discreetly, by his choice of filming location in the Nayarit swamps, through simplification and also perhaps by conflation of the Texas Indians with Aztecs, and by using a dash of magical realism, that Cabeza de Vaca's real story is about the tragedy of Mexico's conquest by Spain.
Many comedians have also been reputed or shown to be somewhat different in "real life."
One might wish the film had included a bit more regarding his movie work, but that aside, it captured not only the Gleason character, but also the flavor of the periods in the past as his success grew to its mammoth proportion..
Among the goofs: the wrong cue music (his most-used TV theme was also a hit single for him in 1953, "Melancholy Serenade"; after introducing his variety shows, Jackie'd leave the stage to the strains of "That's A-Plenty", etc.)
I also agree with another reviewer that the comedy monologues were uniformly terrible; one wonders why ANY of the audiences shown were laughing at all (except during the "Honeymooners" sequences).
Camera wise, it also feel like a series.
Zenon's parents, who were also critical to the plot of Z1, are not even mentioned.
The issue of the character Bronley also completely defeats me.
Two generations fighting against each other, and also two visions of the world.
He also dismisses the men who hired him because immediately as the President dies he'll be replaced by the Vice President.
Within nine years, after he made his best film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (also dealing with political assassination), Sinatra saw his former friend President John Kennedy murdered.
But also a wanting side that wants to be forgiven and accepted and most importantly loved for her uncontrollable actions.
So not only do you have to be filthy rich to even have a chance of appearing on the show, you also need to have a famous singer or sport star for a parent.
MTV is also sending out the wrong messages with this programme.
It's also extremely difficult to know whether MTV deliberately made a show which is a complete shower of trash or whether this really is the insult to humanity it appears to be.
The show is about spoiled kids who get whatever they want, but wait-not only do they show the good parts of being a total spoiled brat, they also show so-called "drama" in planning the perfect sweet sixteen party.
There is also alot of documentary stuff used for this movie, that are maybe the most bad parts of the movie, the storyline is alot like "jaws".
Fortunately, we've also got the incomparable Vic Morrow on board hamming it up with his customary deliciously eye-rolling rip-snorting gusto as a crusty, macho, rough'n'tumble Robert Shawesque old sea salt fisherman sporting Vic's trademark furry mustache and a simply sidesplitting "won't fool you for a second" overripe Scottish accent ("I've been killin' sharks for most of my life!").
Antonio Margheriti's KILLER FISH (1979; which is one I'd also love to get a second opinion of after all these years).
Special mention must also go to the shark itself in this which whilst not as menacing as Bruce from the aforementioned Hollywood blockbuster, is nonetheless a very impressive rendition considering the tiny budget of the film.
And like I said, even thought the initial thirty minutes is also mimicking Spielberg's film, it did have a kind of respectful sweetness and was kind of fun.
There is also alot of documentary stuff used for this movie, that are maybe the most bad parts of the movie, the storyline is alot like "jaws".
i was also surprised when i read that it was released as Jaws 3 in some countries when it hit the theaters, well it is better than Jaws pt 3 and 4. one thing that i like with this movie (spoiler warning) is the ending - right about after the sharks death - when they all get safety on land just before the end text is coming and the sad music is appears - it reflects sorrow, evil and even madness, and the survivors gets into the car - it is a great scene probably the best in the entire movie (according to me).
the movie also contains crappy and dumb scenes, but hey - doesn't every classic cult flicks do ?.
Interestingly, both films also reveal that the filmmakers are not American due to unrealistic depictions of American celebrations.
I was also expecting more gore and nudity but director Enzo G. Castellari obviously opted to make his film a serious-minded and ambitious horror adventure (unlike the Mexian "Tiger Shark" by Rene Cordoba).
During his stay out the house, he will soon come to realize not only that his passion was a mere delusion, but will also discover the emptiness of many things that are generally considered enjoyable such as food and sex.
(That goes for the infamous Pink Flamingoes regarding grossness also).
I was also concerned that the movie was in Black and White.
Years later, I've seen many, many such films, but SS still holds a very special place in my heart, simply because not only is the film truly demented, but it's also very well done, which is rare for an exploitation film.
Is he consigned to a dreadful fate or does he also not really feel in any real danger?
Panos Thanassoulis is good also as the title character, but he remains silent for most of the film and never gets a change to fully impress.
The setting is as strange as you can get; also the costumes of the characters.
The hard core sex scenes are somehow disgusting but great; and also are asked for by the movie's plot.
Apart from maintaining their incestuous lesbian relationship, the women now also compete for the sexual interest of their male guest, and it doesn't take too long before ambiguous conspiracies are thought up.
But apart from the strong sex, "Singapore Sling" also contains other repulsive and unusual viewing material, most notably the ladies' nauseating eating rituals.
There's also a delicious rope bodage menage a trois to boot.
Singapore Sling is one of the strangest flicks I have ever seen, and also one of the most well made.
"Singapore Sling" by Nikos Nikolaidis is easily one of the most demented horror films ever made.This extremely weird piece of film-noir is loaded with erotic regurgitation,cannibalism,incest,lesbianism,bondage,bizarre sex and sadistic violence.The relationship between the mother and her daughter is extremely bizarre to say the least.The acting is absolutely awesome and the performances are incredibly real.The atmosphere is simply insane and wonderfully nightmarish.There is also a good amount of sickening violence and gore including the most nerve-wracking dinner sequence I have ever seen.
They also are real "backwoods" and that's scary in itself.
I also want to dispute a reviewer from UK who mentioned that this movie is much more Chinese than "Crouching Tiger" which is too westernized.
The DVD quality from Tai Seng is abysmal which probably also contributes to my discontent.
It was also interesting to see 1970's Taiwanese hero actor Tien Peng (often billed as "Roc" Tien) as a handsome official of intermediate strength and skill working for the evil Eastern Chamber people.
It's also astounding to see Hu reach in the same epic manner this conclusion, more than a decade before the venerable Kurosawa's "old man's lament" in "Ran".
The development of genres is also very interesting, with the film starting out as a kind of ghost story and becoming a thriller with artistic and spiritual elements.
This is also helped by the near perfect choreography.
The pacing of the film is also perfect, allowing the wonderful characterisation of the main player to develop fully.
Its panoramic nature sequences have not only esthetic value, but are also symbolically relevant.
In the end, I found "Lucia y el Sexo" an excessively erotic film, with a confused screenplay, but also very intriguing.
The director also seems to be afraid of light.
I also didn't feel that the game was as good of a multiplayer experience, lessening it's replayablity.
I also felt that the whole idea of researching abilities really slows the game down and because the AI opponent always start with a big head start you spend a lot of time waiting for research to be done to be able to match you AI opponent.
At all points of the movie, the characters of Lorenzo's fiction interact with and exist as real human beings; we see their lives change as Lorenzo types away at his computer, but they are also free agents.
The book that conceived Luna also made Lucia fall in love with Lorenzo, the shot of their first union cuts into Luna's birth, they both dropped into a hole together, and at the end, when Elena tells Lucia that she is a gift to the earth, she looks as happy as she would if she got back her lost child.
The dog that killed Luna also features in a shot on a television screen at the coffeeshop where Lucia picks Lorenzo up.
The game also has multiplayer, and StarCraft also excels here.
The game also has a magnificent story(and well-told(partially through rather marvelous voice-acting, and some through beautifully animated video sequences), complete with three perspectives, and well-written characters).
The multi-player is also reliable, with no errors during play.
It was ok, but somehow lacked the addictiveness for me (it also didn't help that it was nearly impossible to cheat!).
Yeah, totally duped... You know Dimension Extreme has given us all some really great stuff, but they have also given us some really, really, REALLY bad stuff - Steep Trap falls into the latter.
NOthing to do with the movie and technically there is NO steel trap so inaccurate title also.
I also recommend 'The Band's Visit' with again Ronit because this had to be an embarrassment to everyone who worked on this production.
Well, it's watchable, but it's also a movie that really has nothing going for it at all.
However, next to this movie Kurosawa made a breathtaking "Yoidore Tenshi", whose scene is also laid in late 1940's poor Japan.
"One Wonderful Sunday" reminded me of "The Bicycle Thief", De Sica's powerful portrait of post-war Rome, also mounted on a deceptively simple vehicle - a man's desperate search for his stolen bicycle.
Yamaguchi also does a good job of creating some atmosphere, both in the green tinted elevator scenes and the interwoven interrogation scene that makes use of a dark blue color palette.
There also happens to be a little explosion, a little explosion caused by the cigarette that Luchino dropped when being pursued by surveillance for having an illegal substance, which doesn't particularly mix well with some fuel that got spilled.
There's also the elevator operator, a young lady in uniform who has been "trained to deal with adverse situations".
However there are also floors you don't want the elevator to stop at.
There's also Noize and Drum & Bass riffs that fit in well too during some of the more gruesome scenes.
It also engages in "guilt by association".
It also presents it as a "blue state/red state" issue.
And this film is more about criticizing and insulting those who believe in ID itself than it is about criticizing those who not only believe in ID but also believe that it should be taught in science classes.
It also explains a little about the legal and political history of the recent ID-in-schools phenomenon, and that's interesting stuff.
At the very least, it should have reserved its insults and criticisms for those who not only believe in ID but who are also of the crazy view that ID ought to be taught in our science classes.
There was also a discussion panel afterward that included a number of scholars and critics and politicians.
I wish the film had also shown the venality and pervasive corruption of the bible thumpers revealed in their mismanagement of and campaigns for the Kansas State Board of Education, but that complexity would have been harder to explain and would have taken much longer.
The anti-evolutionists also seem to be cohesive, highly organized, and well funded.
I also love movies, so when a movie about Science comes along, I will see it.
Hannah Taylor Gordon also gives a great performance and I think she will become a great actress.
Jakob the Liar is an underrated movie.I just want to say that before anything else in my review.The movie tells about Jakob Heym, excellently played by Robin Williams.Jakob is a Jewish shop keeper living in Polish ghetto in 1944.He overhears a German radio broadcast about Russian troop movements.When he shares the information with a friend a rumor about a secret radio starts spreading in the ghetto.Jakob starts making up stories to the ghetto inhabitants he has heard from his 'secret radio'.This way he brings hope to the people who are losing it.Peter Kassovitz' Jakob the Liar (1999) hasn't got as much credit it would have deserved.It's a movie about an important matter.It combines comedy and tragedy in a great way.It has a brilliant cast.Robin Williams is just amazing.This actor, who turns 55 today (congratulations) has a great ability to act both comic and dramatic roles.He is a great man and a great actor.The young Hannah Taylor- Gordon is excellent playing Lina Kronstein, the Jewish girl Jakob is hiding.She was amazing also playing Anne Frank a couple years later.I hope we'll be hearing a lot from her in the future.Then there are also these greats; Bob Balaban (Kowalsky), Alan Arkin (Max Frankfurter), Michael Jeter (Avron), Liev Schreiber (Mischa the Prizefighter), director's son Mathieu Kassovitz (Herchel) and lots of others.This is a movie that can make you laugh and it is a movie that can make you cry.It shows all these poor people living under the horrors of war, under the circumstances you can not justify.
Meanwhile, Jakob is also hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from a camp transport.
Everything about JAKOB THE LIAR is perfect, it's a very realistic down to earth story, acting and script are also brilliant...not to mention Edward Shearmur's really heartwarming scoundtrack, what a pity it has not been released.
Meanwhile Jakob has taken in a little Jewish girl who has escaped form a train heading to the gas "showers" and must also keep hidden from the Germans.
And i like how hey put some comedy into it also but not to much.
And also how long he was going to go with the lie of him having a radio.And i just recommend this movie to teens or teachers who are looking for a good World War 2 movie.
Williams (also executive producer) did a fine job as Heym.
There has to be a reason this film has been not only invited to show at festivals across the country, but that it has also been winning awards at several of them.
The film also manages to convey a significant existential quality to the main characters that is very nuanced and requires contemplation.
The social overtones of this film are also outstanding and a fine addition to the series.
It is also one of the rare indies that doesn't try to overcompensate for it's low budget-ness with overzealous shaky-cam blocking.
It also features one of the single greatest sex scenes ever in cinematic history (without any nudity at all!
It is also one of the rare indies that doesn't try to overcompensate for it's low budget-ness with overzealous shaky-cam blocking.
She's oblivious to the fact that his, obvious to us, adoration of her must also be enhanced by the fresh odor of sex that trails her to the couch.
The dinner table scene somehow reminds me of writer-director Mina Shum's 1994 "Double Happiness," which included Chinese-Canadian family dinner scenes with Sandra Oh in the lead; also brings to mind director Wayne Wang's 1985 "Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart."
Secrets and lies - yes there are: the relationship between Michael the quiet mechanic who reads (also the landlord) upstairs and Lori the pretty actress neighbor & friend downstairs; the relationship of Lori and Justin (her bed fellow and live-in boyfriend); the mÃ©nage Ã  trois between Michael, Lori and Justin; the relationship of Michael and Darcy the stranger; the relationship between the two women - Lori and Darcy (or Charlotte sometimes); the other triangle of Michael, Darcy and Lori, and not to miss the Darcy and Justin moments.
There's also w-d Alan Jacob's 1994 down to earth fairytale of a relationship: "Nina Takes a Lover" with Laura San Giacomo and Paul Rhys.
We also discover that things aren't quite what they seem.
It's also an apportunity for audiences to see some fresh young talent in a film with something on it's mind
The place one will remember for a long time: where the tidal flow made by full moons is also the flow of our soul, where we can see happiness as an island -or rather, a raft- in the midst of a sea of indiference, where we can find LucÃ­a's loving and admiring eyes and smile, and live in them forever.  
The focus was also on the soundtrack rather than dancing, so this is a much more thoughtful and full-bodied presentation of the score.
Clearly the movie review I heard was also a little confused!
I also had the cast album.
it's possible- "tart" (also starring Dominique Swain) was worse, but not by much.
The colors in the film are also unique in that I'm sure they were chosen so that your eyes would not wear out because of so much life you see.
If you don't mind seeing some, you may say, awkward sex scenes, and you're looking for a really great plot, with great dialogs full of symbolisms, and also excellent photography, then you're just gonna love this one.
I also thought Dominique Swain was pretty good in her lead role... but the producer, Nicholas Loeb, was putridly pathetic.
He also handled love and memories as important drives of people.
Medem also likes to use nature to symbolize stages and feelings in his character's lives.
It's very strong from the beginning, but besides it's explicitness Medem also deals with it very sensitively.
I was also happy to see that the UK-version of the video was uncut, showing the male organs.
Very refreshing that men are also portrayed vulnerably in a movie.
That was functionable in the story as the characters saturate themselves in it, leading to problems, but somehow to me it also felt unbalanced.
It is also disconnected from what is shown, so it's very hard to know who says what, and who belongs to which group.
And another problem that is also tied to the script is the fact that the movie is overly long.
Judels also voiced the horrid Stromboli and that crook Coachman in Disney's Pinocchio.
I never really understood why long Laurel & Hardy movies always also had a serious subplot-line it, which always involved serious characters played by actors why play their roles in a non-comical way.
You will also see that a lot of the people in the American version are in the British version, and I enjoy that a lot, but I also get to see a lot of the talented and funny British comedians, too, so that is also great.
How on earth did they round up this whole cast also and Busey's a riot!
The entire film was well shot, the casting was great and it was fun seeing all the bad guys coming altogether in this, especially Tom Sizemore, who also rips it up!
What call my attention the most is that, I have the feeling that Medem tried to get away from his past with this story but ended up coming back to it, which is a great thing in the sense that the poetry and melancholy that is always present in his movies, are also part of this one.
I would also say yes, the very first moment she would come near me.  
They also briefly cover his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade or so.
One of the most memorable of short films, UN CHANT D'AMOUR is also one of the most controversial.
Hysterically funny of course, but also incredibly insightful.
It features lots of 'what-if' themes and the story is being rewritten in the characters mind, also with lots of symbolism, mainly with the moon and the water.
He also covers completely unrelated topics such as dogs, drugs, family life, boxing, and sex... all the while being hysterically funny.
Rani was also good in her side role.
Aim was also not clear on his part.
There are a very few sensitive women who are also, sensible.
So it wasn't a complete surprise to learn that Visconti made a film titled "Le Notti Bianche" which was also based on the same short story.
Zohra Sehgal as an old lady who helps Raj in this new town is also a strong pillar to hold this movie in terms of acting and appearance.
He is in the meta-story, but also places himself in threads in the other stories that come from his imagination.
Do they also complain about the presence of aliens in Alien?
Basically, Sorimachi and Lau play two assassins who vie for the title of Number 1 and also the attentions of a girl (Lin).
The ending was also slighlty disapointing taking the attention of the film away from the assassins to Simon yam.
Though the assassin characters seem almost invincible, unlike most John Woo films they also have unique personalities and are likable.
While it's billed as a film about two hitmen--one vying for recognition, the other for anonymity--it also peers into the lives of the supporting characters.
It is in CGI, it is very funny and it is also one of the hardest (maybe the hardest).
While they stalk and spy on each other, they are also linked by Miss Chin, played by the gorgeous Kelly Lin.
Andy Lau plays Tok, a flamboyant leather clad professional killer who not only takes pride in his work but also looks to put himself in the spotlight with every kill he makes.
There's more depth here than in an average film of its ilk, but there's also a delightful sense of glee in the action pieces that make you think that those involved thankfully weren't taking it completely seriously.
It is also an indictment of the international news media for accepting the easy answers and official stories and not digging deeper for the truth.
The film also examines the role of foreign peace-keeping forces in the country and argues that the conflict was exacerbated by international power politics.
There are also spoofs of some famous people of the time as well, but the film is a real fun treat that the little ones can enjoy again and again.
The soundtrack is also all original and highly creative.
It also shows great sportsmanship, Love, friendship, honour, diversity of countries, - oh just go get this movie!
Squid in the Bobsled, Otter for the swimming, Frog for the high jump, Bull in the boxing etc etc etc) but also because of the terrific soundtrack and songs by Graham Gouldman of 10CC.
This is recommended to fans of animation firstly, also to lovers of track and field events (they're all there) and to any fans of the previously mentioned artists (Crystal, Shearer, Gouldman).
The story takes place in the Nevada desertÂ Frank Bolger is a conspicuous man in the community who also happens to run a drug-smuggling ring on the sideÂ The local sheriff is in on it, acting as his hit man.
For '70's aficionados, there's also a cameo by Howard Cosell... *1/2 from ****
Vincent's furry companion "Harry" (a tiger) also makes the trip.
She's also got a jealous suitor in Danny Goldman.
Yes, there's also a cute plot about a black football/baseball/basketball coach (John Amos) who travels to Africa on safari with his hopelessly stupid assistant (Tim Conway).
I was lucky enough to be able to see part of "Athlete" being made at my college in Stockton, California in 1972.I also got to meet Jan-Michael Vincent, John Amos and Tim Conway.I also had a confrontation with the tiger.
To top it off, John Amos and Tim Conway also made a surprise visit to my parents, cousin, and Aunt's restaurant also located in Stockton, California.
Seeing a gold mine and wins with Nanu as his athlete on campus, Coach Archer lures him to their university, where Nanu indeed excels in sports, but also feels homesick.
I also missed the amusement park and I am sure there were quite a few funny moments and puzzles to be had there.
The dialog delivery was also adequate, but the dialog itself was trite, contrived, and slapstick in its execution.
Stan is also a bit of a heckler, but decent.
It seems like they also took a bit of the plot from 'TICKS' by having the spider implant an egg into the body of the dying astronaut which results in having a 'mutated' version of the spider escaping from his body.
All the supporting roles are also outstanding.
The monster also grows bigger and bigger from one generation to the next, so at the finale we get a house-sized giant spider going on GODZILLA rampage on a college campus and through the city.
There's also a sequel.
The CGI spider also comes across very well, and I was hugely impressed with the finale, where I couldn't believe so much had been achieved on such a low budget.
The pacing is fine; There is enough action to keep the viewer at least semi-entertained, assuming they can appreciate other aspects of the film also (I'm not a big fan of "irrational abominable creature vs. bunch of dumb people" films).
There is also some stuff about the dress affecting different people in different ways, depending of their existing strength of character and their psychology etc.
There is also a lame twist ending that everyone will see coming from miles away.
The film is also bereft of the sort of shock value that one would need to swallow the tall tale being presented at face value.
Sunshine is my all time favorite movie in the entire world.I also have been looking for The Sunshine Years TV Series that aired as Sunshine for half a season.
I've also been searching for this movie, if anyone knows how or where to get it, please let me know.
I have also been looking for the movie "Sunshine" for years.
I was reminded of the movie each time I listened to John Denver song (he also happens to be my favorite singer)and also could remember that the young dark haired lady that was dying of cancer.
I also learned that cats can sense death - a useful fact I guess.
It was a real love story and definitely a tearjerker but it also showed a mother's true love for her daughter.
It was unlike any other cop show I'd ever seen, in that it captured not just the exciting car chases and gunfights, tense moments and drama, but also the average day-to-day calls that a police officer might receive.
It's hard to believe that 10+ years have elapsed since the show ended....  We love(d) various other police shows such as Homicide and we're also devoted viewers of Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, but *nothing* can compare to High Incident.
We've remarked that not only was the acting superb (and very *natural*, which was rather amazing when considering that many of the actors were relative "unknowns" at that time), but also the *action*; it's like we're literally right there with the officers.
The fictional persona of the Tough Talking', Ass Kickin', Rough and Tumble Street Copper is also propagated by our popular literature, film, Radio and Television.
His holding the rank of Sergeant also places him in that small, select circle of people who truly run the operations on the street.
NOTE: ** The series also boasted of having Charles Haid on board.
They didn't hire a crew to come in and apply a dozen coats of paint and polish it to a glass-like shine -- while that result is appealing and good, there is also merit in an artwork that is deemed "finished" by the artist but for which the audience knows it could be done differently.
He's perfectly adequate in the scenes showing Holmes as a cerebral "armchair detective" but utterly wrong for the neurotic man of action Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also intended Holmes to be.
Andrews is known for his acting in such films as Independence Day, American Histoy X, Cabin Fever and his own Touch me in the Morning, but also makes his own unfortunately rarely seen unique films.
Period Piece is not only directed by him, but he also produced it, wrote it, scripted it, photographed it, acted in it, edited it and composed and recorded the musical score for it.
Blythe Danner and Edward Herrman are also two of my favorite actors.
All in all, I would recommend this movie (and also the book).
He also goes to America.
The scene when Irfan is standing in tower and sees airplane is also good.
The acting by all is very good, the newcomer who played the role of doctor has also given a very natural acting too.
I also can't believe you're comparing Queen; one of the most contributing rock bands to the Spice Girls; talentless, daddy-did-not-love-me, girl powered, children!
I have to say that I did not expect much from the movie, but I also didn't expect anything this bad.
The directing is also done with a steady hand from director Martin Asphaug.
There are also two racial stereotypes: a young Chinese man and that frantic woman from "Gone With the Wind," Hattie MacDonald.
It turns out that it was his twin brother, also named Arthur Perry, who was there impersonating him the real Arthur Perry, and trying to cash in, by selling out Houghlands secret by getting an offer he couldn't refuse $100,000.00.
It turns out that not only is he the one who helped Houghland in his new TV invention but is also a agent for what looks like the FBI and breaks the case wide open.
It is also the kind of movie where characters talk about how important the item they are transporting is, yet they haul it around on an open flatbed.
This is the first movie which is Rayesque to the core.One of his most obvious permanent feature really appears for the first time: the search for a father.The relationship Bogart/Derek is intense (after the death of the biological one)and predates those of "Run for cover" (John Derek again playing opposite Cagney) and "Rebel without a cause " (Remember Plato to Jim and Judy: "I wish you could be my parents" )But I could also mention the Mitchum/Kennedy relationship in " lusty men" or even Heston and the Chinese girl in "55 days at Peking" .Or James Mason and his (biological this time) in "bigger than life".Emma's character predates The Rayesque young girl ,the one you meet again in "they live by night" (note how Allene Roberts resembles Cathy O'Donnell).Allene Roberts' beaming face and her hope against hope are the only ray of light in a dark tragical story.
Most of his hardship is overseen by attorney Andrew Morton (Humphrey Bogart, the only lead actor who gives his role at least some intrigue and is therefore the only one who doesn't get the nickname treatment from yours truly), also from the wrong side of the tracks.
However, it's also an interesting film from a number of standpoints, with several important compensations critics tend to overlook.
Too bad also that the courtroom scenes are prolonged (probably to accommodate Bogart's starring role), since they amount to another key flaw.
They're also atmospheric and colorful.
Note also some of the subtler miscellaneous touches, such as the flame that flares up from the restaurant tray the moment Derek pledges to reform-- an ominous portent; or the ugly hot water tank that dominates the visuals of the young couple's cold-water flat where Emma finds a home but Nick only finds desolation.
There's also the film's central irony-- that the shrill, cruel-faced DA (George Mc Ready, with an enhanced scar) in fact wins the courtroom battle and Bogart loses.
Very emotional and powerful ending sequence where Andrew gives his closing argument not just about his client's Nick Romono tormented and troubled past,as he pleads for the jury to spare his life, but also for the future.
I also appreciated character actor Vince Barnett's (The Killers) portrayal as the less than reliable bartender.
As for Fisk/Kingpin being bald, frankly no one could actually look like the giant bald guy portrayed in the comics, also don't remember anyone commenting about gene hackman playing Lex Luther in the superman movies (he is revealed to be wearing a toupee at the end of one movie)
One of nurses working for Wilson Fisk also know as the Kingpin is told to kill her and that night when she goes to Daredevil shows up and stops her.
He also wants David Banner killed so in prison a sharp object is passed to his cell where the prisoner has to kill him but suddenly he's told that he needs to see someone.
He then asks David to help him find Elley and stop Wilsom Fisk, he's given a possible location by the Captain and goes their where he finds Ellie but also gets ambushed by Kingpin's men and gets beaten up buy suddenly David changes into the Hulk and beats them, then Daredevil sees what happens to David.
Not a great episode but also one well worth seeing.
He also has the disadvantage of two things.
He is also living in the past.
Psychologically, the characters are also well thought-out.
I also loved this confrontation between the accusing Couzins claiming Ellis was perhaps behind a conspiracy to keep them in the shelter..Jaeckel and Cooper produce some fireworks.
The music and camera-work are also very effective and there are excellent supportive roles for Hoyt Axton ("Gremlins"), Suzanne Snyder ("Killer Klowns from Outer Space") and Leslie Wing ("the Dungeonmaster").
Having taken their backing tracks with them, the musicians were able to not only collaborate on 1 Giant Leap songs, but also to hear the sounds previous collaborators had been inspired to lay down.
His photos and designs have also adorned the covers of Skinny's Failure and Faithless' Sunday 8pm.
I have also known many people like Margaret (Parker Posey) - people who need to be seen and heard at all times.
Smaller roles by actors such as Jamie Kennedy, Bob Balaban (Posey's costar in "Waiting For Guffman"), and David James Elliot are also performed with perfection.
Yeah, I get that it's supposed to be a parody of earlier television variety shows, but parodies are also supposed to be funny.
Basil Rathbone, later to play Sherlock Holmes in films of the 1940's, resplendent in a red and gold surcoat, plays Robin Hood's worthy adversary, & he was also adept at fencing in RL.
With circumcision being increasingly touted as a way to prevent HIV transmission, it's useful to be reminded that it can also facilitate it.
Sevigny is a novice that sees her mission as more than saving souls; she also tries to save lives.
The cinematography in the film was incredible, and the music was also excellent.
Sister Clara believes their mission is also to help the locals and she self-sacrifices her dignity to get financial support for the community.
At times, I found it inappropriate for the subject, but perhaps that is also the message: we can laugh despite the hardships.
This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time - but also one of the most harrowing and thought provoking.
From Africa we go to rural China where Jin Ping (Lucy Liu, speaking Mandarin only) is the very pregnant force who runs an underground blood bank which while serving the donors with some cash also contaminates the population with HIV virus (we discover that Jin Ling is HIV positive, carrying a baby at risk, and supporting her HIV husband).
3 NEEDLES' cinematographer Tom Harting deserves awards for the sheer magnificence of his images he captures on film, not only the majestic vistas of Africa and China but also the intimate moments such as Jin Ping's birthing.
(Amazingly, the renowned Dr. David Ho was also present at the screening, which added another hopeful touch: HIV/AIDS progress is being made but, as the film shows, funding and education are still lacking in poor countries, and attitudes are often still messed up in rich ones.)
Just for spice, add a lesbian madam named Cristina (Bibi Andersen) who also has Max's number; a coterie of drag queens so over-the-top they make the girls from PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT seem downright genteel; sex that just avoids becoming triple X-rated porn, prodigious drug use, more sex and a murder investigation that will turn everyone's lives even more topsy-turvy...if that's possible.
For one thing they drag it out too long it makes the movie boring and there is also no good plot it has been way over dune in the past.
They also spent way too much time talking.
He also out acts his poor supporting cast.
All of this happens in this movie but there is also a rather unnecessary subplot involving a custody battle.
Mykelti Williamson also became well known, first in Midnight Caller and then as the shrimp connoisseur Bubba in Forrest Gump.
There is also a small role for SNL'er and 3rd Rock from the Sun star, Jan Hooks as the uptight new wife of Goldie's ex.
The film is also plagued by having that very annoying 80's music sound.
It is also fun to see Nipsey Russell although they don't give him enough to do.
Incredibly large actor Thad Thacker is also fun and the only interesting player on the whole team.
The film also launched the movie careers of ex-Cheers actor, Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes and rapper, LL Cool J.
There's also a lot of unfunny 'fart humor' on display, but thankfully not from Goldie's character.
I also couldn't help but notice a heavy stylistic influence from Woody Allen of all people here (editing and music style, but done clumsily) which didn't fit at all.
When I see a film by Christopher Munch, I think (as I also do after movies by Abel Ferrara or Claire Denis), "This is what celluloid is for."
But surprisingly, it's not bleak the way you might expect, because Munch also shows us characters whose lives contain riches that they do not see themselves.
The film was shot by Rob Sweeney, who also shot Munch's previous film, "The Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day," one of the most beautifully photographed films I've seen in the last decade.
Surprisingly enough, the film is nearly evenly balanced by the representation on the conservative side, as interviews are also conducted with several "leading lights of the right", which include "Miss Manners" and Alan Keyes (who frankly made me want to punch him out every time he came on-screen.)
Or, of course, Lenny Bruce, who also had a fight that he ended up losing miserably, however much he paved the way for everyone else in his field.
There's also a good segment done on the f word in politics and religion, even in poetry (I'll have to look through Ulysses now to see where it's at).
The acting is extremely under par, the story done 100 times before with much better results, and the effects were lacking which also describes the story.
And i like low budget horror movies, and many of them also has poor plots and few sense, but like this.... this is not a low budget film, and it seems that a dead-line was made and the movie makers just rushed to do one, whatever it was.
I for one am also happy that Ghost stories are making a comeback, and I would much sooner jump in my chair a few times than cringe or hide my eyes or be disgusted by the graphic slasher films also doing the rounds.
I have also just seen The Marsh at London's Frightfest and I and my friends were wholly unimpressed.
It feels like another film in a long line of by-the-numbers supernatural thrillers that have come out of Hollywood in the last five years such as Stir of Echoes, Hide and Seek, Secret Window, The Sixth Sense, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Skeleton Key, The Mothman Prophecies, Bless the Child, The Forgotten, The Others etc, etc (Some of these films are quite good, but you get my point)   I have become very bored of creepy houses (this one was particularly un-imaginative) creepy cornfields, creepy little girls in night dresses, creepy dolls and scarecrows, creepy children's drawings, creepy children's songs, windows blowing open in gusts of wind etc, etc   It is also frustrating when EVERYTHING vaguely frightening is accompanied by a thunderous drum beat, even things like a shot of a child's teddy bear hitting the floor during a flashback!
i found this look inside the life of one woman in the adult film business interesting.for whatever reason,she allowed a camera crew to to follow her around,not just while working but also during her personal life.she seemed very candid and opened her self up.and allowed herself to be very vulnerable.or at least it appears that way.but it's clear she's also a tragic figure.regardless,the film is an entertaining piece and somewhat revealing.you see someone as a human being,and not just as a sex object.as interesting as the film is,there are no real revelations.and,when you get right down to it,it's still a sad subject.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 7/10
Some of the most poignant scenes involve SV visiting her mother and having an honest talk about her settling down (both of them end up teary), visiting a hypnotist to try to improve her self-esteem, talking about her on-again, off-again relationship with her boyfriend (also in the industry), leaving an Adult Entertainment Awards ceremony by herself, with no award, in the dress she was so excitied about wearing earlier that day, and petting her cat, saying since she doesn't have a special man in her life, there's always her cat for affection.
)and also talking and being friends with a few women in the industry, I can say the movie presents a very realistic portrait.
If this isn't enough to make you squeamish, they also serve up a liposuction and an operation to give Stacey come-hither lips.
The relationship between Neil Morrisey's and Rachel Weisz's characters sparkles because however quirkily their attraction as lovers fleet on and subsides off at different times, one gets the feeling that Weisz is partly a fantasy (there are storyline elements that also drop hints of this) for Morrisey's pint chugging bloke (not too unlike the concept in Fever Pitch) and that his and the nation's fantasy of success for their Football team mirrors their relationship.
He busts up all of her potential romances, but he's also got an ulterior motive.
This may diminish the big laugh somewhat, but it also demonstrates how Fields's frank humor was ahead of its time, forcing him to truly fight for his best ideas to be permitted once in a while, unlike today when comics can pretty much get away with anything.
A superb grotesque, Duggan was also memorable in the underrated A Damsel in Distress as one of the madrigal singers.
If anything, this film is a must-see for two of W.C. Field's scenes: 1) Fields' first meeting with Baby Le Roy (who also appears in It's a Gift), which is easily one of the best comedy scenes in the movies, and 2) Fields' juggling routine, for which he was very famous when he was a vaudevillian, justly so.
It also contains one of the oddest-named characters in any movie, Cleopatra Pepperday, played wonderfully by Jan Duggan.
There is also a fascinating little cultural artifact within the movie -- a production of The Drunkard, a 19th century hit, no doubt popular when William Claude was a mere lad.
Yet somehow, with the advantage of hindsight, Fields was able to turn these unhappy memories into great comedy, comedy that also serves as something of a history lesson-- albeit a pleasant one --for viewers interested in the early days of the American stage.
In desperate need of cash, McGonigle is compelled to woo a local wealthy widow who aspires to the stage, the magnificently named Cleopatra Pepperday (played with appropriate magnificence by Jan Duggan), while in the meantime his daughter is wooed by a college boy who also dreams of performing.
Fields' reactions to both of these characters are priceless, but it's also worth pointing out that in this instance the notoriously paranoid, cantankerous W.C. Fields, who was said to be deeply jealous of other comedians, generously shared the spotlight with not one but two fellow players and permitted each to temporarily steal the spotlight, to the ultimate benefit of the project.
It was Cunningham who reworked and expanded Fields' original script into the seamless story it became, and who chose to interpolate the sequences from "The Drunkard"; he also persuaded Fields to dust off his old juggling act for the finale.
There is also a racist joke when Carolyn's maid (about the only role open to black actresses in the thirties) remarks that black men are too idle to support themselves and prefer to live off their wives.
Seems to be a remake of "Ten Cents a Dance" from 1931, which also starred B. Stanwyck.
It does bring the Ugly American fish-out-of-water aspect to the table and also revels in the manner in which the locals are able to accept what is useful about the foreigner and let the rest slide.
The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, including Patrick Knowles as the dashing Will Scarlett, Alan Hale as the burly Little John and Eugene Palette as the godly Friar Tuck are also what audiences imagined they would be.
Several questions raised about each other's culture can also start healthy debates.
It is also quite remarkable that both authors are not Indian: asking my Mumbai-native friends for a reality check, they only confirmed the movie did indeed capture a good realistic snapshot of what India is like.
It was also Selected for Registry by the National Film Preservation Board (1995).
The local people that Todd deals with on a daily basis also find they need to adjust to Todd's American way of running a call center.
Possibly the greatest (and most celebrated) of swashbucklers, it's also the best Robin Hood film (once again improving on Douglas Fairbanks' already impressive Silent version) and Errol Flynn's finest hour: delightful script (not only providing several great lines for the actors to sink their teeth into - Claude Rains' Prince John in particular - but it's put in the service of a plot which remains absorbing despite its over-familiarity), beautiful three-color cinematography (by no less than three top-notch cameramen!)
), drama and romance (Flynn and Olivia De Havilland's Maid Marian not only are cinema's last word on this famous fictional couple, but their pairing here also proved to be the highpoint of their lengthy on-screen collaboration which stretched to 8 films); not forgetting, of course, countless unforgettable and stirring action scenes: the ambush in Sherwood Forest, the contest for the Golden Arrow, Robin's escape from the gallows, the final storming of the castle (highlighted by one of the best-remembered duels ever to grace the silver screen between Flynn and Basil Rathbone's Guy of Gisbourne), etc.
Interestingly, three actors - Rathbone, Eugene Palette and Montagu Love - would go on to co-star together again in another equally renowned swashbuckler, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940; which I also just rewatched): Love, then, can be seen as well in yet one more similar film - the definitive 1937 version of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (which is forthcoming on DVD from Warners as part of a "Literary Classics Collection" and coupled with its inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake); incidentally, all of these classics virtually constitute the three top titles in the entire swashbuckling genre!
In the end, this has certainly made me want to pick up the "Errol Flynn Signature Collection" (also featuring a documentary on the notorious star) a.s.a.p.
Needless to say, there have been scores of films about this popular character and, going by the IMDb, apart from the afore-mentioned 1922 Douglas Fairbanks ROBIN HOOD, I've also watched the following: THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE MEN (1952; a live-action Walt Disney version), SWORD OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1960; a Hammer Films effort directed by Terence Fisher and co-starring Peter Cushing as the Sheriff of Nottingham!
The writing for these characters also needs to mentioned as it is of such a quality standard.
We are also allowed to venture much more into the character of Perry White, whose portrayal by Lane Smith is so witty, funny, all knowing and brilliant.
And the fact that the story's of the episodes are simply fun also makes it very good.
The excitement, the romance, was also meant for an older audience.
Clark seems a softy in the beginning, but also when you get to know him better, he's different.
The other actors also played their roles very well.
it was way back in 1993 when lois and clark aired the first season i was just 3 years old now i'm 17 i can fully appreciate the brilliance of this show Dean Cain Is By Far The Best Clark Kent/Superman and Teri Hatcher Is The Best Lois Lane/Kent it is not only about the man of steal it's also about the romance between lois and clark.
* Next, we have delicately, beautiful Olivia de Havilland who brings not only her feminine pulchritude to the movie, but also an innate sense of class and intelligence too.
He must have really liked portraying Little John, for he was the Big Quarter Staff Man in Douglas Fairbanks' silent screen ROBIN HOOD(1922),a role he re prised not only for this picture but also for ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FORSET (1950).
The movie was not that bad, but it also was not that good either.
It had its funny moments, but then again, it also had some parts where the sense-of-humor had me wincing in pain.
The scene at the dodgy S&M club has also been changed.
Triple H also put on a great performance coming in at number 1 and going to the final three.
It also involved Mark Henry.
Results from the PPV:  Gregory Helms defeated Funaki to win the Cruiserweight Championship which also consisted of Kid Kash, Paul London, Nunzio and Jamie Noble in a very good match.
It was also a good vehicle for me to get into movies I had never seen or vaguely remember.
This one not only had its fair share of tits and silly splatter, it also has some retardedly funny "man on the street" comments from moviegoers.
To me the movie portrays perfectly what we all come across sometime in our lives and how we deal with our own failures and also how we face and deal with death.
Leonard Felton does a brilliant job in this film also.
It was also the official selection at several film festivals.
I especially enjoyed the impromptu scenes between Mr. Duvall and Miss Pedraza, to me, were worth seeing over and over, of course this might also be due to her great beauty.
I can also understand why he went out and got himself a girlfriend 40 years his junior.
Similarly, the sequences with tango dancing are also never fully utilized to their full effect, and Duvall, who is supposed to be the central character, is barely shown doing any dancing at all, and his suppressed love for his real-life girlfriend never catches fire.
This film follows the well trodden path of an ageing hit-man (John J) sent on what may well be his last job in Argentina which also sets the backdrop for a second stand of the story: John J's love of Tango.
The interplay between characters has also got a fresh kind of realism to it ala Ken Loach.
The direction is also not good, and there are at least three scenes that the actresses look to the camera.
There a dark element to it ,but also a very romantic side.
The film also reminds me a bit of Apochalypse Now in that you just sort of have to watch it -- many times, perhaps -- and realize at the end you're just about as confused as you were when you first saw it, so if you're like me, you accept that, live with it, and are happy to hear any new interpretations that might come along.
While watching Assassination Tango -- Robert Duvall's follow-up to his directorial debut, The Apostle --, I was vaguely reminded of this year's similarly themed The Dancer Upstairs (which was also directed by a veteran actor-turned-director -- John Malkovich), in that they both deal with a man-on-a-mission who falls for a dancing instructor.
The constant is Cartman keep saying that it was all just a nightmare while we all see the visitors abducting Kyle's brother Ike, mutilated cows (we also see cows wanting to ride a train!)
and well also Cartman's anal probe (loved: "hey that kind of looks like Tom Selleck").
Well, we also have romance (Wendy is also introduced, and boy is the kissing because everything went fine scene is simply ruined!
It's silly, not terribly original, but also entertaining through an trough, just as an action movie ought to be.
The plot is also filled with action it the form of shoot-outs, fist fights, and one terrific car chase.
Mako is also good as the movie's villain, but the film's most stand-out cast member is without a doubt B-movie veteran Lee Van Cleef, who is a joy to watch as Carradine's tough, irritable dad who doesn't crap from anybody.
Not only do the viewers get to see the beautiful and wonderful places that are visited, but we also get to learn about the cultures and customs of different countries.
Map skills are also an excellent thing to have on this show, as many of the teams get lost and need to stop and ask for directions.
The story also is usually confirmed on the very last minute after searching for optimal tasks and routes by the producers.
The escape scenes are also thrilling and so revealing.
However, I think there should also be a few good movies that tell the other side of the story.
If you have time, you should also listen to the directors' commentary.
and i also love the ending, it's simply beautiful.
As Guy of Gisbourne, Basil Rathbone is also playing one of the landmark roles of his career, and gives a superb performance.
Not only this movie shows all the stupidity of communist ideology (and any ideology in particular), it also in vivid manner shows how far would mother do to protect its child.
Bonnaire is startlingly good and Menshikov as the deluded doctor who brought his  family back to the Soviet Union is also excellent.
The ability of the Russians to suffer and celebrate at the kitchen table also seemed humanly authentic and prepared me to accept the Dr. Zhivago story line.
It also carries some very interesting and pertinent comment on many political/philosophical themes.
Sergei Bodrov Jr. is also excellent as Sacha, the young boy in love with Marie.
What is also worth-seeing is the entry of heroes to the Greek-Bulgarian boundary on the mountains capped with snow.This is the Balkans..
Okay so maybe I am just biased by my unending adoration for David Bowie but I am also a big fan of great games and this is one.
The reason Lucille Ball became so famous, (also Carole Burnette) was that she was willing to look slightly foolish, and do pratfalls and physical humor in order to make an entertaining movie or TV show.
I also liked how the title went with the story - Jane Ryan (Ashley) was running out of minutes until her speech presentation in New York, and Roxanne (Roxy) Ryan (Mary-Kate) needed to get to the Simple Plan's music video to promote her band - and they both were being chased down by all sorts of people!
Cute boys were also a plus!
There's also one seen in a black hair shop where the twins have many outfit changes and everyone is dancing.
A shame because that also in a way means that not too often Dutch movies like "Cloaca" will ever be made and released.
It also definitely helps the movie that the three of them are real life friends and went to college together (along with the movie its director Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen), it definitely shows on screen, since they all have such a great chemistry and share some great anticipation and reaction with each other.
It's based on a stage play by Maria Goos, which starred for most part the same actors that also appear in this movie.
It means that the movie also feels 'stagey' at times, with its characters and dialog.
The movie also has some beautiful cinematography and a suiting musical score.
Gijs Scholten van Aschat (who had the chance to play the raper in Lars von Triers "Dogville", but didn't do it because he wanted to make "Cloaca") plays Joep on a wonderfull way, and also the other die hard theater actors Pierre Bokma, Peter Blok and Jaap Spijkers give a fantastic performance.
Not only did we see the success release of 'Van God Los' and 'Phileine zegt sorry', 2003 also saw the release of Cloaca.
Dixie reminds me of those other early 30s stars Nancy Carroll, Ann Dvorak and Mae Clarke, whose careers also petered out by the middle of the decade.
He also acted in a number of films, including Lon Chaney's last film, "The Unholy Three," in 1930, and "The Last Flight," 1931.
Burns and Allen fans might be disappointed that they don't have bigger parts, but they are also good here, and help advance the story.
Joe also gives a very lovely rendition of the Tchaikovsky's "Nur Wer Die Sehnsucht Kennt".
The Turkish guy who plays one of the bad guy's henchmen is also very good and you can tell he should have a good career ahead of him.
The scenes with the police are also not too strong and could have been better done.
The air squad that sky dived was also bad actors.
There is also violence, and graphic death by gunfire.
I know she has done more music videos, but I would also like to see her in more feature work.
Besides, i particularly appreciated the acting of the crazy girl, Hye-jeong Kang (which i already saw in Old Boy) which is also probably the best character.
Welcome to Dongmakgol opens with a small detachment of North Korean soldiers whose numbers are continuously dwindling not only because of constant attacks, but also because they have been given the order to kill every wounded man.
While primarily a comedy Welcome to Dongmakgol also contains a few graphic scenes of violence such as the eradication of the North Korean soldiers at the beginning of the film and a few scenes near the end of the film.
It also seems tantalizing to imagine if MGM decided to stick out "Our Gang" for one more year, until after World War II ended, I'll bet there would have been a patriotic-themed musical episode, like "Calling All Kids!"
But Tanguy is not just fluent in Chinese and Japanese he is also an advocate of Eastern philosophy so he turns everything around and smiles tolerantly if not quite inscrutably at all their best-laid plans.
Actually I know quite a few guys and girls -of different nationalities- that live or have lived with their parents not because they could not afford to live on their own but also because it is... convenient.
It is disingenuous of Minghella, who also wrote the screenplay, to ask his audience to buy why, at this point, Will doesn't just call the police.
Jude Law also turns in a performance perhaps better than some of his other movies.
The story was also unrealistic when I discussed it with friends of mine who are in the medical transportation field.
We needed to see her as sexually frustrated, yes, but also as someone who is awakened by being made love to by Jude Law!
By the way, her relationship with Will was also not fully developed.
It could also be referring to the relationship between Will and Amira.
I also loved how Minghella studied the parallels between the two mother-child relationships in the film.
This element is also displayed with Erika, who has to resort to being a cleaning lady and is automatically accused when the break-ins first start.
While Will is facing an instability relationship with Liv and her autistic daughter Bea, he tracks down Miro, and discovered that Amira was the mother of Miro, and also the woman whom Will met earlier on.
While King's Cross was depicted as a place for vice, crimes and lowly immigrant living in the slums, the title also means another thing: Breaking and Entering into the lives of the opposite.
He also has Law act unbelievably.
I also really liked Vera Farmiga in a small role of a Russian hooker.
The title is very explicit,there are lots of breaking and enterings not just in ones property but also into each other ,questioning and re-valuating ones actions and choices and most of all revealing the motives,whether they rise from social or personal considerations.
He's also got a depressed Swedish-American girlfriend Liv along with her 13-year-old autistic daughter Bee to deal with at home.
Much like those mediocre movies did, in a desperate search for relevance this one also resorts to dropping little bits of halfass global liberal politics at strategic points throughout the story.
There's also a risky screenplay, an original one by the director that also stands on a different level compared to his previous adapted efforts.
This is because there are things that also remain the same; the kind of things that define a director's work: like actors direction.
Juliette Binoche is also effective as Amira.
But there also are some weaker parts of the movie, but it is still strong and great for the whole family!
And that is also the case of Robin Wright Penn's character and her daughter from Sweden.
This is the stuff that fairy tales are made off, also great drama, great comedy and all the natural ingredients of what is laughingly known as our daily existence.
He is also an outstanding director.
They are played by real-life brothers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with their close friend, the director.
It also has a really good ending, which is very important.
And we also realize that their parents are deceased.
He also provides a 'deus ex machina' ending as well.
This is a comedy with music, and it also has the sexy Diana Dors in it, as well as a cameo by Norman Wisdom.
A parody of the Johnny Ray type celebrity it's based on a long running stage show that also starred Buchanan.
The soundtrack was also all Beatles so what's not to like?
This movie also starring Nicole Ari Parker, Martin Sheen, Stephen Root, Yara Shahidi and Richard Schiff.
I also felt like the film was a little bit clichÃ©'d if you know what I mean.
But that was also when Star Trek was in its prime, so it really brought be back.
I also felt the kid's acting were great.
The producer should have also, at least, sprung for the buck to buy some black hair coloring at the 99 Cents Only store to make the family resemblance at bit more plausible.
There's also an unnecessary subplot that involves a budding connection between the one-eyed nice guy and a "biker with a heart of gold," and writer-director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts does all he can to mine sympathy for the shy guy and the model before he kills them off.
It's also fun (without being campy), the acting is good, the boys are hot, and it's a suspenseful and thrilling film that takes itself seriously as a real slasher film.
SPOILER ALERT, as soon as I saw one guy in flamboyant Drag & a cute young guy, I felt that they would be victims,  It was also filmed in West Hollywood, It sure did not look like the West Hollywood I know so well.
Etheredge-Ouzts, who I met at the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, directs the first gay slasher movie ever, a fun and scary film that has nothing (other than the gay angle) original about it, but also doesn't pretend to be original.
The humor also is a major plus, as there are several laughs spread throughout the film.
Yes, it is about a serial killer on one Halloween night in West Hollywood, but it also seems to be a light-hearted takeoff on all the silly teenage massacre horror films.
I also wondered why it took over a year for this film to get released.
It serves up plenty of scares, but it also has a sense of humor which keeps the tone light and fun.
There's also plenty of room for a sequel.
As nasty as this is, it just might find a niche with Creature Feature aficionados who also happen to be splatter fans.
Giallo fans may also like this.
The ending was VERY Poignant and also left me with a feeling like This Woman is gonna be OK. She has conquered the most devastating of Tradgedies and has emerged from it with the Courage of a True Hero!
There are also tech problems in the film.
It's very likely that there was as much money thrown at this as there was at the opening titles of Superman, which I also watched today (thought 'was much better', incidentally).
It also brings sharply to mind that this young girl, Jill Kinmont's fate could so easily in a split second be our own, resulting from a sports injury, car accident, or whatever.
It paints a vivid portrait of the realities faced by those who must depend on others for personal care and simply daily tasks, also their struggle for some measure of independence and the same respect granted able bodied individuals.
I'll also add that if you saw and liked the first, you may want to watch this just to satisfy your curiosity.
A big game hunter with grenade launchers fails to match Oliver Platt's role, and the Bridgette Fonda look-alike also does nothing.
I also started searching for the soundtrack and have been unsuccessful.
There are also an unbelievable number of attractive women in various stages of undress.
It also contained(or should I say didn't..) something that I wasn't very used to seeing in movies these days---it had no profanity, no suggestive actions....it was all real.
I hope that i get to see it again i just saw it on TV today and i thought it was very good I'm also the type of person to believe in that kind of stuff i like myths and true stories and vampires and people who cant die i dig that kind of stuff.
While action packed the human drama behind the movie is also of interest and the DVD (a double with 'Smash Palace') features an excellent making of documentary highlighting the issues of making a movie in New Zealand in the mid-1970's.
The casting was also excellent, especially for Vlad, the attractive Rudolf Martin whose looks scream Dracula in this movie as they did in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"; and Lidia, the petite Jane March whose voice and looks expertly display the quiet yet strong religious character.
One night, Vlad hosts a banquet for Romanian nobles, who he believes are in league with the Turks and are also responsible for the death (by being buried alive) of his father.
But there is one condition; he must marry the King's daughter, which would also entail converting (even if in name only) to Roman Catholicism.
Vlad's father, also called Vlad, was a member of the Teutonic knightly order of the Dragon, which had been established in Germany with the purpose of protecting Christianity against the rise of Islam at the gates of Europe.
His affiliation with this order gained him the surname "Dracul" which is a Romanian translation for "Dragon" and also a synonym for "devil".
He had also been ruthless with the breaking of the law in his own land.
It investigates the characters and suggests how they were warped by the times and politics, and also touches on the metaphysical implications of such viciousness.
There is also a secret that is eventually revealed, and sort of explains why things are the way they are.
It also describes the mother, Miranda Richardson, whose spirit has been gradually destroyed by her volatile, controlling, husband, until she is reduced to a morbidly depressed alcoholic with no life beyond the couch and television.
And also, it shows how life then was somehow different than today Â quieter, more private Â at least for some of us and the families we grew up in during that time.
Willis O'Brien, who later became famous for this type of filming in 1933's KING KONG, was also the guy responsible for bringing to life the dinosaurs in this film.
The character of Reggie also becomes less likable, since director Coscarelli obviously found it necessary for this formerly very cool character to annoy with 'hip' one-liners.
Challenger is also extremely well done.
There is also the famed hunter Sir John Roxton (Lewis Stone), who is a flawless shot with the rifle and is never afraid to step into the very jaws of peril.
This addition also allows for a (rather predictable) love story, since it's completely unreasonable for young Malone to conclude the film as a single man.
The latter film was also certainly influenced by 'The Lost World' in several other ways, including the general "Lost World" theme and the destructive escape of the captured beast into a bustling city (notably, Steven Spielberg also pays tribute to this film in his underrated 1997 effort, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park,' in which a Tyrannosaurus Rex escapes in San Diego).
Unfortunately, the film includes not only explicit, but also implicit racially insensitive and inaccurate images.
My copy also offered an incessant upbeat piano soundtrack that didn't change tempo throughout the entire movie, somewhat disconcerting for those intervals of intense drama requiring a more somber or even a threatening tone.
I also have the Lumivision DVD of the 64 min.
It goes without saying that there's some irony in seeing the sequence put to music that was also used in the 'romantic' moments of Barry Lyndon.
Parts may look typical and even slow, but it's also alive in ways that many CGI action films of today (Eragon I'm looking at you) fall flat completely in comparison.
Not only predating computers by a huge margin, but also predating the Dunn Optical Printer which became a standard in motion picture effects departments.
It also ranks with Jurassic Park in it's scientific accuracy, based on the knowledge of prehistoric life at the time.
The ending is also great.They bring a brontosaurus back to London and it runs amok, it also destroys Tower Bridge.
it also leaves some unanswered questions that i hope will be answered in part 5. as i have said in my comments on the rest of the movies i hope pt5 is the final part cos we dont want the best horror series ever going on and on and on.
It also has some wonderful performances by its hole cast, and is expertly directed, in almost a Spielberg way, with the talent of Alfred Hitchcock.
If you enjoyed The Lost World, you might also like, On the Waterfront, Its a Wonderful Life, and Jurasic Park.
The stop-motion dinosaurs are done excellently by Willis O'Brien and also include Allosaurus, Tricertops and Pteranodon.
Cleverly adapted by Broadway playwright Marion Fairfax (who also adapted in 1922 another of Conan Doyle's works, "Sherlock Holmes"), the film is an excellent mix of action and adventure that even when it's not entirely faithful to the novel, keeps the spirit of wonder and fascination with the unknown.
It's also strange that a Brontosaurus was selected to be loose in the finale, especially since this sequence wasn't included in the novel.
This film also shows what Gary Oldman could do if he sticks to his promise of not playing any more one dimensional bad guy roles.
I also liked the irish-italian mafia subplot, but did not like the fact that it was the driving force behind all the key events in the film.
In contrast Gary Oldmans character is also torn up in side, but he has no conflict, he is happy going right over the edge.
The two brothers have a sister, Robin Wright, who has also tried to escape the neighborhood by working at the front desk of an uptown hotel.
The Evil Dead movies all have open endings, but there is also a lot of plot development and resolution of problems.
John Turturro as Nick plays also a great role.
State of Grace was one of the earliest films that depicted the Irish mob, a topic that, so far, has an impeccable track record at being transitioned to the screen: Miller's Crossing, a masterpiece by the Coen Brothers that arrived the same year as this film and was also criminally overlooked, 2003's Road to Perdition, Sam Mendes' beautiful father/son epic, and, most recently, Martin Scorsese's triumphant return to the genre with his slick adaptation of Hong Kong blockbuster, The Departed.
He also rekindles his relationship with the brothers' sister, Kate (Robin Wright.)
Call are also superb.
Consistently intelligent and understated, it is also superbly and movingly scored by the great Morricone, which almost lends a contemporary western elegy feeling to the film.
The kid from part 3 who knew everything about guns and fighting is dropped and Rocky who left in the car at the end of part 3 is also out of the picture.
Robin Wright Penn also delivers as a young woman who is desperately trying to escape the mean streets of the Kitchen, the violent world of her brothers, and her meager upbringing.
She also underestimated what being with Terry would mean, especially after learning Terry's true identity.
Watch this film for the terrific performances of all the lead actors, for the fantastic music, the frenetic action, and the moving drama, but watch it also to ask yourself, what are your demons, when will you finally face them and what will happen when you do?
It's a fable, with its story origins in a budding cartoonist, Fellini, who also appears here in his one and only acting role as a kind of Vagabond (and quite a suave looking one, ho-ho).
It is also a very telling story about religion and faith, and to my way of thinking still holds a relevance just as meaningful today as back in the later 40's and early 50's.
There is also a neat flashback sequence, with footage shot for the first film, but not seen before.
I think it's a wonderful movie and it's been unjustly underestimated:it's oneiric,sentimental,poetic and the dramatic plot is dealt with a sense of humour.There are various issues like male bonding,homosexuality,friendship and I think every role is proper for the actor who plays it:my favourite actor JOHN MALKOVICH(GREAT)is a homosexual with some existential problems and he falls in love with Marty(Michael Zelniker)and they get engaged at the end of the film;Dennis(Kevin Bacon)has in vain tried to get successful in Hollywood as a musician,Al(Joe Mantegna)grows up thanks of Jamie Lee Curtis,Vinny(Tony Spiridakis)dreams to become an actor and Ray(Ken Olin)a painter.Even if the dreams of some of these guys don't come through,their strong and profound tie is the reason to continue to hope in the future.I also think the title is the only very funny thing of the movie(in Italian language it's "Dreaming Manhattan")but the film succeeds to alternate melancholy and thoughtless scenes:Mantegna climbs up the bridge which links Astoria to Manhattan,Ken Olin listens to his message "I love you guys" while he's thinking about his life,Kevin Bacon and Michael Zelniker play "ordinary people song" while Zelniker and Malkovich look at each other,Malkovich jilts Terry Kinney,who had fallen in love with him,because he doesn't like the way he talks about his friends(when Kinney asked him if those guys were his type,he replied "that I don't know but they are the best I could do"),Tony Spiridakis howls with a healer without a reason,Tom Waits reads his odd poem at Jack's,Jamie Lee Curtis takes Mantegna's gun and learns him to throw all away,Chloe Webb tells Madame Rose,a palmist, she's surrounded by idiots,the five boys shout out Arnold's name while they're having a bath under Hellgate during the night because he was the only guy,apart from Mantegna,who climbed up that bridge and they don't see Linda Fiorentino stealing their clothes out of spite,because her husband Mantegna spent all his time with his friends(he also kisses John Malkovich at the disco)...well,these guys are amazing!They are either crazy or gay,either sad or happy,sometimes they make you cry,sometimes they make you amuse.Personally I was a depressed sixteen year old girl when I saw this movie for the first time on a night during last summer and it made me dream:this movie is everything for me,it lets me to take refuge in another world and it makes me isolate from my reality,whom I hate as much as I can, but fortunately I'm not here,I'm under Hellgate Bridge to dream with other Queens.I thank Tony Spiridakis,who wrote the story,and all the actors very much for this wonderful movie!!
Anyway, it's an all star cast featuring besides Webb, Mantegna, and Fiorentino but also Kevin Bacon, Ken Olin, John Malkovich, and Jamie Lee Curtis.
The other actors and actresses were also very good.
John Malkhovich also does his usual good job, playing Eliot, a man trapped in the machoistic World of Queens, yet struggling with his homosexuality.
There are also things that just don't help the plot much.
There are also a few twists and turns that, while well signposted, impress once again by showing how fearless Coscarelli really is when he has such faith in his own material.
Alonzo also loves her.
He knew Alonzo and the audience was supposed to know why - there was also a cryptic note the knifethrower sent him as well.
He is also a great actor.
While dealing with his own problems of how to tell Nanon he really isn't armless, he now has to contend with the strongman who also has developed feelings for the girl.
The music also added the affect of the film.
This is an enormously powerful film, and also very unique as far as the films I've seen.
The storyline also revealed a lot more than it physically displayed on-screen.
This was a truly creepy but also touching tale with wonderful acting by Lon Chaney, Sr.
It was also strange to see the very young Joan Crawford before she was transformed into the sleek creature she later became, and frankly, I liked her better here.
The film bore thematic and "mood" resemblances to Browning's later "Freaks", also set in a circus milieu.
I also liked that you could often read the character's lips and so actually got more "dialogue" than was printed on the title cards.
When I described the plot twists to a friend, I also compared it to a Poe short story (not a specific one-just in mood).
Rounding out the triangle is circus strong man Malabar (Norman Kerry) who is also in love with Nanon.
Kerry had also appeared with Chaney in both "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1923) and "The Phantom of the Opera" (1925).
For viewers then as much as now, there is also the whole milieu, director Tod Browning's leaning to the macabre and the small time circus.
As usual, Lon appeals to our best sadistic instincts while also eliciting genuine sympathy for his impossible love.
It was also one of the most offbeat psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio, especially one such as MGM.
He would also, he tells Cojo, do anything he could to someone who takes her away from him.
The circus strongman Malabar (Kerry) also compulsively loves her and won't take no for an answer, but he keeps putting his arms around her as she pushes him away.
Norman Kerry is affable & tender as the circus strong man who also loves Crawford.
It also features a great, early appearance by Joan Crawford, a complex, gripping, allegorically deep but economically told story by Browning, and it is an excellent instantiation of themes found throughout Chaney and Browning's other work.
In a typical Chaney film complicated love triangle, Nanon and Zanzi Circus strongman Malabar are also attracted to each other, but Nanon has an aversion to being touched and keeps distancing Malabar and any other man who wants to be intimate.
This film, despite my dissing, also seems like it could have had potential.
Tom Sholte is also great as the complicated, warm-hearted priest.
Paul McGillion who plays Grace's brother, Dominic, also adds to the power of the movie.
Paul McGillion is also stunning as 'Dominic', Grace's haunted missionary brother, torn between his love for his sister and running away from the anguish of knowing 'all the love in the world' can't help her.
But Sultanet has another suitor, the cruel and mischievous Ahmed Khan (Renato Baldini), also engaged in the league against the Russians.
Maybe, but its also real life.
It's also so funny that her name is Glenda in this film.
Unfortunately, he's also the writer.
Josh's one good friend (it is never explained why THEY aren't potential date material) bets Josh he can set him up with a perfect man in the title ten dates who - also source of the title - turn out to be ten attitudes, not ten dates - and ten that include at least three or four who NO good friend would ever set anyone up with!
But thankfully there we can see in the movie life has some good aspects too and also some nice people like Dev Pratap Singh who help people like Farhaan, Fardeen in the movie get back into the right track.
), misguided youth (a very well managed sub-plot, which is seamlessly integrated into the main story) and the inevitable romance (also well integrated into the story)!
He also re-visits the famous Banquo's ghost scene from Macbeth.
Looking beneath the surface we can see that Dev is also about friendship and it's boundaries.
While doing so, Tej also believes that there's no injustice even if the innocents are exterminated.
'The Devil Rides Out', a truly great movie, also by Terence Fisher, where Lee plays a good guy the way a good guy must be played.
He's also some rare genius - I never figured out how he deduced the whole alien invasion theory - no one else was aware of it.
Peter Cushing has a smaller role as a local doctor (he also starred in Island of Terror).
If you have seen 1-3, which all have the same ending more or less (which is vague also), this one blows it out of the park.
The amazing Phantasm score isn't really played, but a slow violin version that sounds great is herd often which adds to the drama of the film (also herd in 2 and 3).
Terence Fisher's direction is solid and efficient and he handles the film's most awkward moment, the attempted rape scene, with considerable bravery even though an understandable element of reticence, discernible also in a similar moment in Fisher's 'Frankenstein Must be Destroyed' (1969), is apparent, but works well in what I would argue is a surprisingly non misogynistic movie.
I also noticed that the DVD cut is slightly longer than the one last shown on TV here in the UK with an extra scene involving the dissemination of the walky talkies which, in the other version, just appear from nowhere.
Fisher also directed "Island of Terror" which this is reminiscent of.
Being that this was to be an "independent" production (as in "independent from Hollywood") I thought it may also stay away from the radical leftist view of Hollywood and look at every thing from a new edge or original angle.
Excellent also by parents especially Greg, Richard Thomas.
It's also a movie from the 80's, and that starts showing.
They have to struggle to accept the fact their young son was terminally ill yet remain strong enough to prepare him for his own death but they are also fighting the ignorance of how AIDS was perceived in the Eighties.
I highly recommend this to not only people seeking a good gut-wrenching drama (as there is nothing more gut-wrenching than watching this film and knowing this was a true story that happened to a real little boy and his family) but also for older children and teenagers seeking a more meaningful view of AIDS and its consequences.
Not only Reggie was a Ice Cream truck driver, he was also a musician on the side.
We occasionally get to hear Claire's thoughts, which belong to the saddest but also the wisest inner monologues I have ever heard.
This movie was also the subject in one of my academical projects,in a Greek university for a computer science department.
Almost every cue being spoken by the actors is hilarious, these actors are many years together, not only as partners, but also as friends, and are some of my favorite Greek comedians.
It is also a very well shot production (by DoP JÃ¸rgen Johansson) who has exploited the Digital Intermediate post production route to the hilt but in a very subtle way.
It also goes some way to filling in the gaps, giving the Tall Man a proper origin story and answering a few questions while still leaving enough up in the air to justify the 5th film which is apparently in production currently.
Miscommunication is also reflected in their relationship.
As Christoffer comes to terms with possibility of life without Maja, he explores the question of identity and also the sense of 'knowing' another person.
The music in the game is also top notch, some of the scores are very haunting well others...aren't.
I could see he was trying his best, and I give the two stars to the film for his role (and also for the gorgeous Raima Sen, who sadly doesn't have much to do), and a song that he sings in a club.
It's also cool to see Bill Thornberry again, but he's way underutilized.
:-)  P.S There was also something about Bugs Bunny here that made him lack his usual charm - he was too predictable.
This is a remotely entertaining little effort, but quite possibly also the most clichÃ©d horror movie I ever watched and it's derivative of at least a dozen genre classics, including "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (original and remake), "Friday the 13th" ,"Psycho" and "The Hills have Eyes (original and remake as well).
Every prototypic twist you expect to happen in a backwoods horror slasher really does happen here, and at the exact moment you predicted it too, and every stereotypical character you anticipate to make an appearance also really does make an appearance at one point or another.
The bloody make-up effects are nifty, but there's too little variation in the characters' deaths and the film definitely also needed a couple of authentically perverted gimmicks.
Some of the death scenes are creative, I'll give it that, but they're also quite absurd, unrealistic, and often there just for violence's sake (the whole pipe-through-the-ankles, chain-pulled-through-it bit was over-the-top to say the least).
There's also some completely random, unnecessary sex scenes that border on soft-core pornography, and are so out of place and poorly portrayed that it's laughable.
There is also an unnecessary rape scene in the film (which seems to go hand-in-hand with hillbilly killers nowadays) that is so poorly constructed that it's not even close to being disturbing, which is actually kind of scary in itself.
also some thrilling moments that u can expect from horror movies.
But poor confused little Michael claims that everything felt so realÂ Ten years later, his dream is proved a reality because the Tall Man is back, desecrating every town he travels throughÂhe also kills Reggie's family.
I also thought Trevor Torseth as Kane stumbling out from behind the tree exuded an intensity and malice not characteristic of bad acting.
I think this movie is getting unfair treatment.It's not one of the best Afterdark Horrorfest films, but it definitely isn't one of the worst.The acting was actually good and not just horrible like it is in most B-Movies.The script is actually quite new and fresh, for a movie of this standard.It was also very entertaining to watch, and while I did find the ending EXTREMELY stupid, most of the material in this film didn't bother me.It was good, and I enjoyed watching it.The characters don't stick to you like they should, and there were a few flaws with this movie, but no movie's 100% perfect, and you definitely shouldn't sit down to watch this movie expecting to be.I liked it, and it's rating is too low if you ask me.I recommend it if you've liked all the others, because it is a fine edition to the series.
While I don't mind a dose of that in a movie, the horror elements also have to be there for me to enjoy the flick, and in this case, there is just nothing there.
You'll also see that this movie was influence by some earlier movies that had the same premise.
There is also the mysterious wrong perpetrated on Flora's father by the Starkadders sometime in the dim and misty past.
This provides unpredictability, but also confusion.
While we Americans(I say we, since I'm American even though I'm landed in Canada) tend to think of Monty Python when we think of British humor, there's also a satirical type of humor that seems to be unique to Britain.
But the supporting cast, including Joanna Lumley as Flora's friend Mary Smiling, Sheila Burrell as Aunt Ada Doom, Ian McKellen as Amos, and Rufus Sewell as Seth(also Stephen Fry and Eileen Atkins) are all perfect as well.
And should it lead to a part five it is also a brilliant cliff hanger.
Eileen Atkins as Amos wife,cousin Judith and Freddy Jones as their hired hand are also standouts,but with such a perfect cast there are no weak links,so take sit back and take a journey to the far regions of Sussex with Flora Poste and investigate the quirky Starkadder family, with secrets aplenty at Cold Comfort Farm..once there you will want to make many more visits
There's also a smattering of Lambsbreath (Adam) and a smidgen of Hawk-Monitor (Dick).
As mentioned in the comments of others, Ms. Beckinsale, clad in her natty period togs and radiating a winsome, unflappable aura (while also projecting a strangely prepubescent vibe), hasn't had as good a role since Flora.
Flora, excellently portrayed by Beckinsdale, is pretentious and rather smug but also well-meaning and likable.
Kate Beckinsale's Flora Poste is as unshaken and well-spoken as Austen's Emma (who Beckinsale has also starred as) but in a more cheerful and less hypocritical manner.
Eileen Atkins as Amos wife,cousin Judith and Freddy Jones as their hired hand are also standouts,but with such a perfect cast there are no weak links,so take sit back and take a journey to the far regions of Sussex with Flora Poste and investigate the quirky Starkadder family, with secrets aplenty at Cold Comfort Farm..once there you will want to make many more visits
Delroy Lindo has a typically rather small part (unfortunately) but manages to be breathtakingly captivating for every moment he's onscreen (also typical for him).
Satan was a poor misfit, but also a violent hooligan and a cowardly assassin, as this film, based on his own autobiography, actually shows .
Satan himself, or rather herself does a curious impersonation of Josephine Baker, who by the way is also be seen in the excerpts from the original Madam Satan, directed by Cecil B de Mille in his most extreme, odd mood (the action of 'Madam Satan,' the original 1930 musical, takes place inside a Zeppelin!).
The outstanding achievement of this film, though, is to put his life into context, that he is also protector, father, dreamer, artist; and to neither airbrush, glamorize nor excuse his life.
The protagonist is also the antagonist with his often irrational and aggressive behaviour, possibly a trademark of Joao Francisco himself on which the film is based on, although this could be one of the film's flaws.
Excellent photography, which really brings to the screen the mood of 30's bars and nightclubs from Lapa (Rio de Janeiro traditional bohemian neighbourhood, known also for its violence).
The cast is fantastic, highlighting the performance of the stunning LÃ¡zaro Ramos, who is also the leader actor of the excellent and very recommended 'O Homem Que Copiava'.
And also the fact that I really enjoyed it at the time (Christmas).
While not necessarily a bad thing in itself, this can also give the impression of a lack of depth.
Policewomen also features some of the sloppiest editing I've run into recently.
Or to go on and on about the stunning work turned by Audran (going between an entire emotional palette, as it were, from happy to sobbing to frightened to pale and shot to hell) and Yanne (also great at what he's meant to be, our male protagonist and, sadly, eventual antagonist by default).
It's a film that deals with the greatest, most puzzling, and most disturbing mysteries of humanity, but it's also a small, simple film with a style so subtle it sometimes appears to be no style at all.
The Butcher is also the story of two people who have adapted, in their own ways, to modern society.
This beautiful actress is superb at providing the lead, and also fits into the film brilliantly as she bodes well with the exquisite cinematography.
Their chemistry is also perfect.
It also has its fair share of cat fights, and we even get to see Ms. Currie wipe the floor with the almighty William Smith, who plays a karate instructor.
Exploitation veterans Wes Bishop (who also appears on screen as Raymond) and Lee Frost (who plays a Catalina attendant) keep it moving and keep it interesting.
And it's also got Jeanie "T.N.T.
Chabrol's triumph and also Stephane Audran's finest performance;only "le festin de Babette" will give her a part as strong as this one.She plays a luminous radiant beaming schoolteacher ,teaching her pupils spelling with a little help from Honore de Balzac and dance with "le menuet du Bourgeois Gentilhomme",a MoliÃ¨re-Lully collaboration.She epitomizes honesty,loyalty,innocence and devotion to her work.In direct contrast to her,we have Popaul,the butcher,masterfully played by Jean Yanne (He's never been as good as with Chabrol:please,please,do see "que la bÃªte meure" (The beast must die)):He's obviously in love with HÃ©lÃ¨ne /Audran but he realizes the gap between them.He's a crude uneducated brute,but his clumsiness is so touching you side with him.But we know from the start that won't be a happy story:the first scene,dealing with Cro-Magnon in dark caves heralds a story of blood and bestiality.Popaul is Cro-Magnon ,but he's also a victim of the war they waged with his blood.Chabrol 's camera insists on the war memorial,this inhuman piece of stone surrounded by four shells.LOOKS are more important than words between Popaul and HÃ©lÃ¨ne,and as she begins to comprehend the horror of the situation,we know ,that in spite of what Popaul has done,she feels for him.Chabrol excels in depicting a small village ,French critics often compare him to an entomologist.
He's evidently scarred by the violence he's seen and also by his relationship with a cold, unloving father who seemed to be the reason he left France in the first place.
This obscurity is less frustrating than it is fascinating, however, because Chabrol is a master of pacing and mood, and he knows not only how to keep an audience gripped right to the end, but also how to haunt them afterwards.
There are also several opportunities for them to escape from Jayne just as there are opportunities for the hit men to kill Jayne.
Jeannie Bell also has notable fight scenes.
First, you could actually hear them talking without much straining--and this CAN'T be said of films like COQUETTE (also 1929).
Q, or someone pretending to be him, never makes an appearance, but you can expect three fine spy gadgets in this film: a bow with a spool, a knife that shoots its blade(used by a female villain, and also may I add a useless weapon compared to say... a gun), and a belt that becomes stiff for throwing as a javelin *rolls eyes*.
They also managed to get some people who actually stared in Bond movies, like Ms. Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), M (Bernard Lee), and Emilio Largo (from Thunderball played by Adolfo Celi).
He also happens to know Judo and knows techniques to induce the deepest states of trance possible (and that most men would kill to know).
With tongue firmly in cheek, we also learn that Neil is the brother of a famous spy and, as his brother is unavailable, the government wants Neil to stand in and give them a hand.
The Pre-code element was also very risquÃ© and the fact that the affair between Cagney's & Mathews's chaarcters was so obviously sexual, must have had all at the Hays office pulling their hair out.
Like in most early talkies, many cast members seem to struggle with adapting to the new medium, such as adopting wild animated body gestures as they would have done in silent pictures and also speaking terribly slowly as they were so often told to do.
It also is implied that O'Grady's rejection of bribes is more the exception than the rule among police officials.
He is an artist and also a veritable Don Juan with a magnetic charm.
There's also the fact that Louie's kid brother 12 year-old Jackie had been enrolled in the prestigious Fairfield Military Academy.
Lew Ayres(Louie Ricarno),"Calling Dr. Kildare",'38, was a crook trying to go straight and start a new life for himself and did everything to protect James Cagney,(Steve Mileaway),"The Public Enemy",'31, who was a fellow side kick in the rackets and was also fooling around with his wife.
If you look close, you will also see Dwight Frye (Monk, a gangster),"Frankenstein",'31 and Ward Bond(a policeman that was uncredited in this picture) Ward Bond appeared in many of John Wayne Western Films.
I also got a kick out of the scene in which Ricarno fancies himself as big a man as Napoleon, and Cagney does a mock impersonation of the dictator to the amusement of Louie's girl Doris (Dorothy Matthews).
This film is so much better than you'd think, and that is due not only to fine performances by Ayres and Cagney (make that, a WONDERFUL performance by Cagney, who really does ignite the screen), but also to impressive direction by Archie Mayo.
One hitch here is that the woman he marries is also sweet on his henchman, Steve Mileaway (Cagney) and the feeling is returned.
I guess there must have been a bit of nepotism going around concerning Mr Ortlieb's role in HRH (you'll also notice a couple of other Ortliebs in HRH too).
Not only because it was ugly, but also the way she is made to seem completely helpless was unconvincing.
It's also campy and funny.
Most of the film takes place during the day which is also different.
It is also a loving tribute to the medium of radio, which has ultimately been destroyed by FCC deregulation.
I also don't like a lot of what he's done, but this wasn't one of those times.
However, he has also brought with him the devil (in the form of a statue), and this leads the local priest to visit the convent in order to expel the demon, only he ends up featuring in the nuns' desires also...  At first, I didn't think this movie was going to work as a porn film because the first couple of sex scenes are far too rigid and it seems like the actresses are just doing what they're told.
This film is also bound to appeal to anyone that loves sleazy trash movies, as D'Amato is happy to go a little further than just showing your basic sex scenes, and the film also features lesbians, rape and wooden dildo's...
Meanwhile, we get to see also the lives of various radio performers, among them Mia Farrow's and Wallace Shawn's characters.
I liked the use of the old age music and the impressive cinematography from Carlo Di Palma and Susan E. Morse's editing was also good.
Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker also shine as the main set of parents in the piece, Mom & Dad to Allen's childhood alter ego.
It's not a "laugh a minute" type film, but it also gets you thinking.
It also cements my conclusion that Woody Allen is the only director who "spoofs" great art films and artistic styles, confirmed by his tributes to Ingmar Bergman and German Expressionists.
They are inextricably connected as genetic members of a family, but also more intangibly linked by radio broadcasts, to which they listen to individually as well as collectively.
They also share great love for one another, though they quibble like all human beings do.
Re-telling them not only reveals how one thinks life once was (usually painted over with warmth and pleasantness), but also oneself and the knowledge that these times are no longer physically accessible.
And that, if nothing else, is not only comforting, but also meaningful.
You've also got to hand it to the cast.
Reports are also interjected from the BBC, SkyTV and New York's WNBC with familiar news readers.
The terrorist's identity is also left vague, which is one of the movie's few letdowns.
I'm also former military - an NBC specialist - so I know way too much about this stuff in real life.
also carrying out a vendetta, but the events leading up to that are offscreen.
Alas-genre regular Richard Harrison is no where to be seen having by this time presumably escaped his contract with the aforementioned cinematic crooks (in fact Harrison reportedly felt so sullied by his experiences with Lai and Ho and their deceitful film making techniques that he more or less retired from the industry)  In his honoured place however steps forward Pierre Kirby (who also appeared in the demented classic that is 'Zombie vs Ninja', aka 'Zombie Rival-The Super Ninja Master') who actually does many of his own stunts and martial arts.
The acting/dialogue as expected, is also a hoot - is there really anyone out there who can keep a straight face as the characters in these films interact with one another?!
Added to this, the original film into which the ninja segments have been edited is also actually very good in it's own right and involves a skilled swordsman called eagle in a tale of violent retribution.
Totally outrageous in every sense, but also totally superb!
Then you also have Boris, and Leon.
While the plot structure and most of the characterization weren't fantastic, the comedy was after all fairly effective most of the time, and the movie also managed to maintain the serious story quite well.
I remember him from Eagles Claw (Tai Seng released this and is also a fun kung fu film), and even thirty years later the man is still ripped!
She also doesn't appear to have the same level of ability as Lau Kar-leung and Wu Jing which, like with Lau Wing-kin, leaves you a bit sceptical that she'd last long against the villains.
Jacky Wu also shows how he has progressed since Tai-Chi Boxer.
This is also a funny movie, Kareem Hardison, follows in the steps of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor, a comedian/actor whose ad-libs are always fun to watch.
Dacascos (who is, I've discovered, a king of straight-to-video movies) outdoes similar actors (Van Damme) where the acting is concerned, and is also a great fighter.
Hardison also shines by adding humour to the fray and Pyper-Ferguson has a certain charisma and presence as the bad guy.
Brittany Murphy is also a revelation here as a (very!)
Also this film is also very very funny at times.
It also showcases Mark Dacascos perfectly.
Kadeem Hardison is a also a great talent.
It's also amazing to learn that some of the best lines and coolest moves were ad-libbed, or choreographed without a wire.
Anyway, I also didn't like Kadeem Hardison's character; I get so tired of stereotypical Black/African-American (whichever term is proper this month) character's like his, especially in action movies.
It's also a great "Buddy" "Buddy" flick as well, and it's very well made and written as well, plus I was lucky my friend recommended this to me, otherwise I would have gone thinking it was just another straight to video Action film!.
A lot of it works dude to the wonderful chemistry between Dacascos and Hardison, and the fight choreography was also fantastic, plus the guy in the white coat at the end looked awesome and was very cool.
Kadeem Hardison is also amazing here, he was very funny, and worked so well with Dacascos, what a great unknown find here, I really hope him and Mark make a sequel together!.
Mark Dacascos stars as Toby Wong, a genetically altered soldier who escapes from the Chinese corporation that built him and is on the run from thugs looking to return him back, also on board is Kadeem Hardison who becomes Dacascos' hostage and partner while top notch martial arts action ensues.
: Also, be on the lookout for a rather humorous supporting performance from Brittany Murphy as a bored, easily-excited teenager who is also brought along for the ride.
Kareem Hardison is hilarious at times but also sometimes a distraction from Dacascos but his improvisations and ability to carry the story between the action cannot be overlooked.
I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has seen Dacascos before as this is surly his finest film, and also to anyone that is intrigued by an American martial arts film that can hold its own against its Chinese counterpart.
What it also adds is a genuinely funny, if wafer thin script.
John Pyper Ferguson is also very funny as one of the bad guys.
He comes out with some great lines, and also some hilariously cheesy lines such as `look its my favourite cheese eating, dick monkey' WHAT?!!
You might have experienced the situation someone's telling a joke that is not only well known but also badly presented.
I must say that this also did work for this movie.
Jack Wouterse is perfectly casted as Bennie, the main character and also the rest of the cast is adequate.
Its really funny and strongly entertaining, you will not believe what you see sometimes... Our neighbors gave us many many hours of good movies, i also like "Amsterdamed" or "Flodder" but this is very Good.
The characters are also pretty wacky, ranging from a fat woman hating tough guy, to a necrophiliac serial killer.
He's done the cop role many many times - Die hard 'nuff said - and the cop with problems is also a re-run from Willis - Strking Distance & Last Boy Scout.
You can tell that he pulled out his gun and fired like he was trained, but that critical realization afterward propels the film as much into the mind of Mosley and Eddie (who is also shocked here) as it propels into the street of lower Manhattan.
Donner also chooses his settings carefully with key scenes taking place in basements and at Mosely apartment - not just in some random alleyway.
It was also Ohio that the Republicans targeted with a massive get out the vote campaign which the Democrats failed to match.
The Republicans-who politically controlled the state- also bottled up a number of key Democratic precincts, with disruptive poll watchers and a lack of voting machines.
There's also an intriguing clip that passes without comment: a group of white college students wielding Bush-Cheney signs chant 'O.J.
Oh, also a really bad performance by Alan Cumming and some scenes which include Stallone's love interest that have no sense and point to them or the movie at all.
His acting would put a lot of people to shame, in fact it's a superb performance (also see "Copland").
No gaffs, major or minor - I enjoyed this remake more than its original, which was also worth viewing in my opinion but just didn't get my involvement or support as much as this one - I'd stay up late to watch this one again.
In the new version you also got to see where Richie's wife and daughter were coming from when Jack shows up after years.
I thought it also kind of totally fell apart in the last 1/3
Miranda Richardson does well in her supporting role as Gloria Carter, Jack's sister in law; Rachael Leigh Cook also does a good job in her supporting role as Doreen Carter, Jack's niece; and I really think that Sylvester Stallone did the best job he could with the material as Jack Carter.
Overall the story also gives an interesting review of immigration and the nation's feelings about it.
She also loved the film and I felt so gratified by that, because sadly this type of quiet, sensitive films is not the kind of film which you can watch with anybody and can be fully appreciated as it should be.
Praise must also go to the two actresses that vividly portray the two women in Cooper's life: the unjustly forgotten and underrated Russian actress Anna Sten and the equally unfairly forgotten actress Helen Vinson.
This movie is much more in the transcendental tradition of Henry Hathaway's Peter Ibbetson, also starring Cooper and released the same year.
It is also one of his first films.
Here the ending was changed to protect Novello's reputation as a romantic leading man (as was the first talkie sequel in which Novello also played the lead, albeit to a slightly altered script, character and motivation).
He also manages to let the images speak.
Shortly afterwards he made Downhill, also with Novello, and a good movie too, especially the ending.
The Lodger is also credited with being the first film where Hitchcock started making his trademark cameos, one of him at a news desk early in the film and once again in the crowd near the end.
Hitchcock also has nothing nice to say in the film about media sensationalism, which is the cause of much of the widespread panic caused by the murders.
Silent film acting is also very different from acting in a 'talkie'.
This works better than the later sound version, although that is also pretty interesting.
It also made directors search for better visuals to compensate the absence of the spoken text.
He also likes blondes, especially golden-curled heroine, and Avenger-bait, June Tripp (as Daisy Bunting).
Suspicion begins to fall upon Mr. Novello, who also has a thing for blondes.
Besides the outstanding film narrative and excellent camera-work, there is also a good deal of wit: the Londoners, like any other European commoners, watch with fascination the story of this dangerous criminal who terrifies a whole population and defies the police.
There are a lot of scenes in "The Lodger" wherein Herr Hitchcock's talent for creating mysterious atmosphere is well demonstrated; the influence of German cinema-with which Herr Hitchcock was very familiar-is also apparent in his technique.
There are also a couple of examples of artistic cinematography and symbolic imagery, but it never really pays off.
These early Hitchcock efforts have been easy to find for a long time now except for "The Lodger", and "Blackmail" which is also part of the set.
But note also the superposition of images to denote imagination and memory.
There's also a scene in which a sexy young girl is happily taking a bath while the lodger tries to sneak into the bathroom.
We can also tell early on that Hitchcock was interested in using his camera to involve the audience in the film, throwing in point-of-view shots or drawing our attention to specific items.
There's also of course a "wrong man", although here he appears more as the subject of a whodunit.
It's also nowhere near being Hitch's best silent film, even though it tends to be remembered over more polished works like The Ring and The Manxman.
He also made the first of his famous cameo appearances, twice actually, which would also become part of his trademark.
Novello would also star in THE LODGER's 1932 British talkie remake.
It also moves a bit too slow.
It was also the real start of suspense films in England...  "The Lodger," based on a novel by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes, was set in a Jack the Ripper-style murder wave in a foggy London...
), and most had no idea the song and movie were connected (I also read that Martin's comedic timing slightly saves the family film).
Burt Kwouk is also back reprising his reoccurring role as Kato, the late Clouseau's humble servant.
However, altho I blame the problem in "Son" more on Blake Edwards, it is also true that if Benigni were in a Pink Panther movie with good scenes, the movie would be only mediocre.
Either way they should of gotten Joe Montegna for Dean, being that he's portrayed Dino in a movie already and Brad Garrett should of done that little appearance by Jackie Gleason, also being that he played Jackie Gleason on "Gleason" that CBS movie.
Mention should also be made of Paula Cale as Dean's first wife, Bettya and to Kate Levering as Dean's second wife, Jeanne.
Jeremy Northam also gave a stellar performance as the stoic Dean Martin.
It is also a great illustration of the fact that, no matter how cerebral men get, show us a pretty girl and we become jibbering idiots!
I also read the book and found the movie to be every bit as good.
Painful cameos by Walter Huston and Sugar Ray Robinson, both of whom look like they wanted to be somewhere else, also burn themselves into my battered brain pan.
The only honest performance was turned in by Buck Henry, who plays a raving mental patient- of course, since he also wrote the screenplay for this abomination, it was probably only typecasting.
It also offers a chance to experience the sexual permissiveness and hallucinatory extravagance of 1960s society, in a film made just as the cinema was breaking away from the Production Code into a new and exciting era of relaxed censorship and franker morality.
Elsa Martinelli is also creepy and sexy and John Huston lends gruff support.
"The Water Horse" a fantasy that is light and family-friendly, but also carries an important life lesson.
Kids will like Crusoe's cuteness and occasional comic relief, but parents will also be fulfilled, as the film is not obnoxiously zany or as drenched with annoying pop culture references as many "family movies" tend to be.
I also found it well-shot.
As for myself, not only did it do that and more, it also had me think about myself, and my current situation in life, and since my country damaged me so hard, I guess in a similar way, I wont experience a great deal if at all.
For definitive to date ... you'll have to go to Werner Herzog's (he produced, starred and co-wrote - with Zak Penn who also directed)"Incident at Loch Ness".
It also boasts impressive camera-work and effective CGI.
This is also the first portion of a two-part "Loch Ness Saga" which will include a review of Beyond Lock Ness.
Director Jay Russell also invests much effort into incorporating computer animation into the motion picture.
The underwater scenes as also adroitly crafted.
But it also has a lot of story behind it, too.
There is also a short side-story about Lewis, the handyman who shows up to help the family.
There is also the story of a mother trying to protect her family from the horrors of war, even as it sits down right in her own backyard.
All actors who took the part of Angus were superb, special effects were also superb and I recognised some of the locations.
The fact that people said it was "family friendly" was also a strong turn-off: kiddie characters, themes ... 'nuf said.
The special effects in this movie are also stunning with the occasional blip here and there but this does not create a hindrance to your viewing pleasure.
About the pg13 though, F bomb was dropped once (twice if you count a replay of it saying) The musical score also did a nice touch to the scenes.
The Director, Jay Russell, has helmed other very successful films (including a little-known but personal favorite "End of the Line") which were also obviously "fiddled with" by studio decree.
Because many of her films were action films and westerns, it's easy to forget that O'Hara was also an excellent actress.
Creators of heart-felt films tend to make them extra-sappy, which also seems to defeat the purpose (at least for me).
The Return of Bigfoot was also a great 2 part Bionic Crossover with both Steve and Jamie and Bigfoot was played by Ted Cassidy.
Unfortunately, the last Bigfoot episode (also with Ted Cassidy) called Bigfoot V made in season five fell flat and was pathetic.
This, surprisingly enough, leads him to rediscover Christianity and learn a humble grace that seems a contradiction to the usual (and also, ehrm, historical) image of the Crusades.
The film's portrayal of King Philip II Augustus of France through C. Henry Gordon is the complete opposite to how history describes Philip and Saladin also receives a romanticized and westernized portrayal.
While the quite historically inaccurate and freaking weird love triangle between King Richard, Berengaria, and Saladin is the main focus of the film, Christianity is also clearly a primary element.
Certainly a decent cop - thriller; it's quite entertaining despite some actions sequences that are really unlikely (they could also be called brainless).
It's also a refreshingly mature approach to make Saladin an honourable foe, although there is of course still the obligatory moustachioed villain in the form of some anachronistic minor king (played by Joseph Schildkraut, naturally).
He also wanted to show that Saladin was as "knightly" as any of the Crusaders.
It's also an interesting contrast to Kingdom of Heaven.
Mos Def also delivers an outstanding performance through the use of his accent and his hilarious anecdotes throughout the movie.
I would recommend this film just for its superb photography - except that it also happens to be a lavish, well-plotted gangster film.
In a way, she is also young Jinbao, going back many years.
His Raise the Red Lantern (1991) also shows in a different way the moral corruption of what might be called the ancient regime.
He also has a riddle that is not answered till near the end of the film.
She plays a "moll" , also a singing star triggering more than an ample reward for the conniving under bosses who would try to topple the boss.
This leads to a few laughs, but also some uncomfortable moments--as there were just too many scenes of intensely scared black people--a crappy stereotype from the era.
It is also interesting to note that the accident with a prop bomb which claimed index finger and thumb from his right hand and nearly killed him happened during production of Haunted Spooks, halting production for some months, and the prosthetic glove by wore to disguise this is first evident here.
This swift reveal also destroys much of the opportunity this movie had to keep us engaged.
I especially loved all of the bad 80s references, which added some reality to what a call a biopic of the 1980s (which also proves to be one the most turbulent decades fashion wise).
Adam Sandler is fantastic - so sweet, but also hilariously (makes-you-feel) sympathetic when he gets mad at his ex-fiance in the song he shows Julia.
A great performance also came from Drew Barrymore as the waitress Julia Sullivan and cousin Holly Sullivan was portrayed well by Christine Taylor.
And romantic comedies are also among my favorites.
The main reason I can honestly say why people like this movie (especially me) is because it has humor and an element of romance as well... let's also not forget that this was set in 1985; that gives the cast an excuse to dress like a flashback.
Oh and it also stars 2 of the most charming actors- Drew Barrymore, as Julia and Adam Sandler, as Robbie.
It is a nice (and funny) comedy about a guy (wedding singer Sandler) who has been dumped by his fiancee and is soon falls in love with (waitress) Drew Barrymore who is also engaged, but isn't in love either.
Robbie Hart is a genuinely likable character; he's a person I would like to have as a friend, and he's a performer I would gladly hire to sing at my OWN wedding (Sandler also seems completely comfortable with his character, while even Drew Barrymore sometimes sounds like she's merely reciting written dialogue).
Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast.
The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi, who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start.
The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a 'Fonz' type, womanising character.
The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one; the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with; it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer, all that matters is the love between two people.
I think that because of it's relative obscurity on adult swim it's overshadowed by Family Guy and South Park(both of which I also love).
I also love how people in the show seem so violent for absolutely no reason such as the Flintstones sketch.
I also love the sketch of Scooby Doo and Jason.
It was just so funny, also in the end when Velma loses her virginity to him.
I also recommend it if you like random violence on shows.
I think so far the funniest season is season 3, but all of them are also hilarious!
I would have enjoyed this when I was in 3rd grade, but I also thought the parody of the Barney theme song was clever and funny (I hate you, you hate me, so lets go out and kill Barney...) Why do you think references to other TV shows and movies are so funny?
Robot Chicken puts an adult twist on all the shows I loved as a kid, like GI Joe, Thundercats, Transformers, and Star Wars, but also makes fun of newer shows like That 70's Show (with the voices of the actors from the actual show), Kill Bill, and reality shows like The Real World.
First, i'm a fan of stop motion because I grew up on Gumby and i have also experienced using it.
I also am a fan of Mary McDonnell's work from Dances With Wolves, but her smugness her seemed rather 1 dimensional; albeit not a great role to begin with.
I would love to see this movie another time and I hope you also pick up a copy of it.
I decide to watch this one for two main reasons: first, it has a still young-looking James Mason, appearing in his thirtieth movie (he first appeared in 1935) and there's also one of the heavies of the thirties and forties, Herbert Lom, once again showing his under-rated acting ability.
I was also surprised at the great camera work: some truly imaginative interiors, great use of shadows and lighting, and quite an interesting denouement between the two men at the top of a building, again with some brilliant camera work.
What it also had going for it was a very European setting and sensibility, very fitting for the plot.
This mild-mannered masterpiece (if not a real classic in the wake of "Rock & Rule", also produced by Nelvana, as well as the Disney films of the early 90's) is so sweet, you'll think the whole world needs more films than this and not slice-fests like Q & U's "Kill Bill".
It came out the year I was born, and I'm reasonably sure that it is also the very first movie I ever saw in my entire life.
There was also Cree Summer, who did voices in various different cartoon series', and of course, Billie Mae Richards (Rudolph).
It's pretty enjoyable, but it also has a lot of frightening parts.
To help lighten the mood, there are also some catchy songs in this movie as well, which are all done by famous pop artists such as Carol King and John Sebastian.
I am also a sensitive person by nature, and I attribute that to watching the Care Bears as a child.
its also when you first meet the care bear cousins, which are a bunch of jungle animals and at the end they all get their little tummy-pictures.
It also wasn't offending to the Hearing people in my class, so that is a plus for any Hearing person looking at this movie.
Specter is doing more than just run the hospital though: He also likes to sacrifice his subjects to Satan.
Demi Moore has also an inspired acting, in the role of a mother in a dilemma between telling a secret and hiding the truth.
And Glenne Headly is also great, in the role of an abused and very unsecured low class woman.
Demi shows her mettle, she also shows what it's like to come to the end of a violent union.
I can't figure who wouldn't be, but she was also strength for her friend.
Bruce Willis is also in this film but he playes her best friends abusive, drunk husband.
It makes you wonder how the judicial system can ever figure out who's telling the truth and also how many guilty people are acquitted because of their acting abilities.
No, also the cast isn't very believable, except maybe for the policewoman, who knew all along how it would end, and wisely didn't talk.
Willis is also very good as evil and abusive husband Jim.
Set in New Jersey, the directing is also good, with flashing images and slow motion effects.
Glenne Headly (Joyce) is also outstanding while Bruce Willis is excellent as Joyce's drug-addled, boozing, wife-beating loser of a husband.
I would also like to complain about a movie that acts out a false story told by one of the characters as though the story were true.
The continuous gun fire also made sure that there was some bloody pulp.
But, it also gives us nothing to hold on to.
- also about nurses on Bataan.
The shift stings, but also points out realities she's not entirely uncomfortable with.
This movie is also a reminder that most Americans during the war saw the fall of Bataan and the Phillippines as the major tragedy of the time.
Like "Cry Havoc" (also made in 1943 but with a small cast and a modest set), this is a film about American Army nurses stranded on Corregidor, Philippines during the horrific time when General MacArthur was ordered to retreat to Australia.
The balance of violence and romance works; and commendable also is the script's restraint coupled with unexpected plot turns and un-clichÃ©d character studies.
Some of the surviving nurses of Corregidor were also brought in during production as technical advisors to the film makers.
He's also really bad at his job, and we see how poorly managed and worse-for-wear the facility is as Hickock inspects the place..pipes often spit steam, water leaks are apparent, and rats are visible in the kitchen area.
The cast is also better than usual for this sort of thing, with Fletcher given the best part as the too-dedicated scientist.
Those interested can also take note that there's a dose of both female and male nudity on display here.
Cardone, who also gave us the terrifically trashy "The Forsaken" and the pleasingly eerie "Wicked Little Things," maintains a snappy pace throughout, stages the genuinely startling shock scenes with considerable harrowing aplomb, and does a deft job of effectively creating a clammy, creepy and downright unsettling nightmarish claustrophobic atmosphere.
The rebellious young girl who tries to see beneath the propaganda images is also on psychoanalytical trip to confront her family history.
Well, basically the catch of the movie is the intertwine of the story with the girl on the way of her desire and the political level which makes this trip also a trip of a historical clearing up.
The story must be autobiographical to some extent, since we see Agnieszka encountering political opposition to her digging too deeply into the past trying to reconstruct Birkut's life and figure out why he essentially dropped from the scene after having been so highly visible; there is also a famous film director in the movie whom we get to know well.
MAN OF MARBLE is a testament to those who had to live through the oppression of Communism, and also to those who are still living under its iron fist.
While I felt that all the actors were superb in their performance I also felt that there should be more of a story-line.
I also thought too much time was spent on trivial dialogue between Thurman and Lewis about hairspray, what to drink , where to sit in the bar and what not, but maybe that was the intention of the director....
Supporting cast members Rowlands and Lewis portray characters who are also manless but with contrastingly better coping skills.
This film has some outstanding performances and is also realistic, amusing without being comical, and hard-edged without being hard-boiled.
As it is set in the 80's there are some great soundtracks, and there is also a parallel story with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara (as Nick) who develop a relationship in the unlikely environment of Bayonne, New Jersey.
Juliette Lewis is also believable as Beth, a high-school dropout who has a young daughter, and no husband.
As the girls struggle with Life issues they discover their greatest strength lay in their own closeness, no matter how vulnerable that also makes them to each other.
Uma Thurman plays "Deb", a self-centered secretary who doesn't want anyone to be happy unless she's happy, including her best friend "Beth" (also expertly played by Juliette Lewis) and her mother (Gena Rowlands).
Tragically flawed with low self-esteem, she covers it up with fantasies of happily ever after, even fooling herself, while the more level-headed, but also flawed Beth tries to do her best to stay happy with her absent-fathered daughter and inject a little reality into Deb's world.
There are ASTOUNDING performances by Uma Thurman (obviously,she won the golden globe she was so great) and also by Gena Rowlands and Jullite Lewis.I'll admit it, I laughed and cried during the course of this movie.
Juliette Lewis, as Beth, is also endearing.
Sanjay Dutt plays a police officer who gets caught up in the proceedings and also involved are a bandit (who does nothing for the script) and Contractor's father (who also doesn't do a damn thing for the film).
Dhamaal also revolves around not less than 10 crores , lustily eyed by a group of assorted people , and a smart inspector , even the Commissioner !
Their ride through the mountains is also pleasing to the eyes .
i remembered a scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday , when he gets locked up in a roadside loo , and also gets entangled with a young boy , who is left behind on the platform.
On many occasions, it is also inspired by Starsky and Hutch.
Though Sanjay Dutt is also there in the movie, but the young boys does a good job, and make this movie a perfect comedy, this is a type of movie which you can see again and again, A complete funny entertainer.
The dialogue in the group therapy sessions is so full of gay clichÃ©s that it's harmful as well as painful, and even the conversations with the older lover are also full of clichÃ©s with no affection expressed between the two.
The cutting is also a incoherent thing, they jump all over the place with not so much connections.
There were also inexplicable overdubs of people's voices!
I've also collected many of 'The Destroyer' books, and at one time had close to 100 of them.
Skynet develop sophisticated flying machines yet they also build motorbikes utilising the combustion engine?
Is is important to note that in watching this film, you will also learn the secret technique of bringing a woman to ecstasy in seconds!!!!
Comical at times, he also makes you believe that he COULD kill you with two fingers.
Smith was also done very well.
I have also seen very poor quality bootlegs for sale on eBay (don't but this trash!)
We also see how Crockett and Tubbs' relationship got off to a rocky start, but the groundwork is laid where it's easy to realize how good they work together.
On the other hand Sonny Crockett is a Miami detective who just watched his partner die in car explosion, Crockett is also known as the detective who doesn't always work "by the book".
Hikaru's also at the center of a love triangle that sees his emotions split between a cute Chinese girl who ends up going from waitress to pop idol overnight, and his by-the-book career military commanding officer; this triangle is milked for all it's worth and is the primary reason that the series proved so popular with female viewers, along with the romantic trials and tribulations of the rest of the voluminous cast.
;o) Of course the summary line is also a link, that this movie is obviously linked to American teen horror movies of the recent past and tried to copy them as good as it could.
I mean I liked "I know what you did last summer", but it had also a lot to do with Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and the others.
I also welcome this movie because Horror has a very small tradition in European film-making.
There's also stuff from other kinds of flicks (a possible visual The Empire Strikes Back-reference).
This is a decent episode but also one that is easily forgotten.
After the original series, it was also used in the spin-offs (minus prequel show Enterprise) and three of the eleven - so far - Trek movies (The Voyage Home, First Contact and J.J. Abrams' reboot), always to great effect.
My friends that I saw this with, who were NOT familiar with the XMen beyond the promos, also enjoyed this very much.
His scenes with Rogue (Anna Pacquin, also excellent) were believable and often touching.
I also liked the commentary in the film that did not hit us over the head with the shovel.
Not only does Singer orchestrate an entertaining but intelligent yarn around titans of Good and Evil battling for supremacy with the fate of mankind at stake, but he also tackles important cultural issues integral to the plot that enhance its subtext about intolerance.
Homo superiorÂwill suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous.
Not only can Xavier read your innermost thoughts, but he also can exert control of another person's body and speak through them with the ease of a ventriloquist.
Although Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese does steal the show, also Marcus rights character and the way he s portrayed soon becomes a positive in the film.
This is also shows MC G either didn't care too much about the film, or just was poor in the ironing out of the script as he left many loopholes.
This is OK because Connor says its a different future, but then MC G used a lot of history form the others, such as kyle Reese being Connor's dad, and the photograph, this is OK also, but MC G should of chose to base it on the whole history, or non at all, leaving many loopholes because he doesn't decide.
There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g.
There are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.
He also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but I thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak.
The film also has a good international cast, Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellon, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden and Anna Paquin.
The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise.
To a lesser extent Rebecca Romjin has also become a major actress.
There is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers.
As each mutant character is given a past (to give him a motivation) and a weakness, the film's plot never got boring because I also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselves.
I think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him.
The effects in general are also very well made.
Bryan Singer, however, did a wonderful job at making X-Men a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book, but also the general movie-goer as well.
The acting is also quite good on the whole.
Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.
It's a small world, because not only have Manu and Mehdi met through Mehdi's well-heeled wife, Sarah (a friend of Adrien's); Mehdi also minds the seedy area where Manu lives with Julie and consorts with the local whores.
They also have a baby she doesn't much care for and she is getting tired of writing children's books and wants to write a regular novel.
The young gay boy from the mountains who goes wild in Paris has close parallels with the young Pierre (played by an actor named Manu, Manuel Blanc) in the 1991 J'embrasse pas (I Don't Kiss), who likewise comes from the mountains, winds up in a promiscuous gay life as a hustler, and initially finds an older gay protector at a Parisian cruising area (and this film also has BÃ©art in the cast).
The couple makes love again, but Mehdi also begins taking Julie up in the little airplanes that were part of his courtship of Manu and she begins to replace Manu in his affections.
It's by far the most complex role and also, perhaps for that very reason, the most believable.
There he meets Adrien, an older man, also gay.
Adrien is also a good friend of a young woman, Sarah, who's just had a baby, and her husband, Mehdi.
What also moved me in particular is the character of Julie, Manu's sister, played by Julie Depardieu.
AndrÃ© TechinÃ© also may not ring any bells, but anyone who is interested in French film-making has to see something by him.
Natiale meanwhile had become very friendly with both young Person and Kurt, Mark Rendell & Shawn Roberts, who both work as volunteers at Brenda's animal shelter and also have a stake in her not having to lose it to the bank.
less sympathetic protagonist, but also its more primitive quality (Avery's Fred Quimby-produced MGM efforts being generally superior to his stuff at Warners).
She was engage in a War Against Rape to save innocent women and also joins an Urdu newspaper AMN with us.
5.Scen at marriage party gives a good glimpse of social interactions in Punjab also how feudal elements still hold sway.
Though khamosh pani doesn't tackle these issues directly but shows a changing social scenario in Pakistan during the seventies & eighties.this movie subtle also reflects the futility of partition & insecurities of the time.It should be a lesson to all the people who give more importance to theology than humanity.
I also appreciated the fact that they picked actors that could actually act.
The one which stood out most to me is the one where Clive Owen and Monica Bellucci (also perfect) are making love and the baddies bust in.
I also loved the scene when he chastises a mother for smacking her kid.
Clive Owen is such a great actor and he beautifies the film in the way he eats his carrots and also with all the tricks and stunts.
The film also has a very good sense of humour and it made me laughed.
It also failed as a comedy because I think there was only one (maybe two) parts where I laughed.
This film will appeal to almost anyone who likes action and also a few female actors who add some sex appeal.
Also, the fact that it is about the mass media and war coverage was also pretty interesting.
The movie left me feeling a little unsatisfied but overall it is in itself (i think) relatively unbiased, showing all types of reporters and also things that may or may not be motivating the US government.
The acting also turned out surprisingly well with Sam Worthington (playing Marcus) and Anton Yelchin (playing Kyle Reese) being the two stand out performers.
The film is not perfect; there are pacing problems and a series of annoying/confusing flashbacks that break up the narrative; but it also features some strong characters and an interesting plot line with some ideas that actually do hold some weight.
The central plot and the problem between the two main characters are open for debate, and also give the audience plenty to think about.
All of the programs, not only entertained but also made you think, dream and look at the world, thinking of the future.
One was "The Twilight Zone",which was hosted and narrated by Rod Serling whom also was responsible for writing some of the episodes.
Not only did John Newland introduced us to the episode that followed not to mention being a congenial host,the series also employed the talents of performers who invested their material with conviction and authenticity to spare,from long-established character actors to at the time rising stars who were making their mark on their careers,such as: Christopher Lee,George Grizzard,Torin Thatcher,William Shatner, Alfred Ryder,Suzanne Pleshette, Pernell Roberts, Ross Martin, Patrick O'Neal, Elizabeth Montgomery,Edward Binns,Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn,Donald Pleasence,Paul Richards,Dick York,Jack Lord,Louise Fletcher, Barbara Bain,Barbara Eden,Robert Loggia,Claude Akins,and even Warren Beatty.
Even Cloris Leachman and Mike Connors and also Peter Graves were guest stars in this series.
The film also lacks a lot of humour, and while it's clear that the filmmakers were not making a serious horror film to the audience; apparently they themselves were oblivious that fact!
Added to this, as a vengeful crusader for shark equality he's not only a murderous psychopath, he's also an unfriendly, arrogant man with a big ugly medallion and no sense of humor.
Stein is also extremely naive and dumb, as he 'donates' sharks, supposedly for good causes, to a science lab and to a sleazy (and mega-fat) bar-owner for an original entertainment act.
His character also hasn't got a sense of humor, which is a huge mistake according to me.
I think I was also sucked in by the fact that this was from the writers of Vegas Vacation, which despite many others opinions is a National Lampoon movie I very much enjoyed.
I also disagree vehemently with people who say: "this should be seen especially by African-Americans."
The music, primarily by the McIntosh County Shouters, is also great.
With that out of the way let me also address the clown KompliKated (might as well add the extra "K") and his blatantly ignorant comments on this special.
I also disliked Wonderland's recurring gimmicky motifs - eg.
All in all, this is a good movie, with some flaws but also beautiful moments.
It is also the documentary style that makes this movie so real.
All of these factors that have left the characters in the story with a quiet desperation, also pull the audience into a world of imbalance.
The natural performance of the cast is also outstanding, making the story very real and credible.
(And also Tokyo's mysterious look in Stratosphere Girl.)
(He also wrote music for The Piano.)
But thanks also for a fascinating insight into fine character-making in a very enjoyable film.
As for the enemies, they not only display great strenght and cruelty, but some of them are also allowed to develope as characters, which is extremely rare for bad-guys.
My younger sister also likes it.
Was also about the only other homage to the originals (the truck chase from the trailer is excellent as well).
Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described this way.
I also really hope that they keep making InuYasha movies as well..
Some of the antics by the characters (eg, Kagome's "sit", Miroku's obsession with women, Naraku in general) also dragged on far too long.
If you watch an episode you'll love all the characters (how to bo to love inoccent Rin) (even Naraku is an evil character you'll like) also its genius how all characters including Naraku lead you threw the storyline !
There's also Kagome, the teenage girl who stumbles in the well.
Reading some online spoilers also helped ^_^  As I'm not that far along into the story, there isn't much that I have to say.
I also think that Thomas' work on this is something that shows a lot of potential and talent.
i also love his wicked sense of humor throughout.
also, i forgot to mention that the music fit each scene, and i really wish there was a soundtrack.
i also loved the creepiness of the house and how the scenes were mostly done in the dark.
the special features were also great, and hats off to the whole crew who did such a great job.
i've also ordered a second copy just in case i wear this one out.
also a little side note, judd looked adorable with his crazy hair & beard.
The PM also said they were still searching for a distribution deal, so I would like to wish Mr. Zambeck best of luck in his endeavors and would strongly recommend checking this out once it becomes available.
It is also interesting to get a listen to some of the other musicians of Brazil in some of the soundtrack.
The statements of the prisoners about the massacre were also unnecessary, as they build a sometimes false impression of who lived or died, and prematurely at that.
It has also been said that the film lacks focus, with many prisoners getting a little detail, while others get none at all.
It has also been said that the film builds a false, overly negative portrait of life in Brazil.
I also zoned out during the drawn-out battle with the Schwarzenator near the end, because I really didn't care about John Connor (or his cute, perky wife, though she was never in danger the entire movie - another dramatic mistake).
A sad film, but also one with a great deal of humor.
You see this in OZ also, as they have flashbacks to life outside of prison leading up to their time in lockdown.
There is also a man who makes strange patchwork Montgolfier style balloons that he tries to send out of the prison walls, which are always too high, there's a very surreal shot of one of these balloons rising and then slowly bursting into flames.
Generally the relationship between the prison officials and the prisoners is relaxed, the prisoners get a lot of privileges for behaving, they can have televisions if they pay for them, they can have long term sexual relationships, they also have a visitors day where families will come in with picnics, and they sit and eat them in the courtyard, or go off to specially prepared cells for conjugal visitations.
The prisoners have also decorated the prison, often with text, for example scripture, but also with many beautiful graffiti.
The film starts off with lots of characters shouting and arguing, also I am not used to watching films with subtitles so to say I was slightly confused would be an understatement!!
It also has sub stories on how they became to be inmates.
It is also known that a large amount inside Carandiru was jailed without trial or lawful judgement.
Hector Babenco, whose career also undertakes prison movies such as Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985) and Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco (1981), brings together one of the best cast seen for this type of genre.
Not just the obvious ones like the music choices or one liners, but also subtle things like single handed shotgun cocking or single handed pipe blows, or the choice of settings and shots.
This wonderful cast also includes Lewis Stadlen, Harriet Harris, Byron Jennings, Terry Beaver, and many more.
Lane did not have the crusty, elderly asperity of the great Woolley, but he did have a malevolent elfin charm reminiscent of Woolcott (a man who was all too easy to dislike - Woolcott was also the model for Waldo Lydecker in LAURA, which just goes to show his popularity).
A very good, intellectually and romantically stimulating and wonderful film directed and written by Julie Delpy, who also plays the main character, Marion, to Adam Goldberg's Jack; the two are a couple who spend two days in Marion's hometown Paris, before heading to their home in New York.
Delpy also does a fine job given that she's clearly shuttling between different ends of the camera - not too 'kooky'.
Julie Delpy directed, wrote, edited, produced, composed the original score and also is the main actress.
I must say that it enhanced my appreciation of the movie to discover that Julie Delpy's parents played themselves (and, if I understand correctly, the apartment was genuine as well) and Julie Delpy and Adam Goldberg were also involved at one time, and per one interview with Julie Delpy- monogamy was not exactly her strong suit) Julie Delpy has a deft touch with all this and with numerous details (including the rabbit dish episode which I experienced in almost an identical fashion in Italy once, the tourists seeking to travel the path of the Da Vinci code) I love the ambiguous celebratory ending and I love the way the Da Vinci tourists reappear at the end.
And also, just like in Woody Allen movies!
Julie Delpy makes an impressive first work as a director in 2 Days in Paris,a great movie.The best thing about this movie is,no doubt,the screenplay because it makes very intelligent commentaries about the modern relationships and it also has brilliant dialogs.I would say this movie is a twist between Annie Hall and Before Sunset,because it has the intelligent humor of the first one and the brilliant dialogs from the second one.Delpy makes a pretty good performance but Adam Goldberg really surprised me.This actor made a perfect performance and he does not seem to be acting at all and I think that's the greatest achievement of any actor.The only fail I found on this movie is that some scenes are a little bit pretentious.2 Days in Paris is a brilliant movie I truly enjoyed.I totally recommend it.
If you got the tickets for free, you might consider a trip to the cinema, but you could also do something more useful and interesting, like picking your nose or cleaning the toilet...
2 days in Paris (2007) was produced/written/directed/edited/scored/starred by Julie Delpi who also recruited her real parents to play the parents of Marion, her alter ago.
I also did not find charming Marion sending to her family via e-mail the picture of naked Jack with the colorful balloons.
Whether one wants to call him touchy and easily offended will probably also depend on whether you think that, in the first place, he is being treated badly by all those slightly crazy Parisians or whether you would rather want to say that he is a bit stiff and inhibited.
It's refreshing to find out that not only does Julie Delpy act brilliantly as the naive and clumsy Marion but she also directed and wrote it, heck she even composed the soundtrack.
There is also lots to say about relationships and how they work, or don't.
While the film sometimes relies on stereotypes (particularly with some of the minor characters), it also presents rich, fleshed- out characters that are clearly individuals with their own histories and experiences that they and those around them have to contend with.
There are also moments where Delpys character is a little annoying, but those are thankfully far and few between.
She has also aptly captured the emotions and dilemmas of 30-something adults who, under it all, are still looking for meaning, belonging and peace.
This movie also made me feel squeamish at times.
Brian Lackey is a boy who, also at the age of eight, experiences a traumatic event after blacking out for several hours and waking up to a bloody nose.
Tractenberg and Licon are also worth seeing the film for.
His scenes with Brian are probably my favorite as it shows just how much he cares about him, and also gives Brian that true friend he has always wanted and needed.
Brian, who was also abused, can not remember it at all and, instead, believes he was abducted by aliens and he spends his entire life trying to figure out answers.
He stole every scene as the intriguing Neil McCormick and makes you scared of him but also begging for him to appear back on screen.
And it is also about the connections and bonds we create with each other during our lives and how distance and time do not break them.
Violence is at minimum for even a Hammer film, but what we also get which is a trend at this time are films where there is no recognizable star power.
Pippa Steel is also awesome eye candy.
While I will agree that Lust for a Vampire is entertaining overall to a degree - it is also heavily flawed and unworthy of the great Hammer tradition, Jimmy Sangster the director, and many of the Hammer legions of production workers who have worked and created much superior work.
It also has bizarre parallels and clues that didn't occur to me until hours after I'd seen it.
(You'll probably recognize this guy...he's super-creepy looking, and yet also terrifyingly cool & inscrutable...he played Capone's main henchman Frank Nitti in THE UNTOUCHABLES) He joins the John back at his stark-white apartment, and a scene which seems destined for tension, dread and horror...suddenly becomes beautiful, incredibly sad, and transcendent.
Importantly he also shows the abuser's self-justification process.
This film also had to be made.
It is also a difficult film to watch.
The Bad News: There's some really nice moments, but there's also some really off moments here.
That also limits the action in the film, and other than the beginning and the end, there isn't much of that in the film.
Greg Araki has made this novel into something that cuts emotionally but could also have a great impact in how people learn to deal with a painful past and the defenses they have built up to protect potentially devastating secrets.
Amnesia, also, hits Crystal and when she comes knocking on Tom's door, she is so confused that Tom invites her in and vows to find her family.
But, alas, an evil supernatural being known as the collector (Jeff Fahey) comes to town, also, for in her present state, the collector can capture the fairy and put her in a bottle.
It also has an imaginative plot and a capable cast, with Caulfield making a nice, caring father.
but again, this is also a good movie for the whole family to watch.
She is also very beautiful.
And the cast is also quite good, particularly lead Glynnis O'Connor.
On a couple of vampire websites also appeared a portrait of Yutte Stensgaard by him taken from the film.
While I have not lived in Mississippi, I have visited it and South Georgia, and also resided in rural northern Florida for a time.
Mark (also played by Gibson) has purchased the home at a steal because of its disturbing past, which he isn't aware of.
This is given far less weight, partially because it's not so directly related to what's on the screen, and partially because this is impossible to "measure" for most newer films; this last factor also only tends to help ratings; I don't really subtract any points for cultural/historical _unimportance_.
It's also helpful to remember that I begin all films at a 9 (an "A"), and then score up or down accordingly.
I also got a lot of value out of it.
But the gore is also very well done.
There's also an extremely important and attractive shot that breaks the monochromaticism in the dÃ©nouement, right before the obligatory and welcomed doom-laden "tag".
Ronald Colman gets his wish in "If I Were King," a 1938 film also starring Basil Rathbone and Francis Dee.
Although he showed talent in administration from an early age, he also was quite adept at angering his father, Charles VII, and ultimately had to take refuge at the Burgundian court until the time of his succession to the throne.
The extended scene where he, while hidden, metes out sentences to his friends who were also caught stealing, is pure delight, and very worthy of Sturges.
Ronald Colman and Basil Rathbone, two wonderful actors having the time of their careers playing wittily written opposites who are also spiritual soulmates -- Francois Villon, the poetic rebel, born into poverty with a noble soul, and Louis XI, King of France, born into privilege but with a rebel's iconoclasm.
Slaughter Studios pictured itself a horror movie--it also tried to be campy and funny--unfortunately it missed on all counts.
Kuddos also to composer Christopher Farrell (a long time Katkin collaborator) whose effective score guides the viewer from laughter to fear and back to laughter with ease.
Yes, the movie also looses points because nobody in can act worth a crap.
They should also not be allowed to reproduce, as it would be hazardous to society.
Among the waterlogged patrons seeking shelter are: a formerly wronged business partner of Zucco's who'd like to kill him, a geeky embezzler looking to get away with $50,000 stolen loot, a gangster who's also interested in said loot, a young couple looking to get married behind the back of the girl's objecting old father, and dad himself - who's also hot on their trail.
These eclectic individuals include a vengeful escaped convict whom Bradford put in jail, a meek geeky bank teller who's trying to embezzle $50,000 bucks, a mean, ruthless mobster who also wants to get his grubby paws on the hot loot, a young couple who are planning to get married, and the huffy, overbearing, disapproving father of the bride-to-be.
All four of them have different personalities but that is also what makes their bond so strong.
She also wanted to make Darnell miserable after they broke up, calling him over to pick fights with him Wasn't she the one who cheated?
Her friend also acted like a total jerk towards the father of her own children when he came to pick up the kids.
Did she also want to do the same after Toni fired her as her assistant at her new real estate office?
He also hears that an English teacher is coming and when he arrives Lestrange tricks him into going to Venice for a month and now he can get the job at the school.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  Lestrange meets the PE teacher Janet Playfair (Suzanna Leigh) and also notices the arrival of Countess Herritzen (Barbara Jefford) who brings her niece Mircalla (Yutte Stensgaard) to the school and instantly Lestrange is infatuated with her.
One night Mircalla kills her lesbian roommate (Pippa Steele) and then when she finds out that Giles knows about her she kills him also.
The first film "The Vampire Lovers" is the best and a bonafide classic but this is a pretty darn entertaining film also.
I'll start with my obvious statement, that I'm not necessarily a big fan of musicals (quite the contrary) and while I will write that I also didn't enjoy "Sound of Music" as much, I am aware that some/many will dislike my comment here.
Note also that FLORENCE HENDERSON was not able to make another film in Hollywood but went directly to television and stayed there for a very successful run on "The Brady Bunch".
Christina Schollin is also very good as Theresa Berg, Grieg's patron and former lover.
Something else also bothered me - but I can't quite put my finger on it - the picture quality seemed off.
Also, I recently saw NIGHTANGEL (also by Drouin) and it is even better than this film--an amazing work of art from start to finish.
Film techniques are interesting too - borrows a little from Russian Arc and also, a little from Stalker (of which I've only seen a little - unfortunately).
The gasps heard all over the theater when Sam Neill is first seen (from Sybilla's POV in the tree) also made an indelible impression.
The musical score was also a delight.
A movie may also move at a pace that you are not used to and the pace of a specific film is chosen for a reason.
Sam Neill, also in one of the significant early roles of his career, is likewise charming as the young man who presents her with a tempting alternative to her ambition to become a writer and escape the frontier life forever.
I thought Stevie Wright was also very funny, but the ending was pretty lame.
Mike Myers also > plays the character of his scottish, immigrant father who is hilarious.
Charlie's dad (also Meyers) is hilarious with his outrageous Scottish accent and rude personality.
Alan Arkin, Michael Richards and Charles Grodin also provide the laughs in their cameos.
I also love the cameos of Allan Arkin, Steven Wright, Phil Hartman and especially Charles Grodin.
The movie also has a number of cameo's of gifted character actors who while only on the screen no more two minutes, deliver some classic comedic bits.
The sequence where Mike Myers introduces Nancy Travis to his family (Myers also plays his own father) is riotous.
Mike Myers also plays the role of Stuart Mackenzie Charlie's father.
The supporting cast also does excellent work, especially Anthony LaPaglia as Charlie's policeman buddy Tony.
In fact, it's his father's role that steals the show in both the Harriet meets Parents scene with his comments about his younger brother's "Heed" and also at the wedding with his shouting out "Lets get P*seed" at the end of the ceremony.
It's also the point when I began warming up to the Doggett and Reyes characters.
I also remember Harry Morgan from "Dragnet" as being the only cast member I recognized then or now.
Released in 1951, before racial tensions were to explode into American history, The Well is a brave offering from co-writer's Russell Rouse {also co-director} and Clarence Greene.
Apart from being one of the goriest films ever to garner an R rating, REAZIONE A CATENA is also something of a record holder when it comes to alternate titles.
The Count also disappears after this murder.
Later it is also revealed that Fossati is married to a fortune teller named Anna fossati.
Also gore fans may also be satisfied by the violence which is incredible for a movie of the early 70's.
The performances of Laura betti as the fortune teller who foresees doom and Leopoldo Trieste as her husband who dislikes Frank Ventura for attempting to damage the beauty of the bay, are also noteworthy.
The score is also quite excellent giving a mysterious feel to the whole movie.
One factor that places it in the elite list of giallos and horror movies in general is that it is also a fascinating character study and greed is a common factor throughout the movie.
The complex plot is also quite an achievement because at the end the pieces fall into place quite perfectly.
But the ending seems somewhat of a rushed job but I feel it also has a symbolism.
Also there is also another scene where two people are killed at once by a single spear when they are in bed together.
Not only are these murders extremely violent but they also set in motion the soon-to-be-standard slasher motive where teenage sex must result in gory death.
Upon hearing Of the Countess's death Frank Ventura (Cristea Avram) and his wife Laura (the rather attractive looking Anna Maria Rosati) also both travel to the bay to try and buy it so he can begin to a build long planned development that the Countess was so opposed to.
Four teenagers also turn up, George (Guido Boccaccini), Bobby (Roberto Bonanni), Patty (Paola Rubens) and Brunhilda (Brigitte Skay) all looking for somewhere to party.
This is Bavaâs third âbody countâ movie after BLOOD AND BLACK LACE (1964) and FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON (1970); however, given that teenagers are also involved here, this is the one which became the virtual template for all the teen slashers which stormed Hollywood in the late 1970s/early 1980s.
The narrative â in which members of the same family kill each other off because of an inheritance â brings to mind not only the âold dark houseâ-type thrillers like THE CAT AND THE CANARY but also the celebrated black comedy from Ealing Studios, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS (1949).
Incidentally, Bavaâs film has also been seen as a black comedy in some quarters â but itâs rather difficult to concur, in view of all the typical giallo viciousness (reportedly, former Bava collaborator Christopher Lee walked out of a screening of the film because of its excessive violence!).
It is certainly not a typical example for Horror's most glorious sub-genre which was single-handedly invented by Bava himself, but it is also undeniable that "A Bay Of Blood" does include many Giallo elements.
It is also one of the first films to include aspects of the future Slasher flick, and, along with Sergio Martino's awesomely nasty Giallo "Torso" (1973), it is THE film that influenced the genre the most.
The performances may not be the most important aspect of "A Bay Of Blood", but the cast includes several greats of Italian genre cinema, most memorably the great Luigi Pistilli (one of my favorite actors), the beautiful Claudine Auger, and Laura Betti, who also starred in Bava's "Hatchet For The Honeymoon".
He is also an incredibly talented cinematographer, as you can tell with many clever, artistic touches and how his camera looms for some time over the tranquil lake-front setting in between the very graphic murder sequences.
There's also some brief nudity.
Reazione a catena (also known as Bay of Blood or Twitch of the Death Nerve) is a true example of the Italian technique of film making, it's style over substance.
By the way, I have also seen Sedes en Belli and Witse, which are entertaining too.
The film is packed with some memorably graphic mayhem; the sickle to the face will always be my personal favorite, although there's also a nifty decapitation, and a show-stopping, prime example of coitus interruptus that was ripped off later in "Friday the 13th, Part 2".
What will give this film the edge over the many North American imitators that it inspired is the elegance and flair that Bava (also serving as his own cinematographer here, and doing an excellent job) brings to the proceedings.
I'll also find hard to forget the striking image of an octopus slithering over the face of one of the many victims.
The film is also enhanced by the lovely music of Stelvio Cipriani, which at times involves lots of percussion and becomes heavily atmospheric.
Bay of Blood is often noted as being an obvious inspiration on the Friday the 13th series, and when taking things such as the setting and a certain murder sequence into account, that is certainly true; but let's not forget that this is also a fantastic movie in its own right.
It hardly matters because the killings aren't being made by a single killer with a singular reason but by several killers, whom all have a confusing number of reasons (which can all be traced to greed), with few of the killers knowing that others are also killing other people at the same time and as the film progresses, the killers, in turn, also become victims themselves.
Combine this with the fact that the story's actions happens mostly within a brief time-line (except for the beginning, everything happens on the same day) BUT that it also goes back and forth in time, with flashbacks and such, and BOB, oddly enough never feels grounded to one specific time.
The location and sets were also good.
The flip side is that while it made me laugh, it was also exploring some real issues about relationships and commitment and man's difficulties doing either!
I also loved the play on Dreamworks' opening logo!
I also liked the back drop for the movie it was easy to follow and enjoy.
I also like the way the plot was carried out throughout the movie.
also the sexiness of it sure did a lot to make me want to add this movie to my collection and watch it quite a bit.
Kisses and Caroms is a hilarious indie film which packs the jokes in thick and fast, but also has rounded, believable characters and a truly enjoyable plot.
Sumuru, or Sumitra as she's also referred to, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise," played here by actress Eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in "Goldfinger."
These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru," sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design & visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "Some Girls Do," which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army.
Sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that's one of the secrets.
The clever marketeer is he is, Jess Franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like Mario Bava's ultimately sensational "Danger: Diabolik!".
The film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex.
Look at the movie "The Edge' - it's supposed to take place in Alaska, but they used Canada also.
I also loved the theme music.
Insightful as it is, I also found the film's bittersweet realism a bit unsettling at timesÂlike watching a sneak preview of "Sex in the City-30 Years Later."
It also had them protect their unexplored and pristine land with the bravery and ferocity of the then, back in the 1860's, Cheyenne Dogmen whom these now modern Indians are the descendants of.
P.S The movie besides its uplifting storyline and powerful acting by Tom Berenger Barbara Hershey and the Dogman's Indian Chief Yellow Wolf played by Steve Reevis is also beautifully narrated by actor and former rodeo clown, who's job is to distracts a wild 2,000 pound bull from goring a fallen rider, Wilford Brimley.
Barbara Hershey is also excellent as the professor obsessed with Indians.
I am also a Tom Berringer fan as well so what the heck...I figured I would give it a chance.
I also had a reminiscent thoughts of "Last of the Mohican's (Daniel Day Lewis) while watching this film, up until the point when I realize that this lost Indian tribe was more civilized than the law enforcement agency of the local town.
We also have a great fondness for Native American stories and traditions.
This scene didn't only send chills up my spine, but much to the credit of Tab Murphy, it brought tears to my eyes, as also did other scenes in the movie.
It had action, but was also humorous throughout.
I also have to mention the dog who seems to get a lot of his own scenes.
The opening sequence of the overhead shots and the introduction of the lead characters is also very well done, for the period.
I also like the way that Jean Hersholt's(spelling?
The well balanced script gives each character room to develop on their own, but also connects them perfectly to one another.
Greta Garbo also does a decent job in the film as the prime ballerina who just wants to be alone.
The movie "Grand Hotel" also has as one of its guests the flat broke and compulsive gambler Baron Felix Von Geigern, John Barrymore.
Baron Felix now on his last legs which he'll need crutches for if the "Boys" don't get their money is planning to rob the Great Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo, the worlds greatest ballerina who's also a guest at the hotel.
As for the meek and sensitive Otto, whom Preysing stepped on for some 30 years, he also left with Flaem for Paris to spend his last, and extremely happy, days with her at that city's "Grand Hotel".
This film also has a pair of Barrymores, with Lionel as the ailing Mr. Kringelein, looking to spend his final days in the lap of luxury, and John as the dashing Baron von Geigern, a hotel thief with a soft touch.
Grand Hotel still holds up today with its story line and performances but it is also an excellent example of a period that was about to come to an end (1932).
And it is also one of the MOST important movies in the History of CINEMA.
Designed by legendary art director Cedric Gibbons, who mixed Deco and Moderne styles to tremendous effect, each set was built specifically for the film and no detail was overlooked; Adrian's costumes were also meticulous in their combination of high-fashion and romance.
But if GRAND HOTEL is distinctly of its era in terms of visual style, it is also distinctly of its era in terms of performance, and it is here that we run into a bit of trouble.
John Barrymore was noted for his larger-than-life performances on the stage, and he brought that same quality to many silent films; less fortunately, he also carried into the sound era, and his performance reads as excessively large.
Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) is officially an stenographer and also an expensive 'working girl', making programs with her clients.
Lionel Barrymore's performance is also really memorable.
One can also add Senf (Jean Hersholt) who has to stay at his hotel job, while his wife is facing a dangerous childbirth which is worrying him to death.
Contrary to one of the comments below, the documentary also contains interviews with at least two Armenian historians as well.
It also highlights the Entente Powers culpability and their exploitation of nationalist fervor to destroy an Empire in an effort to gain control over natural resources- oil.
While they are very effective in their advocacy, their approach is also unethical because they use "selective truth" to "prove" their point.
They also know that most of us will jump on the bandwagon and sympathize with their claims.
It was directed by long-time collaborator Charles B. Griffith, who also wrote and directed "Eat My Dust" and has an uncredited small part as one of the deputies.
There's also a sub-plot involving a deranged group of sheiks out to uncover a secret recipe of moonshine...huh?
This one is special because it's another rip-off of SMOKEY & THE BANDIT, and also another with the name "Smokey" in the title (how many were there???).
After realizing how many precious classic Dodge Chargers were destroyed during the "Dukes of Hazzard" TV run, it's also kinda sad to see a hot '57 Chevy banged up in chases (watch the disappearing dents, they used more than one of course) but the highlight definitely is that great crash by the '57 through the roof (where of course, McNichol simply keeps driving after the car lands).
A few comments- First of all, I was student body president at Antelope Valley College when this movie filmed there-they got to film because they kicked $750 into the student government accounts and loaned us original prints of three films for an on-campus showing (they came back to re- shoot two scenes on a weekend, and snuck onto the football field by conning a security guard, btw)...I'm also a background extra in three different scenes in the first 10 minutes, and several of my friends are also in this movie.
The masterfully shot sinister landscapes also made me real nervous.
I also respect him as a person who stood firm on his political and social views.
I also wanted to welcome any comments, criticisms, and answer any questions anyone has about the film.
It is also the worst film of the series.
In addition to playing Jason, stuntman Kane Hodder also appears sans makeup as one of two FBI agents (he's the big, bearded one) guarding the morgue.
After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last.
The blood relative also has the power to stop Jason with a dagger that once impaled in his immortal heart will send him to hell and the bounty hunter knows that.
I also i am the biggest fun of nightmare on elm street and if this new movie is a sequel between Jason and Freddy much better!!!
Directed by Nick Quested who also has a role in the film as Deputy Carry I thought Seven Mummies was yet another below average, nothing special, utterly forgettable & stupid low budget shot on digital horror film that steal most of it's ideas from better films such as From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) amongst others.
In one laughable sequence, you would be forgiven for thinking "Jason" (or as I'd like to refer to him as...the Imposter) being reborn meant the world would end, however a mere 10 minutes or so after he was "reborn," he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger (who were the camp counselors who ignored Jason as he died...some ancient Sumarian or Egyptian people or something?
Of course, there is plenty of blood and gore (as the Friday films always seem to have), and there is also plenty to gross you out- but if you think or feel anything towards the horror icon that made these films successful, you ought to take a pass on this one.
Kane Hodder (in his third appearance as Jason) also gets a credit for stunts.
"Jason goes to Hell" is also incredibly lazy.
Yan Yee Kwan (sometimes Yam Sai-kun) is one of my favorite bad guys; he was also excellent in Fearless Hyena, Once Upon a Time in China, Iron Monkey, and Heroic Trio.
Fairbanks also finds romance on ship, with kidnapped princess Billie Dove (as Isobel), whom he saves from gang rape.
This was also a film where very serious philosophy and training were put to great effect with the fencing.
The film also depicts how Holmes' court clerks were in effect surrogate sons.
I was also delighted by Eduard Franz's underplayed portrayal of Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish justice on the US Supreme Court, after whom Brandeis University was named.
The plot of the film was also quite good, surprisingly.
Bingo's uncle Ben also discourages the relationship and offers Montgomery money to leave her!
Both films were clearly inspired by "9 and a half weeks" (there is also a nod to Zulawski's Femme Publique) but D'Amato changed the story by putting the woman in control, a modification which works very well.
Not only did they get astonishing numbers of bad extras for the zombies (many stumble around like straw-puppets not sure what to do), they are also totally not frightening and not able to kill four people who are armed with knifes when coming at them at a 25:1 ratio.
Not only do the movie-makers want us to believe that Â as it seems Â the whole small town in which the heist takes place is turned into undead morons (which of course nobody seems to pay mind Â the place is all but deserted apart for the zombies), but also that the "great plan to eradicate them all" of Mr. Kane's character is, well, to shoot them all with handguns and stab them with knifes.
he also has a great singing voice!
Robbie also pays homage to those great singers, never attempting to steal any of their thunder, but merely wanting to present these songs to a new generation.
It also looked strange to see Cagney in his mid '50s playing a guy in his early '20s.
Johnny also asked about Lon Jrs.
The picture also boasts a terrific music score by the underrated and now wholly forgotten film composer Frank Skinner (1897/1968).
In the end they make relevant decisions, also about their relation to each other (with the genre in mind we all know what that means).
It also makes a change from the empty hopeless modern romances that litter the screen trying to be charming, trying to be sincere, and falling flat on their collective scripts...
It was not surprising therefore than when she turned to directing she did so with her own screenplay La Buche which centered on three sisters and their disparate lives but also offered strong roles to four semi-leads with a handful of cameos (Isabelle Carre's neurotic wife, for example) for good measure.
But, we also see her determination to keep trying.
Binoche's beautician is also far more interesting, and less stereotypified, than American film portrayals (Fran Drescher, Dolly Parton, Jennifer Coolidge...)  Not one of the great French films by any means, but I still give this one 8/10.
In addition to the highly accomplished look of the film, the story is also fast-paced and holds together to the end, the acting is uniformly excellent as well.
I liked the loving relationship she has with her husband and the I also enjoyed the location shots.
Directors MÃ¥rlind and Stein have a distinctive Hollywood-complex that also shines through in a disturbing way.
- Dramatically there are also a lot of errors in continuity as well as in credibility.
The only actors who actually knows how to speak Scanian - Harald Leander, Per Lasson, to mention some - use accents from a totally different area, but at least they know how to speak it and unlike JÃ¶rgen Persson they also know acting.
The leading actors, however, AndrÃ© SjÃ¶berg and Malin Morgan (former Larsson), well educated and all, doesn't seem to have had very much time to learn their character's way of talking, there are loads of mal-functious pronunciations that really hurt the ear and is very hard to understand also for a Scanian.
( and that most certainly also applies for mere mortals as ourselves! )
I also like Lori Petty and L.Q.
this is the first version of this movie made,and the only version i have seen so far.i liked it.i thought it was touching and ironic,and also tragic.it basically tells what the movie business can do to you,and the sacrifices that are made.it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are.as long as you are the flavour of the week,everything seems fine.but when you're no longer useful,reality hits and things can come crashing down.that's what basically happens in this story.it's an indictment(ironically)of the movie industry,however subtle.regardless,i thought it was well done.the acting by the tow leads,Janet Gaynor,and Frederic March,as well as the supporting performances,are terrific.i also thought the writing was very good,and the movie flows very well.for me,A Star is Born gets an 8/10
Well, suspense for that matter, seems to have taken a holiday, also.
Not only do you have these great characters you also get the one and only Martin Lawrence with his best performance since Remember the Titans.
It also helps that there are two sets of villains, with the second, and possibly the most effective, not being very obvious until late in the film.
I saw this movie back in Hungary, when I myself was also in high school, and absolutely loved it.
The only "science" element is the hero's claim to being an archeologist - in which case "Raiders of the Lost Ark" would be science fiction also.
Â which bear strong echoes of another fantasy stalwart, H. Rider Haggard's "She", prove incredibly disappointing; curiously enough, this would also turn out to be the case in such diverse, later sci-fi films as THE TIME MACHINE (1960), BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES (1970) and LOGAN'S RUN (1976).
Near the peak, an avalanche almost buries them, but it also exposes a ruined Sumerian city.
The ending is also not quite what one would expect.
Barrymore was also a big-shot whose career declined heavily in the 30's because of his alcoholism.
Ganyor, the winner of the first Best Actress award, is also very good as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester.
Gaynor also does rather funny impersonations of Garbo, Hepburn and West at a Hollywood party that reveal a knack for comedy.
May Robson as the Grandma is good also, but a little tiresome after a while (I think it's more how her character was written than her acting abilities).
A satire on the entertainment industry and also a heartbreaking character study of a marriage ravaged by the effects of alcohol and one partner's growing dissatisfaction with life.
It's also an adventure movie about exploring for a lost civilization.
Most of the plot involves this civilization which also happens to include the Mole People.
Is Ritai really going to sell the illegal antelope pelts in order to raise the funds needed to stop the poachers who also sell illegal antelope pelts?
This has got to be one of the most AMAZING films ever made, not only for the astounding cinematography, the quiet, subtle, yet overpowering drama, the incredible pacing of the story, the compelling character portraits, but also for very intelligently conceived cinema verite techniques.
also one of the earlier comments was that the movies ending was bad script saying that why would the captain go up to poachers armed with a single rifle, knowing that these poachers have killed one of his men earlier.
Adding to this, Kekexili is certainly also a must-see for anybody interested in the "Tibetan Question", as it shows life in the Tibetan highlands from a very uncommon angle: It's a Chinese view of "Shangri-La", torn between admiration of its spirituality and humanity and, on the other side, shocked amazement by its harshness and inhumanity.
It also serves to elevate the protagonists above ordinary heroes as it can be interpreted that they're not just doing this for the Tibetan antelope, but endangered animals everywhere.
Movie Nuttball's note: If you like alien movies I also recommend the following films: The UFO Incident, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T.
It's also worth mentoining that the 80's was also an era where movie makers didn't go and remake everything like so many people are doing today.
Dr Mack believed he was near to the truth about what was happening and this film may also be a step in the right direction towards a definitive explanation.
DVD also includes outtakes with commentary by the director, two theatrical trailers and more.
He also, at times, delves into folklore and mythology.
Nevertheless, it's an interesting read, and great material to compare to the screenplay of the movie (also written by Strieber).
I, also, am not a believer in this specific subject matter, but I don't let that interfere with my interpretation of the film.
The story gets quite involved with a man being accused of killing his wife and also another murder of a woman Sir Alan had an affair with.
Flip is also surrounded by his equally white wannabes who constantly refer to each other as 'dogg' spelled with two Gs because it is so very gangster (I'm sorry, I meant gangsta) to misspell things.
I also feel that Trevor was the only character of the main 3 that showed a shred of morality.
That also shows that this movie is NOT just based on characters trying to be black.
She is also heartbreaking in her famous finale, "This is MRS. Norman Maine."
I remember them beating The Power also.
There was a family on the island with Valerian so it was easy enough to identify with someone and pretend you were there also on a wild adventure.
You also have another man of science, in Jonathan Willaway.
When I saw that the co-writer and co-director was also the film's composer, I knew I was in for a treat.
Great score also!
A thoroughly entertaining B-movie; GLASS TRAP was directed by cult horror director Fred Olen Ray who also directed "HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS" Another one of my favorites.
A delivery of plants is made but it turns out that the plants are hiding an unexpected secret, they were exposed to plutonium & the Ants that were on the plants have grown to a huge size & their appetite for flesh has also increased.
The reaction I had also affected the way I perceive Hollywood a little bit more; it's true that films like Zodiac, Blood Diamond and Apocalypto occupy my top three of 2007 but even some of them and the many others on that list do not match the fondness and recognition that I had for Dead Man's Shoes upon seeing it Â the great thing is, this was extensively levelled down in terms of funding but pumped up in terms of quality.
Meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film; indeed, when you see Herbie (Wolfenden) trundle down the road in his Citroen 2CV with the other guys in the back, you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels; at how these people are presented as people who live, breath, hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars.
Meadows also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something.
So this is Meadows introducing to us the villains in stages; the targets Richard must deal with if he is to get his revenge Â we are systematically told what Richard is up against but there is also that nice little touch of Richard showing up now and again with scare tactics.
- the lights go out.. so do the elevators which doesn't stop the janitor for trying to use them..and why should he, the company info stealing guy also used the elevators when the lights where flickering.. gets stuck and attacked by a plastic non moving ant.
they found the gun because our moronic janitor who is also a psychic broke into a desk in the office where he was hit over the head with the wooden duck..?????
The French pupil, Adele, is also full of energy and very much like the little girl in the book.
Both are also average-looking rather than gorgeous which makes the story more believable although Sorcha is beautiful in a classic way.
Faithful as the long conversation are rendered in the '73 version, they appeal to the intellect rather than the heart, they are interesting, but not captivating, and they lack the focus and also the intensity of the scenes between Rochester and Jane in the '83 version.
But the misrepresentation of Jane's character is not Cusack's fault alone but partly also due to the script, which brings me back to my first point of criticism: Since the script is overall so faithful to the novel, the viewer naturally concludes that each word uttered in this version must come straight from the novel Â but such is not the case.
And getting Jane wrong they also got the relationship between her and Rochester wrong.
Unfortunately there is also little chemistry between Jayston and Cusack: their interplay is amusing but it lacks feeling and their love scenes are passionless and dry.
The narration by Jane herself is a unique approach that I found very interesting and added to the depth of not only Jane herself but also to the other characters about whom she continually muses.
As for the supporting actors, they also did a wonderful job, including the thugs and the mentally challenged brother.
We also have here Bogey's daughter from the first marriage; this girl is given dialog that would make a forty year-old woman sound too adult.
Humphrey Bogart,(Geoffrey Carroll),"Dead End",'37, plays a struggling artist and also a man who loves the ladies.
But if he was that sharp, he should also have concluded that if Carroll was deranged enough to kill his first wife by poisoning, then knocking off a druggist wouldn't be much of a stretch.
The supporting cast is also one to die for.
Barbara Stanwyck was one of THE leading ladies at the time and Alexis Smith was also quite popular.
Nigel Bruce, who everyone knows as THE Dr. Watson from the Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone, also plays a quite amusing small role in the movie.
The camera work is also first-rate.
She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey's precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called "The Angel of Death",was done while she was sick.
Blue Vinyl is also beautifully and imaginatively shot...
There is also wonderful use of music and animation.
Toby Kebbell is also great as his simple brother, his warm, lovable performance making the final scenes all the more distressing.
She also interviewed a scientist, previously employed by the vinyl industry, who agreed with the contention that, yes, PVC is a potential toxin.
There are also interviews with an Italian scientist, other American scientists, and a plethora of PVC victims who became seriously ill after exposure in the workplace to PVC.
Elaine Stritch was certainly crotchety, but also not especially funny as Miss Crock.
This movie also has Sherman Hemslely in a rather large role so once I saw that flash on the screen, I knew the film would be kind of generic.
Screwed also has work by other good actors/actresses (like Danny Devito), who plays an auspiciously named mortician whom never ceases to find (and use) discusting things out of the bowls of his corpses.
The film is also laced with some classic dialogue, such as:  After Richard has stolen the drugs and is sitting with Anthony at the farm... (Summarised)  Richard, "F*ck it, I'll stick the lot in."
When I went to the theater to see screwed I knew it would be a good film, with Dave Chappelle and Danny Devito, I also knew that since Norms previous feature film (Dirty Work) was hilarious and very well-written that this movie could not live up to it, and it doesn't but it is still a wonderful piece of work.
Also, Danny Devito is outrageous as creepy diener Grover Cleaver and Daniel Benzali is great as the "evil Cojack" Detective Tom Dewey trying to solve the case - familiar faces Sherman Hemsley and Sarah Silverman also co-star.
There are also undeveloped characters, scenes and subplots irrelevant to the story, and even some humor unworthy of a smirk.
Not what you would expect at first "Daughter of the Mind" is a lot more then a ghost story it also has a lot to do with the defense of the United States that Prof. Constable is very much involved in his top secret work for the Pentagon.
Prof. Constable's weird behavior also attracts the US governments intelligent agencies in the person of CIC agent Saul Wiener, Edward Asner, who's having him and now Dr. Lauder followed day and night.
I have not seen a darker movie than this for some time....maybe not ever...but as well as the darkness, Dead Mans Shoes also offers some extremely poignant and moving moments I think the acting performances from all involved are first class...but paddy considine is a cut above that.
Ray Milland was excellent as the grieving father.I have seen so many of his movies, this is my favorite one.The cast also included Gene Tierney and she was wonderful in her part too.Don Murray was very effective in his role.I believe he is such an underrated actor.The music in the movie gives it a very nice quality.
Scientist Ray Milland believes he's seeing and speaking to his late young daughter in "Daughter of the Mind," also starring Gene Tierney and Don Murray.
And the acting is also well, not great but OK.  One point I will get across though.
Also, the special features interviewing some of the Latino population and their points of view were also a really eye opening complement to the movie.
The rest of the cast is also good, but nothing spectacular.
If the film is also very slow and dramatic, the slowness of the film goes on so much that one wonders "is this still the film?"
And this weird atmospheric disturbance has also taken away all of the Mexicans.
Some of the jokes may also be cheesy and may not garner a titter from the audience, but the main point of the movie is not to knock you out of your seat with uproarious laughter.
You also need to know something of Mexico's culture, and be able to understand it.
I also think that one needs to be accepting of the movie, and wanting to give it a chance before they will like it.
I also see other points, like white Americans being portrayed in a negative light.
They also talk mess about their boss, like most people do, behind their backs.
I felt that this movie did not give this illegal immigrants that chance to show that they are also people.
The play was performed, at that time, by The Negro Ensemble Company, Inc. Ward was not only the playwright, he also performed in the play.
It also shows us even other minority groups can become racist when they are not target themselves.
Although it also sheds some light on Mexican-American relations and contributions that greatly outweigh welfare costs, this movie fails to address more basic and deeper issues, such as:  1.
Speaking Spanish, being Latino has nothing to do with it; there are also Chinese, Filipino's, Polish, Russians, and dozens of others that are smuggled into the U.S., Canada and European countries each day for the same purpose: a legion of cheap workers that must remain silent and live in fear.
Oh, and by the way, it is also a crime against humanity.
They not only succeeded in portraying a truly "lonely" city, chaotic and all but they could also capture the true essence of Latinos which lies in these three words: Tenderness, care and RESPECT.
You will also love the closing scene and the nice final twist.
And if your really lucky, it will also broaden your mind.
OK, it did run a BIT too long, but other than that, I thought this was a fun mockumentary that also made it's point - if all the Mexicans suddenly disappeared, here's what would happen to the California economy.
This also marks the last project of the late Mexican Telenovela actor Eduardo Palomo, whom most recently was seen by an American audience played the role of Cpt.
The fact that most of the violence is inflicted on real human beings instead of zombies or aliens may have also contributed.
Most people say that Giallo a Venezia is also technically flawed, but watching a better edition made recently on DVD of Patrick made me reconsider this.
There's also some very campy effects illustrating Patrick's (the telekinetic one) use of his mind's eye, a lame score, and about four really nicely gory deaths of the sleazy variety--including a bitchen power window death and the implausible spit through the snatch scene.
The film-makers not only completely ignore the events in the previous film, they also replace Robert Thompson, who originally played Patrick, by a different Italian actor.
Like I said: Highly recommended for sleaze & gore-fans but also for lovers of extremely bad and pointless movies.
Nudity is strongly featured also, most of it from the female cast members.
Mario Landi's "Patrick Still Lives" has to be one of the sleaziest exploitation sickies ever made in Italy.It's filled with incredible amount of nudity and masturbation.Gianni Dei plays Patrick,a young man who is sent into coma as the result of the random act of violence.He lies in his bed looking into space for the most part and killing people with his telekinetic powers.The script is pretty bad,but the gore is mildly shocking.Still the scene where Maria Angela Giordano has a long metal pole pushed into her vagina is a real jaw dropper...Another offensive murder scene involves a lovely black-haired woman killed by her own dogs:they chase her all over the grounds before biting,licking and chewing her around the genitals,eventually killing her.The masturbation scene of stunningly beautiful Anna Venziano is also worth mentioning.Like earlier Mario Landi's sleazefest "Giallo a Venezia"(1979),"Patrick Still Lives" is cheap,shoddy,misogynistic and gleefully disgusting.It's just a pure exploitation film,so you should enjoy it as such.Highly recommended,if you like sleaze and extreme gore.
He also knows how to hold its extremes in delicate balance, giving us a place where boredom and violence come together repeatedly in the unholiest of alliances.
They're also engaged in an unusually reflective conversation.
He also displays an unnerving preoccupation with moral hypotheses.
Solid acting and great direction also make this film a must see.
Chris Farley is very funny also as Connie's boyfriend Ronnie and he really is good in his part.
The Saturday Night live people who appear in this movie are: Adam Sandler (Who is also very good in his part as a guy who gives Veldar his new identity when Veldar is discovered by Otto as being an "illegal alien".
There's also some great old-fashioned stop-motion animation of a creature called a Garthok.
The dentists office scene with Lovitz is also unbeatable.
It's also quite amusing that almost no one seems to notice that they AREN'T!
there also aren't enough killers who wear motorcycle helmets....by far this is the greatest film to hit this corrupted and smelly industry in years.
This movie also revealed to me the fact that if you have snow camo on in the spring, a motorcycle helmet with black tape over the face mask, and a nail gun with a bright yellow air hose, you can still sneak through the woods.
She (or he) also spouts some truly awful one-liners as he (she) offs the victims.
This is strictly amateur hour in every single connotation of the word.For something similar, yet a billion times better, do yourself a favor and rent "the Toolbox Murders" instead (the original NOT the remake)   Eye Candy: Staci Gordon & Kit Mitchell get topless (Kit is also topless in the DVD outtakes); Shelly York shows tits & a bit of bush (word of caution: John Rudder shows his ass and penis)   My Grade: D-   Synapse DVD Extras: A 25 minute interview with Director Terry Loften; an 8 & a half minute outtake reel (with no film audio but with comments from the director) ; & Promotional trailer for this film
You also can't hear the supposedly "funny" lines from the killer, as the voice is too distorted.
It is also cheaper than virtually every other movie made.
His height and build also changes through the course of the movie because the director hired two stunt doubles, one of which happens to be female!
The murders themselves are also ridiculously executed.
And for some inexplicable reason, the psycho also opts to talk in a strange, electronically modified Darth Vader style voice, making them seem even more absurd.
He also refuses to accept the job the local lawyer is proposing: investigator for his special cases, because he feels it is charity.
He finally accepts the proposal of some Hollywood producer to make the film of his life and that brings him the end of his financial problems but also the multiplied desire to get even from the local traffickers, even against the advice of their own higher-ups.
The film also shows very well there is a change in the US at that time.
But at the same time it represents the end of a generation of traffickers who also want to run things in a smoother way.
The device of setting the movie in a single day with the chiming clock to mark time was also effective.
Shortly before Brecht leaves his summer residence in Buckow, young GDR-pioneers are reciting for him one of his famous love-poems from "Baal" - at that time, Brecht may have known that with the summer also his lifetime has gone.
I also find objectionable the suggestion that Brecht himself was complicit in the DDR's oppressiveness, at least to the extent that he failed to publicly denounce Ulbrecht (the DDR's leader at the time) and his regime.
also, who is the horrible guy playing kabir.
The story also seemed a bit weak, especially the tie between Kaju's background and the 1984 riots in India.
The dialogue for Kabir also seemed a bit repetitive as he frequently asked the same question concerning the 1984 riots.
The flashbacks that Kaju experienced were also exceptional and helped the story give a sense of depth, the feeling that something deeper has happened that Kaju's relatives are hiding from her.
Amu also showed the true political chaos that corrupts India today.
Surprisingly coming from the director of 'Once Upon A Time In The Midlands' and 'A Room For Romeo Brass' this is very downbeat, violent but also has moments of high comedy.
The film also uses its Derbyshire locations brilliantly and looks fantastic.
But it was also the small but exquisite touches that touched a chord in me.
However, I had heard good things about the film and for that reason I also did not want to miss it.
During her visit she is also trying to get more information about her real parents, who she knows nothing about.
Amu is also about Kaju's relationship with her mother who is trying to keep the truth from her.
I also look forward to many more viewers enjoying the tremendous journey of "Amu".
Writer/director Beaird also did the film Scorchers, which I recall recommending to folks years ago when I worked in a video store -- now here's another to add for truly, refreshingly, "touch-my-soul" viewing.
The story was borderline sensational but also captivating.
Patrick also received an award at VISION FEST for acting.
I find this documentary inspirational, and you might, too, especially in the area of self-defence and also in personal achievement generally.
I also love the brutality of it, Mr Considine in all scenes looks like someone with so much anger and distaste for the people he is dealing with comes across really unstable and alarming, such strong character portrayal is rare in a film these days, the intensity of his character makes the best anti-hero seen for years pretty much since taxi driver, I have heard Paddy Considine being called the British Robert De Niro, I just can't believe he hasn't been poached by bigger (but not better) films.
The rest of the biography is also good but what makes this a real classic is the remake of Game of Death.
The lost footage aside, the documentary is also quite solid with excellent insight into Bruce's philosophy and his incredible determination and integrity which truly made him a master in his respective trade.
There are also a great look at the original version of the "Game of Death" fighting in the Tower scenes.
They found Bruce Lee's original outline and stunt moves for the film, and also all of the footage cut for the 1979 version.
Keaton and St John also have stronger parts than their usual nameless knockabout side characters that had come before.
There are many very funny gags up to this point to where they tickle St. John victoriously but then there's a racist gag involving one Ernie Morrison Sr. (the father of original "Our Gang"s Ernie "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison who would also occasionally appear in Harold Lloyd shorts) that threatens to put things to a halt.
also without effect.
(The version I saw also had a fantastic 'new' score by Carl Davis that added considerably to the atmosphere while supporting the action.)
The Studio also insisted on giving their Mexican star a wide range of ethnic parts, everything from Chinese to Arab.
I was also blown away by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but for the completely opposite reason.
** End Minor Spoilers **  This movie moves slowly sometimes, and I wish there were sub titles, since I had some trouble with the accents in some scenes, but it's also got scenes that look like poetry.
I also recommend seeing it a second time.
He also met his future wife, a Chinese-born woman, on the set.
Douglas said they also wanted to visit a more exotic location than Poland.
It is certainly aided by Sweet's performance, and also helpful the exemplary early use of "montage" which Griffith had been putting to use in his films as early as 1909.
Supporting cast are also good.
It was also oddly camp as hell, quite an achievement for a film depicting the end of the world.
This is actually my favourite American movie ever, and also my favourite thriller ever.
The use of colours is also noteworthy.
One might also wish that some of the acting were a little better.
The Tangerine Dream soundtrack is also excellent.
If you have your heart at the right place,then this movie grabs you by the throat and won't let go...  On the other handiIf you ONLY like comedy's and big budget action movies(which I also like very much)then you're probably going to despise this one...  Go now and find this little gem of a movie,I know you want to...
In fact, one of the best parts of the screenplay is that we, the audience, also don't really know what to believe (until the very end).
Indeed, its this mostly-unknown treasure trove of aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, and old acquaintances in multiple countries who ultimately provide as much material in collective form as the various museums and associations of magicians Miller also consults.
PS Added June 2006  For those that enjoyed this movie, you might also enjoy Donna Schatz's documentary "Balancing Acts", which is making the rounds of Public TV in 2006.
She also locates the spiritual remnants of her great grandfather in the memories of old magicians, vaudevillians and even a film clip paen to Sam delivered by none other than Hollywood's most famous prestidigitator, Orson Welles.
The film's dialogue is also quite intelligent and quotable, moreso than in most prison films.
He also wants to escape in the worst possible way.
I also loved the original, "Sentimental Journey" just as much.
Dustin Hoffman also was great as Papillion's friend, "Louis Dega," who had a bigger role in the movie than he did in the book.
Hoffman also provided some good comic relief to the movie and, heaven knows, it needed it.
I think this was McQueen's finest film ever, and perhaps Hoffman's also.
Some of the cast includes Vic Tayback also known as Mel from the hit TV series "Alice."
I also couldn't stand the overuse of "Electra".
There is also a Casablanca parody with Kermit and Miss Piggy, a Tarzan parody with Gonzo and Lily Tomplin, a Muppet version of The Three Muskateers (with Gonzo, Scooter, and Link Hogthrob), and a foreign film translated by Sam The Eagle and starring The Swedish Chef and Beaker.
M TV also tried to rip off on The Blair Witch Project once more with its jerky camera work.
Very funny, but also very dramatic.
I also knew it was a phony lost season due to the fact that each of the characters played into what some see as the typical cast mold.
The writing and directing for this show is also very good.
The acting is also great and funny.
I'm also gonna say, if you like The Office (british or American), you may or may not like this show.
Just kidding, that movie also sucked.
She also goes into certain social settings like a party, the coffee shop, and a ladies clothing store.
Alyson (Kaley Cuoco) is a pretty, skinny, and athletic girl; but she is also a very good person.
This movie also shows that stereotypes can be right.
We have also seen articles, by Leslie Lampert, but this movie, To Be Fat Like Me, looked into a teenager's perspective.
She also learns that lying to her friends and family is not acceptable, and that the people she could truly rely on won't stand by her if she lies to them.
Very developed storyline with well-developed characters also.
However, the problems are not just health-wise, but also a sociological and psychosocial problem.
These situations don't just involve her and various high-school cliques, but also her weight-recovering mother and chubby brother.
At the centre of this film is a conventional road-movie, a story of an odd couple who bond; but it's put into a wider context by the extraordinary scenes, set in Tirana, that top and tail the movie: this film is political as well as personal, addressing not just the contemporary Albanian reality but also wider questions, such as racism and the relationship of the affluent west to the poorer world.
But what stands out most of all is the remarkable visuals, both of the stunning Albanian landscape and also of the people: few directors make as much use of the widescreen format as Amelio, and the way he creates landscapes from faces so expressive they are almost fluourescent is in a class of its own.
He also seems to go out of his way to reinforce the typical "Southern" stereotypes.
Now it isn't just that he came off as rather dull, but the women he was set up with also really didn't spark any interest as well.
The conversations, the nuclear threat, the clothes and hairdos, it also makes a wonderful time capsule of the 80's.
I also highly recommend the two follow-ups to this "Time Indefinite" and "The Six O'Clock News".
Matthew Perry was also funny in this movie, as well as all the other big or slightly big names in the movie.
In the film both Walt and Frank grow through new and difficult stages in their lives, Walt is discovering his sexuality by not only showing interest in his new girlfriend but also his father's college student; and Frank, a new teenager also suffers from hormonal and sexual issues, not to mention his seamen distribution throughout his school, his new interest in beer, hilarious vulgar outbursts, and his non-artistic role-model Ivan the tennis coach.
This is also the first time I would place an American film on the same rung as one of the Dutch-language pieces that has elevated Paul Verhoeven to godhood in my viewpoint.
It cannot properly be labelled elitist as it also provides the lesser audience with the requisite comedy and dramatic tension.
I can only imagine the difficulties that face children when their parents get divorced, but the film also includes the anxieties of teenagers something that most people can relate to in one way or another.
I also enjoyed the supporting cast of characters, I'm not a big fan of "Friends" but I thought Mathew Perry was good in this movie.
And we also get the presence of the beautiful Anna Paquin, who plays a really 'racy' character and completes a very 'racy' scene with a high level of mastery.
I have also wanted her to do more things than she actually does.
We could easily say that Baumbach's script is a storm, because it puts its characters in the middle of one, but we can also say that Baumbach is a man who definitely tries to find the calm between the storm, in his characters and in his movie.
The two actors playing the sons are also very convincing.
Frank, who is going out with a girl he seems embarrassed to be seen with, also pines and almost succeeds in seducing Lili.
There's also an interesting subtext involving the film BLUE VELVET that may or nor may be intentional.
But the mother--who is clearly the sympathetic parent in the director's eyes--is also horrible.
Joan, the mother, also a writer, is starting to get her work published.
Walt is attempting to begin a sexual awakening as well with his first girlfriend but is getting all the wrong comic advice from Bernard who is clueless with the opposite sex as he is also trying to have sex with Lili while burning over Joan who has hooked up with Frank's tennis instructor Ivan (a doofy Baldwin whose every other utterance is "Brother").
The plot is also bad, like it's a re-make of the original howling only oversimplified and dumbed down to an annoying degree.
This "movie" could also be seen as a very boring 2-hour infomercial for Coca- Cola, as there's a good amount of product placement in there for Coke.
Howling IV: The Original Nightmare tells the tale of Los Angeles based author Marie Adams (Romy Windsor) who has a deadline looming but has also been suffering from bad dreams & hallucinations of a mysterious nun, after a public breakdown her doctor advises her husband Richard (Michael T. Weiss) to take her on a break, a complete rest form work.
Soon her nun friend discovers that the town people are Werewolves and hurries to warn Marie, meanwhile Marie's publisher Tom also tries to warn Marie but sees Richard in the road thriving in pain.
I also love that theme song "Something evil, something dangerous"
First I must say that I am a big Paul Verhoeven fan and when I heard that he was directing Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon (who I am also a big fan of) I was really excited.
On the lam, Frank will try to keep Maggie from harm as Reisner has his goons out searching for them while they also try to stay one step ahead of an invisible pursuer who has the upper hand.
Peter Facinelli and Laura Reagen were also good.
This movie had a great storyline, and great effects, and not to mention great suspense also.
At the end of the day,i have seen worse,but also a lot better,Facinelli and Regan do well in their roles,and for Christian Slater,he yet again made this movie worthwhile for me,despite the fact you only hear his voice.It doesn't really get your immediate attention,but if you be patient i think you will agree that this movie is actually worth watching.I particularly enjoyed the scene outside of Regans house,smart effects with the flash grenades,i gave this movie a rating of 7/10,which i feel it deserves.I read a comment from another user that has the opinion that Christian Slater cant act!Which is an insult to myself,i own every Movie that Christian Slater is in except Name Of The Rose!And i can ASSURE you that this man is a Very talented actor.
This film was absolutely horrible with its one-dimensional characters, and also its boring storyline.
And also needed to at least try to make itself better than the average horror sequel.
I would have loved an invisible man movie that takes into account not just the physics involved, but also character development, the possibility that the man is not bad and not good, just as normal people, true invisible fantasy scenes, I mean, naked women, violent acts, etc.
On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells' novel "The Invisible Man", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That's Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!
She ends by going to visit Lauren's grave (which also looks exactly like the real Lauren Townsend's grave up close, so I think it probably is, but the crane shot doesn't look like the real cemetery).
Debra Winger is also a terrific actress who is often underrated.
This is a very human story, and it was helpful to portray the life of Dawn Anna's family; but I think there is also a bigger picture which we need to know about, and this could have been written into the story without concentrating solely on the perpetrators, or victims.
I'm also a secondary ed teacher, have had two brain surgeries (for Chiari Malformation not an AVM though), followed by re-hospitalization for severe infection, and had extensive rehabilitation to learn to speak and walk again.
There was very joyous scenes in this film and also very bitter and heart breaking ones.
Very enjoyable and I also liked the character of Eleanor, her look was right out of the 1970's.
THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is also notable for giving the current female singing sensation Â Barbra Streisand Â her first non-musical role; in fact, it led to other wacky comedy vehicles: foremost among them WHAT'S UP, DOC?
Segal also shot some nude scenes which never made it into the final print.
It was an historic word also, the first time a star had ever  said it in a major film.
The film also features performances from Corrado Pani, Richard Conte and John Richardson, who all do a good job in supporting roles.
Her role here as Anna, an innocent coffee shop cashier who falls for the brutish charms of a Mafia thug, really gives her a chance to show the world what all the giallo fans knew before: that she is also an intelligent, subtle and highly skilled actress, as well.
In "The Kansas Raiders", and also on his last film, he was Jesse James.
The two women, Beverly Tyler and Yvette Duguay are quite strong characters, also unusual in this type of westerns.
It is a real action packed shoot-em-up, but it also has a better than average plot to hold your attention between the action sequences that were Audie's trademarks.
It also made fun of women who are older than 40 saying the 0 in 40 stood for "old, too old to get married".
There were also some really gross sex scenes and the plot was stupid, and campy.
She also has a few CD's out and are quite entertaining.
I also think Valley of the Dolls, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?
Even though he's straight, I think he has a wandering eye for my beautiful friend, who is also a trainer!
It is a bit 'odd', but it's also a great, raunchy, adult Indy film!
I also wish Franklin Cover's character could've been featured more extensively, I really enjoyed his scene in the film.
Into their lives walks their new roommate Varla (Jeffery Roberson), an aspiring starlet whose late mother Marla (also Roberson in flashbacks) was also Evie's most hated acting rival.
), but at least you get to look at some beautiful landscapes, and of course there is also a lot of nudity to keep you going between the all-too-infrequent shark attacks.
Rene Cardona Jr's TINTORERA (1977) is one ridiculous JAWS ripoff made by this Mexican film maker who is also known (among many other films) as the director of jungle exploitation film TREASURE OF THE AMAZON (1985), a much better film.
Soon, however, after some 30 minutes of the film, finally the nasty shark starts to eat and kill people and also return the vacationers back on earth from their dream world.
There is plenty of scenes depicting sharks being killed by people or each other and also the "sharks attacking human being" scenes are pretty dull and thus funny.
There's plenty of naked skin and bodies and also some blood so the exploitation elements are there as they were in TREASURE, too.
It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew.
The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling.
The persistence of the two men's characters was very courageous and inspiring also, making even me want to be an FBI Agent after watching the film.
They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice.
I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen.
Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong.
Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express).
There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat.
Frances Mac dormant is also very good...and so she won an Oscar too..it is only i am not satisfied that dafoe did not received any Oscar for this movie...sometimes an underdog like him should be given a chance...  nothing to say about this movie...the plot and story line are definitely superb!!
Michael rooker has always been good in his movie.. he played as a villain,and so.. he has proved that he is also great at playing as a villain...just like Michael ironside..  overall...i give this movie 10 out of 10 stars...  Bravo For Mississippi Burning !!!!
I've also seen some of his funnier stuff like his two silent films and it's clear that this is a filmmaker who likes to work in many different genres and be one of a kind.
It is a collection of home videos shot by a married couple who have two kids, but also like to kill people on the side and film their crimes.
I thought the acting was very very good (Paul Mccloskey and Barbra Lessin were very very realistic), the movie has plenty of blood and gore, lots of disturbing moments, and a surprising ending that is also atypical of a horror movie.
I also liked how not everything was explained, it allowed us the viewers to draw our own conclusions (like whether or not the son Todd knew about what his parents were doing and what happened to him after the conclusion of the film, or what the meaning of the scene at the abandoned house really meant).
I applaud Anthony Spadaccini for coming up with an original idea and also applaud the cast who did such a wonderful job portraying these characters.
It works well, making everything feel much more real, but also causes the film at times to move a bit slowly.
Priyanka Chopra also does a great job with the character.
Shiny Ahuja also delivers, adding another perspective to the story.
Priyanka is also great in her small role.
What made me feel good after watching this movie was ... a good story and brilliant acting.. specially Priyanka Chopra has done a very good job... she is the lady who knows what acting is.... and no doubt if she will be the next bollywood queen... John Abraham has also done a very good job playing the character of a hit-man... all together a good movie to watch ... worth the time... And I think after a long time had bollywood came up with such a brilliant movie I don't know why such movies are not liked by the Indian audience... they go in for crap...
The story is mentioned in the plot summery and also by other comment users.
I also noticed a goof when John received his wife's finger it was a full finger but when he was talking to her on the phone after the song Ishq Nachaya Kare her finger was half cut.
The story also follows Striker as he rounds up a gang to find and capture the slaves.
There are also lines in the dialogue that sound awkward.
She also co-stared with Dabney Colemen in "Maybe Baby".
I also liked Richard Benjamin, Eddie Albert and Dabney Coleman as male support.
At first we give Edwards kudos for deselecting him, but when Fontenot lets it be known that he'll only join the expedition if his hot Indian woman (she's not a spouse or girlfriend to him, but property), Shaquinna (Lisa Barbuscia), can also come along, Edwards figures that they probably won't need a translator's services that badly anyway, so brings him on the journey.
Produced by Robert Aldrich (who also produced "What Ever Happened To Baby Jane"), it's pretty easy to see where the derivative title originated.
She is also wonderful in her role.
The rest of the cast is also good, but most of them aren't the big-name stars that these two leading ladies were.
The film's ending is short but fitting, and while I felt it may have been lacking a bit, it's also forgivable when you take into consideration the rest of the film's quality.
Ironies also abound.
Ruth Gordon shows up applying for the position and gives Miss Page a run for her money, who is also a joy to watch.
There's also a neat cameo from Mildred Dunnock ("Death Of A Salesman") as the luckless servant who precedes Miss Gordon.
The publishers very free spirited (some would say nymphomaniac) daughter also visits at the same time (or does she?!)
Its strength really IS its sensuality:not just Ms.Sagnier's sexiness,but also the feel of two people who are experiencing the same house with different attitudes and different reactions.
It also doesn't contain the weird storytelling that many French films have.
Charlotte Rampling is also present in that one but I can honestly say that actually nothing "happens" in the film.
It also allows us to identify the changes she goes through when put up against her opposite in Julie, and how forced interaction with this 'type' of person forces a confrontation with typical feelings and emotions.
What Charlotte doesn't know is that she is about to be french fried when she discovers that the young voluptuous sex-crazed daughter of the owner of the villa has also decided to dive into the chateau.
The daughter character is also real but you don't see the real person until the end of the film.
He also suggests her to make the experience of writing about a different theme.
It is also an erotic drama, Sarah forced to confront herself in the cast-off wake of Julie's promiscuity.
The women's tacit sexual comparisons are also played out in a series of Oedipal symbols and exchanges Most striking is a gash of a red lilo that sits menacingly and yet enticingly by the pool throughout; the men that Julie brings back to the house are also pawn-like, less sexual partners than bargaining chips between the two women.
You'll also need to have patience with the main character, played by Charlotte Rampling.
And their colaboration in Dominican Republic with Aristide Massachessi was also great.
The script also steals elements from a handful of other movies ("Aliens", "Cannibal Holocaust" Â) but if you've seen "Predator", you're always several steps ahead of the screenplay.
According to the TCM host Robert Osborne, a previous film starring Mason was also used as the basis of this sequence too.
Nelson, Barrymore, and Granger were also fine.
Angeli also looked quite believable as well.
I also enjoyed hearing the Paganini theme; I had loved it in Somewhere in Time as well, so I was surprised to hear it in another earlier film as well.
I also liked Pier Angeli; she plays Nina Burkhardt, a woman who is so disillusioned she tries to commit suicide.
Angeli may just have the right stuff to be that partner, but Douglas is also looking at her in more than a professional way.
In addition to that, I enjoyed: 1) the timing--the movie consists of three shorts and I appreciate the order in which the three are presented; 2) sense of humor--the second short is quite charming and I thought well written from a child's point of view--it avoids being an adult pretending to be a child; 3) long dance scenes--there must be several three minute scenes with no editing cuts (the music is so strong that whenever I hear a piece by Faure, if it's not the piece in this one scene it reminds me of it, that I must stop a few seconds because the memory is so alive); 4) the deep exploration of "what is right" --I not only appreciate the presentation of the two sides of every decision presented in all of the shorts, but also that a quick Hollywood solution is resisted; and finally 5) a young Kirk Douglas--which is the old fashioned manly-man.
This segment reminded me of The Red Shoes (also starring Shearer) but was thankfully MUCH shorter and interesting--a definite plus for those like me who really DON'T like ballet!
Being English, French and Italian (in that order), they also embody the international strength of post-war Hollywood, and are strong complements for the male leads, Mason, Granger and Douglas, all of whom made their careers in America (Mason was born English, I believe).
It also looked as if Angeli did her own stuntwork.
Director/producer Wynorski (who also helmed the raucously cheesy Chopping Mall) proves himself to be the unsung B-movie hero.
Wynorski also succeeds in that his intentionally funny and over-the-top ending is actually funny.
There is also an appearance by K-ci & Jojo.
There is also a scene where Roundtree karate kicks a vampires head right off!
Comic relief is provided by two legendary stars of the 1970s, Fred Williamson (who also directed the movie) and Richard Roundtree (best known for his role as Shaft).
The thing that got me to rent this is the fact that Williamson (who also directed) and Roundtree were starring, both of which I respect and enjoy seeing a lot.
this film is also choppy and bitty.
he also worked on flesh and blood with verhoven, blow out and bonfire of the vanities with depalma, mccabe and mrs. miller with altman, and close encounters with spielberg.
The film also neatly resolves all the major conflicts in the film in about 5 minutes.
It's a good mix of cross-cultural issues, with an ensemble cast that also covers the diverse nature of India itself: characters include Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.
The profound irony is that his college room 'partners' are also Indian.
Director Casper Andreas, who also had a hand in the script, hopes to titillate and shock his target audience with bitchy, outrÃ© dialogue and flashes of naked behinds; unfortunately, this isn't anything any filmmaker treading in queer-cinema waters hasn't tried before.
As long as Hawke is keeping Airwolf, the FIRM will keep looking for his brother but also Hawke has to fly Airwolf for the FIRM missions in return.
I also loved Sharkespeare and still wonder what happened to him.
I also felt sad for Mozart and Tosca when Flower evicted them from the family.
The 80s were not only filled with cheezy hairbands, but it was also filled with very cheezy T.V.
Airwolf is also the only show from that era that should be made into a big budget Hollywood Production!
I also like the way he blows away villains who really need killing, but generally spares the lives of low-end flunkies.
Undercover agent Gabrielle has also been sent in, though against his wishes Hawke has fallen for her.
(***SPOILERS***)  Roscoe loves his wife (as usually played by Mabel Normand, who also did a remarkable job as a dramatic actress) terribly much, but, as in so many other cases, the fear of losing the love is much higher than the pleasure of having it.
Michael Granger is also excellent as the honest, professional Cuban police investigator who stays on the case himself and keeps running into Mitchell along the way.
The film also features legendary 50s leading lady Allison Hayes (Gunslinger, The Unearthly, Attack of the 50 ft. Woman)as a woman who once knew Mitchell and was married to the missing man.
I also like some of the supporting, non-celebrity roles.
They are also present in Speedway.
The best musical number was the adorable "Your Time Hasn't Come Yet Baby" and Nancy's solo number "Your Groovy Self" was also a highlight.
It is also curiously anachronistic, playing like something coy from 1963, but this was 1968!
A movie about two run-away teenagers traveling across the country to catch their dream and the interesting people they meet along the way, "The Dream Catcher" also takes the viewers on this engrossing journey.
The film also has a great soundtrack, with songs perfectly matching the moods of the scenes.
He gets right into the clowning with them also.
On the way they also get ravelled up in many of A&C's wacky routines including Don't say Tin, a bit of piffle-diffle, the classic Pokomoko sketch, Lou trying to sleep with a mouthful of beard, and my favourite the Hi Mike sketch Â poor devil: shot to death twice, once with a knife!
It was the first - and unfortunately, only - film made by her production company Marilyn Monroe Productions and was also the first time she had made a film abroad.
The film is set in London and Monroe stars opposite the great Laurence Olivier - who also directed the film - in one of her best comic roles.
She also copes with some extremely tricky dialogue, giving the lie to her inability to remember lines.
The admirable Royal Dance sequence is also brilliantly choreographed and lushly staged.
Thank You again Animal Planet and my Thanks also goes to everyone in the cast and crew of The Meerkat Manor show!
It is also true that "The Prince and the Showgirl" is not Marilyn's best performance, given her outstanding acting as Sugar Kane and Roslyn Taber in the aforesaid movies.
(The few extended examples of German dialogue in the film suggest that the Carpathians not only speak English with a German accent, but also speak German with an English one.
The greatest actor that ever lived is, this time, not only acting with Marilyn Monroe but he's also directing her.
There are also a couple characters introduced but mysteriously just dropped (think of the gym scene).
My recommendation to all who want to write a negative review: make some research before doing so!That is the only way to find out how much truth there is in this film!I, for example found also out that they were using exact the same type of weapons at that time, like knifes made of obsidian.
I would also recommend to see this film along with another great film:The Mission(1986).If you liked "Apocalypto" and want to see a true story about what happened next, you should see "The Mission".If you saw "Apocalypto" and hated it, "The Mission" will make you fell better.
and making prophecies was also unbelievable.But this is still a movie!
This film is about Maya, yet it also applies to every other ancient civilization.
I am also glad that they have begun to rerun it occasionally on Sunday nights, so that when we do miss a show, we can catch up.
(It is also fun to watch them all over again.)
There are also many aerial camera angles, allowing us to see characters in pursuit of each other from the tree-tops.
They're also a good looking bunch.
I say this in light of the final scene in which the two mains have escaped the ruin of the city, and instinctively also veer away from the approaching Europeans.
The ending disappoints in that it introduces an outside element to this previously enclosed world, and the ending can't resolve the movie's basic dilemma: how can it be both the story of a civilization's decline and also the story of a man's personal triumph.
These subtitles also help create a distance between the modern audience and the lost world of the past being shown on the screen.
They also did not paint their buildings white.
And I'm also Mexican, so I should know my history.
Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller.Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society.The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes,make up and art direction are top notch.The acting is a real surprise since Gibson casted actors with no experience at all, yet they are convincing.What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure chase film, the best one in years, this is a must see, and for people worrying about subtitles, do not worry, they are simple and brisk.
Apocalypto is probably one of the ten best movies of the year, a compelling action movie with not only adrenaline, but also brains and heart.
Christine also has an abusive boyfriend and you just know that Howard will do something about that .
The DVD box describes this film as one of the most shameless, sordid and sleaziest exploitation movies of the sixties, and also one of the most inexplicably profitable ones.
Well, all these aforementioned things may be true but the reputation should also include that "Touch of her Flesh" is dreadfully boring and contains an impossibly high amount of insufferable padding sequences.
This is also what is to acknowledge about this film however as it is pioneering in its sleaze and weirdness.
Director Michael Findlay also stars in the role of psycho Richard Jennings, and the guy's craziness is very entertaining to watch.
Female eye candy is also omnipresent throughout the film.
The film also does a really excellent job with lighting.
The plot of the would-be movie, also called "The Dying Gaul," concerns a gay couple and what happens when one of them is faced with AIDS.
The film also leaves a few questions open-ended even though doing so serves no purpose.
Here, that's where the main struggle is also centered.
I also saw this film at the first screening at the Seattle International Film Festival.
Directed by Craig Lucas (I loved his LONGTIME COMPANION, also starring this film's star, Campbell Scott) it is adapted from the play centering around a young screenwriter who sells his story for a cool million.
Now, if Robert changes the male character -- Maurice, also the name of Robert's agent and longtime lover who has died -- into a woman, it would be perfect.
But, for there to be some form of suspense, it's probably the only way to convey this progressive bull-fight between her and Robert, and the presentation is certainly pitch-perfect in letting us see both actors talking directly to the camera and hear voice-overs of what they're typing, but also letting us hear her as her male counterpart -- in this case, Maurice himself.
I've loved Campbell Scott ever since "Longtime Companion," and his mature performance here fulfills the promise he showed in that film (also written by Lucas) over a decade ago.
This film reminds me of another along the same genre, American Beauty, which also examined difficult and complex relationships, and attempted to do so with both humor and pathos.
These, also, are notes to keep in mind.
Liberties were taken, however, to make him also meek and hesitant, and clearly existentially bewildered.
Jeffrey's wife Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), also a screenwriter, adores the original script.
Lucas also wrote the screenplays of two other movies I liked very much: "The Secret Lives of Dentists" and "Longtime Companion."
Teeming with bawdy humour, surprisingly graphic violence and finely-honed visual inventiveness, Beowulf is not only Zemeckis' best film for some time, but also rates as one of the year's most fabulously exciting exercises in bang.
The story is also very well designed, BUT it is not faithful to the original tale.
This film held my interest because of the great acting by Ling Bai,(Shen Yuelin),"Edmond",'05, who is a very educated Chinese lawyer and is placed in a very difficult situation in having to defend Richard Gere,(Jack Moore), "Unfaithful",'02, who is also another lawyer from the United States.
I needed to see some movie so I went to see it; also it was directed by Robert Zemickis, for me this name is good enough for me to buy the ticket.
The whole movie was much more entertaining than I thought it would be, maybe because I have no expectation like the others who also went to see it.
He also notices China's newly-found penchant for blunt nationalism (oops, "patriotism", done nicely by a scene where he gauges club-goers' vehement reactions to a coaxing DJ), and doesn't quite feel good about his local contacts (including excellent veteran James Hong).
All in all, Red Corner also plays it fair, going to show that China does have judicial systems with a potential to work as well as any others.
She's a young woman of average attractiveness who also happens to be a compulsive shoplifter.
With the director also being a co-writer and the two leads also serving as producers, I think it's fair to say that Klepto is one of those movies that gets made so the filmmakers can enter it into festivals in the hope of getting noticed by some studio executive.
It doesn't have anything to say, yet also fails to say nothing in an intriguing or provocative way.
I also liked Michael Nouri's small role as the amusing & warm psychiatrist- a nice casting touch.
But this one had kind of nice storyline in it also.
I would recommend this movie to any Francophile and also crime movie liker!
Jean-Louis Trintignant was also at one of his best moments in the French cinema.
He's also enlisted some rather famous actors, and the movie's been shown in regular format, a 3-D projection with the old glasses bit, and I-Max.
Angry spoilers ahead After what seems an eternity, finally this movie was apparently coming to an end, but the worst was yet to come: Lambert's wife, who is also imprisoned, is about to give birth to her child.
It must also be said that Warwick Capper's performance as 'Braindead Prisoner' is truly dizzy stuff, folks.
This movie manages to avoid the cheesy unrealistic costumes and weapons that plague far too many sci-fi movies, and it also produces characters that you start to sympathize with.
It can also be said of Fortress that it's not over ambitious, director Stuart Gordon is aware of his restraints and keeps it simple but sparky, of which this is aided by Lambert buffing up and throwing punches left right and off kilter.
His biggest miss was Fortress, a futuristic prison breakout film that was also his biggest hit, proving so popular that a sequel came out half a decade later.
The film also shoves in cyborgs (a staple of many self-respecting genre films during the 1990s), with a cyborg governor (who acts more human than machine) & whole cyborg SWAT teams, who prove to be nothing more than convenient cannon fodder for our hero, although they do kill half the escaping party.
It's also surprisingly violent, and I remember watching this movie on TV as a kid, and enjoying it so it was great to re visit it, and it's pretty well made and written for it's low budget, plus it's also quite imaginative, and creative too.
All the characters are very likable,and the ending is also quite cool as well,plus there are some really impressive action scenes as well.
Occasionally the film reminded me also of Paul Anderson's Soldier, the non-stop action mayhem film starring Kurt Russell.
Due to the film's violence and fierce moments, this is pretty close to Paul Verhoeven's style of making action films, as couple of scenes are very violent and almost too violent for this kind of mainstream production, and as far as I know, this had to be trimmed by two violent scenes to get the R rating in US, and this slightly cut version has been released also on DVD in US and Europe.
Each prisoner is implanted with a device that shocks them if they break the rules and also kill them if they misbehave too much.
I like this movie because it not only has a great story line but also stars one of my favorite actors (Christopher Lambert).
Kurtwood smith is also great as the prison director.
Loryn Locklin isn't given much to do as the leading lady, but the rest of the support cast includes the likes of Lincoln Kilpatrick, Vernon Wells (who, coincidently, was also in the 1986 Australian movie of the same title!)
I enjoyed hearing the rim sky korsakov cut and paste score actually, at least there wasn't some really annoying music slapped on as in the Gloria Swanson version of "rain" "sadie Thompson" also directed by Raoul Walsh and an infinitely better movie.
It is also perhaps the most distinctive-looking film ever made.
Beowulf turns up to a kingdom (and a small kingdom at that, it seems to be one hall big sometimes) to rid the king of a monster (WARNING SPOILERS from here on in) and does so only to find out the king was actually the father of the monster as he'd slept with the monsters mother who's also a monster but being played by Angelina Jolie helps make bestiality understandable.
The fantastical tone also makes acceptable the pantomime acting, such as the exaggerated yawn and stretch of the guard falling asleep, or Fairbanks's palms literally itching when he spies a precious jewel.
It's also very like Walsh to make us feel as if we are there with the hero, taking part in his adventure.
We also get to see Walsh's sensitive side (rarely acknowledged, least of all by himself) in the romantic meetings between Fairbanks and his lady fair, embodied in this case by Julanne Johnson.
There's also the case of timing.
There are also the other hang-ups of silent movies, such as the movement of the characters being too quick, and how some of the actors and actresses look very strange and out of the ordinary.
The lack of color added to the overall darkness of the film due to lack of lighting also is a deterrent to watching these very, very old films that were made when my grandparents were infants (literally).
The movie was also probably shot on a studio lot, but the set design is so detailed with its tall buildings and plants carefully placed in the makeshift Baghdad that there are few indications of such a location.
Not only did Douglas Fairbanks star in this film, he also produced it.
I also query why they got squeamish about having Beowulf fight naked, but not show his todger.
The costumes and sets, by William Cameron Menzies, are also spectacular.
We also write a short review for each and every film.
The sets and photography are extraordinary; and, the overview shots of Bagdad not only are, but also look - futuristic.
The special effects are also top notch.
Fairbanks is also incredible with his athletic prowess as he effortlessly climbs ropes, battles silly looking monsters (the only minor drawback among the many special effects) and leaps about the scenery.
The lovely Anna May Wong would also get my vote for more footage, but at least she runs true to form right through the movie.
The "underwater" scene is also tinted to stand for the greenish-blue sea.
We also get the bonus of seeing Anna May Wong, in her first 'big' role, so beautifully slinky as the evil Mongol slave / spy.
The costumes and sets, by William Cameron Menzies, are also spectacular.
The movie also has some silly looking but yet great early special effects, toward the ending of the movie.
It's of course all rather simple and formulaic but this is also what makes the genre so great.
It's good simple fun that's professionally and well made, that's also beautiful to look at.
It was shot on a single 16mm camera, largely live at the club, but also with some "out in the street" sequences, and is a vital, rare document of exciting and vibrant music.
The ending was also quite abrupt, but the film managed to remain at least somewhat entertaining.
And also poor, poor lines, that even his talent couldn't save.
He's also really good looking in his older age, I betcha all the girls, even his wife thought he's till good looking.
Rafe discovers an bordello, which it's also a funeral home.
Her sexy employees are also vampires, which they seduced lonely or horny mens for survival.
The kind and noble King Hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with Grendel's mother (hence the existence of Grendel) and who end up killing himself after making Beowulf king.
The great Chris Sarandon is also in this(Fright Night) and we get to see one of the Coreys play a fun vampire.
I also think he was one of the aspects of this movie that held redeeming value.
What we also have is an absolute blast!!!
It is no "Ninja Scroll", but it is definitely not worse - quite different but also very atmospheric.
I would also say that it captures the same style from the Manga (comic books) that is very funny and romantic.
My super, smoking, sexy, hot boyfriend made two turkeys today we have yet to eat them....smells good, also mashed potatoes, stuffing with sausage, greens beans, nice rolls and butter and we didn't even need gravy in a can...homemade gravy.
His mom Rusty (Cher) has a drug problem and has a poor relationship with her own parents, and he spends his time hanging out mostly with a rather tough looking group of bikers, at least some of whom are also into drugs.
From what I understand, Diana didn't actually exist (although some think she may have been a composite of several girls in Rocky's life) and, while touching, the closing scene, where Rusty, Gar and Dozer visit the cemetery and Dozer puts flowers on the grave, is also a creation - Rocky's body was donated for medical research.
It is also backed up by excellent performances by Cher and Eric Stoltz.
Rocky also gets a boost of confidence from his mother, Rusty Dennis, played with sheer excellence by Cher.
Mention should also be made of Dennis Burkley as a slow-witted family friend and of Richard Dysart and the late Estelle Getty who register in one scene as Rusty's parents.
There is also gar,a biker who treats rocky as if he were his own son.At the beginning the odds are stacked against rocky but through love and perseverance,he emerges as an inspiration to all around him.
Rocky also falls in love with a blind girl who even though she is blind,she loves rocky for who he is.
There are wonderful performances from all the leads and also from a young Laura Dern ( destined to even greater things) and the whole movie is a complete success.
I know the movie was sad but it also had a good message.
Cher as his mother, and Estelle Getty and Richard Dysart as her long-suffering parents; she is a rebel/Hell's Angel (apparently this was also true) and fights an uphill battle to give Rocky some kind of life while he still has the chance.
Laura Dern also has a good role as Rocky's friend.
Beautiful movie from a true master Peter Bogdanovich.Truly warm movie about a boy Rocky who has a rare disease so people often think he's wearing a mask.But he was lucky because he had a family.Maybe not kind of family we all think about when we hear that word,but he had a true family who loved him till the end.His family was mother,drug addict and bunch of bikers.All of them saw something in Rocky and that something was his inside and not outside.Story is very good and you can relate it to any other story from todays life.This isn't just a story about boy with weird face,it's a story about whole society,family and mostly about people.What is really important to us people?How we look from the outside or from the inside.Only girl who connected with Rocky was a blind girl.Isn' that tragic how we,people have wrong priorities in life.Excellent movie that really touched me and also some great performance from Eric Stoltz,Cher and Sam Elliott.All time story with great directing and good acting.
Eric Stoltz also gives a hell of a performance as Rocky Dennis, the teenager who's head is a weird shape because of a growth problem.
It's real life we're  watching here, and knowing that it's also a true story makes it all the  more touching and wonderful.
While the story initially seems to be about Rocky, it's also about Rusty.
Beowulf was also supposed to kill her, not make a dragon child with her.
Sam Eliot plays her biker boyfriend but also has a soft spot for Rocky.
Paris: Great clip, Beatrice Dalle is beautiful in this clip, very convincing and the story is also very great with good message.
Honest also, the film doesn't ask much of the viewer; only that he or she listens and watches carefully.
All of these individuals 'are' the film, which shows each taxi from a few camera angles and cares about anything else than the people in each car (the ones who are not driving also give magnificent portrayals) and the streets of each city.
But to write it down and shoot it for people to watch it, laugh at or with it and maybe also cry, is very original and unforgettable.
Very different are the movies of the world-versatile Jarmusch, a real Odysseus for whom the Greek attribute "polytropos" could not better fit - also what the choice of his movies concerns.
To a nice allusion Jarmusch also succeeded in the last episode which shows a cab drive of three drunks in Helsinki.
At first he's just a confused foreigner who knows nothing about America, but then we discover that, even though he is, he's also a smart, happy guy who just loves being who he is.
Recommended to anyone that wants to see a quirky film that is also very funny.
This also applies to the cut scenes between dialogue ... at times I was drooling!
It also left the door open for further possibilities.
It also showed a real problem that minorities face here in NY trying to hail a cab.
Alternately funny and reflective, but always entertaining, this is definitely Jarmusch' most accessible, and also one of his most compelling.
The New York segment is also pretty funny, with YoYo getting irked by Helmut's inability to drive, and making fun of his name.
So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3-D (more on that brilliant factor later) but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway.
Grendell's attack on a beer hall is the opening action sequence, and it is surprisingly violent for a 12a and also amazing to behold.
The storyline and film making is also extremely effective.
As I've mentioned the 2-D version just won't be as good, but also the movie doesn't seem like it'll be that good at the start.
It's also the segment which provides a little extra bitter of a touch by way of the Ivory Coast cabbie, however it does come to pass as being about two outsiders thrust into a strange little moment in life.
It's also a small ruby of a communication fable, of how lives in different cities and countries may be of course different in speech and attitude and dress, but have similar plights to deal with in the dead of night.
Being a work of CGI, you will also have to allow for the flaws of pure CGI work.
Wynona Ryder's performance of the 20-year-old, chain-smoking taxi driver does not work very well and also makes for the least interesting story.
I wonder what this movie would have been like, if Jarmusch had also considered taxis in non-western countries.
It also features an optional commentary by Greg Ford.
However, he must also deal with Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie).
Beowulf is opposed by Unferth (John Malkovich), and has also been paying close attention to the king's wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).
For smaller kids the comic book is available also.
It includes both some really sad moments (including the death of sympathetic characters - a topic rarely treated in children's films), but also some funny ones, like the hilarious scene where the two geese get drunk or the scenes that feature the two stupid dogs.
The music is also quite different and more menacing and appropriate for a horror movie than the jazzy 80's-style soundtrack that's on the US cut.
In essence all of the movies are also the same with its story and development.
Next to the gore, also all of the other typical Italian horror movie elements are present here; many young characters, a scary kid (although she is only scary in one sequence), cannibalism and a psychotic monster like killer.
It also definitely helps the movie and its tension that the killer his face isn't shown until about halve way through the movie.
It makes the movie more mysterious and tense at the same time, which also really adds to the atmosphere.
There are also two sequences that make this movie a memorable one and through that also makes it distinct itself from other genre movies.
The movie is filled with also some other great gory sequences and scare moments, such as the head in the bucket and the Irina Karamanlis suicide.
The movie is also helped by it's killer, that is a great character, who is also quite scary looking.
I also at the same time adds to the charm of the movie and it gives B-slasher movies like this one (because let's face it, this is a B-movie, no matter how well its made) a big cult following.
He also has quite the line of Porn and Erotic material, most of it easy to find, if that floats your boat.
The Iceland born Canadian director,Sturla Gunnarson,tried to get back to what could have been the original story that evolved over the centuries into the legend.It was gritty,made on a shoestring and had only limited cinema release,but thankfully it is available on DVD and is well worth a look.There is also an excellent companion DVD documentary called 'Wrath of Gods'which tells the incredible story of the filming of the movie, and the struggle to complete it with financial problems and the absolute hell of shooting it at the start of the Icelandic winter.
The new 'Beowulf' has also tried to ride on the coattails of '300', but again it suffers by not having real actors showing their courage and emotions.
An interesting point is the actor who links these three films - charismatic Gerard Butler.He was fiery yet also sensitive as King Leonidas and the earlier Beowulf and made the roles his own.
The "bad-guy" is also suitable creepy and bugged-out looking - and the gore scenes at the end make up for the slow pace as the last 20 minutes or so are pretty fast-paced.
While watching the opening credits I also found out that it was directed by Joe D'Amato, big time sleaze/horror director.
The score is also perfect and creates the other half of the movie's atmosphere and dark vibe.
His "Beyond The Darkness" (see review) is also righteous exploitation, a shameless look at a deliciously revolting subject.
He'll also bite a chunk of flesh from a throat later in the film when he pulls a victim's face through the hole of a mansion's ceiling.
You also see the aftermath of a cleaver stabbed into a victim's face.
The film also has a nifty sequence where Julie finds a hidden room where Eastman's sister kept many of his first victims through the breaking of a mirror, in the mansion of a family who worked for the village.
(For what it's worth, the blind girl is also pretty cool -- on par with the blind girl in "Castle Freak" -- and I'm very glad they scripted her in to this one.)
I've found myself comparing many different secluded-island horror movies to this one, most recently Stuart Gordon's "Dagon," but also "Shockwaves," both great but neither quite evoking the atmosphere and classic horror that Antropophagus does.
The film also has a reputation as one of the worst films on the list, with accusations that it is boring, inconsequential, absurd.
As usually happens in a stalk-and-slash film, the killer Â a giant cannibal played by regular D'Amato collaborator George Eastman (who also scripted) Â picks the tourists off one by one and murders by munching into their necks and chomping on their flesh.
But, if you can find the original American version of the movie I would get it also, under the title of The Grim Reaper.
Apart from its shocking violence, "Antropophagus" maintains a very scary atmosphere, and its cast includes many familiar faces for Italian Horror fans, such as Tisa Farrow and George Eastman (whom Spaghetti Western fans might also know).
The actor who plays EZ was also excellent.
I also enjoyed the ski and snowboarding photography, and would have liked to see even more of it.
I like how the show is stereotypical also, like it's how high school really is.
Lily is cool, I'm a vegetarian also.
Tammy-Lynn Michaels and Leslie Bibb are also amazing and deserve more roles.
Life is not only tears, and it's not only laugher... life is a combination of suffering, pain and also love and happiness.
The movie also suffers from the age old, it's creepy because it's almost perfect.
I'm DYING to know what happened to Brooke and also who Harrison chose.
Some of the episodes were honestly laugh out loud, but could also make me cry at the same time.
Murphy has also revealed that he and the WB entered into talks about a potential spin-off called "The Cherrys" which would have starred Delta Burke and Leslie Grossman as Cherry Cherry and Mary Cherry.
Yes, the show spoofs 'teen issues' but, also adds its own unique take on them.
But (and this is really hard without spoiling the movie), the battle that turns him into a hero also leads inexorably to his undoing.
A special mention also to Crispin Glover's Grendel.
A DVD version is also a waste of material.
I also liked the style of the film as the older man (Rey) recounts his tale to enthralled train riders.
The ideology hidden in the plot, defending the intervention of the American government in the Civil War of Nicaragua is also a crap.
The character development also bears a strong mention.
While we discover this mainly through their interaction, it is also subtlely exemplified in scenes such as the first sign of Secondo's pure delight while test driving a Cadillac, and Primo's abject happiness while discussing art and his passion for food with a woman with whom he is clearly smitten.
It also unfortunately reminded me that I have a long way to go with my own italian cuisine.
He also gives the funniest pep talk in the film: "Bite your teeth into the ass of life and drag it to you!"
I felt the same way about "The Imposters," which Tucci also co-wrote.
Although Secundo is in constant chagrin about Primo's stiff-necked refusal to cater to public taste, he also recognizes that his brother's talent is rare and precious and hesitates to force the restaurant menu in a more popular and profitable direction.
But the film, though sweet, also establishes an undertone of such mournfulness that the viewer is not surprised when Prima never shows up, in fact, was never going to show up; it was a brutal trick by Pascal, who recognizes the brothers' abilities, so that they would be forced to close the restaurant and, he hopes, go to work for him.
I also found it also rather sexy.
We were also shocked by the caresses of the chest scene, which in commercial film is rare today although in the late sixties, seventies, and part of the eighties, the obligatory nude love scene on American screens were mandatory.
Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat.
The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer.
Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac.
However, it is also quite slow, and has no real resolution.
It's soundtrack is also a fantastic celebration of Italian music.
Pascal doesn't give it to him but decides to help him by having singer Louis Prima come to their restaurant with the press knowing he's coming also.
This film also does a believable job of recreating the time period that the film is suppose to take place in.
I thought BABETTE'S FEAST was too full of whimsy, and whimsy also bogged down the often good TAMPOPO(EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, it could be argued, was a relationship movie which happened to be set in the world of food, where the others are inextricably food movies).
In my opinion the acting performance of all the young actors are great and effective and also the musics chosen for the movie are making the movie more emotional and binds you with the characters of the movie more deeply.
Also in the film we see not only the exam stress that the students are dealing with but also their relationships and mostly disagreements with their parents.
The movie brings us the feeling of wrong idea of this exam,and it also adds everyone has thought to make difference,but in the end you wont,only hard-workers will win in the end,so criticism of exam and showing the results of working is too balanced so,we can agree it both ways..  Acting:Not the greatest there are some typecasting characters such as Big-Bad-Headmaster,Slutty music teacher,horny tea seller,punk-girl who was before a actual girl etc..But we can feel what students fell really,because of i was in that exam last year,i know that pressure and you feel it too..
Scenes:Some kinda video clip style,which is absolute problem of director,and because of shooting you always feel like its Requem For A Dream,and it also gives you pressure too..
What made really excited is the level of quality of direction in this movie.I know the music clips and other films of this director (Ã.Faruk Sorak who also directed G.O.R.A.)
Not only did he not get the girl, but he also ends up stealing all of her products (which happen to be sausages) and handing them out to all of the people who are nearby.
He was also correct that the armed forces would depend on air power, a fact the armed forces ignored until nearly 1939 when Hitler proved what a modern air force could do.
Besides also starring Ralph Bellamy, Charles Bickford, and Rod Steiger, the film also features some later TV stars - Elizabeth Montgomery, Jack Lord, John Daly, Darren McGavin and Peter Graves.
Notwithstanding the Wright brother's initial breathtaking powered flight, by 1914 England, France and Germany were far ahead of us in not only aircraft design but also in fashioning tactics for a new kind of warfare.
Yet the film, newly restored, reaffirmed not only Mr. McKenzie's vision, but also strengthened so many of our feelings about silent films.
Its also very funny and touching and a really good way to spend 53 minutes.
He also filmed the first 'talkie', which was a failure because all the actors were speaking Chinese.
He was also the pioneer in color film, because he went to Tahiti to get some special berries that could be used in the creation of color, and when he was using the resulting film to capture images, topless and curious Tahitian women wandered into the picture, resulting in his arrest for portraying smut on film.
This also chronicles the creation of the never-finished film "Salome", for which McKenzie built an entire city somewhere on the est coast of NZ.
It's also done in a seemingly straightforward documentary way, like seeing one of the PBS specials or something (I'm also reminded of the recent mock-doc Confederate States of America).
There's also MacKenzie's bread & butter as he tries to finance his pet project, Salome (the film Jackson and his team are sort of after in present-day), which are the random silent comedies of Stan the Man (Peter Corrigan in hilarious make-up), who goes about hitting people un-suspecting pies, as he figures that attacks that are on the innocent (which happens after he strikes a child in one of his early comedies) could work well, that is, until the Prime Minister is on the scene.
All of this is great fun, even if in-between there's a lot of actual sincere stuff put in, also in part fun in being a dead-pan examination of the the ups for MacKenzie (his ill-begotten but always accomplished feats of invention and creation) and downs too (i.e.
It also might add frustration, I'd guess, if one didn't know that it was a big gag in the guise of professional historical research.
This short film not only showcases Peter Jackson's versatility as a director, but also acts as a tribute to the early pioneers of cimema.
We were of course, greatly impressed with the enormity of the project and could only surmise that the actors in the "Salome" movie were also conned into thinking they were filming a real movie and didn't know the truth until the 'doco' came out.
It was also good to see Carole Bouquet in 'That Obscure..' in her pre James Bond days.
But it also works as an exciting thriller, even if you have never heard the name Olof Palme before.
(Even better than any of the Swedish Hamilton and also the Beck movies where the main actor Mikael Persbrandt plays a main support role.)
(Even better than any of the Swedish Hamiton and also the Beck movies where the main actor Mikael Persbrandt plays a main support role.)
It's also one of those films that benefits from being watched more than once.
The landscapes shown are also stunning and stark.
She's not above gifts... or using her male companions to also rob Mathieu of specific amounts of money.
I knew I'd watched the great telling of a great story, but also had a sincere appreciation for Curran's respect of our integrity as viewers.
It also focuses tone-wise as the film progresses.
fyi: George Chakiris (of "West Side Story" fame) can also be seen in the movie btw: MGM didn't even release this film in New York, that demonstrated their "faith" in this flick.
He also said that MGM too had no faith in this movie and underdistributed it shamefully.
The swings are also far more effective and fast(again, with the release of Episode 1).
You also get to use both sides, in SP.
You can also live your Darth Vader dream and grip an opponent and throw him off an edge or just crush'em!
It should also appeal to Star Trek Elite Force fans too, with the same game engine and the nice guns you get in the game.
It also inspired the ABC After School Special Teenage Father, and three episodes of 7th Heaven about teenage pregnancy.
There are outright cases of abuse, but it is also hard to believe people may be unaware they are abusing an animal; for example if they are elderly, and have too many dogs in the apartment.
It also educates those in the audience who may be considering buying a cat or dog, and not aware of the responsibility.
The cover art had a very interesting retro 50's look that also made me inquisitive.
It's also George Romero country, and there are more than a few scenes here that resemble bits of Night of the Living Dead.
I also liked the description of the zitheads terrorizing the area.
I have read H. P. Lovecraft and also Kenneth Grant's post-Crowleyan magickal writings describing journeys behind the Tree of Life which would have preempted H.P.L.
It also lends him a sort of imagery, as a worker, a man who made it on his own.
I think that this movie has also taught my "dog" how to talk.
The non-rhetoric tone chosen for the story is Eastwood's true landmark (see also "A perfect world") and I found extremely touchy and delicate the scene where "Doc" finds the corpse of his mate Iggy brutally tortured, he lights up an electric torch but all we see is his own face looking at the dead man, not the corpse.
This also might be the best movie ever made about war-time propaganda, revealing the nuts and bolts of manufacturing heroes for public consumption.
It was also one of the only movies I've seen where all (save 1) of the audience stayed for all of the credits and when the credits ended, there was a long, silent moment shared by all.
Mr. Film-buff says "I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings ... we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film."
We have also had some superb anti-war films such as Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957) set in WWI.
Like "The Right Stuff," Eastwood also raises the question of what is a hero and why even heroes that have been manufactured by bureaucrats and the media can serve an important function.
While viewers were likely entranced by shots of the real people that had been portrayed in the film, they may also have stayed in the dark until the tears had dried on their cheeks and they could stand and walk silently from the theater.
I have to say that this film was eastwoods better works of history.The ability to bring out the real feelings in people about how we view the human race in general.I enjoyed this film for the simple reason that WWII was a turning point in how we see each other.How to come together in the highest need to overcome obstacles in the darkest hour.As the flag was raised and having a photographer just at that moment to take a picture of the flag being raised,coincidence flew out the door.But the film goes further as we see each one remembering the pain it created,from a simple misunderstanding about who gets what flag and why.If anything the flag should have went to the soldiers who fought there at iwogima.But like the narrations pointed out,it was a forgotten past and the hero's also forgotten.It's sad to think that the human race no longer sees why war is not necessary,just as long as money is made in the name of war is what it's all about.They were right though,without the money it would have been lost to the Japanese at least that part of the world.But in reality it would still be Japanese soil.This film impacted on all sorts of levels,financial gain through war,the soldiers dying because of money being made,artillery paid for by millions of people,and the suffering going home without so much as a thank you for keeping the world safe.In reality the soldiers who fought and died i would like to call real hero's.No matter what flag was planted,and why today most of the yesteryear men and women are nearly gone.I have to say this film gave me a bit more understanding why war is becoming a thing of the past.We don't need it and don't want it,flag or not we need this world safe and i think Mr. Eastwood gave us a good vision of it becoming a reality.So go ahead make his day.
It also opened up the American eyes to the tenacity of the Japanese troops and their relentless defence of the homeland from invasion, in a Digital Domain CGI-created massive naval beach landing.
What is also true to life is how these men - Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, and John Bradley - did not see themselves to be heroes.
For this moving and important message, "Flags of Our Fathers" deserves to be placed not only among the greatest war films of all time, but also alongside classics like "Citizen Kane."
I can't wait for Letters From Iwo Jima (the companion piece, also from Clint Eastwood, told from the Japanese point of view.)
You also get the feeling that BuÃ±uel knew this was going to be his last film with the ending, which is perfectly abrupt.
He's been assigned to work with a French officer named Richard (Tcheky Karyo), who's obviously corrupt and also calls Li by John since he can't pronounce his real name.
It's also by chance he discovers that she was a witness to the kingpin's murder and can clear his name.
The film's best action sequence is Li's two-on-one fight with the "blonde brothers" in the finale who, I must say, also display some very impressive martial arts moves (Can Li even do flips like that one blonde guy does?).
The action is also very bloody and graphically violent.
The first rule of shooting a martial arts scene,especially when the actor is also a talented martial artist, is to pull the camera back and shoot it with a wide angle with longer takes and not to do so many close ups with excessively fast cutting of scenes to the point where the whole body cannot be seen and consequently the FUlL power, grace and the execution of the technique is lost to the audience.
Thanks to Luc Besson, the movie also gets Thierry Arbogast, who is a GREAT technician when it comes to creating the saturated atmosphere.
Credits must also go to the director (Chris Nahon) , making this movie as your first movie ever is a great earning !!
I was really rooting for the 2 main characters as TchÃ©ky Karyo is actually frightening as the main villain, and wanted to see what was coming to him!, plus it also had some good dialog!.
Li is on fire, not only one of the toughest guys on the planet, but also one of the coolest.
It may be slightly tamer but it's made by the same people (producer Luc Besson, Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Cory Yuen) and is also set in France, only with a warmer, more exotic look.
The use of no wires is also a very nice touch.
Liu also becomes involved with a local American woman named Jessica (Bridget Fonda), who was forced into prostitution when Richard kidnapped her child.
I've read some theorizing that the one of the sides was emotive, & the other distracting -- which is also plausible.
Camilla (for the moment) is a mere duchess, but is also "HRH".
Eduncan-1 should also get his facts right.
The ending in my opinion is also quite memorable.
Caught in vicious cycle of metals, ribbons, honors, dinners, toasts, he is also caught in a deeper vicious cycle of killing and bloodshed.
This was his second movie (after Tonight is Ours, also with March in it) and he does a fine job.
Since they were set in NEw York (big cities as settings don't fair well on soaps except Bold and the Beautiful), they also went out on the streets of the city to shoot.
She is also responsible for neglecting herself and the relationships that are important to her, including her relationships with her adopted mother, Lily, her husband and her children.
I also heard that the audience is told beforehand to laugh, whether the jokes are funny or not.
They have to also perform tasks to get their rewards, e.g.
:) I've also been watching the live feeds for the last two seasons, and find that that makes the show a lot more interesting.
They must also nominate two people each week to put up for eviction.
It also talked about other real life problems like aids, teenagers in general and things that had a lot of depth and meaning.
The producers also looks for people who would end up fighting with each other, for example a homophobic and the most camp homosexual alive.
It also looks for ways to get break the 9 o'clock watershed.
I've seen a lot of rubbish being shown on TV in the past, but this show has to be in my Top 5 All Time Rubbish TV Shows (X-Factor is also featured on this list).
Lou Diamond Phillips, whose career also has its hormonal side, actually turns in a good performance as the complicated secret agent.
I also like the way boomer is constantly dragged into scenario that he is totally not accountable.
Just bare in mind that it's not a comedy, but it's also not a total shoot em up.
It's understandable to be fair game, but when you team with a killer who is also the target, you have no choice but to work together.
The story is also developing pretty good and it takes unexpected turns as the good guy turn bad and the bad ones turn good.
This movie was actually shown on PBS when it first came out, and many schools also utilize it in English class.
This is only the second movie I seen Fred MacMurray in (no my three sons here) besides Double Indemnity and his performance is very good here also,... just as Double Indemnity...
He also pretends to be a rock star & sticks pins in dolls, etc.
Treat Williams was also excellent.
I also believe it would be as meaningful today as it was in 1985.
Furtheron they also listened what they did with Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street, I mean the children singing chants.
Kurt Russell also did a find job as Malcolm Anderson and the two worked really well together.
And YES, I also agree that likely the main culprit here was the director (thus like CA said, not surprisingly the guy did only 2 other films) First thing on looking this up here on IMDb was 'Who the hell is that...???'
It is also one of those "axe to grind" films where fans of the short story feel compelled to whine about the adaptation not being faithful to their interpretation of the book, although Oates endorses it without reservation on her website.
Based on the novel "In the Heat of the Summer" by John Katzenbach (who also wrote "Just Cause").
Andy Garcia is also quite likeable in the role he's best at: solid support work as a police detective pal of Russell's journalist who inadvertantly gets as much press as the glory-seeking villain.
Mary Kay Place, as the mother is also good, as well as the rest of the ensemble playing cast.
I am among the few that saw it during the initial week or two that it was in theatrical release, I am also privileged to own a copy of the media kit and a bootleg of an editors cut with additional footage.
A super sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also doesn't get out of hand with being too ridiculous.
It also mentions a sequel, but apparently Buckaroo had better things to do, like become Robocop!
In addition to their work beyond the frontiers of known science, they are also a music band with raving fans and groupies.
The payoff is not only getting a grip on the ultimate battle between the black lectroids (good guys) and the red lectroids (bad guys), but you are also treated to picking up on new gags and jokes (actually more like bits of humor - to wit: Who in their right mind would build a jet car out of an Econoline Van???)
Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids, `John Bigboote,' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot (especially when Lizardo insists on calling him `Big-Booty,' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced `Bigboo-TAY!').
They also call in another scientist that is supposed to be a little crazy.
This movie steals pretty much everything from the alien movies, the look of the monster is also very similar to the monster in Alien.
It's also a treat to see a young Nicolas Lea (from the X Files) in this - battling aliens, no less!
There are some good punch-scenes also and some that could benefit from some more timing..
It was Cagney's 3rd film and also down in the cast was Joan Blondell - they had both been plucked from the Broadway play "Penny Arcade" and given roles in the film version "Sinner's Holiday" (coincidentally, Grant Withers was also the star in the film version).
The story is also kind of weird, and, like a lot of these very short dramas of the 1930s, there are logical jumps and loose threads.
There is also an extremely impressive special effects-driven climax which uses models completely seamlessly.
She also wrote books, at least one of which made certain other Hollywood women angry at her.
As a head trip food for thought film this is almost too much to take in.For the first Hour and fifteen minutes or so its also a finely crafted supernatural thriller.
Overall, Artemis '81 reminded me more than anything of Twin Peaks (which was made nearly a decade later, and, curiously, also featured Dan O'Herlihy) - the same sense of explanation hidden just around the corner, and another reality just half-glimpsed and poorly understood.
Had he shown that he understood the nature of the development of his relationships with the two girls, but forgave them, that also would have indicated character growth.
Well, this is basically an average Columbo movie in every way thinkable but since all of the Columbo movies are such of high quality and features a great and successful formula, this movie is also a perfectly good one to watch.
This is not the Columbo movie that features the best or most original story but it's even more a bigger shame that this also isn't among the fastest ones.
The story is progressing quite slowly, which is also reason why this movie isn't among the most interesting or best Columbo movies to watch that are out there.
On top of that, the movie also features some silly and just plain unlikely plot elements.
Thankfully this also means that it features some good relieving fun humor, of course all involving the unusual Lieutenant, who basically at times is like a child in the big world, although it of course also often is part of his act to gain the trust of his suspects by playing dumber than he really is, in order to get closer to them and getting his information from them.
In this movie the role of the murderer is being played by George Hamilton, who is a great actor and also plays a good role in this movie.
There is also a fine role from Lesley Ann Warren in the movie and of course Peter Falk is great as usual as the scruffy looking Columbo.
This is unusually conveyed by Columbo at a party full of guests; an engaging and sharply observed sequence, which also sees the murderer cleverly execute the murder of this lover through hypnosis over the telephone.
One must also mention the quality of Hamilton's performance in all of this; his character's womanising ways are typically exhibited, but his presence in this episode warrants respect, especially considering his unflappability and self-assuredness; traits which are powerfully upheld until the closing scenes, when he tries to undermine Columbo's perceptions of proof and the validity of an eye-witness (who comes forward rather conveniently late in proceedings) in front of his colleagues.
Unfortunately it can also leave a sense of dissatisfaction, as it did for me.
So, as I overall liked this movie because of good plot and atmosphere, and also because of mostly good acting, I give it a final score of 8/10.
If you like Special Report: Journey to Mars, you might also view Special Bulletin a movie based a terrorist take over of a Tugboat during a workers strike.
He'll soon find it, as there's much need for able men not only in the hero department but also pretty girls need attention -- even in the Burma jungle.
He introduces him to missionary Brenda DaBanzie and also to a lovely Eurasian played by Win Min Than in her one and only film.
I also found the picture of Bloor's wife and family very touching.
In this case Bortko who not only directed but also wrote the script is not up to the task.
I also would like to add couple of more things.
It also contains a few too many stiff upper lipped chaps   I do give credit to the movie for bringing some type of psycological thought to the story though .
The visit also gave me the opportunity to actually have breakfast with Grgory Peck before the days shooting.
The film is also rather poorly plotted, with it all going well until we get to about the hour mark and then it takes a horrible downturn, almost into the realms of boring; this is a far cry from The Godfather films for Coppola.
It is also an indictment of oligopolistic business practices and the financial and political power of big business that keeps innovation from the American consumer in this flawed system.
This is a film for someone who might be interested not only in old cars with futuristic ideas, but also the inner workings of big business and the government of the 1940's.
Jeff Bridges also comes up a winner as Tucker even though he does not have a golden statuette to prove it.
But we like riding in it, and it has an appeal that gives something just a little different, and it's also pretty to look at, too.
Which shows that Bortko also has zero grasp of the philosophical and religious issues of the book.
It also was refreshing to see a nice, supportive family, too.
I also enjoyed the Levi's commercial, with the truck driver.
The collection also features some commercial work and short films that Gondry has produced during his professional career including a beautifully shot black and white film called "The Letter".
I also don't see the exact reason for creating a new character, the man in uniform with the glasses and very recognizable accent who is in charge of investigating the "crimes of the band of powerful hypnotists" - how they call Woland and his entourage.
It also includes some more obscure French ones (Gondry's earlier work).
The extra bits, short films, interview with Gondry, etc are also very interesting and a must-see for fans of his work.
This is my favourite DVD among the three "work of director" series, which also include Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham.
After being introduced to this series shortly after it came out I've taped this and shown the entire series to two women, who also loved it.
An excellent series which should also establish for itself the crown of Classic.
It also introduced me to the fine British actor, Derek Jacobi.
Livia was the wife of Augustus Caesar played by Brian Blessed and Phillips also got a career role.
He conveys the historical Augusus very well who was both amicable and good natured but also very imposing and powerful.
(2) Much has also been said about the lack of expensive sets, location shots, or special effects.
I found this a message of lifelong importance in both politics and management, and it is rare indeed that such a remarkable piece of drama and entertainment is also so fundamentally educational.
Cruelty is also not the focus as being the goal in itself.
The role is reminiscent of Eleanor of Aquitaine in `The Lion in Winter', except that even Katherine Hepburn's Oscar-wining performance in that film is utterly outdone here (ironically, SiÃ¢n Phillips also played the role of Queen Eleanor, in the BBC's adaptation of `Ivanhoe').
He also presents the gripping dilemma that Joe faces, forced to stay and write for his son's safety and at the same time seduced by the prospect of writing a unique chronicle...and by an ex-girlfriend who has never aged after he left.
He also seems to like the small-town theme (see 'The Stuff') where strange happenings are plentiful and the townsfolk are more than a little strange and scary.
", and "Return to Salem's Lot" was, not just truly horrible, but also a is a real joke of a horror movie.
Larry Cohen, who also wrote It's Alive, It Lives Again, and Maniac Cop 1 & 2, penned this screen play.
Unfortunately, he was also the director on this project, which explains the inability of the director to add a different perspective on the written work, and a 3.8/10 rating here at IMDb would seem to support the fact that something did, indeed, go wrong.
VD also gets beat up by a cop & 1 scene, he opens show curtain & see VD showering, what a gay cop.
So, they drew up a little template that would NOT ONLY FORM THE BASIS OF EVERY FUTURE VAN DAMME FLICK, but would also be COPIED BY COUNTLESS OTHER CHOP SOCKY PRODUCTIONS, especially those of the STRAIGHT TO VIDEO VARIETY.
Of course this tactic also fails, and the damn Limey is arrested or killed.
Joss Ackland is also excellent as one of the main villains, didn't have much screen time though.
Kieran Culkin was excellent and also Ted Levine.
There is also the typical "show butt" scene, but what is somehow misplaced is the scene where the kids talk about Van Damme's penis at the dinner, actually unnecessary.
The reason I felt compelled to write this review is that I am, admittedly, a bit of a Cinesnob, but I'm also happy to take a film for what it is.
I like James Bond, I like Sonny Chiba, I like blaxploitation and I also fricking like Van Damme movies!
As if her being a still distraught widow weren't enough, she is also being harassed to a rather unreasonable degree by Ted Levine, who is hilarious and brilliant and the land developer's chief henchman.
Rosanna Arquette also handles her role well, even if the character is flying dangerously close to stereotype.
Her performance grounds the whole story, and we both care for her plight and admire her determination (the men in the audience will also admire her perfectly formed semi-naked body).
If it weren't bad enough that the action scenes are badly shot and clumsily edited, they're also punctuated by really poor one-liners from JC ("Strike 3, you're out!"
The direction is tight and I lked the score also.
This also makes the sinister themes more bearable to watch as Allan seems more or less unaffected.
Here, it's not just the discovery of Peter Schonau Fog, but also of the tremendous cast, especially young Jannik Lorenzen, who plays 11-year-old Allan to perfection with his cheeky bewilderment, and eventually with a heavy disappointment that accompanies his loss of innocence.
Ray McKinnon also does an excellent job as Mad Wayne or Wayne-O, as Burt Reynolds calls him.
I also like this episode because it offers a different combination.
It would also be interesting to know why the movie was completed in 2001 but not released until 3 years later, and then only in Belgium and Holland.
It is a true X Files episode in that it's confusing and makes you think, but it is also extremely lighthearted and comical at the same time.
There is a very old name for him, being 'Pitch' (funny also because of it's musical reference).
There were quite a few jokes in there, but there was some very old songs also, passed down from age to age through lore.
Name a slasher since the big three that has added anything new to this genre...more graphic gore is not setting a trend...blair witch was absolutely a yawner...and i am guessing the same people yapping at this movie loved Blair Witch...what an awesome idea treating it as behind the scenes documentary for the first half...sure it was predictable....name a slasher or any other movie for that matter that isn't...sure there were movies that have shocked us but they are few and far between...as to protecting people...relax those protector's also love the nanny state and probably need people to protect them from things like horrible flicks.
It's also not a real "slasher" film, because you do not see much slashing around, there are not many horrifying close-ups (besides some ripped out larynx that looked rather artificial) ... it's generally not very gory, it's not laugh-out-loud-funny, but all in all I highly enjoyed watching it.
It also explores the history of the slasher genre, because Vernon is, of course, an avid horror movie buff, and idolizes all the great masked murderers.
He's obviously disturbed and is also the product of a rape of his mother, but the most startling aspect of his character is how incredibly NORMAL he is.
Goethals is also quite good but she shines, when she shares scenes with Baesel.
While adding a slight dark humor in there, there is also something so unusual about him.
It's also just as enjoyable.
Some people maybe also turned off by the lack of blood and gore, but that just means more people can enjoy this film.
Angela Goethals is also very good as Taylor Gentry, the aspiring on-camera reporter who gets sucked into Leslie's disarming charm when he agrees to allow her and her film crew to document every aspect of his first major endeavor: the selection, preparation for and actual execution of a bunch of drunk, horny teens.
And I also want to mention the best part of the flick - when it makes its startling transition from "faux horror documentary" to out-and-out horror film.
Leslie has also set up the location for the spree he's planning, and it's the old farmhouse where the young boy, who he is stealing the identity of, was dragged out & thrown over a waterfall many years ago, and now he's poised to "come back" for vengeance.
Leslie is also a former mental patient but he does play that down a bit.
There's also an "Ahab", a rescuer, a sort of adversary, in a character played by Robert Englund, of all people, who knows (or seems to) what's going on and is bound to stop it.
He also finds the time to hook up with his mentor, now supposedly retired, played by the wonderful and under-rated veteran Scott Wilson.
There are also discussions about the nature of sexual symbolism, both phallic and yonic.
There's also an ultimate revelation to come although it doesn't come off as that surprising given the way the film-makers so gleefully play with us, and so well establish Leslie's cunning intelligence.
"Behind The Mask: The Rise Of Leslie Vernon" is very similar in that aspect, but it's also completely different in others.
He's friends with an older, more experienced slasher, who's also very warm and talkative.
This one favorite Betty Boop cartoon and also "Cinderella" is one of my favorite fairy stories; I also would like to point out that this short was maded 16 years ago before Disney's theatrical version.
Like I said I love animation from Fleischer Studios (also from Disney,Hanna/Barbera,Rankin/Bass and Studio Ghilbi from Japan) and Betty Boop is one of my favorite cartoon characters beside Bugs Bunny,Twetty,Pepe le Pew of Looney Tunes and Disney's Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse.
And I also love the main title song :  "I'm just a poor Cinderella Nobody loves me it seems And like a poor Cinderella I find my romance in dreams.
This cannot be confused with the rich and vibrant colors of true Technicolor--a more expensive process that was also being introduced around the same time.
Clearly this in an innovative film, though I also think it suffers from two major problems.
Second, if you are not a fan of Boop, you also might not be all that impressed--simply because she's a rather dull character compared to animated characters from the 40s and 50s (which had a lot more personality).
The Fleischers were likely also hoping that Betty's popularity would boost interest in the Color Classics series that they were starting.
!I should also mention that this film is hard to come by but you should try get it one ebay because it is worth it.The story to it is about a young dude called Vinnie who does boxing in his spare time but keeps getting kicked out of school.His mother is going out with a real scumbag guy because the father died.He often beats her and Vinnie thinks hes no good for her!Vinnies mother asks him to join the school band because she thinks it will keep him busy and off the streets away from all the bad action and maybe help him with a future career!
There is also the supposition that the alien presence is known, and has been known, for years.
The film also bathes the audience in sights and sounds.
It really shows how we are in society also, showing things that we tend to think we have to hide from everyone because of the way they react.
There is also the haunting singing of someone in an apartment in the building where all the interaction and often non-interaction of the other characters takes place.
Each week, our heroes arrived in a different community, got involved in a local difficulty, solved it, and moved on, all the time struggling to stay one step ahead of Urko ( 'The Incredible Hulk' series with Bill Bixby also utilised this format ).
Chosen as the film to start the Perspective Canada series for the 1999 Toronto Film Festival, "The Five Senses" explores numerous lives in turmoil that are also intertwined in many ways.
A dream full of naive peace-loving but also blind humanism.
It also mentions that the show was up against 2 very popular TV sitcoms at the time, Sanford & Son and Chico & the Man.
I also had the ape model kits.
It's also the story of the church trying to tie down God (Gulliver) and He loves us enough to let us for a little while, but He knows our nature is to war and He has to stop it.
The film also has an excellent soundtrack with great songs too.
Along with the exciting rescues, there were also some amusing situations.
I seem to remember one episode where they were responding to a house fire, and while they were working that fire, a house across the street also caught fire.
(Two "Gabby" shorts are also included on the DVD; draw your own conclusions.)
And we can also luxuriate in the well-drawn visuals, which allows the audience time to wallow in the rich colors and narrative (without the slam-bang short-attention-span cutting that sea-sickened me during "Atlantis" and similar Y2K material).
Continuity errors, cheap make up and effects, mics in the shot, film crew shadows and excessive lighting also ruin it beyond imagination.
She also becomes more herself and less a mindless killing machine as she drinks the blood of her victims.
There are also several shots of full frontal nudity on display throughout which should keep the fans of sleaze happy.
The script is rather trite, and the film is also rather oddly paced, as it starts off like any other silly zombie movie, only to mature into something much more interesting later on, which may annoy some viewers.
The lesbian undertones also help to up the sleaze level, which is fine with me!
Emergency(1972) that is the Year i was born that's why i love Emergency and engine 51 because i love the engine 51 and Fire Engine 51 also.
I hope Emergency(1972) be back for the season 3 in DVD so i get it also.
And Also the Cast of Engine 51 was also cool and awesome too!
It's also been described as "dreamy".
Jean Rollin's "La Morte Vivante"/"The Living Dead Girl" is an excellent erotic ultra-gory vampire tale and I like it very much.The film has some wonderful atmosphere and some striking images of eternal painful life.There is plenty of graphic gore to satisfy fans of extreme horror.Along with all of the gore there is a large amount of beautiful naked women running around.Rollin's trademark photography is naturally here but this film is much gorier than his other films that I've seen.Francoise Blanchard who plays bloodthirsty Catherine is incredibly beautiful.Overall,I enjoyed this film and you should too if you like zombie/vampire cinema.There is also an unofficial sequel to this one called "The Revenge of the Living Dead Girls"(1987).
I do have the pilot also, but due to some sad coincidences, it has a bit worse quality than the other episodes.
Obviously I was wrong in what I remembered but the touching song was played in the end causing me to cry as it did when I was a child :-( I'm also curious why she didn't sing it as "her" song in the movie?
The movie also featured a decent performance from Frederic Forrest as Rose's love interest Huston Dyer, who started as her chauffeur and ended up as her lover, but eventually had to get away from her and the life she was leading, although I found the romance a bit too contrived to be believable.
Having managed one very popular high-end Irish booze-hungry performer who showed up when he felt like it ("I know when the sound check should be") and also felt free to book conflicting dates on his own when he felt the money would be better -- AFTER a contract had been signed!
Vilmos Zsigmund's glittering, burnished, faded cinematography gives the film an appropriately blinding brightly saturated color flashy look, shooting the lively, uninhibited concert sequences through a dense smoky haze of piercing reddish hues (such fellow noted cameramen as Laszlo Kovacs, Owen Roizman and Haskell Wexler also lent a hand to the dazzling concert sequences).
I also had appeared in The 82 Club in New York City - a mafia-run establishment, and wonderful to work for, also closed - and was hired originally by Rydell as a consultant for the physical attributes in a long-closed speakeasy in downtown Los Angeles......it was larger, but perfect.
She also has an ambiguous relationship with David Keith who plays a young soldier she meets up with in an airport scene.
Forrest as Huston is also excellent.
The beginning of the show, in the Wedsworth-Townsend Act, everything is quiet, your seeing the fire trucks, then you go up the pole, see all of the fireman and then, breaking the silence, the big loud fire alarm blasts waking not only you but also the fireman up.
And I swear I remember Shirley Booth doing this on TV also.
I've also read that Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead were considered.
It also has as its hero a guy who looks remarkably like Mick Jagger(he has a huge jaw).
You also get to see a young Nikki Cox (and even at that yound age her acting is GREAT!).
Future sex kitten Nikki Cox is also here, but won't reach her potential for another three years.
That also never found a spot on NBC's regular schedule.
gay in new york city (early village) this a very important film for many reasons including the 1973 NYC gay pride parade footage, the very ground breaking subject of that time men on men in long term relationships, also for its very butiful gay love seence.
The film is also an incredible historical archive.
That it shows life before AIDS also adds a layer of poignancy that the filmmakers could never have planned for.
It's also interesting to look at gay lifestyles in this period setting.
Charlie walks with his bulldog and finds a "good luck" horseshoe when he passes a training camp that is looking for a boxing partner "who can take a beating".Charlie won't take a beating, that he has decided.After watching the others lose, he puts the horseshoe inside his glove and wins.Now the trainer prepares Charlie to fight the world champion.Can Charlie win this time.There's also a nasty gambler who wants him to throw the fight.And there's also some love in the air with the trainer's daughter.What a great silent short from Charles Chaplin.The Champion is from 1915 and it also stars Edna Purviance (Trainer's Daughter), Ernest Van Pelt (Spike Dugan), Lloyd Bacon (Second Sparring Partner etc.)
and Leo White (Crooked Gambler).You can also see Billy Armstrong, Ben Turpin and Broncho 'Billy' Anderson.This is a perfect comedy.There's no stop to laughter once you get started.When Charlie trains for his match and he keeps getting hits on his nose.When he shows off to Edna with the weights.How he kisses the dog on the head before going into ring.And the fight itself is priceless!
I also liked the way the music played together with the performances, it made the whole thing funnier.
I also hope they will be adding in some of the classic characters like Vultan and Prince Baron.
Flash also shows some restraint regarding sexually suggestive stuff that would largely sail over kids' heads, and violence that isn't too disturbing - how refreshing that they kept a story that was originally innocent & intended for children...suitable for children.
The comic-action mood of the series has also finally blossomed.
The dale character is also benefiting from Gina Holden's improving acting skills, and it is fun watching her want so badly to be an action hero and contribute to the team.
I also have to say I'm pleased with John Ralston's courageous interpretation of the Ming character.
She is also a great sidekick for flash.
It's also innocent enough to not be traumatic in children's minds.
It also has lots of action in it and the graphics are pretty good as well.
There's also a nice element of humor that the cast does a great job of pulling off.
also in the movie flash was a football hero, in the series he is a aging track athlete sponging off of his mom instead of being a man and earning his own living.
I'm also fairly certain there are laws against weapons and firearms being hidden in cars and trucks... right?
I'm also fairly certain that if **I** were Ming the Merciless, my Probe Scanning Flying things wouldn't be so easily decimated by some idiot wielding a double barrel shotgun.
Jody Racicot also does well as the extremely nervous Hans Zarkov (or "that strange fidgety little man", as Baylin calls him).
Karen ClichÃ© is easily one of the most enjoyable cast members, delivering humor with her confusion or lack of knowledge about human customs or lifestyles, however also is a tough woman with no problem punching someone in the face.
A simple well dressed slave with excellent skin tone and makeup, forget that she has access to the torture room... oh and a gun... oh and she knows the layout and guard patrols.. oh and she knows all about the water purification area under the castle (which for something so massively important to planetary survival has no security or guards)... She also knows how the patrol craft operate and how to use a dimension ripper.
Lets rip some more holes... Bounty hunter time, another rip and look the bounty hunter is a hottie too.. no armor... one gun... ummm yeah, oh and she can drive stick, she can also find people with her vast psychic powers too i guess.. the same psychic powers that let the princess find her way from Dale's place to Flash's mother's home on pure instinct.
I mean bad enough everyone speaks perfect English but they can also find one house out of a city without a map or a learner's permit.
I also wouldn't send 1 guy with dubious combat skills.
Anyway the evil princess gets fooled into thinking the I-mex is destroyed, although your average street magician could have been more convincing, and we find out daddy is alive (DUH) and is hooked up to some computer... maybe the one that maps your brain and would have told the bad guys not only where to locate it but also which pizza places would have delivered to the house while you were there...  You know some shows have plot holes, some have major ones (Professor stop making radios out of coconuts and fix the 2 foot hole in the boat) and some just say "We didn't actually care enough to hire writers, we just strung together a series of scenes and called it a pilot, we figure sci-fi viewer are dumb enough to watch anything"  Sigh.
The character of James Bond also isn't based on Pierce Brosnan or any other Bond.
His real life wife Linda Kozlowski also joins him taking the role of his girlfriend Sue Charlton.
First of all I never saw the first two Crocodile Dundee movie's personally I think its not a great movie but it is entertaining but some of the jokes ar not so funny but there are also a few good joke's but still I liked this movie paul hogan acting very well as Mick Dundee now I want to see the other 2 movie's and I heard they are better then this one if thats true then I really want to see them I give it a 7.5/10
It was also good to see Hogan in another theatre release, since he really hadn't appeared in one since he starred with Elijah Wood in 1996's Flipper.
I also like his charming, down-to-earth character.
There's also plenty of time for Mick and Mikey to explore the terrain of the big city, which is new territory for Mikey, but for Mick-- already a veteran of a trip to New York-- it becomes just one g'day after another, mate.
It's also a movie you can show to young children, which is more than you can say about 90 percent of the comedies (or movies in general) nowadays.
Fans of the movie should also view the inferior, but still funny See No Evil, Hear No Evil which sees the partnership of Wilder and Pryor re-ignited for a third time, following on from Stir Crazy and Silver Streak before that.
It's not just a crazy comedy, it's also a character drama with wonderfully surreal and authentic moments (mass-mass-mass murderer Grossberger sining 'Down in the Valley' and proving to be as timid as a kitten being one of them).
Pryor also is a very hilarious friend sort of character.
It's also a rare chance to see the uniquely talented Erland van Lidth de Jeude, a huge, 6'6" Dutch heldentenor who qualified for the Olympics in wrestling, was a teacher, an MIT graduate, and had his own computer company.
So I was nervous that Stir Crazy might also be a let down this far removed in time.
It's also fairly suspenseful and surprisingly serious at times in the last act.
Wilder's Skip Donahue has an air of Mister Rogers-styled good-natured innocence, with the same kind of odd and maybe creepy homoerotic overtones, but he'll also turn on a dime into a neurotic, screaming loon.
It also turns out to have much more weight than just a comic device: Donahue survives in prison as well as he does, and it brings about the profound changes of character--Donahue becomes much more authentic, realizes his potential, gains material for his art and even gets the girl--because of his continued misprision (in the Bloom sense) about life outside of New York City, and in the end, it enables a "return to the market", as they say in Zen Buddhism.
The fact that it's also suspenseful and has philosophical things to say about human nature is a bonus that makes this a film you shouldn't miss.
It also was interesting to see such a young looking Craig T Nelson and JoBeth Williams.
He also still loves to eat, and is capable of consuming mass quantities in one gulp!
His parents are Jean and Hugh, both loving, caring, laid back parents, but they're also misguided and absurdly tolerant of Taz's behaviour, and virtually nothing makes them angry!
On the other hand, there are also episodes in which Taz is the prey, when Bull Gator and his idiot sidekick, Axel, try to capture him for the "zoo-going children" to see, or when Francis X. Bushlad tries capture him so he can earn his manhood in his tribe!
As one would expect, there's a lot of slapstick mayhem (with Taz often the victim), but there's also some satire/parodying I wouldn't have understood as a kid, with such episodes (or segments of episodes) as "We'll Always Have Taz-Mania", "Ticket Taker Taz", and many others.
I also have more appreciation for some of the characters than I used to, including Taz's lovable family, with his over-affectionate mother and babbling, orange juice-loving father, with his catchphrase, "blah blah blah yackety shmackety," and the way they sweet-talk each other!
I also find very funny when Tom is disguised as a cowboy and walks like one, rolls up a cigarette by using Jerry, a gun to light the cigarette and then smokes it to puff out the word "Howdy".
Soon, we also get to see Tom having some conflicts with a big bull, thanks to Jerry and his sense of fun.
All in all, a very good movie, one worth seeing not only because of Denzel Washington :))), but also because of the social problems mentioned... And really, is Britain such a racist country?
Left me with a wonderful feeling at how uncomplicated my own life is and how I have managed to avoid complication by keeping things simple - also by keeping wacky people out of my life!
It also fails as any type of social critique or satire as it is decidedly unfunny and doesn't create any insight into its subject matter.
A few other peripheral choices also hover nearby.
It also avoided using simplistic general stereotypes (for example, police are portrayed both in a very positive and very negative light).
The music was also absolutely astounding!
Not only do the viewers get to see the beautiful and wonderful places that are visited, but we also get to learn about the cultures and customs of different countries.
Map skills are also an excellent thing to have on this show, as many of the teams get lost and need to stop and ask for directions.
The story also is usually confirmed on the very last minute after searching for optimal tasks and routes by the producers.
Excellent acting also by Tim Hutton as Holly's irresponsible husband and Tyne Daly as Falk's wife.
You should probably also avoid moving to San Francisco, because he's not really that unusual by SF standards.
There was interesting commentary by Jack Wrangler, who apparently also has rooms made into self-shrines but is much more the part-hetero guy his parents must surely have preferred to his burlesque 'n' porn days (even if his wife is 20 plus years older than he, himself no spring chicken, is.)
It also reminded me to be in the fully moment and that whatever I think is beautiful is beautiful.
He is also just as proudly gay in private life.
It's warming to know that some beautiful people are also genuinely nice guys.
I went for the acting in this one also.
Amanda Douge also does exceptionally well in such a complicated role as Lynn Marchmont.
Richard Hope and David Yelland are also very good.
Did I also forget to mention that this is set on an island in the middle of the Bayou in the Southern US?
Of course, in the meantime they also send psychic messages to their buddies in the lizard kingdom - snakes can always wreak some havoc as can spiders, big lizards are well equipped to knock stuff over, and those turtles are more deadly than they look!
However, like many of the animals running amok films of the 50s, 60s and 70s, it is also strangely watchable because it is so silly.
If you like this wretched 70s film, also try EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (which is actually worse than FROGS) and NIGHT OF THE LEPUS (about killer bunnies).
Sam Elliott, portraying a freelance photographer, takes pictures of animals at Ray Milland's island while also stopping to take photos of all the debris in the water.
You'll also, eventually, see this movie.
A snapping turtle killing a human also seems pretty silly to me, although I found out afterwards that snapping turtles actually ARE perfectly capable of killing someone.
Photographer Elliot, also an ecology expert, is taking snap shots of wild life, and especially pollution entering the river near a island swamp owned by millionaire curmudgeon Milland.
The thing I liked also is that he - and the movie itself - wasn't a bit preachy like other environmental sci-fi type movies.
In this film, the frogs aren't just vicious killers but also strategic army generals that mobilize a whole island's ecosystem to commit nasty murders!
The eerie score also helps as well.
The supporting cast is also on cue.
"Driving Me Crazy" can be compared to "The Gods Must Be Crazy" (which I also like) in terms of comedy.
It is a fascinating mix of the new and the old: the story is told in a somewhat offbeat way, but there are also some light moments (Mrs. Leadbetter and her dog, for instance) of a kind that had been almost completely eliminated from, say, "Five Little Pigs" or "Sad Cypress".
In other words, I'm already interested in his next AC adaptation, which according to IMDb will be "Hallowe'en Party" (also, I find it quite funny that some people complain about lack of faithfulness to the novels BUT want Hastings, Japp and Miss Lemon back in the movies, even if these characters did not appear in those novels at all!).
(***)  (Read also pajak3's excellent IMDb comment on this movie - the sentence "there is no such thing as a lighter side of crime" is particularly spot-on, especially when we're talking about murder)
You also get Lucille Ball in here, although she's just okay, nothing hilarious.
If you have sympathy for young petulant pretty girls that invent crises of their own because their life is too uneventful, then you may sympathise with young Leelee, but the fact that she decides life is worth living because her Chinese neighbour cooked her some spring rolls with chop suey and then washed and ironed her dress properly pretty much sums up the vacuous nature of this character and also of this turgid film.
Zao is also complex.
Therefore the rest of the buildings tenants also become somewhat envious of him in their own emptiness of depth-less or stale relationships as he and the new beauty grow closer.
The supporting cast also fits very well here, helping to make this a quality piece of character driven film.
At first all smouldering eyes and wry smiles she also grows over the course of the film into a sympathetic and tragic figure, allowing the audience to truly care what happens to both these characters and understand the deep core of loneliness that brings them together despite their differences.
The supporting actors also flesh out strong characters.
Both these characters also undergo changes as their jealousy of the relationship formed between Zao and Sarah (Sobieski) overcomes them.
Plus it foreshadows (spoiler) that Jeff Daniels (also blond) and she are meant for each other.
The locations are also great, I don't know where this is in NYC, but I would love to live there!
As well, a certain butcher named Leo is also captivated by Stella's modest ways and they are drawn to each other and soon fall in love.
I also enjoyed the cozy portrayal of the Manhattan (NYC) side street neighborhood life.
The acting is also mostly a tad non-descript, Gene Evans and AndrÃ© Morell are slightly uninteresting heroes and the most engaging acting comes from a bizarrely enthusiastic yet wryly frozen faced turn from Jack McGowran as a paleontologist.
Sadly It is sold in a 3 DVD Box Set called Camp Cult Classics Volume 1 Sci-Fi / Thrillers u can also get it separately.
And also has 1958 for the release year when it actually was released until 1959.
I am gonna have to update my Willis O'Brien My Space Page u guys need to check that out also made one of Stop-Motion Greats David Allen & Jim Danforth need to finish Allen's though I will before his B-Day on Oct.
Sadly, this was also the last film that highlighted his stop-motion work.
Likewise, his British counterpart, Prof. Bickford (Andre Morrell) also plays low-key.
Sun Ra was also an early proponent of electronic instruments in jazz.
A comparison could also be made to the "blaxploitation" films of the 1970s.
Woody Allen used this plot as the basis for his "Curse of the Jade Scorpion," also a very funny movie, but too long, too loose, and not as perfectly perfect as "Larceny, Inc."
Wyman was also a few years from an Oscar for Johnny Belinda and Carson did break the mold of playing lovable blowhards.
Another film made the same year (again, on the eve of Pearl Harbor) was Bogie's "All Through the Night" that also included Gleason and a young Phil Silvers.....All in the same vein!
I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's.
It's also got a young, menacing Anthony Quinn to give it some edge, and an early Jackie Gleason to steal a couple scenes.
RÃ¼diger Hoffman also can't save this.
Carpenter as always wrote a solid script, this time with help from his old film school buddy Nick Castle, who also was the original horror icon Michael Myers in John Carpenter's Halloween.
Carpenter also takes what advantages he can from his low budget and low production values -- almost everything is filmed in the dark, and a lot is filmed indoors; also, everything (props, costumes, etc.)
Not only do these moves let "Escape From New York" look as good as it possibly can, but it also fits the feel of the "gritty, dark future" that already permeates the film.
For all its dark doings, however, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is also infused with an often subtle black humor that helps keep it from devolving into the kind of lackluster action film that features stars who can't act; Russell as Plissken is also- surprise- vulnerable, and thence more real, than most action leads.
If you're a fan of futuristic action/adventure films, then you also MUST check this out.
The music is also very cool, it will stay with you a long time after you see the film.
So now he does not only have to take care of the President and try to stay alive in between all those criminals, he also has a lot of time pressure...
At a loss what to do, the authorities decide to send one man in alone, ex war hero turned criminal, Snake Plissken, not only does he have to contend with surviving the incredibly hostile prison, he also has a time bomb implanted in his body that, should he not get the president out safely within 24 hours, will explode and mean no more Snake Plissken!.
Apart from Kurt Russell, "Escape from New York" also stars icons like Lee Van Cleef ("The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"), Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Donald Pleasance ("Halloween") and Harry Dean Stanton ("Repo Man").
In 1996, Carpenter also made "Escape from L.A." and even though it's good entertainment, it can't compete with "NY".
Sequel, Escape from LA, filmed 15 years after the original also available on DVD.
This film is silly, okay, but it's also extremely funny and entertaining!
Not only is it set in Wales but it's also a film born of a passion for the art of film making rather than profit making.
It's also important to note that this is precisely the kind of radical, raw, original, thought provoking material that the American masses are restricted from viewing as they are fed the constant diet of bland, formulated, self-censored, over-glossed, garbage Hollywood usually churns out.
I also liked how they did the brunette/blond jokes, I thought that was actually kind of clever.
The film also boasts a crazily eclectic soundtrack - I defy any fellow Welshie to now set foot on the Kingsway without Downtown resounding in their head!
It also, however, captures some of the more beautiful aspects of the city, namely its heart (although the Lewis family are dysfunctional, they have a very warm family dynamic), and also the beautiful scenery in the area (visible in the panoramic shots of the city), and I think that any Welshman couldn't watch the funeral scene at the end as the choir sings "Myfanwy" without wiping away a tear.
John Noakes and the scene with the Ice Cream van is most amusing and again if you are English the scene in bath where the twins are quizzing each other about football is also exceptional.WATCH WATCH AND WATCH AGAIN.
Not only is it well written, it's also beautifully filmed, and makes great use of the camera.
The music is also something to listen out for, as it stands out as a good piece of work on it's own.
The cast is also extremely good.
The always reliable Martin Landau has a ball as Denton's worst tormentor and Doug McClure also surfaces in a small but key role as a young gunman.
The delivery of gags in this is also faster than for a typical Hollywood style movie.
(She was btw also great in the movie 'Let's get Lost')  All in All : Good Entertainment!
I must say that it's the best danish picture I've ever seen, even if Festen also was a very good and interesting film.
Hans-Werner Olm as the queens dark helper qualifies himself for better rolls (also non-comedic) and the absurdest of German comedians, Helge Schneider, who mixes absurd monologues with a great talent for Jazz in his shows, has a funny moment as Gandalf-Lookalike ÂThe Wise/White Helge'.
The fight between Happy and Bob Barker (of "The Price is Right") was hysterical ("The price is wrong, b**ch") and Kevin Nealon was funny as that weird golfer ("Send the ball home, Happy")   There is also one really funny scene which is only on some TV versions.
He also takes on board the beautiful Virginia Venit the tournament's PR, who helps Happy control his almost psychotic temper and focus more on his game.
It is also my favorite Adam Sandler movie.
Omg that part was just so funny and also when Shooter brags it's funny.
I also love Happy's dreams and Chubs was great to with no hand.
A great film with a fairly simple plot that is great to watch if you are trying to learn German but also great for anyone who really loves foreign films.
It is also just all-around solid comedic entertainment and a crash-course in golf.
My wife's boss also saw the movie in her home at the same time, and it seems that all of us were just too tired or lazy to get up and change the channel (this was before the days of wireless remotes for cable).
Lisa Eichorn was also excellent in this, and it never plays on TV or cable anymore, so let's hope that it will turn up as a budget DVD at some point.
Saif Ali Khan's Anil Manchandani tale was also very good and very well acted.
also, the direction is slick and technically brilliant,although the screenplay needed some corrections.
There is a book called the Indigo Children by Lee Caroll & Jan Tober,which also should help indigo children and their parents.
There are also other books out there on Indigo and Crystal Children.
I have seen the movie and read reviews that were posted about the movie Indigo.I never even heard about the movie until a week or so before the showing.I personally know one of these children,most of the time he is just a normal little boy like any other child,he doesn't do a lot of the things that Gracie does,but I believe that her character was just a mix of their gifts to show what they can do.The main point of the movie that I feel is the most important is that they are here to bring out the truth,they can see behind what adults and others tell them.You will not pull the wool over their eyes,they CAN see right through you and read what is in your heart,your pain from the past wrongs in your life.And also the good things about you.They can and will heal the planet.The other thing I feel about them is that through the real truth, they will bring peace wherever they go.They came here with their switches turned on,in the past people have had to go through a life changing experience to be enlightened.Near death experience comes to mind.I pray that I meet more Indigo's,If you meet one you will never forget it,he sometimes looks at you suddenly from a break at playing and tells you something about what has been troubling you for some time,then he has that all knowing smile and off they go playing again.
It has all the qualities of a new cult classic, as I said, it's raw and brutal but one thing it also has in abundance is charisma.
But John also has vulnerability, loads of it.
I also had a few moments where I felt the budget and that had to do with a couple of odd cuts and crude camera work.
the 6th Chakra...also known as the Indigo aura?
I had never been to a Unity church, so this was also a new experience for me.
It also didn't help that it wasn't presented in the correct aspect ratio, so everybody was 'long' throughout the film (this was the Church's fault, not the film's, but it was still irritating).
I am also curious as to how this phenomenon of "indigo children" can be so widespread but have escaped the attention of the mainstream media and psychological journals.
Directed by Christian Viel (Evil Breed) and starring John Fallon (who also wrote it) Deaden is pretty straightforward.
I am a father of 6 children who also abandoned my older children due to obsessive work and alcohol addiction before I eventually 'woke up'.
Not only for the light hearted plot but also for the music.
So much history involving both celebrities of a bygone Hollywood era, but also political significance since it was in the Ballroom kitchen that Robert Kennedy was assassinated.
I think the same scene placed at the beginning of each synopsis that shows some older men playing dominoes in Don Ru's cantina is symbolic because it is representative of an ordinary day and also shows how people in the community gather together and share stories and get to know one another.
I feel that it represents the culture in Mexico and emphasizes how everyone looks out for one another, like how Ubaldo looks out for Eusebia's sadness and how Dona Cata looks out for Susanita's feelings, and also how Abel looks out for Chava's well being.
There are also some street scenes where it seems everyone knows one another.
The acting also is superb.
A few middle age men are playing dominos and jokingly playfully yet also talking about their lives.
The movie also subtly introduces other characters during this first chapter.
Not only does this movie shows how difficult life is in modern Mexico, but also how people respond to their own dilemmas in their lives.
This movie is an impressive and exciting story about the people,their feelings,love,desperation,anger and hope.Although the scenario is a little bit melodramatic , the film is a must indeed.It is quite different from the blockbusters with happy ends because it is real and outstanding.Several lives and fates are mixed in it.Every character has his own unique personality.They all have to take decisions for their lives and have to fight for happiness.The actors are very nice.The stunning Hayek makes a good performance .Gomes Krus is also convincing as a man who becomes gay after 30 years marriage.The supporting roles are also well-played.Don't think that this is some kind of soap opera- it is something deeper...
On the one hand he's someone the chicks dig (though I can't really see the 'it' thing that everyone talks about), and though he may know it, he also seems to realize the truest injustice in life: that we live in a world where we are alone and nothing matters and few others see that.
He also may not have.
Best of all, there is also a time when sex is communion with another.
It's also being attentive to the dear persons around us, in our lives, and give a little - don't wait.
She's also in director John Crowley's "Intermission" (2003, script by Mark O'Rowe) - taken on, among the stellar cast, the rather offbeat yet still demure role of Sally (the script itself is plucky and unyielding alright - then again, it's probably quite 'normal' in the setting described) - another amusingly enjoyable film from Ireland if you're so gamed.
For in addition to death and illness, "Wilbur" also deals with the less tragic topics of adultery and unrequited love.
Like the best Scottish comedies, this film provides us with a slice-of-life tale filled with ordinary, likable people who may have their weaknesses and eccentricities but who also strike chords of familiarity deep within the viewer.
There are beautiful performances by Jamie Sives as Wilbur; Adrian Rawlins as his brother, Harbour; Shirley Henderson as Harbour's's wife, Alice (who is also in love with Wilbur); Lisa McKinlay as Mary, Alice's young daughter, and an assortment of other fine actors and actresses who populate the scene.
Wilbur is a celebration of life, but is also a show of respect for those who don't wanna live anymore.
It is well filmed, also.
Shirley Henderson is wonderful, as usual, but there are also strong performances from Jamie Sives and Adrian Rawlins.
The setting also made it very enjoyable (the bookshop), possibly because one of my favourite characters (the kipling fanatic) only appeared in this location.
And we also learn that grand Kentucky bourbon is available to Glaswegians.
Now as fun as this film is, and it's a blast, it is also very difficult to watch at times.
So we've got action, violence and lots of ass kicking, but Deaden also has some heart.
Originally there were no inter-titles; narration was performed by an on-stage lecturer who also provided sound effects including gunfire and hoofbeats.
Not only was 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' one of the first bushranger pictures, but it was also the world's first feature film.
It is also probable that, at least in some scenes, the role of Kate Kelly is being played by a man in drag.
It's also part of the London Australian Film Festival, likewise at the Barbican ... so, I actually ended up attending two film festivals simultaneously!
Actually, I've also seen (in Australia) another reel of this film: not a projection of the movie's image onto a screen, but rather I've seen (and touched) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself, now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration.
The final shoot-out scene is also well filmed - with Ned Kelly moving, and shooting, toward the camera, as troopers flee to the sides.
All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts!
He's funny in this brief scene, but it is also sad to watch.
I also believe the same film together.
Fallon's co-stars also step up to the plate and manage to hit (mostly) home runs.
OK so I think its good fun,  On the TECH level  I dug the look in some areas more then others such as some ext stuff looked Well videoish (Being that it was shot on video) while the some of the INT especially when Rane fights one of the main bad dudes (who was giving a blowie to other dude) hand to hand had a cool gritty look, Girlie Club also...I wish the latter look was kept throughout more, that's just my personal taste..There's a lot of gun action going on in this flick!
Story  Simple and to the point it was just good ol Revenge..Nice gratuitous violence =) Aborted babies always a good for a cheer in my book(You'll have to see the flick to understand how messed up it is)!..I liked also the constant hits of coke etc prob most coke hits since Scarface lol..  Acting  John Fallon who played Rane was solid the rest of the cast ranged from decent to passable(I felt weakest acting wise was female cop)..I Rane's coked up buddy he was cool and I liked the two Fhorensic Cops cracking the jokes.
But I think it can also be argued that single men are in danger too.
LOL He is married to Lisa Rinna, who plays his wife in the movie, and it was also their idea to present this film to other couples to enlighten them on the subject.
The answer, of course, is that her husband Harry Hamlin acts as the male lead plus also produced the movie.
Despite some good ideas the script (by James B. Harris) lacks any real cohesion and is for the most part rather contrived, worse than that the dialogue is also pretty flat and uninteresting, with the characters all painted as rather one dimensional.
As for the direction, also by James B. Harris, it's workmanlike but hardly inspiring, the nature of the story requiring a certain edge and grit to the direction that Harris just doesn't manage to deliver.
Not only is he stressed with his crumbling marriage, but is also ham strung by his boss at the police precinct who is a born-again Christian and won't allow Woods the kind of resources he demands in order to trace the serial murderer before he strikes again.
Hopkins is arrogant & difficult not only to work with but also to live with.
But he is also scared & concerned about her future and hopes that she will learn right from wrong and not fall into the shadows of crime & sleaze that he witnesses every day where he works.
But for all his morality & self-rightousness, he is also a cheat, a womaniser & just as sleazy as some of the scum that walk the streets that he so detests.
Charles Durning, Lesley Ann Warren and Raymond J. Barry also conspire to throw away their collective acting prowess along with Woods.
You'll see a very inventive way to film a guy sniffing cocaine (there's also a VERY funny recurring way that pays tribute to "Scarface") and you'll also see that every killing of this movie is different from each other and most of the them are committed with very unusual weapons (the movie features a new way to play pool that Ruggero Deodato will enjoy a lot).
Because, of course, "Deaden" is a serious movie but also a non stop fast paced action picture (filmmakers and editors, take notice of the rhythm) that pays tribute to the 80's and 70's action films; you'll appreciate references to "Dirty Harry", "Death Wish", Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, "Rocky" and all Sly Stallone's films and "Requiem for a dream" (don't be surprised by that, "Deaden" tells a story).
It also has sexy Randi Brooks and Charles Durning for support.
Lesley Ann Warren also does a fine job as a chainsmoking Lesbian poet.
(He's also very funny)  Cop is too flawed to be great - its plot mechanics are too predictable; James Ellroy, having started with the daring proposition that Woods might be mad, and his investigations just an extension of this, is too afraid of loose ends to be truly scary (serial killer plots, ostensibly about the blackest modern evil, are paradoxically reassuring - they suggest pattern and order, and an identifiable problem, which once rooted will result in restoration); the visual style could be out of any dour 70s cop show (except for some gorgeous Kubrickian tracking shots); the music is hellish 80s synth orchestration; the climactic showdown is implausible and silly, although the film boasts one of the best endings in cinema.
Harris, producer of The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Lolita etc., has learned much from Kubrick in this unforgivingly formal, analytic approach (see also Melville).
James Woods also co-produced with director James B. Harris, long time buddy of Stanley Kubrick and producer of THE KILLING (1957), PATHS OF GLORY 1958) and LOLITA (1962), who also wrote the script for this hard-edged cop thriller.
Also in the cast is Charles Haid, late of Hill Street Blues who also is part of the mystery.
I would also recommend The Hard Way with Michael J Fox.
That's also one of James Wood's best performances.
Charles Durning is also very good, as is Lesley Ann Warren, though I just wanted to slap her character a couple of times for being so stupid and whiny.
But I enjoy the simplicity of the stock market, the characters are also simple but you don't care too much about that, because you're inside a story thats goes around different dramatics situations to finalize with a happy ending.
It also is one of the better early depictions of the handicapped as having so much more to offer society and themselves.
I also noticed the back of the envelope calculations Atwill makes when pitching his stock market club for beggars only involved impossible amounts: millions in months.
A lot of ticker tape shenanigans go on in the second half of the film, all of which are so exaggerated, I ended up thinking public anxiety about the market was also being channeled here quite volubly, along with fear of the disabled and wretched poor.
Why people vote so low ?,i cant see what i wrong on this movie ,i saw worse...,and you have to think also in the back of your head it is a TV movie so that means less money to make that film..,i think they forgot that ,so the film is about a virus that comes free on a plane cash and than you see the results if such thing can happen...,very realistic if you think of the real life now Anthrax ....and that kind of stuff...so...i think people rate it too low they underestimated the script,the crew also was good a few good actors and actresses.
It was perhaps the lowest budget film screened at the festival but many attendees said they thought it had better entertainment value than many of the blockbuster movies which were also featured.
I also found the Foley annoying, because it was noticeable.
I noticed a few people liked Warner's performance also.
They also spoke fluent French instead of Wolof, unlike the older people in the community.
It also seems that Absa saw a lot of faults in the white males in the film, but in the end everyone was able to get along together.
The youth also are very interested in music but not of there culture, but rather music from the United States and Europe.
Lighting changes several times during some scenes, and costume can also be seen changing in a few cases.
But the film is also about coming of age as the world of tradition gives way grudgingly to the world of the modern.
"Twist Ã  Popenguine" offers an amusing view of cultural conflict and generational conflict, but also the gradual and sad loss of a heritage.
They also get into trouble with the adults in the town usually resulting from one of their projects not going as planned.
Absa also shows the influence of the French colonialism with the school teacher Mr. Benoit who is sent from France to teach the children of Popenguine French language and literature.
I think how it's filmed in black and white is also very fitting and sets the mood.
So the girl and a guy go there and move through the old abandoned house unfolding the "shocking" history of her father who was also a painter.
I was also thrown off a bit, until I realized that this wasn't from the European world of film that I'm used to (France, Spain, Germany, Italy).
The acting is brilliant also; with the monstrous Blanche Baker heading up a cast of youngsters.
Throughout this movie my thoughts kept going to the book "A Child Called It"--also true.
This movie strikes as another in a long line of torture-porn movies made solely for twisted individuals who enjoy watching a very attractive and intelligent teenage girl gradually beaten down and controlled with increasingly sickening and frightening abuse during which she is raped by young teenage boys who are watched by their mother who also seems to gain sexual pleasure from spanking the much younger sister.
Ruth is abusive and out of her mind and so are her accomplices who happen to also be her own children and some neighborhood kids.
Similarly, Ruth's dispensing of beer to underage kids might also be written off as relatively harmless, but again it serves to signal the potential for something else.
The pacing is also remarkable- by the time Meg has been imprisoned in the basement and 'the game' has begun, we have become unwilling but necessary witnesses of a despicable crime, uncertain as to the precise point at which the line was irrevocably crossed.
Black-hole dark and beyond harrowing, it's nonetheless a carefully crafted work and also extraordinarily sensitive.
The real girl, for example, also had to consume human waste, which is not shown here.
The suffering he feels vicariously, we also feel vicariously.
This is also the reason why I wouldn't recommend watching it to most people...
The messages of the irony of American Freedom of Speech is also a focus of the movie (if you could claim it to have focus).
A hilarious musical besting Trey's earliest forray into film "Alferd Packer, The Musical" (also in this DB, though that one not R rated) This is NOT..I repeat NOT a movie for the kids.
I was definitely excited to also see what they would do without needing to be censored for TV.
It is also one of the funniest animated films ever made.
The film is also a musical and benefits from the catchy tunes of Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman.
Soon, a lot of kids in the country see it and also start swearing.
the animation is also the same which must be great news for the studio because by doing that the movie was made very cheaply.
The best thing about this movie and also the TV show is of course Cartman.
The rest of South Park kids see it also, and by the next school day, the parents find out and totally hate the movie.
There is also a plot with Kenny going to hell, and finding Saddam Hussein and Satan in love.
It also has racism, sexism, and offends every group out there from the Gays to the MPAA to the parents.
I found it only mildly offensive personally, but then I also love the movie "Pink Flamingos."
Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life.
And it also shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem just like a bunch of comedy writers and composers, but that they could be truly freedom fighters by show-casing this film.
Beneath the scatological humor, the cartoon violence, the scathing portrayals of Wynona Ryder et al, and the backdrop of adult xenophobia, sexual repression and political opportunism, is a sensibility that exalts childhood as an island of honesty and idealism, if also of id-like impulse and frequent selfishness.
In this they share space on the shelf of great satires with "Candide," "Gulliver's Travels," "Tom Sawyer" and especially "Huckleberry Finn"--classics that, like BL&U, also exposed the hypocrisies of the adult world "through the eyes of a child."
It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue ( many of those films get an AA rating ) but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.
The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.
There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.
They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.
This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions.
Gwyneth Paltrow is also good as Mills' wife.
Because of all the rubble and junk-piles turned into crazed surrealist imagery, It's also been compared to "The Cremaster Cycle".
It could have been written better and the ending also should have been different.
The Fatal Glass of Beer turns not only the Hollywood film but also American drama inside-out.
He also plays the dulcimer with his mits on, narrates the tale of the salvation army girl who high-kicked his son in the forehead, "A trick she'd learned before she had been saved," has a crying fit with a mouth full of crackers.
Astro Boy discovers new companions, orphaned humans, but he also realizes now that he is a robot.
He also might run into his dad again.
An A-list voice cast also helped, with actors such as Nathan Lane, Eugene Levy, Bill Nighy, Samuel L. Jackson, Charlize Theron and Kristen Bell all chipping in.
They also liked it.
I am also sad cuz I want Imagi to do well, I like their company mission statement.
There are also plenty of emotional elements to touch people's hearts.
"Se7en" also works because of its two main actors.
Apart from its images of horrifying murders, "Se7en" also impresses by its general cinematography.
It's also a movie having a pessimist vision of the world, where nobody is good, nobody is fine and everybody is bad.
This pessimism is also present in "Fight Club", which is better than "Se7en", but not by far.
"Se7en" is also remarkable for its accurate description of the police world, more specifically the homicidal section.
It's also a redemption for David Fincher who was only known at the time for the disappointing "Alien Â³".
Set in the future, a scientist(voiced by Nicolas Cage) is drowning in sadness, cause he lost his son(voiced by Freddie Highmore) in a laboratory accident, almost a year later he builds a robotic replica of his son(also Freddie Highmore).
He also gets the name Astro.
I also did not mind that some of the side kicks may have had some resemblance to characters from other movies.
There are also many funny moments, although not enough time was given to laugh at them.
It's all rather confusing and irregular in it's general presentation, but it's also one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time.
On the other hand, they also add a "feel good" and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place.
It's also a longer film and could have been more effective with some of the same plot and editing license employed in the Travis film.
It happens what has to happen: "A Square" concludes that when there is a dimension beyond his there must also be a dimension beyond the 3rd one.
My kids loved this film also.
warning:if you choose to watch this movie,know that you will enter on a dark and twisted journey.David Fincher directs this film,which concerns a serial killer who executes people,using the seven deadly sins as justification.though there are some horrific and graphic images here,there real genius of this movie is it's implied horror.this movie will leave you with an impact long after the end credits have rolled.David Fincher directs this intense psychological suspense thriller.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives on the trail of the killer.Freeman plays veteran Detective Lt. William Somerset,on the verge of retirement,after this case.Pitt plays rookie detective Detective David Mills.Kevin Spacey also stars in a powerful performance that is mesmerizing.this is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen so far.if you are not affected by this movie,i'd be surprised.for me,Se7en is easily a 10/10
I've also named her "Pea Brain".
are essentially coming from the European Community (Poland) but also non members states from eastern Europe (Ukraine) and some countries going through a crisis like Iran and Iraq.
When things go pear-shaped, she is the vulnerable female, but also the protective mother, as determined as any tigress.
She starts her own and also starts to exploit people like she's been exploited.
The central character (Angie) played by Kierston Wareing is a self employed recruitment agent an ambitious and vibrant women who wont take no for an answer, she has a certain cheek and charm that is compelling and shows us some level of kindness, but also has a darker side which she has no problems in showing to people.
I can't say enough good things about it, I hope that many people see this film so they can also appreciate it.
This might be partly due to the involvement of Ken Loach himself but also because it is a rather poignant essay of the one crucial aspect of globalisation Â the richer countries exploiting the availability of the cheap labour available from the poorer countries.
i am also an ardent tchaikovskyite.
This one is not perfect also !
The music to the film is a hodgepodge of Tchaikovsky music including the symphonies and ballets but the score to this film uses variations and Tchaikovsky-like melodies composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, a noted Russian film composer who also made music for American movies, such as Fall of the Roman Empire in 1964.
Tiomkin's work with Tchaikovsky's music is respectful and also highly creative at the same time.
It was funny, insightful, versatile, with tons of parodies, but unfortunately also one of those short lived shows in the 90s.
There were also other funny segments like Lord Bravery, Fatman and Boy Blubber, The Huntsman, etc., It was basically one of those shows where story didn't really matter and it was just there to make you laugh.
Freakazoid was also chalk-full of random catch phrases.
Freakazoid also pokes fun at the other superheroes; thus he is the antithesis of the traditional superhero- if you have watched the show you can tell that he sure doesn't act like one.
The narrator also punctuates the proceedings by not only dropping in many appropriate sound effects, but also by bringing to life a chef to manage the wife's dinner arrangements.
This is not only one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the worst movies of any kind that I've ever seen (and I've seen some pretty bad films).
Jekyll's Rating : It was a true pleasure to be able to watch this film and also meet the guys in charge of it.
I also liked the knife scene where she's looking at her camera that she set up in her bedroom to see a startling image.
And I can also state quite confidently that the scariest movies were made in the between the 60's and 80's (Exorcist, Amityville Horror, Rosemary''s Baby, Carrie, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw, Evil Dead.... just to name a few), and the crap that came out after that was mostly crap (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Candy Man, The Others, and your average slasher thrill-kill flicks...).
not only am i disappointed with the film, in fact I'm disgusted that any video store would even stock this film and be willing to rent it out to innocent film lovers, all stores that choose to rent this film out should have this film in a large case with a 20ft warning sign that says " Please understand that by watching this film you are not only wasting your hard earned money but even worse you are putting yourself through what will be years of torture and torment at the realisation that at the end of this film you would have lost about 2 hours of your life that you will never get back, please approach film with great caution, also we don't do refunds.p.s.
Unfortunately, there are also some stupid plot elements that should have been removed or tweaked.
I also love the brother, sister relationship, and when she finally meets her love.
He also agrees to help out a guy who works the lunch counter and this provides a few laughs.
This is meant to be funny also but quickly grows old.
Kudos also to David Fincher's stylish direction Â this may be Fincher's best film to date.
Even though I found this distressing, I had to give Billy West credit for accuracy ... since several genuine Chaplin shorts from this period also include Jewish stereotypes.
i love this film so much it has a great story line and the actors are amazing.it helped that the film had Zack Efron in because he is a talented actor who recently the lead in high school musical i gave this film 10/10 because it was amazing and i dint want 2 blink because i did not want 2 miss a second of it i also thought that the film was heart warming and it made me see a whole new side of Zack's acting skills i no that i cant wait to see him in his new film hairspray because if it is as good as this it will be at the top of the charts the only downside to this film is that Crystal Hunt who plays Jill Overton got 2 kiss Zack i was so Jealous if only i lived in America i would of auditioned for that part but i live in england for now

I also enjoyed Houston Jones character and his relationship with Zac's character, "Patrick".
From an equestrian's point of view, this movie was also terrible.
The filming is good also with night on night shots that depict a true night life in New York.
I really looked forward to more from this director also writer of the movie.
Willie is a man who is always feeling discriminated against, he also the peasant one of gang.
However, these nocturnal wanderers also have to deal with some of the more sublime facets of race relation as Nestor Serrano as Fernando, aka Vinnie, a Puerto Rican gigolo tries to convince everyone, including himself, he's Italian, or Doug E. Doug as Willie blames every one of his problems on the fact he is black and moreover accuses other black people he meets of "selling out" or "ignoring {their} African roots" while he has never participated in one rally or learned a single fact about African Nationalism.
The film also features one of the earliest hints at the talents of comic/playwright John Leguziamo as sweet, introspective supermarket stock boy Johnny, a subdued, endearing performance by a man who's now known for extravagance.
While this wonderful film rarely lets up on the laugh, it's also intelligent and inspiring, while at times heartbreaking.
This is not just a comedy (although it is extremely funny), it is also a very intelligent and thought provoking film and it is clear that Vasquez would have had a bright future.
Doug E Doug also does a great job in this movie.
Arch Johnson is also dead-on.
It was also neat seeing them "in person" because they portrayed a different image than I sensed from the books.
Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing.
He's also quite pro-Linux, the emblem of the "Open Source" movement whose adherents regard its underlying virtues with a devotion normally reserved by the religious for the icons of their faiths.
Much credit to the filmmaker for not only explaining the seminal value of open source - the commitment to free interchange of ideas with minimal incorporation of legal protection for intellectual property - but for also succinctly allowing contrasting values and competing personalities screen time.
Charles Winninger is hilarious as the boozing doctor.Walter Connolly is brilliant playing the editor named Oliver Stone.Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin starred the remake of the movie in 1954.The title that time was Living It Up and it was also awfully funny.70 years hasn't done any harm to this movie.It's more like a fine wine and gets better with age.Not that I'm an expert of wines.
Fredric March is great as the reporter and Carole Lombard is also good as the woman who is faking her illness.
after watching this movie,one thing really struck me:how talented Carole Lombard was as an actress.she has a real gift for comedy,of which there is a fair amount in this film.i found i very funny,but beyond that,i just thought it was well written,and even more relevant today than back then.it basically skewers every imaginable target,including the price of fame,and paints pretty much everybody as phonies,when you you get right down to it.even your average every day person is painted with that brush.but this is also a romance and drama,and it also works on those levels.Fredric March is the male lead,and he does pretty well in the role.the supporting players are also good,but,like i said,it is Carole Lombard who steals the show.i had a great time watching this film,and highly recommend it.my vote for Nothing Sacred:8.5/10
The details of the film are also of the neatest sort.
The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).
Fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film.
He also brings in a chef in a puff of smoke, to come to the housewife's rescue.
The first time you get a good look at Lombard, she has shaving cream on her face from kissing a man who is shaving - also not the normal star-moment you might expect.
This Canadian produced film also known as The Parasite Murders & They Came from Within, both Orgy of the Blood Parasites which would have been a fantastic name for a film & The Parasite Complex were apparently working titles, was written & directed by David Cronenberg.
I must also give Cronenberg credit for giving credibility & substance to a somewhat silly premise as he directs with deadly seriousness.
I also remembered the whole exclusive accommodation block concept (just looks really 70's now!)
It is also better and much richer in its story and horror metaphor though the characterizations are slightly more shallow than in "Dawn of the Dead."
It is fairly nasty in a visceral sort of way but it's also derivative, (it's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in all but name), and appallingly acted, (look out, in particular, for the elderly European couple with the walking frame), so that any serious point it may be making is lost.
It could be seen as an AIDS metaphor and it's full of Cronenberg's usual queasy motifs but it's also pretty terrible.
He also works a lot of warmth and wit into the movie.
You could also put this in the Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Living Dead mold, a group that never stops, you either become one or die.
Then, there is also a heaping helping of bare breasts.
This movie, like much of Cronenberg's work, is designed to make you think, but it also to reaches into the basest emotions you have.
Their disgustingly looking little parasites are not only anything but healthy, they also turn people into braindead and murderous sex maniacs...
At any rate, the parasites are moving from person to person & also can survive outside of the body, but are always looking for new bodies to host them, so they aren't outside for long.
The leashed girls crawling around on all fours also probably would not be done now.
It is a gripping and terrifying film, but not for everyone - at least one person walked out during the screening I attended in 1979 - and also manages to make a serious comment about the nature of human sexuality.
See, it seems some mad scientist was using the inhabitants of this virtual Eden to test out some replacement for organ transplants: a parasite that is also "a stimulant and an aphrodisiac".
The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.
The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple.
But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene.
Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you.
but above all, cronenberg delights in sinking us into the flesh, so the film can also be seen as fable of a world gone mad with life and freedom, which many would not consider so horrific.
I also need to point out that the great and long running character actor John Hoyt has a large and very important role as an undercover T-man.
The film also features tragic sex bomb Barbara Payton in her first major role and she also scores as a somewhat naive, yet ruthless, partner to Bridges.
It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.
The soundtrack from Scorpions Ralph Rieckermann (how they got him to perform an entire soundtrack for them is beyond me, he must also be a b-movie horror-fan!)
Oh, I also hope to see more of this production team and also the stars of this movie, they really gave it their best.
What I also liked was the way this movie used special ambient lighting techniques that made the gore all the better to watch!
The 'special effects' are also lousy; the zombie makeup is extremely amateurish and the gore content is fairly low.
The performances were realistic and I also like the fact that the characters were not casted by stereotype( gay people are feminine ( boys) or masculine ( girls).
As I heard, whatÂ´s the theme of "Common Ground", I thought first about other attempts like "In & Out", "Jeffrey" (also with Steven Weber) or "The Birdcage".
Many aspects are also named twice, especially in the first two episodes.
JTT can not only act in comedies, he can also do more dramatic parts.
See also: Out of the Past: The Struggle for Gay and Lesbian Rights in America
The second segment is also strong but not as well developed.
Sadly, it is also unrealistic to think that even in 2000, a small town of 24,000 would be so welcome to a gay wedding that the town council would approve it being held at the community center in front of a war memorial which is the centerpiece of the town square.
I also really enjoy the stereo soundtrack.
He also learn that the suspect he is tracking lived the same life as he did, but took to a life of crime.
The changes in post war Japan also play a major role in this film.
He is also required to understand the society he is trying to penetrate.
Stray Dog, on the other hand, takes place in post-War Japan and travels its mean streets convincingly, though, truth be told, it also features Toshiro Mifune (thankfully in one of his better and less histrionic performances).
Murakami's distress over his gun being used in crimes also seems a little heavy-handed.
The film, "De jurk" (the dress) also starts out like a comedy, but the longer you watch, the less you feel the need to laugh.
The rain also signifies sadness and brings a dramatic effect to Sato being shot.
The story is rich and juicy, full of the dramatic potential which can jump a stylistic gear into melodrama with very little effort, but also weighted with a powerful message about personal moral responsibility.
Mifune's detective character and his opposite number, Ko Kimura's criminal are not just typical examples of Japan's aprÃ¨s guerre generation, they are also symbolic of the conflicting feelings prevalent in the defeated Japanese nation.
While I agree they are perhaps a little over done, they are not only Kurosawa's opportunity to show off a number of visual styles, but also all the sights and sounds of the city, in an almost neo-realist style.
He also begins making frequent use of horizontal wipes, matching the direction of the wipe with the direction of movement on screen.
It's also a solid film noir which, although often very dark and negative, in balance bucks the trend by being overall uplifting and leaving you with a satisfied feeling Â although some might say that excludes it from being counted as a film noir at all.
He is also clearly experimenting with different techniques, he hasn't quite found his own unique film language.
I was also impressed by the frantic chase sequences at both the beginning and end of the film, which, aside from being exceptionally thrilling, were genuinely harrowing.
Before it is over, the gun will be used to kill a woman and Shimura will also be shot.
I remember Ali and his sister Zahra, in permanent anxiety about the tennis shoes worn they share.And behold, with its immense sensitivity to the common people and humanistic lyricism that flowed constantly, also the master Akira Kurosawa was busy making a film where, for a rookie detective, your weapon becomes endowment constant goal, when it was stolen on a bus.
Not only does he have to restore his honour (ironically symbolised by the lost gun which he tries to retrieve), but also redeem himself by bringing the killer to justice.
But as his detective collaborator on the case remarks (played by the great Takashi Shimura, who also starred in Seven Samurai) he faced the same bad situation and made something good out of it.
There's also a silent 10 minute montage of location footage shot in rundown neighborhoods as Sato searches the black market for his gun, which serves as a poignant snapshot of Japanese history.
There are also interesting parallels drawn between the detective and the criminal.
Then a woman who buys it becomes ill, and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing (apparently she barfed on it) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter, who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train, a bus driver, and then gives up the dress to send to Africa, but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up, trims it a bit, and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker, who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away, etc.
This is a dark comedy, and at times it also offers up some social commentary on the homeless and on foreigners.
There's a certain sense of time and structure that sets apart Stray Dog from the numerous 'film-noirs' of American cinema of the period- while it contains the kind of determined edge and wit of those films, it also relies on portraying the people in this world as honestly as possible, however downtrodden things are (like Kurosawa's later film High & Low, location adds to the mood greatly).
I was also intrigued by how almost every scene bears, already, the stamp of Kurosawa's unique vision as a director.
Music, also is great.
Kurosawa touched upon international influences to an unprecedented degree in Japanese film (the internationalist impulses of Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi or Mikio Naruse are just as deep and varied, but far more discreetly deployed), Kurosawa also skillfully highlights Japanese specifics (the rookie cop expecting to be fired, even accepting the possibility in an apologetic fashion, only to be assured that he will not be fired - this would not occur in a similar American setting), while always linking the same details to universals: honor, nobility, responsibility.
He explores in depth the social and economic conditions in postwar Japan which led many young people--particularly returning veterans--to take to crime, and also the particular circumstances which motivate the acts of Yusa (Isao Kimura), the criminal.
Script is based on actual event in San Jose, CA, in 1933, while vivid depiction of college boys from local parochial college leading the charge is also based on fact.
Also since that time I have seen other movies that Victor Von Wright, has played in and they also were very good.
And yet, he was also a likely a man with his share of flaws, and a good chunk of the film is about the relationship between him and Honey, his girlfriend-turned-wife.
And also, going back to Fosse, the style is another big factor.
Every step of the way, it seems, Fosse is keeping up with Hoffman's vitality in this character of Bruce, and while the film provides some laughs, it also works as a serious treatise on what it means to try and have free speech in this country.
It's strongest as it merges with a full-on character study, as Hoffman and the supporting players (the actress playing Honey Bruce is also very good) put on a certain image of a time and place.
Clive Owen also gets a chance to use his acting skills, certainly more than in the previous BMWfilms.com series.
Now I am brought to this film, done by Alejandro Gonzalez Inaritu, famous for his breakthrough film "Amores Perros" which I also had the pleasure of viewing.
But that's not all: the acting is also awful.
I also couldn't help but enjoy the shout-out to blaxploitation in the character of Tony, who kicked ass and took names.
Being the exploity goodness it is, there's also broads.
There are several stand out moments in the movie - especially topless German soldier girls firing at our bastards with machine guns - and the ending is also quite well executed.
Of course "Bastards" was also part and well, I will be trying to see all of those films now not before but after Tarantino's "Basterds" and yes, I'm still a newcomer in regards of war pictures and yes if not for QT I probably would have never seen this film, hell anyways it would have never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray (the 3-disc edition contains a really great conversation with QT and Castellari).
He steals not only pretty much the film but also pretty much anything!
It's fun sometimes and that type of fun is also in "Basterds"; here we have first a German soldier with the bastards and he at one point will give Tony and the Italian dude a surprise, that is not quite as dangerous as in "Basterds" but really funny: Tony thinks this German only speaks German so he insults and stuff, you know (in "Basterds" the Jew Hunter, Christoph Waltz's character at one point surprises everybody with his really good Italian!
The prolific Italian helmer Enzo G. Castellari of "Any Gun Can Play" and "Payment in Blood" not only made terrific Spaghetti westerns, but he also made one of the best European B-movie World War II thrillers.
The black-and-white cinematography is terrific, and Fosse really lays on the editing razzle-dazzle, also making good usage of Miles Davis' "It Never Entered My Mind".
The cast also includes Peter Hooten as Tony, who's kind of a jerk, Michael Pergolani as Nick (his long hair is certainly anachronistic), Jackie Basehart as Berle, Michel Constantin as Veronique, gorgeous Debra Berger as Nicole, Raimund Harmstorf as Adolf Sachs (the German prisoner who for a brief time is part of the group), and the always delightful Ian Bannen as Col. Buckner.
" Em F*ck you F*ck s*it Balls"  So if you watch this prepare to laugh   The film's action scenes are also very creative, with over the top action and a body count that i lost track of.
It is also edited a bit funnily.
It also has a few twists to the plot and a few memorable scenes and lines, you seriously need to watch this if you're any kind of a movie buff.
This is Z-Grade/exploitation heaven, with specialist director Castellari shamelessly borrowing elements from the greatest war movies ever made (the motorcycle stunt near the end seem to come straight out of "The Great Escape") but also adding a lot of his very own and creative ideas and humorist elements.
The Inglorious Bastards also features some really nice miniature work.
There's barely a line wasted in this flick, barely a scene that doesn't actually try and provide its actors like Svenson and Williamson Â also other very good players like Peter Hooten and Jackie Basehart and Ian Bannen as the tricky Colonel Buckner Â some good meaty dialog to chew on when they're not blowing stuff up to bits (written, and I was even more surprised by this than you, by five writers).
But it's also a lot of fun to watch it, and it even goes beyond being a guilty pleasure into being just plain awesome.
A lot of great puzzles also, so you have to use your brain very much.
Lunt lost the Oscar to a tie between Wallace Beery and Fredric March, while Fontanne lost to Helen Hayes (Marie Dressler was also nominated).
The Guardsman has also put me in touch with their biographies, what wonderful lives they led.
Lunt especially gives a knockout comedic performance, not only as the whining, conceited, jealous husband, but also as the brash and passionate Guardsman.
This is not just bad, it's also a cheat.
Also the kill scenes are also very sub-par and not scary, and the acting and editing was horrendous and haphazard.
Said actresses also provide ample "eye candy," if you like tight outfits, leather pants, etc.
=) - The killer's outfit/mask/demeanor is also suitably creepy.
The editing also makes the plot confusing at times.
John Hogan also did a fine job of directing, with many dramatic angles and more closeups than were seen in the previous Drummond film by another director.
He also discovers a corpse under the table, which was a fine feathered deed worthy of this fast-moving film, which does not disappoint any stout Drummondonian.
(Could also be his first name may have been a downer in the long run.)
The reputation of Jean Renoir also is responsible for the high marks this film receives.
But there's also a staginess to many of the characters and scenes that blemishes director Renoir's naturalistic approach.
Not only it gives a statement for the gay people in Bosnia, but also one for the whole population.
Not only was the lead hated and oppressed because he was Muslim, but also he was further despised because he was gay.
It is not just the love story between the two men in this film that matters--and it does matter, mightily--it is also the conflict between savagery and mercy in the Serbian townspeople and the Muslim protagonist.
This film isn't just about war, it's also about peace.
The small cast also includes Kenneth Griffith as Hawkins' eager-to-learn subordinate Â incidentally, the latter also appeared in two episodes of Patrick McGoohan's later cult TV series of the same name but which bore no relation to this movie!
Although the main characters and the setting remain unnamed throughout (lending it a pretentious air of political allegory also missing from the earlier film), the controversial subject of THE PRISONER got it banned from participating in both the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals Â although it did get nominated for 5 BAFTAs and, eventually, won a couple of other international awards.
Alec Guinness got to repeat one of the roles he did on the London stage with the screen adaption of Bridget Boland's The Prisoner which was directed by Peter Glenville who also did the original stage production.
I also have to admit.. the whole plot really doesn't get me worried about who wins!
Now he works as a tugboat captain and also is the custodian of Eric, his killed friends son.
But just like any other movie, it is also very entertaining and keeps you in your seat from beginning to end.
I also preferred Mr. Vincent over Mr. Bochner as I believe he portrayed Byron much more convincingly.
Not by a chance any less of a great performance also by Valerie Perrine (Honey Bruce).
Hart Borchner is also giving a good performance as US submarine officer Byron Henry who is trying to reach his wife Natalie and his child trapped in Europe.
Rest of cast and supporting characters are also showing very admirable performances.
I also found the switch in actors playing Adolph Hitler distracting, but to a much lesser degree.
Barry Morse also deserves credit for being able to switch roles from the slimy Wolf Stoller in WoW to a wise but challenging General Halder in W& R ( One goof- Halder was not executed in the aftermath of the July 22, 1944 attempt on Hitler as depicted in the film- he survived the war ).
Not only is it a very interesting story about the lives of these specific people, but also tells a lot about WWII and it inhumanity.
The sound is also updated and very good (DD 5.1).
I'm not a great "war movie" fan, but War and Remembrance succeeds in capturing the enormous scope of the Second World War while also telling the stories of personal sacrifice and heartbreaking tragedy.
And there were also shortsighted clowns among the Allied forces and in their political ranks.
There are also the experiences of their spouses, lovers, and the relatives of their spouses and lovers.
The audience is also given a glimpse into the thinking of the Nazi leadership, with Steven Berkoff providing a chilling and brilliant portrayal of Adolf Hitler.
I also recommend reading the book.
Relative acting newcomer Chloe Sirene, actually London-born, also gives a fantastic and completely convincing performance as the Romany Czech refugee, Tasha, struggling against ethnic hatred and pursuing male relatives to gain British citizenship, independence, and find her way in an impoverished and hostile area.
The supporting cast also give very solid performances that add texture to the developing story line.
She is also in mortal fear of her Czeck husband and brothers who might come looking for her.
But I'm a big fan of biography movies, so I decided to give this movie a shot, since I like Dustin Hoffman and also a world of stand up comedy.
Dustin Hoffman also did a great job as a troubled stand - up comedian, despite the fact I found him far away from being a comic actor.
But the other half of the movie is much much better; Lenny Bruce's legal troubles, obscene behavior and problems with drugs... the movie was in this case quite realistic but also very very depressing.
And I also didn't like the fact, that a movie about a stand up comic is not even funny.
Not to mention the fabulous writing also done by Brooks!
And then there is Greg Kinnear, who also does a great job.
I also like his relationship with Simon, you can see him wrestling with the fact that he actually likes him.
The screen writing is also just as superior.
I also admire Shirley Knight as Carol's mother Â perfect!
This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.
The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality.
As Good as it Gets is a very funny movie, filled with great acting and lines that always hit the mark p-e-r-f-e-c-t-l-y... Jack Nicholson is absolutely perfect, and Helen Hunt proves that she can do better than playing in Twister... Greg Kinnear is also very convincing in his role.
The movie also looked good probably because I did not how big of a personality this guy Lenny was (was written about in Time magazine n all) and my previous experience with such biographies hasn't been that great.
He also has a little bit of Perry White thrown in as he constantly is telling people 'don't call me inspector'.
Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues.
Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part.
When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.
Nicholson shows real range here - sure, he gets to be the sarcastic curmudgeon we've all come to expect, but his character also has moments of fear, repression and vulnerability which he brings off equally well.
And also, the fact that his character is a romance novelist is never really explained or examined in any way.
(It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)
As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also hugely entertaining.
As Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written.
Aside from its many hilarious moments, it's also quite touching.
Helen Hunt also gives a compelling, emotionally packed performance.
Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he is scarred and left destitute following a break-in.
The emotions evoked by the actors are also authentic and heart-felt, as if they love what they are acting out.
The movie also chronicles his marriage to stripper Honey Harlow (Valerie Perrine).
I loved this movie along with The Ice cream man which also needs to be released on DVD.
"Night of the Scarecrow" is a typical horror movie from 90's.The production is slick and polished,the acting ranks from acceptable to lame and the special effects are mostly cool.There are some graphic gore scenes,so the gore-hounds will not be disappointed.It's a decent movie however I prefer earlier "Scarecrows"(1988,William Wesley),which is not only gory,but also creepy as hell.In conclusion,this is sometimes nonsensical,but quite enjoyable picture so you should give it a chance.
Night of the Scarecrow deserves more recognition then it gets.It's got a good storyline and plot to it.Theres no characters that are that famous,but if you watch soap opears you'll recognize Cristi Harris who plays "Stephanie".She's from NBCs Sunset Beach.The killer Scarecrow is corny ,like the snowman in Jack Frost,but it's still a great movie.It also has great death scenes;so if you like horror movies rent Night of the Scarecrow,you won't be disappointed.I give it **** out of ***** stars.
It also takes a while to explain what exactly is going on, but overall it was enjoyable enough.
Nevertheless, I hold the stories themselves in high regard and so I also had high expectations of the movie.
Changing the character of Susan into a much stronger young woman was also appreciated.
It did feel surprisingly rushed though and I hope this is at least a trilogy from the way they ended it which was also a bit confusing for the audience.
Even so, the implications surrounding Aslan's self immolation can be interpreted in non-religious forms: if anything, it's also very similar to Gandalf's fall into the pit with the Balrog in tow in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.
Narnia only exists if you believe hard enough in it, and time, of course, stops... or let's say, it marches at a totally different beat, also visible in Stephen King's DARK TOWER series.
There are also some large, captivating sights such as the view of the ice castle and the scene of the final battle.
His playing with the children and also with the animals that he brings back to life gives him a wonderful quality that we don't get in the movie.
I also missed the humorous asides and narration that are present in the book.
I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy.
However we are also treated to multiple examples of Lenny's hedonism and the choices (perhaps poor, perhaps misguided) that are also to blame for his death.
I have never seen footage of a Bruce concert/performance, but I have several as music files and have listened to them many times (particularly the Berkeley and Carnegie Hall performances that are also undoubtedly CDs now); Hoffman captures his verbal mannerisms perfectly.
Much of the material will be familiar to anyone who has listened to Bruce's work, but there is also much that I have never heard.
The film also makes it very clear that Bruce was far more than tit jokes and profanity.
This movie was also very very good.
The story contains important lessons for children, but also relevant reminders for adults.
I also think attempts to compare the film to Lord of the Rings and/or Harry Potter would be unfortunate for all parties.
As I remember she also ended her career as a brunette in the picture Don Juan.
There's also character actresses Sue Ane Langdon and Marya Small (both familiar to '70s tv viewers) and the young Felice Schachter seems very sweet as Scott Baio's soon-to-be girlfriend.
This also applies to the dead sexy Jewel Shepard !!!!!!!!!!!
The script also goes so far as to have Barney recite Travis Bickles' immortal quote from "Taxi Driver"!
Willie Aames great to watch also, kinda like your buddy who knew how to get things done.
Veteran actor Albert Finney was also nominated that year but Carney won on sentiment and Hoffman lost out when he and fellow nominees Jack Nicholson for Chinatown and Al Pacino for Godfather II split the vote which led to Carney's win.
It was also nominated for Best Screenplay and Cinematography but came up empty in all six nominations.
He's a real sleaze bag and rents a place so he can work on his art with 3 female models and his female assistant but are also joined by a big hulking ug ug kinda guy who works for an estate agency or something and has to oversee this guy for insurance purposes (it's kind of hazy).
There is also another Lash La Rue film, "Ghost Town Renegades," on the back side of the disk, although he is "LaRue" in that film's credits.
The third part of the film focuses mostly on The Circus and the uncompleted film The Professor, but it also includes tidbits from City Lights, Modern Times, The Great Dictator, and Limelight.
In addition to analyzing his shorts, the documentary also chooses to analyze CITY LIGHTS as well as THE GOLD RUSH and provides many behind the scenes insights.
FYI--Fortunately, while this is a nearly perfect film about Chaplin, there are also two wonderful similar documentaries about Harold Lloyd ("American Masters", Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius) and Buster Keaton (Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow)--both written by the same two writers who made this wonderful film.
They also understood his flaws as a human being, and the result is an unflinchingly honest biopic that paints a dark, staunch portrait of a troubled man.
And although the narrative is rather cold, it's also unique Â sometimes refreshingly so.
The supporting actors are great also lead by "Lt. Tragg, oops I mean Ray Collins" playing Uncle Matt to the Turners.
This film comes from the fertile mind of Sidney Sheldon who also had another bachelor/bobby soxer film in Susan Slept Here.
Rudy Vallee also carries on in the tradition established for him by Preston Sturges's comedies.
Myrna Loy is a judge who sentences Cary Grant to Shirley Temple in "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer," also starring Rudy Vallee, Johnny Sands, Ray Collins, and Veda Ann Borg.
Among the cast, Cary Grant is very-well cast it seems to me as the suave, womanizing and genial Nugent; he also portrays exasperation very nicely, and his reading of comedic one-liners is one of his best professional strengths.
One also needs to know the times to understand that "bobby-soxer" refers to young girls wearing sox with the tops turned down ("bobbed" which means shortened).
And the later scene in the nightclub is also a real winner.
The shots that Fosse used also assisted with building this compelling story.
It also left the door open to the question of who is behind the camera.
Valerie Perrine, also a young actress at the time, was immaculate.
Living with an English teacher, I am constantly involved with the English language, but I am also shown information about those that have no interest because they do not see how it relates to "real" life.
I am also aware of how little respect English gets as daily we hear of schools cutting back on their Literature studies to help support their sports program, or how the first way to cut back spending is to close libraries.
3very good actresses Eleanor Parker Patricia Neal & Ruth Roman are the 3 women in despair,,and give very fine performances.Direction is very good also by future Oscar winner Robert Wise.. but a lot is borrowed from "Letter" the basic 3 women plot, the miasma, and the stream of concsiousness flashbacks.They worked well for "Letter" & work well here also... but the conclusion is smaltzy & the film lacks the wit and intelligence of its predecessor.. Worth seeing.. a "Chick" flick & some good actors involved..but Letter to 3 Wives is an original & a masterpiece !
Shades of Al Pachinos desire to concentrate on legitimate business in the Godfather perhaps, also parallels with Billy Elliot as Thomas goes against the grain of his contemporaries.
This is the story of a man who works as an enforcer within a building company but who also harbours the desire to resurrect his piano playing.
I also liked the way in which he dealt with the pianism within the film.
A very good, if (also characteristically) rather pessimistic film.
To make life even more complicated, he is having an affair with his best friend's wife, and also brazenly seduces a mobster's girlfriend.
In "Beat," Tom Seyr (Romain Duris) is also a thug.
And Tom tries to keep in touch with his dissolute widower father Robert (Niels Arestrup), who is also a nefarious wheeler-dealer.
The filmmakers also don't find it necessary to tie up every loose plot end or coddle us by taking the storyline where we in the audience think it should go.
Ocassionaly Tom collects debts from clients for his father Robert, also practising in questionable real-estate deals.
Unfilimar with the original James Toback film, director Jacques Audiard; also screenwriter with Tonino Benacquista, have taken the challenge of completely transporting the story into a French setting, and succeeded in this task.
not only are the piano pieces pleasing, the techno also thrills (trance is great!).
also, there isn't a single scene without a cigarette in everyone's mouth, all the time.
Nils Arestrup, as the father, has also some good moments.
But, it also worked as a scare episode.
Which was also a pretty humorous scene that scene included the two weedheads from 'War Of Coprophages'.
The split that is also apparent in the character's parents, one a classic pianist who's passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy.
He's also modified the Mafioso's in the original by creating a tight gang of 'real estate' brokers (brokers that break windows, dump rats, etc.
Since Tom also loves electro which he listens to with big headphones in his car -- as the word is Duris himself does -- classical music maybe doesn't grab the film as wholeheartedly as it ought to.
This movie was good, but I don't think Daryl Hannah will be in the 3rd movie and it was also interesting to see the President trying to set Alex and Grant up.
also a very sexy opening - the sequel to this is going to be fun.
Incidentally, yet another contemporaneous Western pitting one woman among several desperate men in a remote landscape was THE NAKED SPUR (1953), one of the well-regarded series of Anthony Mann/James Stewart Westerns â as in that film, the central group here has to contend also with a horde of marauding Indians.
I own a copy of the bare-bones R2 DVD of GARDEN OF EVIL; the upcoming R1 edition should be a SE and include an Audio Commentary â and, as far as I can tell, itâs only going to be available as part of a 3-Disc Collection also comprising two other classic Westerns from the Fox studio: THE GUNFIGHTER (1950; which I already own on R2 as well) and RAWHIDE (1951; not available elsewhere)...
Fans of Cooper and/or Widmark also would not be disappointed.
It also has the film's only real weakness: it's glaringly obvious who's going to "get it," and the order of when they meet their ends.
The prints of Rawhide and The Gunfighter the other two westerns in the collection are also very good.
They all desire the gold and also the woman, and she uses her power of seduction to command them.
The picture also has an excellent score by the ubiquitous Bernard Herrmann.
'Penny Serenade' also touchingly deals with the subject of adoption in an honest yet sympathetic manner.
Cary Grant was also very convincing.
Stevens also pulls tremendous performances from his principals.
The film is also an early, uncommonly mature look at the challenges that arise with marriage and adoption, a precursor to later accomplished films like 1967's "Two for the Road".
After some hard lessons in life, including losing their baby during an earthquake in Japan (making it impossible for them to also have any natural born children as a couple), the two move to a nice, small town in northern California.
Grant demonstrates convincingly, how he also masters a passionate (and slightly sentimental) role - probably being best known for his parts in screwball comedies and Hitchcock-movies, this might surprise some people, including myself.
You could also mention the conscious use of the camera - I particularly noticed a scene where the camera is placed on the stairs, thereby filming primarily the legs of the Roger and Julie.
The supporting cast, which sports nice performances by the likes of Beulah Bondi and Edgar Buchanan, is also very fine, the script is quite good, and the cinematography both functional and elegant.
It's also due to the skill of the leads.
My mother also sat down to watch with me.
Ms. Dunne is also effective as Julie, a woman who can't have children of her own.
I wasn't much of a Cary Grant fan until I saw this film for the first time about 10 years ago, and I also discovered the embodiment of grace and charm that is Irene Dunne as well.
It was also an interesting insight into how a couple struggles to raise their first child, which is something many people can relate to, no matter what the time period.
It was also interesting the way Dunne went through all the flashback scenes in the movie by playing records that reminded her of their life together.
I also didn't like how her mom went and told Joey she was really a guy she should have let Gwen do that when she was ready to.
It reminds me of another brave film, called "Soldier's Girl" from 2003, also a made-for-TV movie, which was also extremely well-done.
It is also to be hoped that this film will educate and enlighten the public about transgender teens and what they face in their daily lives.
The cinematography was also very good, watching the movie one didn't feel that they were in a movie theater, but in the scene with the characters; which is where the cinematography in a movie should take its' audience, but often doesn't.
It also deals with the problem of crew's management and the role of the government in the space exploration.
There's also the over-used music from Holst's The Planets and Handel's Messiah (hey, Phil, it was funny the first 600 times someone used it back in the 30s).
Dennis Quaid also stands out as Scott Carpenter.
It also shows that among these male traits there is also a bond, a willingness and need to work together for the common goal, to push your competition to achieve more than he may realize he is capable.
However, as in all good journalism, the reviewer should also give impartial details, and allow the reader to make their own mind over an issue the reader liked or disliked.
When watching Apollo 13, which also stars Ed Harris, there was a real continuity in the movie that made the two movies complement each other nicely.
The Right Stuff also was a great vehicle for actors like Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Scott Glen,Sam Shepard and Dennis Quaid who have all gone on to do amazing work.
It pleases both as an emotional experience, one of those rousing and inspiring tales, and also at times intellectual.
The Right Stuff is a very human story, told with an approximate awe for the subject matter and an attitude that says "we can be epic, but we can also point out the flaws that come around in human nature."
We see some expected things like a big press conference, but we also see things that ring so true that they feel so real as minor events, like when the scientists are showing the astronauts the pod without a window or proper escape hatch and they all band together to put pressure on them to do it right or else the press will hear all hell (the wording in this scene is very good).
Basically any scene with Chuck Yeagher is one of these, especially early on but then also towards the end with his absolutely stunning bittersweet moment of going up to the sky and, well, nearly dying in a last-minute jump from the plane into flames.
That it's also one of those outstanding ensembles helps a great deal too.
I also enjoyed Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard and Barbara Hershey as Yeager's wife.
Though he was one of the first ones out, he was also the last one eliminated, and it was almost disappointing to see Austin beat him.
It also contained the surprising return of the Big Show and some guest entrances from The Honky Tonk Man and Drew Carey.
It is a powerful story of Lazaro's conflicts with society but it is also the conflict between nature and man or progress.
There is also the very topical issue of the exploitation of the Amazon environment and the relationship between the boy and river.
The nature child learns that human civilization also has some lethal crocodiles.
Charles Durning also gave a masterful performance as the priest who just wanted to do right by Lazaro; he had such a rapport with young Rabelo, leaving the audience convinced of the growing bond between the two.
This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit.
The atmosphere of this movie was seemingly like the Italian neorealist films of the 1950s, like De Sica's "Umberto D.", but it also had the precision and care of what was portrayed on the screen like Yasujiro Ozu and his "Tokyo Story", "Floating Weeds", and his other masterpieces.
And also like Ozu, this movie keeps the focus on family struggles, always a favorite topic for Yasujiro Ozu.
The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.
''Hotaru no Haka'' (Brazillian title : ''TÃºmulo dos Vagalumes'') is a very sad and moving film about the second war in Japan,focusing in the difficulties of a brother(Seita) and a sister(Setsuko).After their mother is killed in an air raid and their father was also killed working in Japan's navy army, Seita needs to be responsible for his little sister Setsuko,a very adorable and sweet little girl.
It belongs on the list of great war movies, but also on one of the greatest stories ever told.
I will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister.
He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain, and instead makes this a very human story, with no clear-cut "good" or "bad" characters.
Instead of just making the Americans out to be bad guys, the Japanese people in the children's village either through greed (their aunt) or through indifference (Gardener, Doctor), also play their part in the children's starvation and death.
The animation is perfect also.
It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.
I also learned that this was his first film, and what a way out of the gate!
Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction.
The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least.
I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead.
He also is THE person to be in such a show.
It also gives that superhero "feel" that Stan Lee never appears in person, just on a television screen.
I also like the interesting plot twists and surprises I've seen so far!
Also, fans of reality TV should also enjoy this show, being one itself.
I liked Annette O'Toole also, but found her performance a little grating - especially in the labour scene which I thought was a little over the top.
I've never seen the opera but I've heard this is very faithful and Stratas and Domingo have beautiful voices and also can act!
They are also of believable age, and display great chemistry together.
The young Domingo's fiery Latin emotions with his imposing looks, and the very slender and also young Stratas' passionate interpretation (especially in her facial gestures) are totally convincing and captivating, as are, needless to say, their vocal talents, among the greatest of the century.
One simply cannot compare, say, the "classical" version released two years later featuring Dame Joan Sutherland (possibly the greatest soprano ever, but at the end of her incredible career)and Luciano Pavorotti (to whom comparable comments also apply).
It also includes some old live-action clips of Hollywood (because of this I recommend this short to people who are interested in history).
It's also a portrait of an independent woman of means at the turn of the twentieth century who has strong ideas about what a masterpiece isÂand how it should be seen by the world.
But "Stolen" also explores many other questions about the nature of art and of life.
The plot is also rich and is a refreshing contrast to so many of the predictable, clichÃ©d flicks playing at the mall theaters.
To make the picture complete, there is also a strangler's mother, a character inspired by the Hitchcock's Psycho.
This is also one of the only films I have ever seen where a voice-over narration is used effectively.
Delivered in a deadly earnest, reporter style voice, the narration manages to add to the overall mood and also provides some of the funniest moments, including the excellent conclusion.
The series is short, merely 26 episodes, and the story telling is minimalist also (truly post-modern) yet each episode is complete.
For me the movie also turned out to be above expectations.
This show also has a vast variety of episode styles.
The soundtrack is also one of the best I've ever heard.
Universal's 30s version is better, but also not comparable to the musical.
Most of the episodes are episodic but there is also a main plot arc running through the series.
Faye Valentine, an amnesic, who was awakened from a cryogenic slumber, her past is a mystery but is slowly un raveled during the course of the series, she is also running from Debt collectors after being scammed upon being awakened from her cryogenic state.
They are also joined in their exploits by a computer genius and master hacker from earth known as Edward, a wacky teenage girl, and a welsh corgi named Ein.
The show also has a great soundtrack.
Excellent story,characters,humor,drama etc.The show is basically about three(later four) bounty hunters and them doing their job.There was also a film adaptation of this, which I saw before watching the series.The movie is excellent as well.If you are an anime fan, check this one out.
Unfortunately, that means there are also some of the galaxy's most feared criminals.
CB's music is composed by the legendary Yoko Kanno, who also composed several other big titles.
It's also worth mentioning this show's dubbed voice-overs are some of the best in all anime (dub voices or original).
I keep hoping that I will also enjoy the movie.
It's also got electronic and trip-hop things.
and like always we also learn more about her as the show moves on and see what her makes so Fey.
Fey is also not a role model since she dresses like a hooker from California and has a gambling addiction.
-The music is also a highlight of the show and is really a surprise.
The smooth jazz is also an advertising ploy and is heavily advertised in the promos.
He also wishes to excel within his known boundaries.
Having seen Amir Naderi's film Aab, Baad, Khaak (Water, wind, dust) also with Majid Niroumand (Amiro of Davandeh) only a day before, Davandeh's power as great cinema was a trifle diluted.
What a marvelous adventure this film is, an adventure that is also magnificent film-making with not an ounce of fat.
Rather than throwing mountains of computer graphics at us, which seems to be the case in most modern horror, the director has allowed us to use our imagination, and also throws enough twists at us to keep us guessing as to the identity of the killer.
The lack of Police presence & also, the ending, revealing that, in a sense nobody was responsible nor any reason for the deaths certainly lost it a mark.
I should also point out that there is a not unimpressive sequence where two characters enter a house only for them to come to a sticky end .
Unfortunately Mr Adams also wrote the screenplay and it's this that is the film's undoing   I'm not much of a horror fan and though I enjoyed the 2002 releases where the British Army let off a few shots at monsters in abandoned houses there's little in this movie to recommend unless you're a horror movie addict
It also manages to reduce an important supporting role, that of Queenie,the black cook, to just two lines and no singing, as well as to eliminate the black chorus, an important element of all the show's stage productions as well as of the 1936 film version.
It is also nice to see another good British horror.
Characters are often not where they're supposed to be and also have severe amnesia problems, forgetting what they did in previous scenes or information they have been given.
The characters are also undeveloped.
The photography and lighting are also used with expertise which greatly add to the experience.
There are also some little twists along the way as well.
The script also features various lapses of logic, at the end I just couldn't stop thinking that it was a bit of a coincidence that a bunch of kids would just happen to hold a sÃ©ance & summon the exact same demon that their landlord & one of their Father's did years earlier, a fact which they only discover later on in the film.
I also hated the scare tactic's that director Marcus employed, I mean people hearing noises only to have one of their 'friends' grab their shoulder & apologise for scaring them.
There are also plenty of cheap demon point-of-view shots which presumably help save money by not having to show the demon itself.
I also liked the ending where the Djinn appears to win, it's nice not to have a happy sugar coated ending for a change.
This also brings a few faults into the film by more of them later.
Lastly, while props go out to Christopher Scott Cherot, for accomplishing the Van Peebles-ian task of writing, directing, editing and starring in his own film; Hav Plenty also suffered from the Van Peebles-ian lack of focus, direction and story development in a film that they write, direct and star in.
He was aware of his shortcomings and he also had confidence and and a great sense of humor about himself.
Lena had also done a brief turn as Julie in the 1946 Kern biopic, "Till The Clouds Roll By".
(He also has to be certain none of the lady guests are harmed, since there is a party involved.)
I can now look at it and smile, but also recall those dreams which invaded my sleep.
I can now look at it and smile, but also recall those dreams which invaded my sleep.
We also get the much used and appreciated staple of 50's sci-fi movies, the educational film strip, although here it is a bare, er, "bones" demonstration, with just a little doggy who has electrodes on his head.
The family life of Darkwing Duck is also quite interesting.
Darkwing Duck was not only a clever series with great parodies of the more serious super hero shows, it was also funny without the bathroom humor or ADHD plots you get on kid's shows these days.
Her "Bill" was also really quite moving (although dubbed by Annette Warren,) especially when she acknowledges that her ring finger no longer has a wedding ring on it.
Plus in this cartoon Launchpad McQuack from Ducktales is in this cartoon as Darkwing's sidekick and Gizmoduck is in it also who Darkwing is very jealous of for stealing his fame in St. Conard!
Plus, he is also brilliant in criticizing some past tragic events in a humorous yet effective way.
This also points out the hypocrisy of religion.
The sniper rifle scene was also very humorous to me and scary at the same time.
Moreover, it is man who watches this movie that also creates the story Â not on the screen, of course, but in her or his mind.
Therefore, there can be no laws at all, because they also stay and fall with evolution.
By the way, the film also has two other interesting factors to note, one about an "infamous" scene that did leave me laughing hard, and another more of historical note.
But it's the theme of Goya's painting that BuÃ±uel is concerned with, and this film is more than a mockery of the bourgeoisie, it is also an attack on communist doctrine which all over the world only seems to take from the people what is was supposed to give to the people: Freedom, and also an attack on leftist defeatism.
I also enjoyed the portrayal of Julliard.
The movie also had an annoyingly self righteous message about conservatory schools.
I also enjoyed those scenes in the cotton plantations.
Ava Gardner was too very beautiful and I also enjoyed seeing dear old Agnes Moorhead whom I have always appreciated in films.
But she also was in her job because somebody's hormones went into overdrive.
George Brent, as Fred Gilbert, is similarly untested in this film (as in most of his films) but is in the additionally unfortunate position of providing the comedy in the romance, initially through his health regime obsession and then his superficial attraction to Maizie (Dorothea Kent), (the latter also being the means by which an essentially simple story is sufficiently prolonged to allow a feature length gap between the boy meets girl beginning and the inevitable - this is 1930's romantic comedy - boy gets girl ending).
She also gives the film its title with her remark that "We're nothing but a cheap lot of spoilers".
No doubt also that Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson sang beautifully together.
That 1937 version also had two people from the original Broadway production who made those parts all their own, Helen Morgan as Julie and Charles Winninger as Captain Andy.
The supporting cast is also quite strong: Richard Barthelmess and Harry Carey (both of whom had been stars in the Silent era and had since settled in character roles) appear as Dietrich and Wayne's sidekicks respectively Â the former is shady and the latter hot-headed, and each prefers to settle arguments with a weapon (Barthelmess a flick-knife and Carey the shotgun he calls "Betsy").
They are at their best with Dietrich as the sassy dance hall owner: Randolph Scott playing against type as a unapologetic scoundrel: and Margaret Lindsay,usually the sweet virginal type is also against type here as a schemer with a heart of gold (well, sort of).
Seeing Randolph Scott as a charismatic bad guy is also worth the price of admission.
They are both charming, which also is rather unique.
Their is also a spectacular train wreck and shootout with the bad guys as well.
If you look close you will also see a number of "B" western veterans in bit parts.
Its close rival in Pittsburgh also featured Wayne and Scott and this one is longer, but not as brutal as in Pittsburgh.
Randolph Scott is turning the corner of his career into Westerns also; abandoning those light comedy or milquestoast leading roles and showing a glimpse of the hardnose tough guy & questionably moral cowboy that he came to be in later career moves.
And the movie could also have done damage with a little more romance(I mean Kelly and Jack could have kissed at least one descent kiss).
The main Russian villain is fairly eccentric, but ultimately just boils down to your typical such baddie for this type of fare, spurting out an annoying number of sentences that begin with 'in my country, we have a saying...'   But none of the cast can do much about a frenetic, convulted plot that leaves too little time to really care about any of the characters and also raises some serious plausibility errors through-out.
And also, Alexsie, that Russian gangster guy with Cerebral Palsy, is also a pretty interesting character, cause the actor does a good job of getting into him, and boy, was he INSANE.
But it all get very lost and over the top, the two marine officers have a no part, the marine major is also a no-parter.
Wesley also does a credible job if you can call it that with this scrip, though I use the term credible lightly because he should have his head read for choosing this script !
I thought also that the director was getting a little too experimental.
The Japhumor is crazy as in most anime but their is peace to be found here also.
It was also disappointing that in the car chase they took advantage of the fact that most people in this world don't know how Bucharest looks like and they had no continuity in the route they used.
Mamie Van Doren in an unusual role where she is not meant to be sexy is the sheriff's bride and also the sister of the banker and leader of the cattlemen.
A very similar story was used in another western "The Young Land"(1959), also with very good results.
It also was great to see James Whitmore again.
My favorite, by far, has to be casting James Whitmore (see also The Shawshank Redemption, Them!, several episodes of The Twilight Zone, and the narration of Ken Burns' Lewis & Clark documentary, among many other credits) as the old man no-one takes seriously.
I also thought it was well written and well directed, despite the shortcomings of a low budget urban film.
Has a very spiritual feel about the whole thing, contains interviews with local inhabitants of the Look Behind area in JA, all of which are reggae lovers, gives there views on RastafarI and Bob Marley, then goes onto feature mutabaruka with plenty of interviews, also gregory Isaacs at his African Museum record label, he also gives a great performance and u can see just how he gets the name "The Cool Ruler", then onto a performance by Louie Lepke singing a song he wrote about bob marleys death.
It's pretty original/charming in concept, though, and I wonder if Miike wouldn't also like to make a samurai film entirely with Americans speaking broken Japanese.
Here a family story is also shown, with a couple that when they get married they forget about the clans but now the woman is going to avenge the dead of his husband by joining the clan of the whites.
Finally, I really liked Sukiyaki Western Django and the entire concept makes that this is a must see film not only for Takashi Miike fans but also for all the people who loves westerns.
It would have also been better with more sword fighting.
The dialog was a little bit troublesome for me from some of the Japanese actors, that tried to not only annunciate their English, but to also provide the old western slang along with it.
It was also accompanied by sub-titles in English.
There are hidden connections not only to the movies "Sukiyaki" is a remake of, but also to the ancient Japanese "Heike Monogatari" (The Tale of the Heike) and even Shakespeare's "Henry VI".
And much more than that: war of White and Red Roses, Gollum for a sheriff, chest, full of gold, old lady - gunfighter (who happened to be also animated eight-handed woman and Quentin Tarantino's lover), Tarantino himself, rather weather-beaten and riding steampunk-crafted wheelchair, raining bullets, Japanese mountains in the autumn, fight in the snow and so on.
And grandma, well, she's apparently a highly trained martial arts & gunslinger kind of gal, and she learned from the best, Ringo (Quentin Tarrentino) who also taught her how to make sukiyaki that wasn't so sweet.
There's an astounding amount of wild and weird action, and there's also some ridiculous comedic bits, like a bunch of men using the sheriff of the town as a shield, and looking exactly like a conga line.
It also helped that Miike had the good fortune of hiring actors who have either lived or studied extensively abroad.
Momoi Kaori (Bounce No Ko Gal, Memoirs of a Geisha), who was also educated in London, is clearly at home with the English dialog and turns in a terrific performance as Ruriko.
They also open the pathway to a subplot revolving around a tragically destroyed Genji/Heike family which plays a major part in the main plot.
Alexandra Mutu is just perfect (skin, make-up, clothes...she just sparkles) my favorite scene is a night scene with her and the stupid policeman(played by Mugur)... so perfectly directed...sweet and funny and also a little vulgar...I just could not stop laughing.
Radu petreanu plays also very good as Costel and the Russian colonel.
and fun also and it is fun just for who have seen Garcea before and know who is he so you should see this movie i am not a fan of romanian movies but this movie is O.K.
The acting is also very poor.
Without any grate expectations regarding the quality of the settings or any cool special effects (it's a low budget movie), I say: see it, be amused, disgusted, revolted or upset about the jokes, but also be honest and think about how many of the situations they are making fun of are based on things happening to you, around you or to a significant number of people living in Romania today!
I really enjoyed it and was perfect for the kids and also a great film for the young at heart aswell.
Lot's of horror fans of '70's movies will be disappointed by this also because it isn't really an entertaining one to watch.
I also liked the sex scene between the sex-crazed lady and the hot young guy.
I was also quite surprised as I watched the film, as it had a very significant amount of nudity and sexual content.
but she also detailed what the other couple was doing on another part of the island at the same time!!
She also starred in the first Broadway production of "Cabaret" as Sally Bowles.
Doses of grisly violence, sex, and intrigue also add to the mix.
In addition the gore effects are also well done and provide for some effectively chilling scenes.
A private investigator named Brent (Bryant Haliday) who has been hired by Penolope's parents to try and prove her innocence also travels with them.
This film also contains one of the worst special effects I've seen in a long time, as the group travel from the mainland to Snape Island the filmmakers used a boat in a studio and a back projected sea, which looks and feels awful.
The fashions are also very 70's, silly looking sideburns and flares, the women in this film look attractive though, but I'm not sure that a mini skirt and high heeled boots would be a good choice of footwear considering the rocky and rough terrain.
It was a great shock to me when I found that this film is given an average of 5.7 .I think it deserves to be in the top 50 movies.It is a great movie with great directing,story,crew and great performance by Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston.The songs also are incredible.
Thank god you also just listen to it, without this awful film!
Watching the little boy, Fletcher (sorry I don't know his real name), was also a treat.
It is also interesting how you get to see 'behind the scenes' of a person who is a mega-star.
Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer.
Not only are there no surprises here, we are also seeing another in a long line of films made specifically to showcase the talent of one of the stars looking for a new pocket of audience for their great success elsewhere.
Costner also stepped up to the plate to win a new breed of fans as Farmer, his charm and laid back manner works well with a ruggedness that the male viewers could easily get on side with.
Apart from bombarding the viewer with unintentional nonsense every single minute, TWS is also a visually high-quality episode, with great sets and wonderfully bombastic 60s colours.
Story lines also included Compo's constant attempt to attract Nora Batty which was always a laugh, but sadly in 1999, Bill Owen (Compo) passed away.
This is also emphasized by the way the filming has done.
Antonio Banderas is also playing well.
Its s thriller, but it is also "a story about love, not a love story."
They are too young to know that many , many years ago there were so much better originals( mostly European)which is also expressed by IMDb ratings ( for The Day of the Jackal 7.9 vs. 5.7 and for The Manchurian Candidate 8.4 vs. 6.7 )
The cuban flair and atmosphere of the setting also could have been brought to the screen in a more intense way.
The cuban flair and atmosphere of the setting also could have been brought to the screen in a more intense way.
I also thought Angelina was perfect for the role of julia/bonnie she really captures the essence of the femme fatale and I greatly sympathized with her character she wasn't really playing a villain she was more influenced by her accomplice/lover Billy who manipulates and twists her mind into thinking that no one could ever love her.In my opinion Julia/Bonnie was struggling with inner emotions and was even more confused by what she was feeling for Luis which is why she tries her hardest to deny that Luis does indeed love her.
Loads of erotic thrillers do release & usually those movies have nothing much to offer, but 'Original Sin' is not only among a good erotic thriller, but also is a genuine thrilling flick.
Thomas Jane was also fine, as a supporting character.
It is also novel to see a film about a man who is actually obsessed about his own wife.
Thomas Jane, whose other work I am not familiar with, is also excellent in his role.
It could also be due to the fact that the plot, "not a love-story, but a story about love," didn't match the small space many viewers have reserved in their hearts for Romance and Drama - just not both!
The final image of the film is also deliciously enigmatic: Paloma gazing - fearfully?
"El Bruto" is no exception and it is a strong combination of a surreal melodrama and political film which could also be viewed as a modern retelling of the Frankenstein's story.
At this point in the movie, one begins to try to make ties between Don Andres and Franco, Spain's oppressive dictator at the time the film was made (and also the reason that the movie could not have been made in Spain in 1952).
Watch also for the lovely scene where Mathilde asks for sexual advice from her mother (the excellent Sonia Tahar).
He had also grown up now.
Finally he manages to safely reach her to Delhi where she asks him to marry her and leave for Britain.Though by this time he is also deeply in love with her, he must fulfill his 'Dharma' now, that is to marry his fiancÃ© Lakshmi .
The movie also shows good examples of where the British and Indian cultures/societies blend to create harmony and clash to create havoc.
An evil prince (played by Rajat Kapoor) who wants to marry Catherine is also on their tail in the wake of the British partition of India and Pakistan.
Hrishitaa Bhatt also has a brilliant cameo in the film as Kisna's friend's wife.
This mindset also prompts new entrants to the industry to ape former greats by playing safe, resulting in more bad films.
I also think the whole Indian culture is superior bit is over done.
its not like Ur old style Indian movie where the British were shown equal to a devil like ruler, but the understanding was there why the villagers didn't like their presence their yet some liked them because of their work - the frictions between members from both sides who are able to accept the other side is also well shown
As well as her fiancÃ©, Newland, who is a business man and also a part of an upper class family.
This is also where Winona Ryder finally comes into her own as an actress.
Here in the Age of Innocence, Scorsese depicts (with the help of Edith Wharton's novel) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant, though also brutal in the deep.
This could sound like Arthur in the 19th century, but the director handles the material so carefully it works very well along with fine performances and excellent photography by long time collaborator Michael Ballhaus (who also provided my favorite scene in movies in the Cobana long shot in GoodFellas).
Unfortunately, Scorcese also takes 2 plus hours to tell us this simple story.
Michelle Pfifer is also good in her role, which Scorcese must have picked her for after a similar role in Dangerous Liasons (a far superior movie).
I also never realized that you can shoot a bazooka at someone 10 feet away and nothing will happen to you, and that some people can throw a grenade and it will blow up instantly with a 30 foot high explosion.
Over the past few months, I have also grown an appreciation for Winona Ryder's performance as May.
It is also dubbed in English, and sounds kind of fake.
They also threw in a little Bruce Lee montage at the end, no kidding, but don't worry, they worked it in tastefully-haha!
The plot is fairly straight forward and involves aliens, lesbian strippers, good ol' boy gun nuts, a pretty cool video store owner, who was also the director,(he kinda reminded me of Joel Robinson from MST3K), and a feisty, fairly hot secretary.
I did laugh though when one guy who was starting to "turn" tried munching on himself and a reverend also turning after being bitten, cut loose with a stream of profanity in the pulpit.
holy crap.i thought this was a great movie.it is a made for TV movie,but it is better than most TV movies,and even comparable to some theatrical releases.the premise is not new,family moves into a new community after a break-in at their old house, to start a new life.things seem great in the new community,but then things start happening.i won't say anymore except that there is a psycho stalking the family.and let me tell you,this psycho is really nuts.but what really elevates this movie is the acting.which i thought was fantastic.there's also lots of tension ans suspense to keep you unnerved.this is a very entertaining movie,deserving of a higher rating than it currently has.i've seen a few TV movies of the genre and this is one of the better 1's.my vote for 'Love Thy neighbour': 9/10
It was suspenseful, fun and the acting was also good.
I also saw that Love Thy Neighbor scored the highest approval rating in the Nielsens that they've "ever had for an Indy film."
The only saving grace that I found in this film was a snazzy little score that unfortunately also seemed somewhat out of place.
Lieberman also injects sequences that see various characters lose their hair before trying to kill anyone and everyone in the vicinity, and these too make the final package more intriguing - the sequence that sees a nanny take out her lust for violence out on a couple of irritating kids being the highlight in that respect.
This film is written and directed by Jeff Lieberman who also made "Squirm" and if you view this expecting to see something outrageous and wild than forget it!
"Blue Sunshine" is more fondly remembered for it's bald,thirty-something,ex-hippie murderers who are easily the most bizarre descendants of the living dead yet to reach the silver screen.This film is not easy to categorize:it's a horror film mixed with drug movie and also features paranoid urban legends and bizarre conspiracy theories.The title of this movie is taken from the name of a bad batch of 60s acid that seems to have some rather unfortunate long-term side effects.The film is badly lit and there are some dull spots,but "Blue Sunshine" is a must-see for experimental cinema enthusiasts.7 out of 10.
This lighting style also helps the movie stay young- aside from the fashion and cars you'd have no idea it was filmed in '76.
Not only did he direct the enjoyably silly nature run amuck movie "Squirm" and the very cool backwoods slasher flick "Just Before Dawn", he also directed "Blue Sunshine", an excellent example of what I have dubbed "LSD cinema" about the excesses of the 1960's coming back with a vengeance.
Zalman King, who was also in "Trip with the Teacher", one of my favorite trash flicks gives an excellent performance in the lead role.
Beyond the acting, "Blue Sunshine" also contains some very creepy imagery, a nifty score that serves to heighten the overall mood of the movie and a tightly written script that manages to do what few movies have been able to do, create an effective and memorable anti-drug message while avoiding being overly preachy.
Not a great film by any stretch, but worth at least a one time view to the "cult" fans out there...The Synapse disc also has a short-film called THE RINGER that is another strange bit of 70's weirdness that deals with consumerism, drugs, music, the naivetÃ© of youth, and "THE MAN" - and is pretty interesting too.
The mood is always kept intense and reasonably creepy, and the director also maintains a snappy pace, with no dull sequences to have to sit through.
The picture also has a purely 1970's vibe; hairstyles and wardrobes and of course a climactic disco sequence strongly evoke the era.
But also across town more weird murders are alarming the authorities.
I also could not get over how bad the English of the Chinese cast sounded.
The "electric chair" also stands out (or sits) in that regard.
There's also a scene of some amateurish belly dancing tossed in, for fans of that particular activity.
In the meantime, Pooja has also started falling in love with Raj and when she wakes up from her coma, she identifies Raj as her husband although that is not true.
Later she recovers and also goes along with the plan of him being Romi.
Like the "History of Iron Maiden" and also the bonus disc that came with "A Matter of Life and Death" there are extensive interviews with the band and others about the making of "Dance of Death" and the touring for said album.
He also wrote most of "Eyes Wide Shut" before Kubrick re-wrote sections of it.
I also used to tack a huge beach towel over my window each night, just in case my parents happened to have to go out at night!
I also tried TV Guide.com's Q & A, but since I couldn't remember the name, all I could do was give my best guest at the actors, and that I remember that the logo was a pink rose.
Nice to see that there are other fans here, and also people who began to question their own memory or sanity with respect to remembering this show!
There were also a lot of parallels to another parody, Shaun of the Dead.
It's also a chance to catch one of Hollywood's most compelling actors in a tailor-made part.
i hope they will also bring in more characters and add some other locations if you haven't seen the show they have not released a DVD but they have the episodes floating around on the internet you can find some on you tube in parts and in torrents but some are in poor quality i recommend that you watch the first 4 episodes and to get others to watch it maybe if fox notices the increase in fans they will do a reboot
Farley Granger is a young man on the "Edge of Doom," in this 1950 film also starring Dana Andrews, Mala Powers and Paul Stewart.
He's also a one-note actor, like Bernie Mac in a way because his acting range also consists solely of gulps and looks of surprise in response to stupid, artificial situations.
There's also an unsavoury 'black jokes' sequence which I simply didn't need.
To be certain, much of the comedy adheres to the "racial tension" theme, and there is of course plenty of the proverbial cultural clash that abounds- consummating with, you guessed it, a torrential family dinner scene in which Kutcher's "empowerment" eventually gets the best of him, but "Guess Who" isn't content to strictly deplore racial boundaries, as it also works effectively as a howlingly funny "meet the father from hell" scenario, succeeding solely on Mac's uncannily nimble charisma and wit, who has an aura about him that would make any future son-in-law shrink to his skin, or to a greater extent, be obliged to sleep and "spoon" with the man!
I also think that Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy would have enjoyed it.
I also found the representation of Brazilian culture, of which I know a thing or two, outrageously inaccurate and small-minded.
This unusual journey of a Hassidic Jew on the path of Western hedonism not only brings to light the sectarianism of such drastic religions, it also point the finger at the lack of spirituality (not religiosity) in the United States.
It also features auteur Sylvia Chang, director of notable flicks Princess D and 20-30-40, in one of her better performances.
She also never really signs up for classes, official reason for being in the city state to begin with.
It's also the first of JCE Productions' international iterations, marking the beginnings of Jackie Chan's endeavors as world-hugging producer on the global stage through is own outfit.
Freddy also has to deal with various Argentine cafÃ© patrons who view all Paraguayans & Bolivians with disdain due to their ethnicity.
Adrian Caetano, the director, also co-wrote the screen play with Romina Lafranchini.
It also gave me exposure to some of the other Doctors that I had never seen before.
Part of this is the fault of the writer, but also Eisenberg was just wrong for the part.
Chris Marquette and Sebastian Stan are also worthy of note, as is Eva Amurri as the typical thrill-seeking bored rich girl - the type that tends to want what she can't have, in this case a guy who is perhaps not to be trifled with, possibly of the kind she is ill-equipped to deal with, or at least to deal with as she does - again the typical heart-breaking machinery at work.
There is also an ongoing attack at "rich people" in general, when the case being considered is that of the spoiled offspring of some rich people - not all "rich people" are worthy of scorn.
I also agree, the educational part was not about Charlie Banks, who seems very passive and self centered with many short rather flippant comments.
However, I also felt as a privileged kid who had all his little ducks in a row, and egocentric as most of these people are, the film seemed to project a kind of real life situational social drama.
Eva Amurri is also first rate as a love interest.the entire cast are all first rate.
It also is a wee bit overlong.
The time line and set are also very interesting to me, the film starts in the mid seventies and jumps into the mid eighties, with all of the hair styles, clothing and props that bring you back to those time periods.
The opening and ending section with the small kids was also very moving.
It's a great first film and is also very smoothly and seamlessly edited.
Jason Ritter also shines as a questionable friend from the past, who may or may not have a more questionable past.
But if you also consider that this film was made by Warner Brothers (who made a lot of similar films) and stars some wonderful actors that I truly enjoy watching (George Brent, Olivia DeHavilland, John Payne and Frank McHugh), it's natural that I should like it.
The folks who made this picture also foresaw the role that TV news would come to play in taking over a story.
The film is also notable as it was one of the first movies put out by MGM under new management which turned the company away from solely making big budget events.
The cat also disguises himself as a monkey at one point.
Sylvia Kristel is perfect for the role Emmanuelle and the supporting cast is also good for a porn film.
If you like hard core porn films, you should also see this film, it might change your mind about soft core.
One can also view this film as a discourse between the male and female aspects of sensuality.
Emmanuelle can also be seen as a spiritual road movie, where she starts off as an innocent, yet strongly sensual girl, who slowly reaches sexual awareness and competence.
N/A  But, nonetheless, it is also a hard movie to watch until the end.
Along with hardcore-- but that's another problem... the plot is quite simple, understandable and sometimes stupid; the sex scenes are also simple, predictable and cut quickly.
I also love the fact that she does the "Dinner party" thing or just a small meal / lunch for herself or a special dinner for Jeffery .
it is also exported to 86 countries, sold more copies than "titanic".
It is no longer the shocker that it was in 1974, and anyway I have never been able to watch the 105' French version... so this film has also been a kind of Holy Grail to me, and I am still hoping to watch the full original.
This sexual encounter could have been a rape also, but because she is not afraid, there is no rape, just a consensual act that she derives great pleasure from.
But it was also the world of 'memory'.
They share a sort of teacher-pupil relationship, and they're also very liberal where adultery is concerned, as neither one cares too much about the other's antics with other people.
The settings in which it all takes place are pleasing also, and the film is of a much higher class than a lot of nowadays porn.
Her nice-but-cold older husband is also all for it.
I also very much enjoy her ideas on table settings, decor, and party planning.
I also found myself lost at a few parts due to two reasons.
Interestingly, the DVD also contains an alternate ending which would have been a "better" way to go, in my opinion.
When Batignole finds him, he feels sorry for the boy and lodges him, hiding Simon from Pierre-Jean and also from his wife.
The acting was awful--Chris O'Donnell did not carry the lead well at all, and Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman were also a great disappointment.
Juhi Chawla also blows you away with a charming performance (and beautiful looks).
However Main Koi Aisa Geet Gaoon (If I Sing a Song Like This) and Chand Taare (Moon, Stars) were also nice and creative.
A lot of other marginalized writers have also been prompted to explain the sins of their culture's past to the rest of us, beginning maybe with Nathaniel Hawthorne and running through the Southern giants of American literature and playwriting -- Tennessee Williams, Faulkner, and the rest.
It's also got Chris O'Donnell, OK not a bad actor (but does he remind anyone else of Matthew Perry?
But he's also prepared, not ready, but prepared to forgive.
Hall's father had changed the family surname to also escape the stigma of being the son of the murdering Klansman Cayhall.
Faye Dunaway also is in here and has a memorable scene with "Sam."
Andy Lauer, who plays the rookie who is ironically nicknamed Ace, is also very good, as are Roy Dupois who plays the mysterious Becker, and Jennifer Rubin who plays Jessica.
The futuristic sets of a war-ravaged planet are also excellent, and the costumes and props to go with it are good too.
Furthermore, his existence runs parallel a banks robber, The Gringo(War Bond) also relentlessly pursued .
Luxurious cinematography with lights and darks by Gabriel Figueroa( usual of director Emilio Fernandez, here also producer).
But it is also not well-acted in a couple of instances, notably the beautiful but overbearing Delores Del-Rio as the woman living in the town who's baby is baptized by the Priest played by Henry Fonda.
Del Rio's character is also quite tawdry.
The film also features an odd, mopey performance from Henry Fonda that works quite well within the context of the story.
Visually the most strikingly beautiful of his career, it's also a horrible mawkish wail of unconvincing public piety that constantly feels like he's trying to buy his way into heaven.
It's a moot point being that this is a re-telling of the original film of which I also enjoyed.
She also got behind the wheel and was impressive.
The ending also surprised me because it was--shall we say, "impersonal".
The movie also lends a few nice video game-like aspects but Paul WS Anderson knows how to handle such things, and really sets himself apart with this movie from directing-failures like Uwe Boll.
Yes the characters also use weapons, and cars that the every day consumer tends to drive.
There are also some really bad one-liners in the movie.
The gore definitely also makes the movie stand out but luckily not in a bad way.
The casting also proves interesting and satisfying and the performances luckily have a little bit more colour to them than in some of Anderson's past films.
If Anderson was looking to make a great homage to a cult film, he's done it, but he's also managed to crunch out one of my personal cinematic highlights of the year.
Jason Stathem, Ian Mcshay and Joan Allen also make this action movie worth watching.
Watching those shiny little cars race down the racetrack at full speed sure is exciting, and is an edge-of-the-seat pastime activity, because it sure gets your adrenaline going.And it's also nice to see every single tiny space of the seating capacity packed 'till there's no seats for more people is nice, because it's interesting to see how many people would have spent hard earned cash to see this big event.
Sent a brutal prison, he finds the female warden is responsible, and the killer of his wife also is in the jail.
You also have other clichÃ© prison characters, the kind you see in all prison films since "The Longest Yard."
Definitely better than the ridiculous "Righteous Kill", that we had the doubtful honor to view today also, at the same press screening, here in Bucharest, Romania.
These are also all the reasons why I had so much fun with the movie.
What Konstantin Tsiolkovsky said of the moon also holds for this movie: it's the perfect escape for those who lead a heavy life.
There's a frozen goldfish named Beethoven, a self-righteous younger brother (also Robert Lepage), and a loving mother who never speaks a single word (Anne-Marie Cadieux).
I really enjoyed this movie, even better than No, which was also subtle and quirky.
I also thought that some of the transitions were simple, yet stunning.
"La face cachÃ©e de la lune" is a film for which Canadian auteur Robert Lepage has got complete command as he does more than one cinematographic function.This is also something of a very special film for Robert Lepage as he adapted his own play to create a film version.He has confessed on numerous occasions that this is a film which is very much close to his heart.Complexities of human relationships are also explored by Robert Lepage as his film revolves around two brothers who do not have much in common.Apart from this film's story and innovative plot,Robert Lepage's acting abilities are the best thing to watch in this film.They will really give a nice idea about this great artist's genius.
He not only starred in but also wrote and directed this great little movie.
The soundtrack, mostly Beethoven songs, is also quite fit.
You also see some pretty bizarre acting by D. Hopper as he seems to be playing it for a black comedy.
I also found Nigel Hawthorne brilliant as Viscount Melbourne.
There's also a subplot of guys robbing convenience stores that goes nowhere.
There's also no sense in ballistics when detectives come around.
this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10
The film is also a great perspective of hard tough life of working class young men in Japan.
The film is also an early form of Takashi Miike's Young Thugs double bill which is ever so interesting.
Fukusaku not only explores the potential possessed by youth but he also wades through the delicate subject of the criminal nature that exists in us all.
YET Fukusaku also shows us that YOUTH by it's very nature is NOT a time to RAGE (most likely because of how simple it is for disaster to strike) BUT a time for introspection, a time to TRY and challenge oneself--- to be something one may not believe one can be.
Bokeem Woodbine is terrific, see him in Dead Presidents also.
It also provides new insight on what it's really like to live in a ghetto.
Jonathan Firth (Albert) also suffers from the various age make-ups, fares much better, and brings more complexity to his role.
He also does not make the transition to age believably.
Diana Rigg and Nigel Hawthorne also lend gravitas to production.
This production also features some really beautiful castle/historic locations, but this one is probably only for those who are addicted to the anglo-miniseries.
Jared Padalecki also did an excellent job in this one.
I have also seen recent productions like City of Violence(Korea)and Kill Zone(china)and despite my great exposure to the genre this movie's boldness in comedy, creative and action makes it stand out as the most fully entertaining action movie in a few years.
The movie also mocks kung fu at the end which is a long held tradition apparently- to make fun of the weaker kung fu compared to the monstrous brutality of Muay Thai and Krabi Krabong.
This is one really weird movie that also features a man who can change from a goofy guy with hair that resembles a tidal wave to an older warrior guy who can fight with the best of them.
There is also a wizard, at least I think that's what he was supposed to be, a tractor, talk of menstrual blood, and guys who seem to be possessed by spirits of animals that run like monkeys and can jump about fifty feet.
There were also a lot of other actors in the film who were outstanding, including Cher who was very believable.
He's also extremely appealing to a lot of women, me included.
I'm one of those guys who can enjoy a movie if you give me a running description of the movie while watching it - but, I also like watching alone at home.....the restroom is a LOT closer !!!
John Mahoney's performance is well-delivered, and an interesting performance, in contrast with his more pleasant persona in "Moonstruck," also -- and particularly juxtaposed with his likable presence in the long-running "Frasier" series.
The judge in the trial also appears to have an overly sense of apprehension in the trial, and seems bent on preventing justice from being served properly.
Not only is this a courtroom drama (and as you know the streets of Hollywood seem to be paved with this kind of scripts), it also featured Cher as one of the main actresses.
Although the filmmakers have also been criticized for using their camera to manipulate emotions, the series does appear to be a genuine attempt to simply chronicle the lives of ordinary people.
The DVD i saw also had a featurette with an interview with Siddiq Barmak, the director, editor and writer for the film.
The Taliban has also decreed that women would not be permitted to work.
Part of the fascination is how the Taliban managed to be so primitive and backward (basically anything that didn't exist at the time the Koran was written was verboten, with the exception of weapons and vehicles for them to get around in) and the peculiarities of Islamic attitudes and practices that distinguished the Taliban from, for example, the Khymer Rouge in Cambodia or the Nazis in Germany, although there are also parallels.
The director also did quite a laudable job of making a rather bleak atmosphere throughout the film.
He also did a good job in making the Taliban a menacing force, which you would learn to hate.
Its also a short movie which makes good viewing.
While it does serve to educate the viewer about the violent impact of religious fundamentalism and the raging inequality of conditions women have faced in Afghanistan, it also teaches the lesson of what happens when an individual defies the established rules of sexuality, a lesson that can be as relevant in Ohio as in Afghanistan.
But even so, there is little dispute that women's rights were trampled during the Taliban reign of oppression and that Afghanistan is a nation in plight in large part due to that regime (was it the setting or did the Taliban also banned the building of houses with roofs?).
There's also Osama's mother and grandmother, and the neighbors, and the men who were 'helpless' in spite of wanting to help - the roles and scenes are all touchingly stirring.
The movie is a study not only of the atrocious practices that are carried out against women by the Taliban, but also an illustration of the elasticity of the concept of religion.
On a slightly different note, I was quite surprised to read the feature review on the first page of the movie info, Eyal Philippsborn write "was it the setting or did the Taliban also banned the building of houses with roofs?"
Eyal also noted in the above-mentioned feature review that the opening quote of the movie was obviously--and I think unnecessarily--altered in the caption.
The use of water is also wonderful- from the film's reflected shots at the opening, through the constant rains and floods, to the last shots overlooking the water- a far better use of imagery than a similar shot which ends Alexander Sokurov's Russian Ark.
History also proves an enemy to their happiness.
Undoubtedly, Angelopoulos's films are also a shock to anyone accustomed to the pace of modern American cinema.
It also became, for me, harder and harder to take, as it became increasingly obvious that the characters are not really characters in a drama, but metaphors in a great historical process.
There are sepia colored photographs , and in this section of the film, the interiors are also sepia colored.
The film then darkens drastically, becomes more political, and also somewhat fantastical, non linear, and rather mythic in tone.
Alexis' role is entrusted also to a first-time actor, Nikos Poursanidis, whose performance is convincing.
But she is also the modern heroine, as women everywhere throughout the ages, who bend and stagger under the weight of adversity.
There is also a reference to Homer's Penelope in the departure scene to America, where Alexis unwinds Eleni's unfinished knitted sweater.
They are also long and demanding on the part of the spectator, but always well worth the effort.
But cinema and people need also the approach of Aggelopoulos, we need some space and time, to reflect and realise our existence.
But I will also mutter "So fake" as the puppets go through their paces.
Someone should have told Stillman that a film so dependent on its carefully crafted dialogue might also depend on the performance of said dialogue.
It has lots and lots of talk, which isn't everyone's cup of tea, but its also a refreshing change from so many movies which bang you over the head with loudness, violence and graphic sex.
More importantly, he's also very good at showing human nature in general.
Stillman also includes moral messages in his movies, but thankfully they are unlike the heavy-handed, politically-correct and dreary messages in so many other movies.
Nick is also a good guy beneath his preppie bluster, a fellow who champions Tom and breaks down Tom's highminded resistance to joining their circle with snarky logic ("You'd rather stay at home and worry about the less fortunate, but has it ever occurred to you you ARE the less fortunate?")
He also has real values he honors, sometimes at no small risk to his nose.
running can be very therapeutic and can also imply a sense of urgency as a medium to escape the predicaments of life one has been dealt.
They also fall in love.
There are also the women, who, unfortunately, do not leave much of an impression (aside from Audrey, of course).
Metropolitan is also blessed with one of the most realistic representations of New York I've encountered.
Metropolitan's interiors are also interesting, especially Tom's family's apartment, which is cramped and claustrophobic, befitting his middle class background.
But over the course of the film it becomes apparent that their secure perch in the upper echelons of the American elite isn't 100% set in stone, as an outsider is able to penetrate this rarefied universe, and manages to hold his own quite well, arousing suspicions (and battling shame over his own proletarian roots, and his battle between his own free-thinking idealism and his aggressive social climbing ambitions), but also making genuine friends among the cute young blue-bloods.
The dialogue, by the way, is great not only for its intelligence and wit, but also because it instantly identifies a proudly unique writer.
The dialogue is a never-ending delight, full of great one-liners, yes, but also some equally cherishable, marvellously pompous sermonising and theorising from these slightly preposterous yet strangely loveable people (particularly Charlie Black).
I also enjoyed the director/writer's two other films to date, Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco.
A friendship develops also between Tom and Nick, the most cynical and pessimistic, but also the most aware and responsible, of the group.
Stillman's other two films in the trilogy are also highly recommended.
It's pretty likable but also rather insignificant--worth seeing, but not a film you should rush to see.
This is Franklin Pangborn's first movie and he plays a very effeminate wimp who also happens to play the rugged hero in the company.
While the ending may not fulfill some viewer's wishes, it is also far from the pat ending that might be expected in a pure comedy.
The greatest of clowns, such as Chaplin, give us characters that are not merely funny, but also are filled with pathos.
Anyone who loved the early scenes in any of the SHOWBOAT films that gave them their name or who howled at Michael Frayn's hilarious stage farce and fun film, NOISES OFF, will also feel right at home with this deft predecessor.
I also got a scare from the part where Virgil suddenly appears at the back window of the car.
That the film also manages to work on an occasional comedic level is an additional tribute to all concerned.
Their "chemistry" throughout the movie is what gets the most laughs, along with Willem Dafoe's character that is also very comical.
Of course, you can't help but thinking about 'Taxi driver', Scorsese's famous movie, which also centers around a taxi driver who has emotional problems and can't deal with the world.
There's a little humor also thrown in this western, mainly involving "Sitting Bull."
Anna Friel, David Morrissey, Timothy Spall, Dominic Mafham, and David Bradley also were wonderful.
The adaptation was also excellent.
His family and friends are shocked and full of scorn and another man who also is smitten tries to kill him.
The depth of love and devotion John Harmon has and also the courage Eugene Braburn uses in defying society for love has makes me wonder what happened to the theory of romance.
This adaptation also had the biggest TV role for Anna Friel at the time.
Paul McGann is also wonderful as the Dickensian lawyer Eugene Rayburn, a bored young man whose life is changed forever when he meets Lizzie, the daughter of a man who finds bodies in the Thames, and when he confronts Bradley Headstone, the psychotic schoolmaster who is obsessed with Lizzie.
Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet).
I also believe it is better to have already seen Shallow Grave before seeing this one, as it tackles similar themes shown in a very different way.
Newcomers Virgine Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet also put in amazing efforts for their debut feature films.
I also love exteriors of this movie, great work of camera, absolutely perfect soundtrack and acting of some of the actors/Robert Carlyle, Tilda Swinton - she is exactly as Sal in the book/.
The acting was believable enough for me, and also I thought the use of pop (and not so pop) music was done well.
I've also been a high school teacher, and have worked with adolescents hungry to discover "the real world", to bite into Eve's apple with gusto.
It's also quite scary - especially the start, in the scene with Daffy.
It also had really good effects - the computer game bit freaked me out.
The viewer is also encouraged to join his nostalgia for his blood stained paradise.
The beautiful Virginie Ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected Francoise, and I also liked Guillaume Canet as Etienne.
If you're a rare remarkable person you'll also get altitude sickness , suffer dysentery , catch ringworm and under go a rabies scare .
He's also good at narration, which he provides here, as he has in a number of other films.
There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.
Jane (Cate Blanchett), a reporter, also joins the trip so she can write a cover story on Zissou and provide a love interest for Steve and Ned.
Wilson also provides a notable performance, where he's not allowed to be the smart aleck he usually plays.
There is also another matter.
How over the years the speed of information and technology has increased our capacity toÂblah blah blah Â No, I'm not one of those who pine for how things used to be, I don't want to go back to Green Acres or Gilligan's Island but I also don't want to be dragged through the next '24' hours wondering whose going to survive.
Jack Bauer is a great character, but I was also very impressed by President Palmer, whose wisdom, calm and dedication to his country shall stay as an example for each people on this world who plays a leadership role.
It is also the best indicator of what "24" is like, and if the first two hours do not get you hooked on the show, then nothing will.
I have also done the same to a friend of mine in college.
I think upon all the episodes i watched it seams it talk about American history and all the suffering that America is facing from their enemies were caused by their great white leaders i think a black head of state can resolve this issues.And also i think if there such movies yet going to be released in the future all the main supporting characters should survived at least seven seasons before they are ripped off.Even though 24 is a very nice movie and it tells a lot about what America is capable i think America is boasting its self to the world that no one can touch them and it can also attract more enemies around the world by also tempting them in so many ways.
And it's also very convenient that Jack always knows the president and/or some of the cabinet on informal terms, so they'll give him some leeway.
Occasionally the show clicks and the implausibility seems natural like the implausibility of life etc, and the audience is kept guessing and also given a satisfying conclusion, with not too many silly subplots.
It also seems like the writers tend to resurrect one-shot characters from previous seasons just because they want another familiar face to show up in the new season.
Of course, once inside the aforementioned prison, which is underground, presumably shielded against some form of electromagnetic radiation in order to protect communications and which is also, by the way, in the middle of freaking nowhere, it's remarkable how everyone's cell phone works.
Wes Anderson managed to not only recapture the Cousteau mystique with a twist but to also take me back to this wonderful time.
The show always uses multiple split screen camera shots and this is innovative work because it helps to make the show seem realistic and also in real time.
You will also see most of the camera focused on Jacks point of view and this is to make the show from a humans point of view and it helps to bring the viewer more involved in the show.
Director-star Orson Welles also adapted Isak Dinesen's rather pointless book about an aged millionaire recluse living in China who tells his employee of an incredible story he heard while in the service regarding a rich, dying man, his terrible wife and a sailor-stud.
Facts he already controls, fiction must also come under his sway.
Just a couple of points bother me here: when the sailor tells Moreau (whose character's name is significantly but inappropriately Virginie) that he is 17 and is informed by her that she also is 17, it is quite evident that both, and especially Mlle.
The facts for her make things awful to bear, even under payment, and Moreau also gets to reveal a deep level of sexuality that gives Welles another challenge never done before for him- how to handle a sex scene (this includes a great exchange of dialog between Virgine and Paul about an earthquake).
I also found Eshly to be like an extra Welles might've picked up from Fellini's production of Satyricon with the pretty-boy men, this time with an awkward English accent.
- the use of locale as a private labyrinth (there is very little of the Orient here, in spite of attempts at local colour - its anguish is very European and decadent); the idea of the dark, fettered house as a figure for the mind or the soul; the use of found locations, especially old buildings, suggesting older, better, nobler days, also irremovable reminders of decline; the restrained bursts of disruptive editing in the elegant design; the deep-focus long-shots form distorted angles, revealing characters to be mere pawns, geometric shapes in a total, hostile design; the idea of the film being the final dream of a dying man.
There is also, in Welles' first non-black-and-white film, a gorgeous use of deep colours.
The colour palette Stone uses is also incredible (especially the green tone for certain emotional charged scenes, because green represents something in the movie ... when you watch it you will figure it out), but he was also experimenting a lot with this film.
There were also a lot of great side-performances by Dale Dye, Lanny Flaherty, Steven Wright, Richard Lineback, Kirk Baltz, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Edie McClurg, Sean Stone, Everett Quinton, Arliss Howard, and O-Lan Jones.
The cinematography is also very nice done.
The change between color and black and white is also nice.
The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.
Lot of people gave it 10 or 9, but also lot of people gave it 1,2 or 3.
Tommy Lee Jones stars like never before and Woody Harrelson with Juliette Lewis are also super.
Of course, this is also where the film makes itself vulnerable to attack because anybody who goes out and murders somebody, and happens to have a copy of the DVD, can be said to have been "warped" by the films 'pro-violence' message.
I must also mention that all of the performances are top-notch.
Sizemore also gives a solid performance, as does Downey Jr, who is absolutely bloody hilarious!
He oozes with creepy redneck sliminess, but is also incredibly funny and charismatic.
The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype.
I also do not think that exaggerating images or scenarios is overkill Â I think exaggerating morals and 'happy endings' to get a point across is overkill.
As Stone puts it in the documentary, it's a film about two people breaking the rules, so it's only fitting that the film-makers are also breaking the rules.
It also asks the question - 'Is that guy on television crazy because he's killed 90+ people or am I crazy for watching a white bronco cruise through the streets of Los Angeles?'.
I'm sure this also isn't news to a majority of the people who are reading this.
The musical close under the credits was also a knock-out.
But their were also some other interesting things that caught my eye.
I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called "HONEY GETTER".
I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called "HONEY GETTER".
It's also the first time Rosie Perez has ever looked genuinely sexy to me.
an emotional roller-coaster which leaves you staring at the credits in la la land long after you should have gotten up and fetched that other beer.....i find it strange that the most compelling story i have witnessed on film is not readily available on DVD..in NTSC format at least and also that adrenaline pumping ...Tyral Hicks scene.. which brings these riveting stories to their anti climax..or climax if you may..is hidden away in fine print in the cast listing by billing......is there anyone who can help me source the DVD in NTSC format.
Papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm ... Download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them.
A curiosity of the late 60's (including footage of Paris in 69/70; also notable for the use of text within image which I actually quite liked), but a real disappointment for Miller fans, and a pretty bad movie overall.
Wait a minute -- the C word was also worked into a pun in "Hamlet," come to think of it.
But must a film produced to explore the dehumanizing aspects of slavery along with the attempts by the slaves to reclaim their humanity also be one that reconciles the image of the enslavers?
It also gives insight into the family unit among slaves, which may explain the black family today in America.
I recommend seeing it even if your friends say that its bad, i only rented it in the first place because it was all they had at Video Connection one lonely Friday night and i needed something to watch, and all of my friends, none of whom know what their talking about, trashed it never the less i found it beautiful, hilarious, and over-all an absolutely stunning work of art by Mr. Wes Anderson... also, if you saw it and liked it, you should check out the Royal Tenenbaums, also directed by Anderson, it is almost as good as the Life Aquatic.
this movie is just some scene taped together with no story line (at least i could find it) the leading male with a monologue that made no sense how you looked at it the comedy in the movie was one clichÃ© after another stuff we seen over a million times like white guy teaching black history(SEEN IT IN 'HOW HIGH')not funny and what is with the badly dubbed music scenes this a perfect example of go home and do it over also why is the leading male living in a crack house if hes loaded its a low budget movie there's no lieing in that but that doesn't mean that the movie it selve needs to be crap everything is cheap in this move including the script
Anna-Marie Horsford also makes a hilarious guest appearance as Mama Pearl.
The director does a great job of mixing the musical performances with the into the comedy storyline also.
The director also did a pretty good job.
The conflict in 'Torremolinos' is slightly reversed in that cinema becomes a more complex agent: it is the reason for misunderstanding, but it also unveils the problem and in the end even helps to resolve it.
Mr. Berger also wrote the screen play, that at times is mildly amusing by the situation he creates.
To sum this up: If you are not annoyed by ample nudity (I have to say this since IMDb is also accessed by... ahem... cultures not quite fond of nudity), you like witty (the Spanish way) humor and you are a bit of a Bergman-geek (does such an animal even exist???)
I also found myself seriously enjoying the director's X-rated version of an Ingmar Bergman film over the actual film it self.
I'd also love to have some of whatever they were smoking which made this movie so stellar for them.
The game was also full of great characters with all kinds of different personalities.
Not only are they fun and challenging (not too hard, though), but they also are filled with jokes!
The ending always makes me feel nostalgic also.
We also see Bill Murray at his best as well as a heart-warming performance by Owen Wilson, who I am not normally a fan of.
The script is also very well written and the story is so well put-together that even an attack by pirates or looting a large scientific institution seem plausible in a serious movie about an oceanographer!
The soundtrack, despite not being from the 1910s or 1920s, is also a great listen.
I also enjoy the music too.
Kudos, also, to Hillary Swank and company for all-around superb performances!
I didn't do an exhaustive search, but their story also felt contrived.
I would also advise rewinding it, and viewing it again, as my second time through was just as delightful and revealing as the first.
Appreciating a film like this requires not only the ability to appreciate and respect history, but also the ability to recognize the importance of sharing history with our children.
Angelica Houston was also a strong force in this movie as the venomous Ms. Catt.
It also has a modern soundtrack with great remixs by Sarah McLachlan, Mandalay and Lauren Hill.
His ability to contain himself while also giving us the emotional stress of being a first-time dad as well as loosing his best friend is Oscar worthy.
However, it certainly is an above average example of the giallo genre, with narrative that is better than most gialli and even has a terrific climax, but it's also certainly not a classic film in any respect.
The fairly complex structure and unexpected plot twists also always stay several steps ahead of you ... indeed, like a hard-to-solve puzzle.
He's lured to Italy, where he apparently also has a gorgeous wife, by a suspicious individual who repeatedly forces Edward to remember stuff.
"Puzzle" also isn't as gory as most contemporary Giallo, but nonetheless there are some noteworthy peaks of brutality (the slaughter of a harmless little dog) and massive bloodshed (chainsaw-finale, anyone?).
as the main character starts to remember more and more of his past), there are also some fairly violent scenes, e.g.
Apart from the convincing performance by Berger, Luc Merenda is also well casted in the title role, as is Umberto Orsini in the main supporting role.
The lush sound track is also very cool and adds to the viewing pleasure.
The film is also known as 'Man Without Memory', and that is down the fact that the central character, Peter, has lost his memory.
I also must say that the ending game was most likely NOT meant for kids.
I also thought it was very well-planned and made.
All of the levels in the game are also incredibly imaginative and fresh in gameplay ideas, whilst retaining a strong play structure in the scoring system and player objectives.
There are also a few ideas that that I don't believe fit into a Sonic game too well.
SA2 is also extremely difficult, and quite unforgiving at times.
I think it will just be one of those kinds of films (but hey, I also loved "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" which this reminded me of).
Murray gives an amazing, energetic, yet deadpan performance and I also liked the richness of the smaller roles like "Klaus."
Times Square is also one of the most remarkable rock 'n roll soundtrack movies ever made (artists include Patti Smith Group, Pretenders, Talking Heads and Roxy Music), and the soundtrack often provides romantic commentary on the developing relationship between the girls.
Robin Johnson, who deserves all the fine line written about her, is great, but Trini Alvarado is also good.
And yet it also swirled with a crackling, decadent energy.
And she's also placed in the hospital for a neurological evaluation, by her misguided social worker.
He's also supportive of Pammy and Nikki's quest to be free, and live life to the fullest.
Nikki and Pammy's friendship also evolves, as Nikki reveals how vulnerable she really is, under her tough exterior.
The soundtrack is also superb.
The performances were really good also.
The girl who played Pamela was also convincing, though not as good as her co-star Robin Johnson, who was easily the best actress in the movie.
Her hospital roommate is Nicky -- Johnson's character -- who is clearly disturbed; she is also exciting, electric and incredibly bold, and Pam is intensely attracted to her.
Although the movie -- through Curry's voice -- is very preachy about this, you also get to see for yourself the vitality and value of the filthy, un-cleaned-up streets.
There's also the story of the liberation of these two girls, which is over-done, and again seems designed to make other girls become adoring fans of the Sleez Sister message, but there's a core of real beauty to it.
The commercialization of the film also included dropping all obvious hints of a lesbian relationship between the two girls.
I can not begin to tell you what a horrible movie "Little Witches" is... but I also cannot tell you what a huge "crush" (I am censoring myself there) I had when watching Sheeri Rappaport.
Snuggly "B" starlet Jennifer Rubin("A Nightmare on Elm Street 3", "The Crush", "Screamers")plays a nun(yeah, right...)who is also the Guardian of the Book That Summons the Giant Evil Scaly 3-Mouthed Demon Thing, and also sports a nifty tattoo!
Heck, I usually love these actors, too, but I also can't lie and say it's one of their better films.
It's also fun to make fun of, MST3K-style.
Clea Duvall also has her moments and so does the rest of the cast but believe me, Ms. Rappaport is the reason to spend 90 minutes of your life.
one is that you'll notice the TV in his house flickers when his mind is not straight, and an obvious one is that the fish are his subconscious.I also think that the film is supposed to show how people crippled by there niceness and quietness stay at the bottom of the ladder in a corporate business and the people with legs to step on others, reach the top, and don't have to care about the lower people.
this is also seen by the cars going fast, i think this shows that he is being left behind going slower then everyone else because he has no charismatic qualities.
It is another film that had next to no release & also made next to no money.
It is also a good film and one might appreciate not only the script, but also Slater's wonderful performance.
Bob Maconel is your average working American citizen, unfortunately, he doesn't have the best looks, he lives alone(without the companionship of his talking gold fish), he's taken advantage of at work, and also has a huge crush on a beautiful co-worker, Venessa Parks who would never give him the time of day.
Someone beat him to it, Bob shoots the guy, making him look like a hero, he also sees Venessa on the floor and saves her life, but she unfortunately is paralyzed.
Various unpleasant modes of motivation are also explored in the screenplay via archetypal imagery and polarity.
I think that it would be interesting to listen to what other people thought of it, how they interpreted it, and also to listen to the naysayers of which there likely would be few.
It's funny, it's dramatic and it's also occasionally quite disturbing, but it is an example of all-around great, late-night fanfare that deserves more respect from the movie-going public.
Only here, we are not only presented with the dark and ugly side of it, but also the vulnerably romantic side as well.
There's also some rather humorous gay moments, particularly with an obviously gay hat seller who sells Power his own hat, and is then told by Power to throw the other one out.
The star, then, is supported by a most excellent cast: Angela Lansbury (a fine actress but a rather unlikely chanteuse), James Bell (a usurped town leader), Jean Parker (an ageing belle and the latter's wife), Wallace Ford (predictably in the role of the reliable town doctor), Ruth Donnelly (as Scott's gracious elderly housekeeper), Jeanette Nolan (as the wife of a revenge-seeking ex-con whom Scott has killed in self-defense), and an interesting trio of villains Â powerful boss Warner Anderson (who also fancies himself a ladies' man and, in fact, strikes up relationships with both Parker and Lansbury throughout), shifty but nervous gambler John Emery and smooth gunslinger Michael Pate (making for a worthy opponent to Scott).
The film also shows how different we all are and that the only way to be able to live together is to communicate openly and honestly.
A subsequent sting from a jellyfish while swimming also leaves Chris physically scarred, further bruising her ego.
You also see fighting spirit, surprises.
A broke American is forced to pose as a Russian prince in order to pay a gambling debt in "Cafe Metropole," a film written by the multi-talented Gregory Ratoff, who also plays a role in the movie.
I also want to know what it all means.
Shot on digital video it is also as much 'about' the process of creating, as opposed to 'making', a film as it is 'about' anything else and in the performances Lynch extracts from his cast, (and not just Dern), you could argue that it is also about the process of acting.
It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes "Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it.
The reason I say that is not purely because of the experience of watching the movie's chaos but also because of the process he went through.
"Axxon N." allusions were also a surprise.
That is also a stand-alone (though unproduced) series that has been completely written for quite some time.
We can also question the connections since David Lynch said he got a lot of the ideas separately and serendipitously and only after it had begun did he understand why his brain was giving him these ideas.
Then there is also the director, King-sley, shouting "Action!"
Her family reunion at the end may be also real and maybe her watching those movies on the screen is just a way to refuse to deal with real life problems, just as the girl from The Purple Rose...
Let me start by saying I've admired every single Lynch film to date, and I've seen all his feature filmsÂnot only all the original work, but also the non-auteur stuff (like "Elephant man," "Straight Story," and "Dune") as well.
The rabbit people are also wise, older Polish men and have a sÃ©ance with Lost Girl and they bring Smithy to talk to Lost Girl.
I think it's also the most bizarre film I have ever seen.
I am sure he would also understand and agree with my rebuttal - "Who cares, it's fun"   When fans either gush about the brilliance of a piece of work or resort to name-calling ("pretentious hipsters??
It's vague, bizarre, jumps all over the place, and at times is deeply frightening (one of the few films in a long time to actually give me nightmares), but in my opinion it's also truly beautiful, almost serene.
And I want to underline also the interpretation of Laura Dern.
You can't pretend to understand completely the story (it's more confused than Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive...) but you'll be captured by the sounds, the lights, the changes of rhythm... David has written the screenplay day by day and also the actors couldn't understand what they were doing...
Inland Empire: it means Los Angeles, the place of Lynch's inspiration, but also the inward realm of the mind and of dreams, the surreal world of Lynch's imagination that uniquely inspires his visual poems.
After becoming the desperate monologist, Dern also became "Nikki," a movie star chosen with "Devon" (Justin Theroux) to star in a film, 'On High in Blue Tomorrows', directed by "Kingsley" (Jeremy Irons).
While this film does feel like a retread of Mulholland Dr. it also stands on its own especially since it contains a much more upbeat ending and perhaps four layers of storytelling,good luck figuring out which is which.
He also continues to experiment with sound and even sings the vocals to a song in the film.
This film also has much in common with Eraserhead in that he's completely free to explore his ideas.
I also implore you to see it IN THE CINEMA.
It is also one of the self- referential moments of the film that explores the audiences very thoughts while providing some comic relief.
It lose some of the cinematic flourish of film, but also brings a more realistic, gritty feel to it that is appropriate for the theme.
He also uses many close shots, and as always, obscure framing allowing ambiguity and confusion.
The film is also very self-conscious as I said before, and also makes many subtle (and not so) pokes at the audience.
It also has some truly surreal moments of Lynch humor.
It is also a comedy that doesn't miss a beat.
Some of the jokes are very funny and it's also great to see Gloria Stuart.
There's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people.
I am also delighted to hear that it was released on DVD a couple of years ago, and I am eager to check it out.
O'toole also coaches Baker on getting the girl of his dreams, played by Jessica Harper.
But there's also an element of sadness in it as well.
I knew someone like that in my life, one who hardly had any kind of a career, but also HAD to be the center of attention at all times and usually did it by getting riotously drunk and acting abominably dumb.
This film also show the side of the entertainment history we don't see, Swann (O'Toole ) confesses that his entire "persona" is a fabrication of the studios, and show his own insecurities.
He also, on one occasion, planned to have Errol Flynn appear as a guest.
But he is also genuinely timid about one creature: the little daughter he barely knows who lives in Connecticut.
We also have some fine music from a tuba, a harp and a concertina.
It is also the debut film of former Spike Lee cinematographer Ernest Dickerson.
There is also a great supporting cast of young actors including Samuel L. Jackson when he was still known as Sam Jackson.
I Had seen the great Rupert on a religious channel that has been showing all the great Christmas movies like scrooge,and the bishops wife.and i loved it.its somewhat a Christmas movie about a family led by the great Jimmy Durante.and a squirrel named Rupert that shares the same household.the great Rupert also stars the dazzling and beautiful; Terry Moore(mighty Joe young)who i think looks great in this movie,playing jimmy Durante's daughter.if you like sentimental comedies,you will love the great Rupert.i totally recommend it.if you spot it on DVD buy it.i hate myself for passing it up as a dollar movie a while back,but i see it again I'm grabbing it.although I'm not sure its a public domain movie,its well worth repeated viewings,I'm not giving away the plot.no spoilers here.all i can say is watch it,you will love it.and its the first movie produced by the late great George Pal.10 out of 10.
If you have not yet gone over to DVD, be aware that this film is also available on VHS.
But I've also learned something throughout the years.
Any ways, a group of kids go off and get killed, one gets impregnated and later in the mortician's office gives birth (Apparently in addition to having a mortician's license, he's also qualified to deliver a baby) to a monster that looks like a cross between the Fiji Mermaid and a carrot.
A great movie, and if you liked this I also recommend films like "Rodentz", "Puppet Master vs.
Demonic Toys" and "The Creeping Terror", which are also flawlessly excellent cinematic masterpieces.
Not even kidding, the aspect ratio of the film is bad, so the screen contorts not only the video, but also your retina.
Now, i have been watching B-movie horrors for sometime now and this film is by far the worst one i have ever watched but also the best.
There is also a scene where several characters discuss their favourite watery monster movies, mentioning Deep Star Six, Leviathan, Tentacles, Alligator 2 and Roger Corman in the process.
the story itself is also very well constructed, full of compelling characters, some suspense and a great ending.
If you've enjoyed Tokyo Godfathers, then you will also like this movie.
is desperately looking for Romeo, because of his activities, and also intelligence reports gathered by them, speak about a possibility of an organization hiring the services of Romeo to assassinate the President of the United States of America!!!
I also like the 'No If!
The film also has its thrills and fun scenes, although the climax could have been better, but the boat chase in the Everglades was brilliant.
oh yes in Bollywood we have many but this is one of the worst films ever made  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined with stupid scenes like Sunny going towards the heroine and his mom Sikri getting fits in India  Even the skin show is forced and then the game of Sunny to play Behaal Singh is worst and even Romeo comes across as a stupid idiot   The film makes no sense and is a example of mediocrity  There are several scenes which are so stupid and also the entire track of the FBI suddenly wanting to kill the president is awful and so is the finale  Direction by Rahul Rawail is terrible, it makes even YODHA look a classic Music is bad  Sunny Deol is himself, funny in some comic scenes and over the top in some and too loud in several portions but he manages to lend some credibility to his character- 6/10 The girls Shilpi Mudgal and Nupur Mehta are bad Kamaal Khan is a joke as the main villain  Arun Bakshi is okay,   Surekha Sikri is hilarious
also i did not like how little of the actual djing was involved in the movie.
This is one of those bad movies that contains moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity but also is hindered by atrocious pacing.
Now, we watch DEATH BY DIALOGUE, also from 1988 and a vehicle for the then red-hot Ken Sagoes, which by comparison is *ALL* charisma.
It was also good for it's morals as well.
Though the magic system is unique (you can create your own spells), it also has a few flaws in it.
But it's also, apart from some weaknesses, a great piece of suspense.
The various characters and the actors who played them are also worth mentioning.
Jane Wyman does a great job as Eve Gill, and also as Doris, the housemaid she pretends to be.
It is also False Flashback that is responsible for some of the major events in the film like Alastair Sim (Commodore Gill) putting the blood on the doll to frighten Charlotte (Marlene Dietrich).
Wyman is also assisted by a police officer ("Ordinary" Smith) and her parents, one of whom is played by the wonderful Alistair Sim, not long before he played "Scrooge" in a Christmas Carol.
The Master himself also puts in one of his famous cameos in this, as usual.
It also brought him back to Britain for a very old-fashioned comedy-thriller that wouldn't have looked out of place among his thirties' thrillers.
It's also the one with the twist that turns out to be Hitchcock 'cheating' or, shall we say, breaking the rules and detractors of the movie haven't forgiven for it.
There is also no flab in the movie whatsoever; it kicks off with a murder and subsequently develops into a good old chase yarn.
So, not only was it enjoyable - I it was also rather educational.
It also have the misfortune of being released while he was in his prime, so it comes off archaic for the master.
I also thought Stage Fright contained quite a bit more of Hitchcock's dark sense of humor (note the bar and shooting gallery scenes, and Marlene Dietrich's comments while trying on her funeral gown).
Hitch consistently made films that were not only as entertaining as a film can possibly get, but also films that were extraordinarily intellectual and human.
Hitch was also the most prolific film artist of all time.
I don't think that it was an enormous failure, but it was also not an enormous success.
Truffaut also derides it for being a whodunit, which Hitch did not like.
The actors in Stage Fright are also superb.
She also "switches horses in midstream," where she begins to doubt her relationship with the man whom she is helping and to fall for a detective on the murder case simultaneously.
Micheal Wilding, playing the detective who is falling for Wyman, is also great, especially when he finds that she is betraying him and may have only been using him.
Dietrich also, in her closing moments on the screen, shows a bitterness and hatred that I don't think she ever showed in any other film role.
Managing also to string along Michael Wilding, as the ubercool Inspector "Ordinary" Smith, she might sound like some cold calculating wench who uses up people like Marlene goes through hats.
The performances here are all excellent especially Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich as Charlotte Inwood, perhaps the laziest girl in town but also the most flamboyant.
The secondary characters are also in fine form and make memorable impressions that adds to the enjoyment factor of this film.
Not only is it "Hitchcocky" and suspenseful, it is also humorous and touching.
The action was also terrible, the Irishman kills by throwing knives and never actually confronts his enemies.
It was also unrealistic.
The whole story takes place in 900's, so Iceland is still a heathen country, god Thor is frequently mentioned and his one-eyed figure is also often addressed to by several characters.
Dickerson also chooses to avoid the obvious route expected in these kinds of films and delivers a sad, somber ending.
If this is up your alley, I also suggest Bill Duke's equally powerful "Deep Cover" (also from 1992).
That's also because one of the strong points of the film is the cast, there's a great chemistry between the main actors and they are able to transport a lot not only by words, but also by gestures and looks.
also had a minor, yet unforgettable, role in anthony minghella's 'the english patient', in the interrogation scene with willem dafoe.
Sebastian Schipper has made a beautiful but also very real film with wonderful actors and great music by The Notwist.
Plus a fantastic soundtrack which adds a lot to the movie: lots of electronic music, some rock, fast, pumping, but also minimal in the lonely moments of the story.
It begins fervently, excitingly, but as events go awry and daylight slowly inches over the horizon, the crushing reality of what is to follow sets in for the trio, who along the way also pick up their next door neighbour, the gorgeous but self destructive Tesla.
It's also a testament to the abilities of the actors playing these parts that you feel greatly for their pasts, presents, and especially futures.
For many who only think of Richard Lester as the maker of The Beatles movie, "Petulia" is one of several titles of his making that ask for a reconsideration of his work, which also includes very enjoyable period comedies as "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", "Robin and Marian", "The Three Musketeers" and "The Four Musketeers".
I remembered the gift of the Tuba, the hospital staff trying to explain the 'dummy teevee' procurement procedure, and of course, George C. Scott making his way into not only a 'Big Brother and the Holding Company' concert, but also a 'Grateful Dead' show.
Lester's use of flashbacks and forewards is a little confusing at first, but it's also a vital element in what makes this film so worthwhile.
Maybe someone will do a Lester retrospective (he also did the Beatles' first films)so that this masterpiece can finally find the audience it deserves.
Christie was so young and Scott was also still quite young as well.
The film is also considered important as one of the first to use a vertical wipe, in this case creating a cartoon-like effect, as Mary Jane nudges the audience as she holds a can with 'PARAFFIN' written in huge letters (a joke borrowed by Beckett over fifty years later in his 'Act Without Words').
It is also a fascinating insight into the "press industry" itself.
"Simpsons" staple Dan Castellaneta also chips in aptly as a mentor at work of sorts.
However, it also portrays the conditions and day-to-day struggle that the poor have to undergo, making you question equality in todays society.
Special praise should also be reserved for Will's own son Jaden, who plays Christopher Gardner Jnr.
I'm also a Tupac fan and I can honestly say when I first saw this movie..
The best drama movie of 2006, so sincere, real, intense, inspiring but at the same time challenging you to participate in the movie, you are being dragged into the movie, in the end it will not only bring happiness to your face and heart, but it will also make you a better person or at least highlight the great parts you have in your character.
His son also did a fantastic job.
It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.
I'll also admit that the film doesn't start off terribly well.
There is also a scene where someone runs up a tree against gravity.
Writer/director Harry Essex, who also wrote the scripts for the classic 50's fright features "It Came from Outer Space" and "The Creature from the Black Lagoon," pukes forth a 50's style micro-budget clunker that boasts all the necessary bad movie vices to qualify as a real four-star stinker: the flat acting from a lame no-name cast (flash-in-the-pan 70's drive-in flick starlet Maria De Aragon in particular just takes up space as fetching love interest heroine Jeanne), sluggish pacing, ragged editing, rough, grainy cinematography by Robert Caramico, meandering narrative, a roaring, overwrought score by Robert Freeman, several ludicrous touches (the fireball stalks people before it kills them!
Don't worry about being converted or anything, this is an open-ended movie with morals, granted, but also with that special touch of human bonding, and what it means to love others.
Right in the middle of the party, when the flashbulbs are popping, a guy also gets popped.
The film's main score is also memorable.
this movie is quite a bit different than 1993's Tombstone.obviously it focuses on Wyatt Earp,more than anything.this movie paints quite a different picture of Earp than Tombstone does.it depicts him in a much different light.Kevin Costner's portrayal of Earp is much different than Kurt Russel's in Tombstone.i think i liked Russel's portrayal a bit more.Dennis Quaid portrays Doc Holliday,and his portrayal is much different than Val Kilmer's in Tombstone.i actually liked Val Kilmer's performance better,and i liked his character more.Quaid does a good job though.the supporting cast is also very good.another big difference between this movie and Tombstone,is that this movie is very deliberately paced,and more in depth.the story is much deeper.there is not that much action,and some may be turned of by the length of the movie at over 3hrs.but if you can view it as character study,you might enjoy it.one thing i really liked rising the musical score.i found it very rousing and poetic.for me,Wyatt Earp is a 7/10
I also like the "arms contractor", a Dutchman natch but certainly a metaphor for (white) South African mercenaries along with his servile sellout native sidekick.
I would also like to say that i dont' see any of you people who criticize this guy so much makin movies.
With that said i would also like to say that i love Tombstone, and bought it right after i saw it the first time.
Then also in the list of comments for this movie is some total moron who said Quaid is at his worst on this movie.
And you also get other non-Hollywood visions of the West, such as scenes with buffalo being slaughtered and skinned.
Wyatt Earp himself is portrayed as a very powerful individual who, while fighting on the side of the law, could also be cold-hearted, cruel, and excessively violent at times.
Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman Etal made me feel that their movie was closer to history and also brought pride in their perceived honor.
The movie brings not only the story of the life and times of Wyatt Earp, but also in showing you the events that led up to the beginning of the end of the Wild West.
It shows Wyatt Earp (Razzie winning Kevin Costner, also producing) growing up on the corn farm with his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) and brothers Virgil (Michael Madsen), James (David Andrews) and Morgan (Linden Ashby).
It is also quite lovely.
The women playing the Earp wives, Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams, Mare Winningham, and Betty Buckley, were also very effective.
To be fair, it also shows his good traits.
It also has a terrific, deep cast and features a good mix of drama, romance and action.
K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never namedÂ "Frontier Marshal" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and "Wichita" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the storyÂ   To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's "My Darling Clementine" (1946), John Sturges' "Gunfight at the O.K.
I also admit that it is not the shoot 'em up Tombstone is, but this film is a far greater one, a character study of a man whose innocence is laid to rest by the harsh wilderness of both the American West and human nature.
He's also looking for a job to help his family as he begins to now work for a drug dealer with a gang if he can get them the money he owes them until one day he finally snaps and gets revenge even on his wife and kid.
A disturbing, bleak and interesting action drama that feels as a mix of both genres which is also a character study in it and it's one of the more serious "Troma" distributed flicks, it's also a interesting movie as well.
The plot also starts of well.
And I also enjoy low-budget ones too.
Movies like The Shining and Taxi Driver were also made in the 70's and they still look great.
This was also the first serious Troma-film I've ever seen (maybe the only one there is, I don't know?).
To me the ending was also a bit of a disappointment.
Frankie has no job or money to support his family and he also owes money to the local drug lords, Frankie is in a bad way for sure!!
or maybe they were looking for at least 1 movie so that they could say "hey, we are also producing serious flicks!!"
He's also having a hard time adjusting to civilian life.
They can also bear witness to the life that surprisingly many Viet-Nam era veterans lived with when  their tour of duty and time with the military was completed.
There are also roles for the likes of Telly Savalas, Roddy McDowall and Angie Dickinson.
And it's all thanks to that French horndog, director Roger Vadim, who was also the guy who convinced his then-wife Jane Fonda engage in three-somes with him and another woman.
He discovers the nude body in the boy's washroom.Â After discovering the body we are introduced to the detective assigned to the case as well as an amoral guidance counselor named Tiger (played by Rock Hudson) who also happens to be sleeping with his students in his office.Â  The investigation goes and we discover that the murdered girls happened to be sleeping with Tiger.Â Despite of all the heat pressure placed on him, Tiger doesn't seem worried that he'll get caught.
Not only does she get felt up by Hudson, she also enthusiastically deflowers the gawky teenage male virgin after extolling the virtues of John Milton's "Paradise Lost."
You can also groove to the opening song by the Osmonds, "Chilly Wind," which happens to be sung over Rock Hudson getting it on with a topless honey.
The phantom also confronts Ken and threatens him.
There is also some great support by Spanish bit players (the Spanish sounds at times a bit shaky, though Â but what else can you expect in Cardiff?).
The Last Seduction II may also be pleasant to watch for feminists.
Bridget also schemes to route some of Troy's phone-sex line business profits into her bank account, with the help of a friend in London named Simon.
So I don't feel the filmmakers were being blasphemous by making this cheap, direct-to-TV sequel (the original also started out direct-to-TV, but later was released in theaters).
It is also, as others have pointed out, insulting to the British.
Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.
I also agree that "Tammy" is and looks like a dork.
In the movie it also makes a point that no matter what you are you can do anything.
I'm probably forgetting something, but that's 10 big plot issues to be dealt with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that's both not too complicated--this is a kids' film, after all--and that's also humorous and heartwarming.
I did know McDowell from the Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man that also had been released theatrically in Moscow several years prior The Passage.
We also have to put up with a lesbian whining to her girlfriend " Why can't I give you a baby ? "
I was also puzzled how anyone who looks like Sharon Stone has a problem finding sperm   Not as bad as it could of been but as someone who thinks HBO is the most outstanding TV company in America I think they should concentrate on dramas featuring gangsters and maximum security prisons
But it also showed what problems lesbians have, if they want to have children in a sensible way!
All in all it is a great movie, not only for lesbians... but also for people who want to understand the mysterious creature... the lesbian!
You should see it, gay or not, because what matters in this world is also: love!
The "2000" part was good also but the script wasn't as good as the first two.
I ended up enjoying/appreciating this one the most, surprisingly also a film directed by Dolph himself.
It also contains an almost pornographic sex sequence.
The last one is sporadically funny, however it also lacks a clear point and only shows scene from today's gay life.
This movie is a highlight in US-TV and it would be my wish that some day we will see this one also in German TV.
There are also no long man on man fights.
It may also anger you, as it did me!
Ellen is such a funny and amazing actress and Sharon Stone is excellent, also.
It shows Anakin and Padme's romance in ways that Lucas couldn't get across, it allows us to see Anakin become a Jedi Knight, and it gives some great insight into not only the prequel trilogy but also the classic one.
Though it allows itself to explore darker elements in the story, it also has moments of inspired lunacy that will make the most reluctant adult viewer giddy and hysterical.
I also thought that the battle between Anakin and Ventress was amazing and really exciting to watch.
History and lineage, albeit par for the course in pleasing the "geeks" with Star Wars, is also paid good attention to, creating some cool new characters (a dastard apprentice of the Sith as one of Anakin's fiercest foes also makes a mark of character development), and some recognizable ones (General Grievous's story is a little amusing and also even more dangerous than seen in the third film).
I also enjoyed the lightsaber duels in this series, particularly the one between Anakin and Asajj Ventress.
Clone Wars, also labeled as an Expanded Universe, otherwise proves the other way round.
In addition to its role as a bridge between Episodes II and III, the Microseries also visually succeeds in enlarging the scope of this universal war only mentioned briefly in Episode IV: A New Hope.
However it also qualifies as a good comedy for another reason: it's genuinely funny.
The dialog is also quite good.
Similarly to my fellow citizen, I also find it rather peculiar, that out of six comments on this film, four (and from now on five) have been written by Hungarians.
It is also strange to see, that the other two reviewers (from Germany) claim that this movie is rubbish.
So should someone from France, who also has seen the film read these lines, please impart your impressions.
None of these statements can be true, and I also find it impossible that there could be such a large cultural difference between the two nations.
The seductive sexy tone of AlmÃ¡si Ãva accompanying the acting of Marie LaforÄt is beyond comprehension, and the young GÃ¶tz Anna is also charming as the young Sophie Marceau.
He is very good in drama, in action, and also in comedy.
I also hope they port Vice City Stories to PS2 at some point, even if its not for a year like with LCS.
John Turturro as the Phantom is also very good, Emmanuelle Chriqui with a decent performance as a sweet Palestinian girl who owns a beauty saloon and a brief but convincing appearance by Chris Rock as a Jamaican cab driver.
I've never been much of a Lundgren fan, with my preferred viewing being Norris and Seagal, with also Van Damme too.
But to my surprise, during a DTV rampage of these guys (The Hard Corps, Shadow Man and also the Cutter too) Dolph's film the Mechanik was by a long, long, way the best of the bunch.
I also understand it was shot on a fraciton of the budgets of Chuck's, Stevens and Jean Claudes, movies and still manages to look the most expensive too.
I also wasn't too sure what was with all the dissolves either, but on the most part this film is directed with assurance and a great sense of pace, and of course directed by Dolph himself!
He also meets Michael, a guy who eventually becomes his friend and offers Zohan his house to stay for sometime.
Apparently, he is also a superhero like Zohan.
If you walked into this theater expecting to see Happy Gilmore then again let me remind you that you can actually buy Happy Gilmore on DVD and also there is a rock at home for your face.
Although I found myself laughing at quite a few parts (particularly when the Zohan was on the job as a soldier), there were also a lot of parts where I was thinking to myself "Come on.
In regards to the acting, Lundgren also did a good job.
And this one also has Carol Lynley and Anne Lockhart in it (though practically as extras).
Michael Moriarity is also not given sufficient opportunity to shine in this movie either.
Cheryl Ladd is one of the most beautiful women in the business, and a terrific actress, Ken Wahl is also a very strong character and the combat scenes are fantastic.
I also noticed that R. Lee Ermey is in this movie playing his best character a Marine Gunnery Sargent.
The dialogue is also engaging.
The remainder of the cast are also excellent.
Real class is also added by Ben Cross.
The noise that the ghost makes (sounding something like a kid doing an impression of a frog) is creepy at first, but it's also massively overused and soon becomes old - though it may well have been an inspiration to the noise that the ghost in 'The Grudge' makes.
There's also that stupid joking black guy who serves absolutely no purpose (except getting killed).
For example, there was Mr Spoon with spoons for arms, and there was also broom sticks for trees.
The acting was also a bit uneven and the dubbing of the actors poor.
The ending also felt rushed.
The acting was alright, and I did enjoy the story, sure there were a couple predictable moments but there was also a few surprises thrown in with a bunch of very creepy/eerie moments, which include a freaky looking Clown doll.
This movie did manage to create an eerie atmosphere which also helped it out.
The little girl and her doll are also very creepy, but I think the main winner in this film is the weird carnival music that makes it stand out from all other films.
It has that nasty Italian feel to it, but also plenty of cheesy fun.
I expected this film to be nothing more than your very average 80s horror flick but it was much more.Admittedly the acting was well below par but the shocks certainly weren't.Any film encorporating clowns in my opinion can't help but be sinister there was no exception here the clown was terrificly scary,and the little girl dressed in white just added to it.The film also boasted some rather gruesome deaths especially the guillotine!This movie certainly surpassed its expectations.Deserves to be seen.
The final prophecy (as it starts to unfold) creates suspense but also became a little bit silly, as the identities of the "whisperers" was revealed.
I also thought that if the aliens/angels had taken that much trouble to make sure that the human race would continue elsewhere, they would not have just dumped these kids somewhere on their own and left them to their own devices, free to make all the same horrendous mistakes we humans seem to be all too proficient at.
awww, damn - it's aliens"), but also thought provoking and disturbing.
He has also given me quite a few that I loved (Dark City and The Crow would be my top picks).
I was also left a little cold by the sci-fi trappings that were inserted near the very end of the movie, feeling almost disappointed and wishing there had been some other, equally mysterious and impressive, way to resolve things.
It also means knowing that Nick Cage is going to lay an egg and paying nine bucks to watch it happen anyway.
They also do not just happily accept being taken by aliens to a strange new world; they do not happily accept not only the deaths of their families and friends (assuming friends are not of the 'chosen') but also the death - apparently - of even their planet.
This movie is worth a 10 because it can show that sometimes no matter what you have to do what is right for you and not the rest of the world.It also shows that if you get caught crying sometimes that it is not always a sign of weakness, sometimes it is a sign that you have just had enough!
The second scene is slightly less poignant, but also shows the unspoken understanding between good people.
Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day.
I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante.
I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia).
Director Allison Anders, who also adapted the screenplay, does hit an awkward snag or two in exploring these characters' emotions, but her feel for Nowhere U.S.A. is rich with complexity.
This film is in my top ten favorites of all time, and also my twin has similar affinity for this superb film.
Ione's brother, Donovan Leitch, also appears in this film, but it is Fairuza Balk as the younger teenager, who is outstanding.
It had some flirtatiousness, and was also a love story.
Soderbergh also held back a lot of the talking-to-himself passages and the hunting-for-the-daughter bus station sequence -- which are so grueling and disturbing -- until later, so we aren't too heavily hit too soon with Keane's severe mental problems.
In grim realism 'Keane' is comparable to Debra Granik's melancholy but convincing 'Down to the Bone' (also shown in NYC in late 2005).
This film as some have noted is not only a very specific account of a possibly schizophrenic man, but also a study of urban angst, a depiction of how crazy-making urban spaces can become for every person who approaches them without armor.Michael Atkinson's statement about this is perhaps a bit too sweeping Â- "Keane" (he says) "is a painfully specific figure but at the same time a totem, lean and frightening, for a morass of modern anxieties" Â- but the borderline between Keane and us does indeed at times become hauntingly blurred.
Luckily, Kerrigan has not just aped a technique, but has also tapped into the same kind of sympathetic, humanistic observation of behavior and optimism about the human race that the Dardennes bring to their stories.
My Lovely Wife has worked as a nurse's aide in a psych ward of a big city hospital also confirms the truthfulness of Lewis' work.
I also think little Abigail Beslin (Kira Bedik) did an excellent job as being able to play the scenes so convincingly, especially the Skeeball scene.
His latest shares similarities with "Clean, Shaven" in that it is also about a mentally ill man (Damian Lewis) searching for a missing daughter.
We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
The only other film, in recent years, that also succeeded in recreating the real world, was 'Rosetta,' a French film that won the Palme D'Or a few years back.
in this film, you can also see sesshoumaru realizing he does care for someone (albeit trying hard to maintain his aloofness and denying it).
it's also surprising in one of the battle scenes that he took the hit for inuyasha - showing he does not really HATE inuyasha that much.
The music by Kaoru Wada also keeps getting better.
"Swords of an Honorable Ruler" is also packed with powerful, moving scenes.
"Four Seasons" at the end was also a very nice treat.
Tenka no Hadou Ken is particularly interesting because not only does it give us a glimpse of Inuyasha's father, it also provides a peek at the inner workings of his brother Sesshoumaru, one of the series' more inscrutable characters.
The movie also contains all the ingredients that make the series what it is: the semi-mythological setting and most of the regular cast of characters, whose interaction is as layered and satisfying as ever.
Based on a Philip K. Dick novel (his works have also inspired the films "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall"), this is better than your run-of-the-mill, filmed-in-Canada B-movie.
After the end-credits rolled on my TV I was quite blown away, but also started asking questions to the last 10 minutes of the movie...
6) You may also feel the worst person on earth, just for having seen the first twenty minutes.
But his best-est friend is a fem,ale and a knockout (Monk) who also happens to be a former girlfriend.
If your a gang of 12-14 year olds, you possibly might like this movie, or if you wait for the DVD and have a family sit around and need something to watch, it also might appeal.
I was also under the impression that the "I'll have what he's having" joke had run its course, but the writers of "Date Movie" have proved that no joke is too old or tired for them.
The film also contains tons of gross out humor, with a man coughing up a hairball, a woman with a hairy back, and a cat humping a corpse.
The cast is not extra ordinary, which makes it also feel so fun to watch, but nevertheless, the cast is still great, though the character of Billy wasn't the best they could have chosen, but like I said, that's part of the fun of it all.
I of course identified with them because I myself was also bored with the material.
I think what also struck me is how impressive the production design was.
But the planet earth has also split into various corporations instead of nations who are fighting for control of those asteroids.
I also didn't enjoy how vapid most of the female characters were, or the idea that anybody and everybody would fall into bed with such a sleazebucket.
And who would also forget the bad results when the three very important rules (1.
Never once considering that marrying a shrike whom you will eventually lose interest in will also leave you lonely.
In one memorable sequence, they are also connected with the urban legend of pets being blown up in microwaves- this movie definitely struck a chord by borrowing from popular mythology.
We also get characters that we don't care about.
There is also no real romance here either.
A little note: Christa B. Allen who plays teenage Jenna, also starred in 13 going on 30(2004), in which she also played a teenage version of Jennifer Garner character.
The main actors also impressed and I was drawn into their romance as the film went on.
The locations are very beautiful and the director, Rex Piano (who also directed another good movie, Blind Injustice), did a nice job, especially in capturing some great visuals.
It also explained some of the usually unmentioned treatment of prisoners of war at the hands of the Japanese.
If you like *REAL* scifi's, like this one, then also see the movie version of "Lost in Space."
The finale itself also turned out to be fairy anti-climactic.
The Cinematrography is also of a high standard.
This movie even spawned a sequel "Gremlins 2: The New Batch", which is also filmed by Joe Dante, it is great as well, but it isn't as good as it's predecessor.
Plus, there's no question he's the best actor amongst them all too - instead of a martial-artist who has turned to acting, he is an actor who just also happens to be a martial-artist.
Made by much the same crew as the excellent Mission of Justice (also starring Wincott) and also sharing that films great fight-choreographer Jeff Pruitt, Martial Outlaw tells the story of two brothers, both cops.
On the storyline front, the film also delivers.
Gary Hudson, while not too impressive in the fight scenes (at least where kicking was involved) also impressed me in his role as a man whose greed has led him down a dark path but who, deep in his heart, is still a good person.
On the other hand, Ming Ming's friend Ah Tu (Tony Yang) is also infatuated with her, and chances upon Nana (Zhou Xun in her second role), with whom he brings along in their escape from Brother Cat's thugs, and whom too is also in love with D. Confused?
The filming style used is also a mixed bag, with repetitions, quick cuts and flashbacks the norm.
It's also proof positive that first impressions can be deceiving, so please, don't despair, stick with it and you will be rewarded.
And also, you could hear the wind blow past you as you swing faster in the second game.
This same choppiness also prevents Spider-Man from using his incredibly limited repertoire of attacks effectively, since any attack activates about 2-3 seconds after the corresponding button has been pressed.
In Spider-Man 2, also for the PS2, the game-play was so good.
i was expecting this to be one of my favorite games ever because ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 games are my favorite games ever but this isn't huge let down its just conclusion of the game is bad if you seen the film harry dies he also dies in the game but when its all over they completely forgot about that and story mode is short to atleaset on the ps2 version but swinging around new york is just pure fun so is story mode but its disappointing that it is so short and playing has black suit is fun but its to bad you cant after you beat the game.
Like the previous movie games, this one is also based off the motion picture film and depicts Spider-Man bonding with a dark entity that changes his entire persona and life to a great evil.
Sandman's transformation in the game is also a rip-off as we see it in a mere 3 seconds in the opening credits.
It is also really cool that it was made by a group of students for next to nothing.
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
Michael Winslow, the vocal sound effects guy from the "Police Academy" movies, was also one of the vocal effects artists here.
I also hope he stays in horror and doesn't lose his edge, because there are far too few consistent directors in the genre.
There is also a lot of disgusting slime.
The movie also gives brief biographies of each character, but this becomes redundant after the first 3-4 and by the time they are all done, you're wondering why they did so many.
It's very funny also and never takes itself too seriously which helps the movie in the long run.
It was also really funny, and the way the movie plays with character stereotypes had me guessing as to which character was going to get it next.
Lang also gets excellent work out of his editor, Daniel Mandell, who helps Lang to juxtapose images in a suggestive way, e.g.
"You Only Live Once" not only looks at the flaws in our criminal justice system, but also shows hope amid desperation.
I also thought the running gag with Dave, the weird Weather Guy, was priceless.
The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character.
This is also heightened at times just before a crucial moment when the film halts and a message appears to warn you about the following scenes, very effective.
On the downside the aliens aren't particular scary and remind me of the ones in scary movie 3, and also the so called experts are pretty wooden.
The group also retreat outside and are followed.
The actors also are very convincing because they do not take turns to talk but argue and debate over each other.
But I'll still give it a 2 out of 10, one, for making me laugh, and one also for the mum, for dealing with an alien invasion by getting completely blotto.
These monsters are scary to be sure, but also very funny with some of the antics they provide.
"Gremlins" was also imitated many times shortly afterwards.
The little girl was also annoying always trying to get to the 'aliens' (who looked more human than aliens really) and betraying the family by removing the shotgun shells from the shotgun.
I also liked the way they had segments which cut away from the movie with people commenting on the footage..
"Last Resort" also features Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, John Ashton ("Beverly Hills Cop" and "Midnight Run"), Megan Mullally ("Will and Grace") and Mario van Peebles, and picking them out in these early roles is an added bonus.
George and his wife smoke some pot, his wife also takes some hallucinogenic mushrooms, a few women take their tops off and everything culminates in a massive shootout with some rebel guerrillas...or something.
The complex relationship between Hogan and his unhappy wife is also misrepresented badly.
Not only is this a personal tragedy for him, but he's also responsible for sealing the coffin on an entire species.
Marquis' good-looking fiancÃ© Robert Kellard (as Drake Hamilton) also arrives.
In this film from actor-directors Alex Harz and Tom Kennedy, while it also features a central character with an anger management problem (West, played by Kennedy), the charmed circle is extended to include a companion: Arthur (Harz), an amiable 'retard', as well as in turn his inanimate, if beloved companion, the inflatable sex doll Nancy.
also begins on an enigmatic shot which presages the final tragedy.
West's history is also the reason, we suspect, why he takes the exploited Arthur so readily under his wing, and it leads to one notable fantasy sequence where West instructs a line of bikers just how to put the world to rights.
Just like the aliens on Arthur's wall (the blank, abductor faces of which recall that of Nancy's permanently open-mouthed latex charms) Arthur and West are, in their way, also strange beings in a hostile world.
one of the funniest, pseudo-realistic depictions of our nation's outcasts, but it also brings out a bizarre fear of not dealing with this element of our population closer to home.
Question Mark is also one of most interesting and original movies I've ever seen.
I found this movie to be very interesting and also very saddening.
Definitely recommended to all Seinfeld fans and I believe that many others will also be entertained.
If you liked this and the Seinfeld series I would also recommend Jerry Seinfeld's book "SeinLanguage".
it was also bitingly funny.
there were so many interesting themes... characters who desired something deeply, then regretted it once it was theirs... pathetic self-defeating behaviors... sex and the pursuit of it... trying to be 'real' vs. living behind a facade...  i also *loved* the music...Hideous Input, I think did most the songs?
The backgrounds, like the people, are also a combination of digital images and animation.
However, once there it just gets weirder and weirder but you also find yourself transfixed because of the unusual story and animation.
That's also the reason why he throughout his career played characters who were much older than him, as was also the case in this movie, in which he plays an ex-Nazi, who gets uncovered by his employee and therefor kills him.
The movie also features some good interaction between the Peter Falk and Jack Cassidy characters.
Besides those two, the movie also features Robert Loggia, before his days of fame.
It was released two years after Richardson had died and it also features that other classical acting knight, Sir John Gielgud as well.
'Rentaghost' was a children's comedy series by Bob Block, who also wrote the equally bizarre 'Pardon My Genie' and 'Robert's Robots'.
The Spider-Man version also featured in MMA was cruel,but you could laugh.This one is 3 times more cruel,and completely unfunny.The writers should be thinking:"Oh,let's parody Lord of the Rings,with the worst kind of comedy and make people laugh".It didn't work with me.
If so you will like this - although it would also help to have seen the original LOTR film.
The performances by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar were also funny in contrast to the seriousness of the other actors.
He also has fragments of his past beliefs that show up.
Then again, if you were to let the show be about any sort of murders, on any place they might also be tempted to go over the top.
I also like Ducky and Abby, who are so strange and funny !
First there's Gibbs the boss played by Mark Harmon, Gibbs is a great character he is serious when it comes to the job but he also has a humour side to him that works well with other characters.
Gibbs left then came back (as we knew he would), Agent Lee also joined the team very briefly and does make occasional appearances due to her romance (if you wanna call it that) with Jimmy Palmer.
Another great season from beginning to end, which seen the end of the Frog and also the end Tony's romance with Jeann.
Some good stories throughout the series and what a great ending, Jenny Shepheard killed off not sure if she wanted to go or the producers decided to get rid of the character, the ending also see's the disbanding of the team Ziva goes home, Mcgee goes to the cyber crime unit, Tony goes on board a ship and Gibbs gets a new team.
They're also very obscure, and hence are seen as the underdog of law enforcement(in the show, anyway) but, of course, as our heroes, they are brilliant.
Earlier in the show, Kate Todd, played by Sasha Alexander, was also a member of the team and a former member of the Secret Service tasked with protecting the life of the president.
So, we also have the "true crime" shows like Criminal Minds, Law And Order CI and SVU, Withouth a Trace and many more.
He was also a writer of several Magnum P.1 episodes.
It's the story of the in and out relationships of the investigators and scientists of an agency that does anything criminal tied up to the marines, thing that Bellisario liked to do also in JAG.
Gibbs is also a top-notch "Training Officer" who clearly trains all of his people to be able to step up and take control and command of a team in a moment's notice.
The ones I know also have wicked, if dry, senses of humor and McCallum has joyfully taken the humor route with Ducky and I, for one, appreciate it.
That fact that Mark Harmon (whom I've always enjoyed watching)and David McCallum (fan of the Shaphire and Steel program)were also in the program was a bonus.
Sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way, and when he is, a good headslap by Gibbs will help him put things straight (this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext - more of an almost-text - in TV History).
The whole concept of an architect of some buildings being responsible for how the people there act later was also very weak.
All of the characters are unlikeable except the daughter, who is also a very depressing character as well.
Maybe she also has too many clothes or shoes.
Directed by Matt Tauber, who also wrote the screenplay with Grieg, it has a fascinating, if at times disconcerting, format of quick scenes flashed before our eyes like simultaneous conversations - and some of the power of the film is piecing those snapshots together as the film ends.
lizzie, rachel, and a bunch of extras go to a bar and have a good time also.
I also got a scare from the part where Virgil suddenly appears at the back window of the car.
Floricienta is a must see series which shows you many problems of teenagers and have fantastic actors like Florencia Bertotti,Juan Gil Navarro,Benjamin Rojas,Diego Messaglio and Camila Bordonaba.Floricienta also have much fun and i recommend this series to everyone for the reasons that i referred.This series is comedy and romance and i think that the acting of Florencia Bertotti is fantastic and she is very attractive.The names of the characters are Floricienta,Federicco,Franco,Mathias,Delfina,Maia,Niko,Malala,Bata and more.
Excellent acting by Nuala O'Neill and especially Julie Walter who not only carried the accent well but acted superbly also.
red, white, and blue, 666 (which is also the number of times at current this movie has been rated ;), etc.
But I also saw the edited version.
Homosexuality also is a frequent concept that is brought up several times in the film.
the numerous sex scenes and dialogue are also more explicit than most people would care for.
It's also very much a 'guy' film... get 'the gang' together, call up all your guy friends and get a copy of this film, preferably an uncut one.
While this is the role that lead him to being typecast, it also made him a cult legend.
And also adding a very good blend of slapstick humor into it.
In the meanwhile, a young woman, her boyfriend and two hicks (one of which - a girl - is going to A) get raped by vines and B) choke to death on an eyeball, while her boyfriend is going to leak some massive blood) have arrived in the cabin too, and as it turns out the whole blame of the situation stands on the parents of the young woman, herself, and her boyfriend, because it's them who looked for, found and tried to translate the Necromicon (yes, THAT book) in the first place...  Bloodier and also funnier than the first one, 'Evil Dead 2' manages to be as good as the original, but in a different way.
He also creates some innovative camera shots - uses a lot of the same shots from the first Evil Dead - and paces his film with a high energy that will make you jump a lot.
the film also didn't take itself too seriously either, which is always appreciated.
i also like seeing Bruce Campbell show up in Raimi films, like the face in the crowd in the last shot in Dark Man, right on up to his television shows and the power-tripping gate-keeper in Spider Man 2.
"The Evil Dead" is probably one of the most popular horror films of all time and it has inspired too many horror flicks to name.It is not only extremely scary,but also gory as hell.In comparison to that masterpiece "Evil Dead 2" is nowhere near as gruesome,but it is still worth checking out.The camera work throughout the film is spectacular and the special effects made by Mark Shostrom are pretty good considering the budget.The cinematography is really beautiful and the action is furious.Some scenes are deliciously funny especially when Ash cuts off his own demon-possessed hand or when a woman swallows a flying eyeball.Sam Raimi was a really talented guy,he could be a real horror master but nowadays he is making Hollywood garbage.What a shame!!
Campbell's acting skills have remarkably improved and Sam Raimi's directing also is a lot more solid.
It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared.
What is also funny is that the character of Ash is already showing signs of the super-obnoxious moron he would become in "Army of Darkness".
This brilliantly perverse stroke also suggests a creepy sexual aspect to her relationship with Buttram, and frankly grabbed me more than than the celebrated climax.
A very pious and severe man with little sense of humor, he also apparently has no problem with premarital sex (with two different women) and is an advocate for the working poor.
We are also introduced to Anna, his future wife and mother of Ingmar Bergman.
That being said, it's also not technically a Bergman film, but directed through Billie August with maybe a slightly differed sensibility.
Sometimes I felt like I was seeing even deeper truths being reached about parents and children (not only Anna with her mother but Henrik with his family- both have tarnished relationships, but however much forgiveness is left off or ties severed shows also how the children become as they are), and a take on the free will vs. determinism of such a decision.
And in today's context, I would say this act of proposition and acceptance would also raise some eyebrows sky high.
Gowariker also tends to use various hammy cross-fades.
It's also extremely enjoyable.
Instead an unknown actor with a commanding presence would have better suited this role...I think Hrithik would be more suited to play the part of Jehangir, in a historic movie, as Jehangir was known to be a typical ladies man...  2) Aishwarya Rai as a Rajput princess is a joke...same as Hrithik, she lacks the stature to play such a part...she is pure eye candy...her voice is weak & she sounds absurd delivering her lines...my choice to play this part would have been Sushmita Sen...  3) The plot of this movie is 2/3rds pure fantasy...Akbar did not have a wife by the name of Jodha...he married a Rajput princess called Hira Kunwar, who promptly converted to Islam and was called Mariam-ul-zamani...she was one of Akbar's many wives and bore him his heir apparent Jehangir...  4) It is not evident whether the director meant for this film to be a love saga or a political drama...too many sub-plots spring out throughout the length of the movie, but get resolved quickly & conveniently...it seems the director wanted to pack in as much masala as possible, culminating in an unnecessary fight scene...  5) Akbar's birth name was Badruddin Mohammed Akbar, after his grandfather Shaikh Ali Akbar and "Akbar" was not a title conferred on him...  5) Akbar was better known as a master strategian & shrewd administrator, not for his chiseled physique...he was also not monogamous as is depicted in the movie, but like other emperors of his time had innumerable wives & concubines...though he has been painted as being broad-minded & liberal as compared to other Mughals, Akbar was far from the benign & forgiving monarch portrayed here...he was responsible for slaughtering thousands of men, women & children, destroying hundreds of temples & ransacking scores of towns & villages...finally no Indian emperor would be fool hardy enough to challenge his adversary to single combat & stake his entire kingdom on the outcome of the fight...  6) The battle scenes are evidently inspired by (read - copied from) Hollywood movies such as Troy & Alexander...however after watching the realistic, gruesome wars depicted in the latter, these appear as tame, watered down versions...the climatic confrontation in this movie reminds too much of the awe-inspiring stand off between Hector & Achilles in Troy...
I admired Ashutosh Gowarikar for his original & entertaining Lagaan and also for his thought-provoking, soul stirring Swades...Aamir & Shahrukh Khan managed to get in the skin of the characters they were playing to such an extent that after watching these movies, you do not remember the stars, you only remember Bhuvan & Mohan Bhargav...here, you are only watching Hrithik who has played romantic lead in several other movies...seems like Ashutosh has succumbed to the practice of making politically correct, commercially successful movies...
His acting was also spot on, perfectly capturing Holmes' enormous ego.
The actors were amazing, especially Ila Arun...Sonu is also a revelation.
It's also something of a gamble: Gowariker has never treaded the historical epic in his earlier features, especially one about India's first attempt at religious pluralism.
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
The director of movies such as "Laagan" and "Swades," has once again left no stones unturned and proved that he is also capable of directing a movie related the colossal personality - Akbar the Great, also known as "Jalaludin Mohammed Akbar."
It also deals with intercaste marriage, which at the time was not heard off due to the fact that when the Mughals invaded India, the Rajput Princesses and Queens became Sati when their husbands, the Kings were killed in battle so as not to be captured and, or, forced to live with the Invaders.
believed that he was capable of doing justice to this part and also because of his physique.
Blood is cheaper than raw materials - this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.
Claude "Movin' On/Sheriff Lobo" Akins also plays a mover and shaker in the Nashville music scene, I believe this picture was meant to have a sort of Lite commentary on the other Nashville, as in that film which Keith Carradine played in back in 1975 - but (A) considering it's supposed to be a comedy, this was hardly the time and place for that, and (B) there was not enough time to do such type of editorialising justice, so the amateur sleuthing won out, thank God!
Briskly directed by Burt Kennedy, with a slight, inane cookie cutter script by Jimmy Sangster, crude cinematography by Victor Salzis and Alan Stensvold, a jaunty hillbilly bluegrass country score by Reed (who also sings the rousing theme song "Breakin' Loose") and the expected copious slapstick fist fights and wacky car chases, this totally inconsequential piece of made-for-TV piffle makes for a perfectly enjoyable diversion.
There is plenty of humor and slapstick and Morgan Fairchild, (Kate) gives a great supporting role and also a double role to perfection.
I mean she was pushing 40 but she did look great and Arielle Dombasle who was in her late 40's also looked pretty good in the rival production Milady.
In the book Athos and D'Artagnan first saw each other in Monsieur de Treville's office and also in the book D'Artagnan was a Gascon (Basque) from the Southern part of France and Athos,the Count de le Fere came from a region not far from Paris.
I also appreciate that this film retained many of the minor characters in the book.Great sets and scenery.
Milady's son was by her marriage to her second husband Lord de Winter and his name was John de Winter aka Mordaunt and a "worthy" descendant of Milady de Winter he was an assassin and spy also and had his mother's appetite for revenge especially against his Uncle,his mother's executioner and the 4 Musketeers for depriving him of a mother.For more on Mordaunt read the novel and sequel The Twenty Years After and try to get a decent movie version of the novel.French and Russian versions of the Twenty Years After are the best and so is the BBC version.Richard Lester gave the Mordaunt character a sex change in his version and the Italian version is very loosely based.D'Artagnan was the shortest of the Musketeers and was olive skinned read the very first chapter of the novel and he was eighteen years old Aramis and Porthos were in their 20's and Athos in his early thirties.
also, us DVD release of this movie is dubbed, badly, with no option to view with original soundtrack.
The cast are unable to lift proceedings also, and one has to wonder how a director of Barry Levinson's class ever became involved in this.
It's also an artist's perfectionism to blame.
On the other hand I'm also grateful to the director (and to the great Ben Becker) that Hans Eberhard Wieck isn't portrayed as a soulless monster.
It's also worth noting too, that this is not an 'artsy fartsy' film.
But also Erika MarozÃ¡n and Stefano Dionisi, which I haven't seen in another movie before, do everything to grant them an Academy Award.
The film also creates a rather fictitious legend around how the infamously harrowing hit song Gloomy Sunday conceived and left its mark not only on music history but also on demography.
But, there's also another story building.
The film also returns to the idea of life and death with its theme of suicide; suicide being the ultimate way to take control of your own life.
Ilona loves Joachim, but she also loves Andras, the piano player.
Laszlo, the owner, is having an affair with Ilona, his assistant, who also works at the restaurant.
She is much admired by Lazlo (Joachim Krol) owner of the restaurant and also by Andras (Stefano Dionisi) newly appointed pianist and composer of "Gloomy Sunday".
Lazlo Szabo a middle-aged jew Hungarian runs a chic restaurant with a beautiful waitress,Ilona who is also his mistress.
I've also seen other comments that say there is nothing funny about this film.
There was also a bit of controversy when the film was chosen to open the Sydney Film Festival (a pretty snooty affair usually reserved for 'arthouse movies').
Although they can be seen individually, the best experience is seeing them all together (like Wagner's Ring Cycle) - and also researching as much as you can beforehand.
However, after the director addressed us all, also announcing that he added a sepia tone color to the print, oh and by the way, he hasn't seen this print yet, so please comment afterwards!
I also think it is better that the show is on at 11:30pm, instead of 12pm.
There's also a bit of confusion in the moments of that revelation too, visually it's not clear enough until the final moment, I do feel that (without giving it away) if they'd film it a bit more open and recognisable you would have had a much longer time of the surprise than the short moment that you end up with.
I watched the movie because it is casting DeNiro but it looks like all actors need money and they play also in bad movies.
Such as why was she not afraid of her father who is the alter ego "Charlie' when her father is her father and also how did going to the country side bring out this alter ego which I'm assuming came about when he killed his wife.
Were also given to understand that David's next door, and somewhat unstable, neighbors have something to do with the weird and deadly goings on at David and Emily's country home.
I's not until the last ten minutes or so in the movie "Hide and Seek" that were exposed to who really Charlie is and why he's doing the terrible things that he does and also why Emily is so terrified of him.
Effects-laden mess also echoes the "Indiana Jones" series, but without strong or charismatic performers and screen writing, the picture deflates rather early.
also we were afraid to go into the bathroom and look in the bathtub after watching this film.
Dakota Fanning is one of my favorite child actors, and she is also awesome in the role of little Emily, not only because of her acting skills, but also because of her new look, with long and dark hair who really suits her.
Famke Janssen ("Don't Say A Word" and "House on Haunted Hill") also does great, and Elisabeth Shue ("The Karate Kid") is also very good.
It also is veers back and forth from thriller to horror territory (which have a notoriously gray border anyway) depending partially on one's interpretation of the film.
While the style and content of Hide and Seek are very different than The Shining--Hide and Seek is even more understated--that's also a slower-paced film that finds much of its effectiveness from its thick atmosphere and commendable performances, and fans of Kubrick's great horror film should find enough to enjoy here as well.
Deniro's last thriller, Godsend, was also terrible, and he played a goofy doctor in that one, too!
She also won an MTV Movie Award for, 'Best Frightened Performance' in this movie.
Talented Ashley Totin also stars as Danielle, Carina's best friend and maid of honor.
Carlos Ponce and sexy Jack Hartnett also stars.
The actor in the role of Danielle's boss does a nice job (and is also very good looking).
There's also Jester Hairston-later familiar to me as Rolly on "Amen"-as a butler and, in perhaps the most humorous scene, Scatman Crothers as Big Ben, a client that prostitute Billie quits on to go audition at a night club.
Ms. Ross was the second (or third since Cicely Tyson was also nominated that year for Sounder) African-American to be nominated an Oscar for Best Actress after Dorothy Dandridge's previous nod some 18 years before.
She also went from innocent looking young girl to well dressed cabaret singer.
It is also especially wonderful to see some wonderful African-American treasures like Richard Pryor, Billy Dee, Isabel Sanford, Scatman Scrothers, among others.
She also doesn't exactly resemble Holiday, who was rather plump early on, but she just so commands the screen...amazing how few films she has ultimately made, though the specter of Dorothy Dandridge looms large.
Billy Dee Williams officially became a star with his charismatic turn as Louis McKay, Billie's true love and Richard Pryor also received an Oscar nomination for his funny and caustic performance as "Piano Man", Billie's best friend and piano player, who was chasing demons of his own.
The movie should also be commended for making Diana Ross equally bad and beautiful within the same movie.
Billie Dee Williams and Richard Pryor also gave strong performances.
While this film may gloss over a lot of Billie's life, the script was based on her autobiography (this may be how Billie chose to remember her past) and the screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar.
This is a great fun, adventurous, mystery movie, with also supernatural elements in it, which focuses on a very young Sherlock Holmes, solving his very first crime.
It features the same adventurous elements and humor, that were also always featured in his earlier movies.
I also liked the use of shadows within the movie, most likely also touch from Spielberg, who is a Michael Curtiz fan.
But I also have to admit that the movie its story, written by Chris Columbus, was rather simplistic.
It doesn't take away the fact that this is still a fun movie to watch, but it at the same time also prevents the movie from being a truly great one.
It's also true that in the end the movie is just a bit too supernatural, which goes at the expenses of the credibility of the movie and story.
The movie further more also features the very first to have a completely CGI character.
The effects were already great looking, which also goes for most of the other effects in this movie.
So, the movie is perhaps focusing a bit too much on just the main character, which is also understandable, considering the icon that Sherlock Holmes is.
In spite of the rather dramatic and heavy sounding plot I've described, it also has some great comic moments.
at 5:15PM.... Director of "Double...",John Cromwell,who also directed the CLASSIC, "Of Human Bondage"-1934-which will be shown at 6:30PM- so you can see his skill...   After that- a very 'touchy' subject-abortion-will be confronted with the PRE-code film,"Men in White"-1934-just before the 'code' was enforced.
Harding is discovering that she is slowly falling in love with Powell, and is also aware that he expects her to divorce him within a six months of their return from their honeymoon (on one of his cruise lines ships).
She also starts pushing him to get re-involved with the shipping line, and he starts taking charge of it (and it starts improving).
This film also serves to further establish the absolute brilliance of William Powell, who is the lazy playboy named John Fletcher, heir to a shipping line.
There is also some good scenes between the protagonist and his grandmother and his sister.
But as the story evolved, I also started to like this simplicity because of the authentic view it gives us of poverty in the Philipines.
This movie has also been the best picture in other Film Festivals as well.
But she was also speechless at the end.
I wish our Indian directors/producers also see this movie and try giving us good movies.
It is a great contribution to the local film industry and films like these with high quality deserve good production and not only support for the commercial mainstream in the Philippines but also in cinemas worldwide.
Jiro Manio's (Pikoy) portrayal of a young boy who took it upon himself to raise money in order for her grandmother's burial/death to be less hard on the family financially was so poignantly moving.The acting of the other cast were also really good especially for the seasoned actors and actresses like Lorna Tolentino (Pikoy's mother), Gloria Romero (who played the bedridden grandmother) and Albert Martinez (the father).
Isabella de Leon, the girl who played the invalid sister, was also great in her role.
We get also a glimpse of the beauty of the Czech women in the person of the wife of the manager.
The movie shows also very well the change of the society in those times.
Kelly MacDonald is also marvelous as Evangeline.
And I need to mention Angela Lansbury (who wore a marvelous fake hooked nose...it took me a few minutes to recognize her)...she is also very funny in her role.
The other cast members are also very overwhelming!
It was great to see Angela Lansbury also - she was so good years ago in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.
Yet the father is also standing there and acts as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened!
The clever make up and well acted performance adds to the authentic side to the film and also shows her how much she deserves another award.
It was also nice to see Angela Lansbury, now much older, in a cameo as Firth's domineering Aunt, but with an important role in the story.
The script, also Thompson's work, is well written and enjoyable with jokes for the entire family as well as the well remembered quotes from all the characters.
Parents who are looking for something to take the children to see Â this is also ideal!
Thompson is a consummate artist and is the only person ever to have won an Oscar for writing ("Sense and Sensibility") and also to have won an Oscar for acting ("Howard's End).
The scenery and costumes were also wonderful to look at -lovely use of color.
There is much humour and fun to be had but there is also a darker tone, what with children being threatened with the Work House and their father speaking to corpses!
Colin Firth was perfect as this dithering man who may be meek but will do anything for his children and Emma Thompson is totally unrecognisable as the lead character of Nanny McPhee (she also deserves much recognition her skills in script-writing this film).
The children also deserve much praise, especially when you consider most of them are not only very young but had never acted before.
It isn't dumbed down, there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue' - and there's also no annoying Americanisms as beset Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.
We also see his love for a first woman, who dies in a car crash (note that nobody actually goes to jail for that "accident" -it was during a car race, and Delon and his wife find themselves right into it without not even knowing it-).
Gino, as an ex con, is forced by French law to take residence anywhere but in a city and so he settles with his young wife in the country, where fate turns against him, as first his wife is killed, then he is hounded by his former crime gang to return to his former lifestyle and also one of the arresting officers from his case years previously, the now chief inspector Goitreau is in charge of the area and has a grudge against him and becomes even more suspicious when he finds out Gino's new girlfriend Lucie is working in the local bank With the help of his now good friend Cazeuenve and his new girlfriend Lucie (Mimsy Farmer) he tries to battle his demons and fight against the troublesome cop.
Giallo queen Farmer is also pretty good and there a very charismatic cameo from Gerard Depardieu as a cocky young criminal, who's not that impressed by Gino's past glories.
But it is also, quite simply, the tragic history of a man.
It calls also upon one of known leading man , with dishevelling Michel Bouquet in relentless police , Bernard Giraudeau who plays the son of the teacher Cazeneuve, the presenter Christine FabrÃ©ga, his wife, Cecile Vassort ,his daughter.Victor Lanoux , Gerard Depardieu and Gabrille Briand three mafias, One could say, in a certain manner, which we all are of Gino Strabliggi..... that's a simple existence transfers with the drama.
It is also some truly priceless scenes like the cat fight at the strawberry picking and any other situation that the Larkins get into.
Catherine Zita Jones is absolutely one of the most beautiful British actresses out of UK, and also a good actress also.
And I also noticed one of the actresses was the only one to run around with her top off all of the time displaying her silicon all of the time (perhaps that's all she could do to get the part & that's as far as her acting skills go) pretty sad, this guys other movies look a lot better.
Time has also ripened and finally, at least through ballots and ballot-boxes, these people have decided to recapture their destinies and to repossess their riches that had been confiscated, maybe with a commercial contract signed by a powerless insect in front of the all-powerful business vultures coming from the West.
Director/co-writer Larry Yust, who also helmed the bang-up funky blaxploitation blast "Trick Baby," fashions this absorbingly off-kilter plot into a delightfully quirky and deadpan black comic horror oddity, skillfully alternating between shocking moments of brutal violence and inspired bits of uproarious wackiness in a deft, screwy, throwaway style which proves to be both amusingly nutty and occasionally quite unnerving in comparable measure.
Brocco, Wolfe, McDermott, Hansen, Fuller and especially the marvelously sassy and sprightly Trueman (who was also great as Sondra Locke's redoubtable granny in "The Outlaw Josey Wales") all give lively, colorful, thoroughly engaging and touchingly dignified performances as the shrewd, lethal, lovably stubborn and indomitable geriatric protagonists.
I was like "please just stop" but the movie was not just so boring but also so long.
Just as good are Ian Wolfe as the building superintendent, Ruth McDevitt as his wife (also the conscience of the group), William Hansen as a widowed writer, blind Peter Brocco and Frances Fuller as a wig-wearing agoraphobic who still talks to her dead husband and hasn't left the building in 20 years.
Co-stars Douglas Fowley, Linda Marsh and veteran horror/sci-fi star Kenneth Tobey as the construction boss also deliver fine performances in less-sympathetic roles.
She is also the personification of evil in the group.
Jennifer will play a major part later in the film to not only bring out what the motives of her murderer was but how they connected her to both Aubrey and what later turned out to be her identical twin Dakota Moss also played by Miss.
Some details were too stupid, like the " time to make a phone call", or the peaceful way in which Dakota seems to take his situation   The Good: The overall history, the photography, the way they portrait colors and his significance, the ending was nice also.
I recommend going into this film with an open mind and you may also end up being pleasantly shocked.
I went to this movie hearing all of the negative comments but left the film thinking the critics had surely missed the point of this great thriller.The use of symbolism in the film such as with the blue rose was nothing short of artistic brilliance.The ending was also superb as we find out that it was the piano teacher.
In addition to the constantly surprising narrative, viewers are also treated to some surprisingly nasty bits of gore, but, unfortunately, no nekkidness from the star (although there are still a couple of moments in which she does turn up the heat: as a stripper performing a pole dance, and during a sex scene).
And she is suffering from this conditioned called "twin stigmata", kinda like the twins on GI Joe (You know, you have to hit one to hurt the other type of thing), which is how I know how to write my only crappy story about her cause deep down inside I know she exists, and that is also the reason that she is randomly losing limbs while she is poll dancing in a strip club where she in the only one who doesn't take off her clothes (of course flashing her hooha to all the paparazzi is totally acceptable, but parish the thought that she flash a teet and get paid for it) is because that when you cut them off my body it falls off of hers.
I also have to say, to the people who said the film was extremely predictable, are you joking?
The comedy relief of the movie, and also some of its most insightful moments, comes with her cussing loudly at God.
I really liked the performances by the actors who portrayed Charles and Camilla, & also the actress they chose to portray Diana was very convincing in that role as well, so casting was very good.
It's also a good introduction for the teenager world!
It also shows how virginity was still the vogue back then and that all the other provocative women were putting on a show.
The film also exaggerates.
It's also fun to see again in the cinema since its 1998 re-issue.
But is also has a massive appeal in a lot of other areas.
The music is catchy, the actors are pretty good and the story behind the music is also entertaining..
All in all, a film that should be re-released every twenty years so a new generation of children and teenagers can watch it, not just because it was one of the last great musicals but also because it truly captures the essence of what it was like to grow up in the 50s.
The end also blows your mind and just makes you so astonished, but in such a good way.
Yes, this film has been put together really badly It also has some terrible editing (1967...(moore mouths eight!
It also has some cringe inducing scenes including what I believe is Roger Moore trying it on with his own daughter.
Ganga's father agrees to the proposal and soon comes Arjun, Kishorilal's faithful nephew, who is also a good friend of Rajiv, to organise the engagement before Rajiv, who's never been to India, comes to see his bride.
There also starts the realisation that Ganga and Arjun are actually in love.
She is not only one of the most beautiful actresses to have graced the Indian screen, she is also an extremely talented actress.
This film also marks the breakthrough of Sonu Nigam, who became a star with the song "Dil Deewana".
The Hollywood studio sequences are also underwhelming, with key details and conversations coming off as suspect (made worse by repetitive moments, poor editing and mediocre acting).
I can well remember that she was not only a wonderful sportswoman and actress but also a doctor of philosophy.
Austrian and European Champion Eva Pawlik who lost her Olympic Gold Medal only against CanadaÂ´s sweetheart Barbara Ann Scott is brilliant not only as a skater but also as an actress.
Eva Pawlik, in the fifties AustriaÂ´s most popular figure skating queen, is shown in a large number of roles on the ice (as a doll as well as a ballerina) and also in the leading role in the movieÂ´s frame story.
The reason why 10 points are appropriate: Eva Pawlik is starring not only as a figure skater, but also as an actress.
The only thing about the frame-story worth mentioning is that Eva Pawlik is also an excellent actress.
She was not only a world-famous sportswoman, but also an outstanding show star and a good actress as to be seen in "FrÃ¼hling auf dem Eis".
The film earns a maximum of 10 points because it is one of the very few movies in which a European figure skating Champion also plays a main role in the frame story of a revue film.
The figure skater Eva Pawlik, however, does her job well not only on the ice but also as an actress.
As the female main role is played by my mother, Eva Pawlik (who died in 1983), and as my father Rudi Seeliger (who also died in 1983) is also presented as a skater, the movie is from the personal point of view by far more valuable to me than to any other person in the world.
Pawlik did a lot of exhibition skating in the US, where she was also asked to be the lead actress in a Hollywood movie by Gene Kelley who wanted to combine his dancing with her skating.
It is good also to remember the conditions in which Austrian skaters developed their skills and competed in the 1930s and '40s.
When I watch the movie "FrÃ¼hling auf dem Eis" with Eva Pawlik (who was also a good actress) all the marvellous figure skating impressions come back to my mind.
Although her skating style may look a bit old fashioned to us now she is still a strong personality on the ice and also as an actress in the frame story.
I can well remember that she was not only a wonderful sportswoman and actress but also a doctor of philosophy.
For Claude Chabrol,a cinÃ©aste who has made over 50 films,this film must be like one of his loving children.However,his admirers might view it in a different light as it might appear as a minor work for them but many serious viewers would nevertheless feel that there are some nice things to observe in this film.Au coeur du mensonge is a film about people who are grappling with truths and lies in their lives.This film is more of a character study even though it is true that there are two crimes depicted in the film.These vile acts are merely a pretext for small town people to talk of pretentiousness and infidelity.Au coeur du mensonge is also a story about two artists;one of them is a fake and other one is not so sure of his inherent abilities.There is also a woman in their midst who is torn between these two men.The message of this film is simple:To understand a lie,one has to go to its heart.When we watch Sandrine Bonnaire and Jacques Gamblin, we realize that the truth is not so complicated as it is always visible on surface level.
The demise of the first of the six students is also strikingly sudden and somehow out of character.
There also seemed to be some sort of "twist" to the ending that I didn't understand...
Not only is she able to conjure the dead and cast spells that will make your stomach turn (think fish hooks and reptiles + soft human flesh); but she also seems to have a predilection for torture using a blow torch.
It also was interesting to see a film from Thailand with Thais as sorcerers as this is a common trait of '80s Hong Kong horror flicks that I enjoy--e.g., Seeding of a Ghost and The Devil.
It also owes those films a nod for using their gimmicks--gory curses, animal body horror, eating of sick sh!t/puking, et al.
There is also an Asian ghost story spin to the whole thing to get it just a little more complicated.
Outside of the main premise, both films also have the similar characters of the dull-witted local supervising the work (here played amusingly by 'Pa Kettle' Percy Kilbride) and a helpful male friend of the couple that the husband falsely believes is making a play for his wife (Melvyn Douglas in BLANDINGS, Harvey Stephens here).
The arrival of a couple of nightmare relatives of the Fuller's also works; with Charles Coburn playing an egocentric uncle they cater to in hopes he will one day leave his fortune to them and Douglas Croft (young George M. Cohan in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY) as Raymond, Connie's obnoxious adolescent nephew.
Hattie McDaniel is also along in a routine, thankless maid role.
I've seen every Ma and Pa Kettle film made because I long to be as stoic, calm and unperplexed as was Percy Kilbride, so this film was doubly enjoyable because also I've always been a big Jack Benny fan due to the fact he had the best timing, on radio, TV and movies, of any comedian.
Rumor also hath it that Jack and Ann got romantically involved during the making of the film.
This was also my first exposure to Jack Benny.
Ann Sheridan buys a dilapidated house believing that "George Washington Slept Here" in this 1942 film also starring Jack Benny, Percy Kilbride, Charles Coburn and Hattie McDaniel.
good movie, also very painful for anyone from that region of the world.
It also has some great score in some episodes.
I also liked the sound, editing, just about everything that made this film.
), part epic adventure (even if the widescreen aspect ratio in the edition I watched wasn't quite the full 2.55:1 format of its original presentation), and part 'woman's picture' (despite Power's top billing, he's off-screen for long stretches at a time, so that Hayward emerges as the real protagonist Â given also that she's involved with three men and undergoes many a hardship during the course of the film).
The finale, then, has the hero relinquishing (not without a certain remorse) his political career to make up to the long-suffering heroine Â especially since their past dalliance had borne him a son (with whom he also shares his name) he was unaware of.
She's chasing Tyrone Power across South Africa, although he's something of a stiff, but she also loves hearty Richard Egan.
The film is based on a novel by Maria Amparo Escandon, who also appears briefly in the film.
Peter Weller (best known as RoboCop) is also a very under-rated actor who deserves some good roles these days.
It's probably a lot more raunchy also!
If you share the same sense of humor I also recommend you "Lemon Popsicle" part shoot at the Army, and two first parts of PORKY's ..
The cast also has Leon Niemczyk, one of the main characters from "Knife in the Water".
There is also some totally unprovoked nudity and the characters are hilarious.
The confessions of Esperanza, always after some confusion, are also hilarious.
The story of the Legion of Superheroes also gives an insight into the sheer heroism of Superman Prime back when he was still quite heroic and not tainted with the insanity that made him into an intergalactic scourge.
It would also deal the new reformed Braniac 5.1 who is now organic and how he would be convinced to rejoin the legion again.
Another thing was also the appearance of the new evil braniac where he said "evil does not die, it evolves" was also suppose to battle with the reformed braniac and the legion.
This story was also brilliantly presented in the Newberry Award-winning children's novel, "The Secret of the Andes," by Ann Nolan Clark, about a young boy who is the last remaining pure Incan, living in the Andes with his spiritual guide and teacher, who goes on a journey of discovery into Cuzco, to find out what contributed to the eradication of his race.
The more than 20 years elapsed between both films shows clearly the different cinematographic techniques of one time and the other; but both products have many similarities in their conception such as the crash between two completely different civilizations each one with their own religious, social and political standards and also the search of gold and riches by both "conquistadores" and their total lack of scruples for the achievement of their target (clearly leaving aside the pretended conversion to Catholicism of the natives that was the excuse of their kings to support the expeditions in a time when the church ruled in Spain).
Hordak also has a great army composed of mechanical soldiers and a bunch of weird creatures.
This was the unmissable event in which Master of the Universe He-Man would team up with his long-lost twin sister, She-Ra, battling against not only He-Man's sworn enemy, Skeletor, but also the evil Hordak, Skeletor's cruel mentor.
But there's also an unmistakable magic in the storytelling and characters.
The production is also 1950s-style.
She wants to help him, but also wants to stay loyal to the Horde.
I don't even know why I thought so.. maybe because I also dug Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman, and Batgirl.. but I digress.
This is the best epic movie of all times until now.Great actors,beautiful music and very good work from the director.I have seen this movie almost 50 times and i never get bored to watch it.It takes away from this world.It takes you to other places that only in our fantasy we can see.This movie is not just a fantastic story about King Arthur,it also contains very good messages for those who can see them.The higher you go - the farther you'll fall!The only thing that i can not understand is why all of the actors(expect Helen Mirren)did not continue with great movies after that and they just move aside making movies(BAD movies),that no one knows.
It's also got an epic feel to it (not surprising given the source material) with a lengthy running time and a plot that spans decades.
Boorman also has included some pretty steamy sex scenes, showing us that life during these times was not all bloodshed and battle.
If they had also worn spandex, the headbands would have been understandable, but wearing the armor all day, every day as opposed to normal clothing, was a bit trying on a person's common sense.
Unfortunately, it also has some bad casting (who in the world picked Cherie Lunghi to play Guenevere?--flower child as mythological queen?
It also covered the story of King Arthur better than any other film before or since.
But it was more than a bit silly to see everything else from feasting to sex also portrayed in full armor.
The relationship between King Arthur, Queen Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) and Lancelot (Nick Clay) is also well-developed.
The character of the wicked sorceress Morgana (Helen Mirren) is also a strong point, and one everyone misses.
It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...  Boorman's 'Excalibur' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend...
Boorman also looks at the Druidic and pagan roots of the arthur story, (" The Land is the King.
However, he also maintains a heart (and no, this isn't one of those drama-ey shows either) and does end up saving lives.
Lupin is so huge, that many, many, many things have also been made after him, and don't be surprised if you find many references to him in other shows, movies, etc.
I was also impressed with Arials direction.
People kept asking how the psych was also the nanny.
The ending may also disappoint in this regard.
Of course the fact that you find your self wondering whats going on during the film also is very positive.
The supporting cast is also exceptional in the roles and convince you of the impact that Danika's visions are having upon them.
They also have no idea when Jack is going to fly into a rage or have another flashback.
Speaking with the firmness and controlled confidence of someone who has had to endure, Rose (Gisch) indicates that she has not only survived her father's alcoholism and abuse, but also that the quality of her life has progressed well beyond the one afforded by her parents' pathetic relationship.
I didn't like the fact that it was so short it took me two days to beat and the final boss was the easiest battle in the game with the exception of the beginning random battles.I also want to know how they are going to start golden sun 2 (which should be coming out Christmas 2002 for all you golden sun fans)because if it's a different game pack than golden sun will they start with the average level of the game then factor in everything like spells and Items and then maybe start the game on the boat then have a secret closet where you can pick up any of the weapons you may have had.
Also you can collect up to 7 Elementals of each elemental force, which also enables more skills and also summons in battle, which can get to be VERY powerful to fight with.
Also, quite a few side-quests, and they could get vital to the second part also.
Even do this game is made for the game boy advance with all of the console's limits, is also extremely enjoyable.
The sound is also enjoyable and the graphics are good for the game boy advance.
You can set Djinns to each character to provide them with additional strength or you can also change types for them.
You can also use each character special power (They call it Psynergy) or simply attack the bad guys with your weapons.
The worst part of all is that it's also a true story.
The scene in the snow is thus not only the victory of joy and will to live over war (because we aren't allowed to forget these guys are in a war area), but also the liberation one feels when one is finally allowed to express feelings forbidden by society.
I also recommend it because it is not a shallow combination of gay love and war, but a profound discussion of joy and death.
It's also a splash in the pond, showing you the dichotomies of a society we grew to relate with war and nothing else.
The film also firmly establishes the two leads enough that it is able to spend time developing the other characters as real people as well instead of as springboards to reflect gay jokes or innuendoes as most other gay films do.
SPOILERS I also enjoyed the small joke in the film about how this was not a Hollywood movie.
Of all the films I've seen, this one is one of the simplest, yet also one of the most effective depictions of gay love that I have seen in the cinema.
There is Aya who also loves Jagger and in turn is sought after by others in the tiny force.
Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood.
But it's also a disfigured love story, which while it keeps it from becoming simply a waxworks or a freak show, causes it to drag a little tiny bit.
Of course, many other people also help to keep Norma from the truth.
I don't think it is enough that the film shows that Norma enjoys manipulating Joe, I think it has to also be implied that to a certain extent Joe loves being manipulated.
He reluctantly becomes her lover, though he's in love with Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen), also a screenwriter.
While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed, were continuing to change, and those they left behind, it also shows us how, in some ways, they've remained the same.
Admittedly, Gloria is fantastic in this film - she's able to send up herself, while also scandalizing the business she was product of - but the acting chops must really go to William Holden, who provides the willful self-loathing thread that ties much of this noirish and twisted tale together.
When she isn't raving about her greatness, she comes across as a frightened and tortured soul Â a sad and lonely woman, who is not only remarkably self-delusional, but is also trying to grasp one last chance at happiness.
There's also the hilarious appearance of a skinny and madly grinning Jack Webb as a happy-go-lucky assistant director, and viewers will get a kick out of the excessive exuberance that Norma displays when she towels down a hunky and hairy-chested Joe at poolside.
It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios!
Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.
In supporting roles, I also enjoyed the wholesome Nancy Olsen and the young Jack Webb of "Dragnet" fame.
And it also leads directly to the best conclusion (I feel) in movies in terms of proper cinematography: the clouding of the focus as Norma Desmond descends the staircase into her madness.
One might also notice that Joe Gillis is not Vicki Lester.
Joe also had his girlfriend/collaborator Betty Schaeffer.
He had been her first director and husband, and he is also (in his over-devotion to her) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy.
Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer, Max gives up his dream of directing, and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis.
The film is also about LOVE.
If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about "being back" and "all those wonderful people out there in the dark" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).
For a live production it also looked great.Its also a treat to get well acted & scripted sci-fi, & sci-fi aimed at adults.
I liked also that characters who were given little to to in the film were fleshed out nicely here-ie.
Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business.
Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive, also making those movies a must see.
In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): "...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces", I'd like to also add that they "didn't need movies; they had films."
I also smiled at the inside "X-Files" joke, with Neeson's character smoking "Morley's."
It was also hard to believe as there were no hospitals for the sick astronaut or isolation chambers, etc as if the script had not been updated.
At the same time, Neeson must also deal with an increasingly volatile digestive system and a horrifying fear of being found out.
There's also a lack of internal logic to these shots .
We also have to endure a ridiculous scene where an art lover bleats " If you destroy beauty then we don't deserve to go on living " Oh please !
Kudos for that, no doubt, belong to the director (who also wrote it), who assembled a remarkably colorful group of actors and fashioned one of the funniest ensemble performances I've ever seen on the screen, a comedy that unfolds with a paradoxically poetic visual style that keeps you howling even when the actors aren't speaking.
I'm also a big fan of her mom.
She also tries having sex with other women, and finds that lesbianism is an exciting twist for her.
She may have also gotten a Grammy that year, but even if she didn't, it's a hat trick that stands alone in the annals of American entertainment.
Anna Biller,in addition to acting as the film's central female lead,Barbi,also wore several hats in the production of this campy period piece (she wrote,directed & edited the film,in addition to set design & even supervising a brief animation sequence,where Barbi is experiencing her first real orgasm, while on some kind of psychedelic drug).The plot concerns a young,suburban housewife who's loutish husband ignores,and eventually abandons her,only to leave her to experimenting with her new found sexual self,including swingers,hippies,etc.
While the film certainly parodies B flicks on one level, on another it truly works as a piece of calculated and subversive art by reversing the usual misogynistic dynamics of the typical exploitation film: we see the repressed lead character Barbi transform into "Viva" who becomes self aware and empowered by discovering and reveling in her sexuality ( the animated orgasm scene is pretty awesome, apparently Anna Biller also animated this sequence! )
There is also a great cat fight backstage with Stacy Kiebler and Tori Wilson.. Make sure to check that out!
Kelly McGillis also gives a good performance as the college student who gets mixed up with the world-renowned poet.
The answer he comes up with is a head-spinner, but it's also a perfect answer to this dilemma, and answers your lingering questions about the movie's name.
Although the screenplay is consistently witty from start to finish, it is mainly in the second half of the film that it is also extremely moving.
the walz used in the film "Un carnet de bal" 1937 is used also for a short scene in the 1936 film "Meyerling" .
The story, also, means different things in different perspectives -- to some, the loyalty or realizations of Samwise might be familiar to their own personality, and they will see what he goes through as their lessons.
Or it could be more complicated, those combined, or maybe also with the Ring becoming something they know.
And also there are some strange mistakes in the story logic, one example (NO SPOILER) that Frodo and Sam spend several days waiting for Aragorn to charge the Black Gate.
There were also several elements of the story that bothered me, in animation, and in plot.
I was also not a fan of the way they reversed Frodo and Sam's characters.
They also skipped really quickly over important scenes and yet took ten minutes on the Samwise the Strong scene which, while important should not take up quite that much time, especially since they had to cut the book down so much to fit it into a movie.
There are also several events that really didn't happen in the book that they put into the movie (but some of them would ruin the end so I won't say incase any pain seekers actually want to see it).
What people also have to remember is that, unlike the Jackson renditions, this and 'The Hobbit' were made especially for children.
I especially loved the scenes with Frodo and Sam in orc clothes walking with the other orcs in mordor and also the fantasy dream scene with the smiling orcs coming towards Frodo and Sam showing the middle earth that could have been.
Glenn's songs are also worse in this one, including only two numbers I really liked (Frodo of Nine Fingers and Where there's a whip).
It also failed to include this final chapter of the story -- Bakshi had hoped that if his first film made enough money there would be impetus to finish it.
<p>As if the incomprehensible jumping-on point wasn't bad enough, we're also subjected to some truly horrendous songs, bad dialogue, poor pacing, very basic animation, etc.
One can also recognize Roddy McDowall as the voice of Samwise Gamgee.
The voice of Gollum is also memorably done by Brother Theodore.
Most part of the actors are from the soapbox opera mafia that controls our TV media -which means they can hardly act-, so I should've been warned by that; but then, thereÂ´s also in La habitaciÃ³n... a couple of good actors -like DamiÃ¡n AlcÃ¡zar- that I enjoy watching at work.
The movie also must be applauded for being an early forum concerning race relations.
This great film also deserves a Musical Review if that's all right with Tom Jones....
And I had an uncle who worked hard at Kodak and also built up a milk delivery business of his own and at an age where he could have just relaxed and taken it easy, he was out working at close to 80 at a tool and die plant.
Although I love the remake also, but this one is much better.
She has all of Judy's raw talent & her incredible vulnerability, but with Liza you also get sex-I had forgotten how very sexy she was.
On an episode of LAW AND ORDER about six years ago, the murder of a woman was tied to her trying to regain her son by her ex-husband: the husband (like Peola) could pass himself off as white, and was a high ranking business executive with a new wife, who was white, and also a bigot.
The funeral of Delilah also is notable, for the appearance of members of the Black Middle class in the scenes, in particular the men in quasi-military uniforms who must belong to some "mason" like club, and who give the deceased a goodbye beneath their outstretched military sabers.
Its racial views are somewhat of its time but it is also very forward-looking.
She won the Oscar for "It Happened One Night," and also scored this second huge hit, which artistically speaking is hardly chopped liver.
But she is also sympathetic to the concerns of the story and helps to quietly push along the plea for racial equality.
The more times I see this, the more I also enjoy Gene Wilder's bit as an unusual doctor with an odd sense of compassion.
It was also amazing to see the amount of talent Allen had to work with in the film.
You can also see how some of the skits inspired Saturday Night Live which was to come years later.
It may also amaze some people that Allen was actually funny at one time.
It also makes you think about Allen and his foster step daughter in the context of this film.
The two best vignettes also work well because Woody plays them close to the style of their inspirations.
This means that the movie is filled with some crazy characters, hilarious crazy situations and fast jokes, also with its dialog.
Other actors that really draw your attention in this movie, also because you just don't expect them to see in this movie and in the roles they play (such as Burt Reynolds) are Gene Wilder as the doctor who falls for a sheep and also John Carradine in a crazy scientist role, also no doubt as a fun homage to his horror movies past, from mostly the '40's.
There's also a fifty foot breast, and a Rabbi indulging his fetish of watching his wife eat non-kosher food, and parodies of Italian films, American sc-fi, and games which are pretty spot on.
It's a movie full of unique, bizarre moments but it's also full of some more great zingers in the script department too.
Still, it's not without it's unforgettable moments; other than Wilder, also worthy of special praise is John Carradine who is wonderful as the ultimate parody of a mad scientist, and let's not forget Woody Allen as a fool in the Middle Ages misquoting Hamlet and getting his hand stuck up the Queen's chastity belt, and his wonderful performance as an Italian Casanova.
Whoever was responsible for the wardrobe in this movie was also an idiot.
While not listed in the credits, the dancing ensemble also deserves kudos for their supporting contributions to this singular and indeed historic concert.
The gang is also a stereotypical gang: Even number of boys and girls who are dating each other.
It also has some familiar faces in it.
The story was also a but clichÃ©d and there was one rather misplaced hot scene.
Boon, Lisa Ann Hadley, was also a character in Infested, which is a great bad flick about bug-spray and bad relationships.
And he also has to to take his shirt off because he seems to be really proud of his chest.
Sorry, either the time is changing all of us either there is something else... and also, some of the symbolic is so... well, political.
All credits to Rajko and Ante, and also to Emir who's acting is superb !!!!
you must see the movie more then once,then you will get the real filling of the movie.the movie is very good also from the professional side,the photography the music everything.everything is happening by the most beautiful lake the Ohrid lake in the mountain and national park in Macedonia.the crew is perfect from Pasic to Paunovic from Mirjana to Sinisa.i m very impressed with the acting of Pasic i think it is a masterpiece.and by the way is co-production of all ex Yugoslavian republics(its not a joke)..............................................more times you see the movie it gets better.
(And also some Sanja Ilic added for good ethno-mood measure.)
According to bloggers, obviously bored out of their skull, the character of Rade O. might've been inspired by Ratko Mladic who also served in Macedonia during the late 1980s and apparently also loved flowers - all of which I guess is the closest this unremarkable film will come to generating any kind of post-viewing discussion.)
Ubiquitous sound of so called folk music and appalling rudeness in communication are also contributing to making this movie the closest thing to actually being there.
And not just emotional growth, as modern animation is often so limited to, but also that he is maturing in a natural/physical way, so that you can really imagine him becoming a strong and brave prince.
Fortunately, Bambi will find some support from his friends, Thumper (Brendon Baerg) and Flower (Nicky Jones), but he'll also have to meet his soon-to-be rival, the mean deer Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), for the first time.
Making a follow-up for a classic like "Bambi" is not easy, but the fact that the writers (Director Brian Pimental and newcomer Alicia Kirk) decided to explore an entirely "missing chapter" in the life of the young deer instead of making a proper sequel, gave them enough freedom to create a story that not only is fresh and original on its own, it also gives continuity to the original without disrespecting it or blatantly copying it.
I love Disney animation (I also enjoy drawing drawing it to), but usually second takes to the films animation is terrible.
It was very funny yet it was also a strong story showing Bambi getting to know his father, very emotional at some points!
I also felt the animation was of a very high standard and it evoked memories of the original film.
"), ramshackle production values, a sappy romance between Kraft and dorky Oriental adventurer Danny Lee (who also portrayed the titular bionic superhero in the equally astounding "Infra-Man" around the same time), a breathlessly frenetic pace, an absurdly melodramatic score, a fantastic mondo destructo monster on the rampage sequence (WARNING: Possible *SPOILER* ahead - in one alternate version Kraft croaks along with the ape at the film's riotously botched conclusion), a few groovy Erutrash disco tunes (one's even sung to a cloying lovey-dovey jungle montage!
Jennifer Rubin also puts on a great performance as her character starts as a mystery and gradually opens up in to someone the audience really cares for.
The script, which is good throughout, is also especially good in the final sequence.
Not only we get to know the relationship between Bambi and his father, but also to know his father better.
We also get to know Ronno when he was little.
I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films.
I also enjoyed this new chapter into Bambi's life as he is learning how to become a prince, but still holding onto his childhood and his favorite friends.
Bambi is having a hard time, his father has to take care of him but his father also has no respect for him since Bambi isn't as brave as he is.
Bambi is also having to learn how to grieve the death of his mother and make sure that he doesn't meet the same fate as she did.
The plot of the relationship between Bambi and his father, basically the ideas of love and growing up, and the feel in general of Bambi 2 are almost exactly like those of original film, and the music, voices, and sensational character and background artwork are also very similar.
In addition to appealing to those who loved the original, Bambi 2 is also filled with humor and adventure that kids of this generation would enjoy.
If this one was made to be serious, it's also an excellent spoof.
Our heart-broken explorer had just caught his fiancÃ©e in bed with a friend and therefore was ready for anything to get out of town, but maybe this...he finds the Mighty Peking Man but he also finds Ah Wei, a beautiful blonde who wears a ragged loincloth and top, who can communicate with Peking Man & also all the other animals in the jungle, except for perhaps a cobra, which bites her.
When news begins to spread in the nearby village that livestock have been found dead and some humans have also gone missing, Keng heads out into the forest alone to investigate the claims.
Yet, "Tropical Malady" also brings a romantic tenor to the subject as it implies that the love between the two men has somehow moved into a more meaningful and primal stage, one bereft of the constricting and deadening rituals placed upon it by a civilized world (my suspicion is that is why the filmmakers chose to make this a love story between two men rather than one between a man and a woman, though, frankly, the Thai society we see doesn't seem to be particularly condemning or homophobic in its response to the lads).
His soundtrack is also a major player in the film, particularly in the jungle scenes where the natural - and not so natural - sounds become an intricate part of the mood and drama.
The second half is also marked by the inclusion of tribal art and cave paintings, depicting the story of the shaman and the soldier, with sub-titles accompanying them.
When a Hong Kong magnate sets out on an expedition to find a prehistoric ape in India, he and the others find not only the ape but also a scantily clad woman (Evelyne Kraft) who's known the big guy ever since her plane crashed in the jungle many years earlier.
The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, also no real suspense.
You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea .
You can also forget all about the racist arresting officer investigating the murder case because he's a composite character that includes at least one black detective so racism wasn't at the heart of the case .
The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.
I also truly urge all those film makers out there, not to waste all that money on movies like this one, that don't add anything to the empire of the large screen.
The "Bad Guys" also are incredibly dumb, reminding me a lot of Marv and Harry from Home Alone.
Second, we also see him repeatedly jump in and/or out of windows or literally crashing through doors and rolling in a ball formation into houses.
The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable.
For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'Melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world.
I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me.
Be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.
The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM.
The only part I liked was when Ociee Nash did something heroic and "unladylike" which also pleased people later in the film.
It's also executive-produced by Jennifer Lopez, which explains why it looks like nothing more than one of her music videos.
Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances, and the supporting cast was also quite good.
But you also have to remember that this film isn't meant to be reviewed, nor even taken seriously.
Besides these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor.
This might be the reason why this one is often compared to David Fincher's Seven (which also has two officers investigating mysterious and bizarre serial killer).
By the way, HARLEM RIDES THE RANGE is also on the same DVD.
Excruciating 'tenderfoot western' has young, overeager greenhorn Gary Grimes begging bearded, salty cattle boss Billy "Green" Bush for a job on his cattle drive--to get away from life on the farm with Ma, but also to be a real cowboy, apparently an occupation you take up "when you can't do nothing else."
The music is also a sad intent of what the director thinks futuristic music will be, Paul Van Dyk has probably never seen this movie and if he did he would probably be ashamed.
So, there is also some kind of mysterious body-switching guardian who goes after whoever has the talisman to kill, maim, hurt, whatever.
They said JMV had a huge drinking problem (it's also in the trivia) and that when he got on board the producers or whatever hadn't met him.
This also has my favorite movie-line ever: "JassÃ¥, dÃ¸k sitt og glor?"
There is also no resolution at the end.
OK first off this is a bad film.No way putting that more straight forward.This movie has no story,no good characters,no good dialogue,nothing cool to wow,the effects are the same effects we've seen in zombie films of the 70 and 80,and this film also had special effects on a computer that looked completely fake.This terrible amateur film that never should have seen the light of day.Also this film has a terrible soundtrack.And to end my tyrant of hate for this films let me end with this that i hate that people don't understand what make a good,fun,scary and entertaining film.You have a good story,fun characters that you invest with,good effects not sloppy things like in this film,and slow moving zombies.Zombies shouldn't be running or walking like orcs like from the damm Lord of The Rings films i mean Jesus.Watch Night Of the Living Dead,Dawn of The Dead also the remake,Day Of the Dead,Land Of the Dead and Shaun Of The Dead.Also Zombie 2.These are zombie films not piece of garbage and just to take it as a B movie is not right.Its not even that funny its over the top nonsense.
I learned a lesson that always look how many voted and also read all votes.
The effects, for all their Ray Harryhausen fame, are pretty basic, though there are a lot of them (the ape, but also lions behind glass, and some mutilation to the lions, beware).
and also , the scene at the end where a guy goes crazy is far too long.
This Grade B film offers a rare opportunity to see the underused Anna May Wong in a lead role as a noted Chinese dancer on tour in London who also happens to be the daughter of the sinister Fu Manchu.
Finally, we also get a chance to see the fine actor Bramwell Fletcher in a rather substantial role as one of Fu Manchu's intended victims.
One of Anna May's first vehicles upon her return to the U.S. was DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON, which was also one of the first screen adaptations of a Fu Manchu story from Sax Rohmer's long-running series of books.
I thought I was the only one but talking to people that loved the movie, they also had the same uneasy feeling.
I also expect that it's US/UK translation will lose some of the 'Norwegian' humor, hence it may seem less interesting in it's international release.
The "Angela" aspect of the film is also played down quite a bit, so much so that this really could have been any typical camp slasher unrelated to the "Sleepaway Camp" series.
There's also the basic plot (which is about as basic as you can get).
This iteration not only undermines the silly B-movie cheese that fans have come to expect from the series but it also manages to create an incredibly unlikable cast of losers that you can't cheer for or care about.
Another good reference, was the fact that Robert Hiltzik, who wrote and directed the original film, was also in charge of the same tasks for this sequel.
Leaving aside the bad attempts to create humor, I was also annoyed by the fact that the interaction between the characters was overly violent and exaggerated.
However, Alan is also a disgusting bully who goes around yelling and being a pain to everyone.
While we're at it, I was also very displeased with the ending.
I mean I've seen some doozy of some bad movies but this one takes the cake and not in a good way lol Granted some of the violence was like the rest of the sleepaway camp movies which was cool.But they edited it like crap because half the deaths you didn't even see just an aftermath which absolutely sucked I expected this sucker to be pack full of gore but I didn't see much of that which was also a disappointment for a Sleepaway movie especially.
Her voice is also electronically altered.
also it might have helped if the sound were actually synchronized to the image, but maybe that's just me being picky.
Smith also acts in it!
The supporting cast also stands out, especially Sara Rue and Shawnee Smith.
The sight of Pauline McLynn also brings up memories of "Father Ted" - and the comparisons to this movie aren't favourable to the movie.
and also LSD sequences from 60s films like HALLUCINATION GENERATION or BLONDE ON A BUM TRIP.
The music should also have been canned.
The frequent night shots of the Boston skyline (same shot repeated over and over) were also annoying.
To some people, the other anachronism might also be trivial but I found it highly annoying.
Like his brother, Luke Wilson also shows a little bit of what would come to be his stereotypical role.
But, that aside, she should have been a raving lunatic about her son going with and getting serious about a non-Jewish girl, who is also quite older than her son.
She is also sexless, so the "blossoming" love affair has no spark.
On the other side of the equation, Uma looks her age and then some, and why a 23 year old (with none of the maturity necessary to even appreciate an older woman) would be drawn to her is also baffling.
Don't waste your time, but also don't go out and rent 'You and Me and Everyone We Know' eitherÂ
Whilst daring (plenty of genitalia descriptions) and modern the plot is also derivative.
I was also put off by all of the flat religious jokes.
There are also some very uninteresting subplots involving idiotic friends.
So besides this movie's wildly ludicrous ending and setting it is also not a comment on what women think or feel, but what men believe they should think and feel.
I also believe that Sanada must have had a clause in his contract requiring his thighs to be on display at all times.
The writing was "sooo" atrocious, I realize that screenwriters have a certain latitude when writing the story but, this story was pushing the envelope a wee bit too much: The mother starts in on a long diatribe on the matter of love the moment she meets the husband to be, also the cooking host on TV says this is a "family show" but continually uses the "F" word, or can you just imagine a man stalking a house in the bushes in broad daylight in an upscale neighborhood and all the neighbor could say was "you asshole", also how did they get the time to fix the truck and also not be seen, so it could stop on cue and how did Keeler get the time to get into the back of the van; where were the police and why was the couple moving themselves, don't lawyers make any money in Florida?
If you are from the rest of the world: also watch it.
It also contains a behind the scenes documentary.
The film, also, has little reason to ever be released to DVD; however, inevitably when it is, a price of more than $1.05 is too expensive.
Not only does it lack Reynolds' charismatic poise, but also the uninspired plot rehashes hackneyed higher education humor that "Animal House," "Revenge of the Nerds," "Old School," and "Porky's" have already worn out.
As Van Wilder's Indian protÃ©gÃ© Taj Mahal Badalandabad, Kal Penn has not only stepped into his mentor's shoes but also he has stepped into something infinitely worse--a movie of unmitigated mediocrity.
Meanwhile he also falls in love with our main villain's girlfriend.
Holly Davidson also steals a couple of scenes as the "cockney" member of the group.
Short of changing the actor who plays the lead character for a sequel, the worst thing you can do when making a sequel is get rid of the main character who is in this case also the title character (how can it be called Van wilder 2 if Van Wilder isn't freaking in it?).
A brief synopsis of the story is that Taj goes to England and starts trying to do Van's thing in a posh college, he also somehow gets involved in a dog show.
There are also subplots of Hulk Hogan's character being a has-been (so is he) and the eldest ninja who'll get the heart of this ten-year-old girl.
Jim Varney, who also appeared in this film, has also since died.
In this tremendous film Hulk Hogan plays a really brilliant and inspirational character called Dave Dragon and he runs around being BADASS with his amazing theme tune and also he beats up loads of bad guys with his little chums who all suck at acting.
There's also an off again, on again, thing between the main character and a man who turned her in.
Also the old man appears projected as old in his memories), L'Aventura ( Guerra for starters and also the attempt of the main character to desperately give a meaning to one's life, and the metaphors associated with the sea), Death in Venice (the metaphor of the sea, the relation between an old artist and a child who inspires him to find the meaning of life and love), Eyes Wide Shut (a long shot but the children sale reminded me of that secret organization).
If you like this movie, i can also recommend bad and horrible movies like this one:"Cannibal!
I also like the references to Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Deliverance (at this point, can you even have a killer woodsman story without said references?).
To some extent, this is acceptable, because Yella isn't given any good explanation of what's happening, and so, we can also be left in the dark.
Beyond the predictability of the film, it's also directionless.
These only serve to reinforce the aforementioned disgust, but they also play a dual role of destroying any mystery about the ending and making this one of the most predictable and uninteresting films ever made.
The fact that its size also seemed to change during its scenes was also totally risible.
There were also a number of plot inconsistencies that sprang into glaring obviousness during my torturous observation of this film.
I will also add that I've read the books a few times, so my expectations were probably high, especially after Lord of the Rings.
As a reader, I was also disappointed in the casting and the dramatic differences between the books and the mini-series.
There was also no Christian subtext in the books.
I also don't know why Grace Jones or The Big Show, Paul "Chef Bordee" Wight, agreed to make this.
The dialogue was pretty poor [IMDB lists no "memorable quotes" which in this case would also make a good plot summary].
I liked the Goth(so to speak) girl and the main actress was also pretty good.
He would toss a guy off in front of a subway and say "Get on the right track" OK, with that out of the way, this movie also is not funny.
Josh is one such extremist & joins one such organisation & uses his knowledge of Angela to help further his cause...  Edited, written, co-produced & directed by Matt Fratto who also co-composed the music score & also known under the title Zombies Anonymous I have to say I thought this was crap despite all the glowing reviews from people who seem to have seen it at some obscure film festival & somehow that makes it great.
I also thought the film was incredibly boring with poor narrative & a very bitty plot that falls apart at the end& becomes a mess.
Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny.
I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight.
and also i found funny that same poor pilot was sent for same mission two times.
I also have to mention the so-called twist ending which I figured out a long time before I actually had to sit through it.
She goes on a picnic with her cute mustached boyfriend, bites into a deep fried chicken leg and golly gee, it also is squirting out blood like some weird prank.
Cate Blanchett is also remarkable as Petal.
It's also a superb multi-level drama and a stunningly accurate-seeming (who knows for sure?)
I also feel that there are eventually too many characters introduced: if you left the Langrishe Theatre Group out completely it would make very little difference to the overall plot, and while Brian Cox is as good as I've ever seen him, that particular brand of scenery-chewing tends to rub off on the other actors - and it did.
Donald Pleasence, who is also normally very good, was terrible here.
Nora is a stupid and annoying woman who is also desperate, immature and boring.
our protagonist also gets some time with a seemingly innocent female that claims that she doesn't support the ways of the group she's in.
also this genre of movie is not new.
The husband's in these presentations are usually vacuous, clueless nerds, also the case here.
the only other reason he may have this tattoo is for its connection to the racialist group blood and honor, a group that also uses this logo sometimes.
also, when he attends the "skinhead retreat", they show a female with a completely bald head, as if she just had cancer treatments.
The supporting cast is also terrible, i really cant comment much on them other then saying that most of them would have been best suited in daytime TV dramas.
I also assumed it would be ultra-disturbing, so being somewhat squeamish, I waited a long time to actually see it.
Shouldn't this also be a moment of high tension?
This is, without any doubt, the WORST movie involving airplanes in the entire history of movies, and also one of the WORST movies, period.
But the point is: the guys not only directly copy Air Force One and Executive Decision, but also don't know anything about aviation.
I must also mention the young (non)actor who plays the kid's Arabian slave/friend.
Not only he just can't act, he also looks like a moron with his tongue cut out who smiles all the time (in fact, his tongue was cut out, if I remember correctly... Oooh, those savage Arabians!)
And also this series makes the prequels boring.
But there also are a lot of scenes that are simply annoying!
I also resent the idea that gangs were formed because blacks couldn't get into the cub scouts, that's absurd, silly and utterly ignorant.
There were also some surprisingly humorous moments as the neighbor who is held hostage comments on the situation at hand to a man who is obviously losing his grip on reality.
Like almost all recent Filipino movies, this movie also looked expensive.
But balance must also be made with respect to morals and values.
There were also some scenes where they failed in the sound mixing so you couldn't catch certain lines that might have been funny... but the direction for the actors was just as poor as the technical miscues and failings.
But, secondly, this is also why the film fails morally as well.
Well, everyone else was superb also.
Amazingly a director is also listed, but from what I can tell they pretty much turned on the camera, came back later, took the film to the editing room, forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing.
He was also one of the first to pack his films with gratuitous sex and violence, and you have to give him credit for that.
They were usually also packed with well-known stars such as Gary Cooper and Charlton Heston.
You also have to wonder what the writers were thinking as they were whipping this junk up; didn't they realize that people don't even _remotely_ talk or act like they do in this movie?
There are many wonderful German films out there, but I assume the average person would also find this film dry and unapproachable, as you need a lot of patience to stick with this film.
Moreover, the guy is a bit creepy, and soon it appears his aim is not just to live rent free but also to provoke his landlords into legally punishable actions against him, and maybe even to con his way to gaining possession of their entire house.
For no reason I can succesfully elocute, this movie reminded of "Vamp", which also seemingly took place in a strange hybrid of Los Angeles via Manhattan Meat Packing District.
As part of her business dealings, she also likes to play sex games with her male clients, always beating them at their own game and dumping them when she wants.
This is also typical of the pretentiousness of today's independent films.
I am not only a resident of L.A., but I also work in the music and film business, and I rented this movie to see some of the Australian landscape and the story sounded interesting.
He gets taken into the desert by an Australian geologist, and she also has no idea who this guy is or what he's doing here.
And the death is also very uninteresting.
Better films also.
It also turns out that this private detective, or private dick, named Norm, Mark Davis, is also on to what both Scott and Charlene are up to in their blackmailing Lucinda and is in turn blackmailing them in the fact that their wanted for robbing a rich Texas woman out of her life-savings.
It also appeared that there were multiple crews working on the set because there was a clear difference in the film quality between scenes.
Generally the presence of Yaphet Kotto in a film is enough to spark my interest; prior to seeing this film, Bullock had also begun to have that sort of status for me.
It also diffuses the overall tone making the film feel muddled and unfocused.
I understand that both mothers had a dead child and the modern mother could empathise with the ghost mother, and that she would be afraid that her own Lucy would also disappear.
There's also some pretty HD footage of whales, turtles, sharks and other charismatic marine megafauna, but nothing we haven't seen before in "Blue Planet" or other productions.
Since I also love documentaries and animals, I set out to see it with great enthusiasm.
Needless to say, they were also outraged for being arrested by authorities for attempted murder.
There is also a completely unnecessary section about the author being attacked by flesh-eating disease.
There are so many scenes where we just see him sitting, standing or filming somewhere and ... well, he also likes to be filmed without a T-Shirt.
ending is also markedly different than the novel.
There was no emotion, and so much drama over too little drama..if that makes sense The movie also seemed like it was over the span of a couple months, rather than three years.
It also added in a lot of weird characters and it had little or no detail in the scenes, making the kids seem like total brats.
There is more swearing than I think in any other show I have ever seen, also there is nudity, sex, etc.
The writing is also very good it is simply a great show that mature audiences will probably really enjoy as long as they don't mind all the swearing etc.
'Clockwatchers' is a relationship film which also examines the lives of the new breed of second-class citizen in the late 20th century workplace, the temp.
Besides the obvious fact that they are being locked away from the world, the grandmother also cuts Cathy's beautiful hair and slaps the children and stuff.
She also left room for a sequel.
Of note to movie buffs - Paul Freeman who plays the bad guy Walter Faraday in this movie was also in Raiders of the Lost Ark playing Indy's nemesis Belloq.
Based on Tony Kenrick's novel "Faraday's Flowers" (a better title), this failure from George Harrison's HandMade Films must have been a devastating blow to the ex-Beatle, who also executive produced, co-wrote the score and wrote and performed the songs (which are heavy on the camp-Asian allure).
Adam walking around in shock trying to comply with lunatics while also trying to think of a way out that doesn't kill his family.
At first I hated the Fanny performance - and then I remembered that I hated Fanny, so she was also perfect.
Rigaud is also an important evil element among the Dorrits abroad, where he teams up with the dissipated Henry Gowan - who is also, sadly, never seen again in this film after he marries Pet.
Mrs. Wade of course also plays an important part in the Rigaud - Flintwich - Mrs. Clennam story.
As much as this film was brutalized and its audience cheated by the cruel omissions and alterations in this story, which I have only highlighted here; it must also be noted that by dint of scandalously flawed directing and editing, what remained of the story managed to drag on miserably, with inordinately long pauses between lines, painfully slow pans to make small points,and long, lingering scenes in which nothing actually occurs.
"Demon Seed": Another horror film, this one from the mind Dean Knootz, the novelist who also wrote movies like "Phantoms."
That women can also capable leading violent lives?
A movie that will keep foreign tourists off Cavite or worse, the Philippines as a whole, "Cavite" is more than just a political thriller exposing as well the dreadful scenario in the outskirts of Metro Manila, which can also be the case in most parts of the country, projecting an image ten times worthy of what Claire Danes had to say about Manila.
While this can lay a basis for a far greater funding, it also makes the film less appealing to Swedish viewers, in that it sets it self up for comparison with other movies with far greater funding, for instance the Bourne Identity.
The film is not just about terrorism, but also blends in the grinding poverty in the Phillipines, where Adam (Gamazon) is introduced to the underside of this society children sell their bodies for prostitution, and the odor of a polluted swamp forces him to cover his nose; and the government's campaign against Muslims.
It is also an education to those who don't often focus on the plight of others in the world.
But also, the film tended to drag between the various fight-scenes.
If they both died, that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing, which in the end really made me mad, because that is also what I predicted was going to happen, and if they both didn't die in the "true events", I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.
As somebody already told it here, the DVD's bonus is terrible : slow and uninteresting, it mostly shows that a German/belgian production of that kind can not be really professional as other comics-based movies of the past decade, from the US (Spiderman, Xmen, Hulk, yes, but also older movies like Popeye or Annie) and even from France (Asterix).
Sure, there are the slight touches to the original, like in here there are two fraudsters instead of one....and also, holding to the Indian tradition of movies they must both be of different sexes and must inevitably fall in love and have a child...not to forget the extremely well choreographed dance sequences in between, which is probably the only thing original in the movie....  don't get me wrong, if you consider Bollywood alone, this is one of THE BEST MOVIES...unhappily, i'd already watched the Hollywood version...  if i ever watch a bollywood movie that's not a "remix" of a Hollywood one, i'll give it a ten no matter how crap it is.....
The directors managed with limited means, not only money but also cinematic, i.e.
She meets yet another person - a male - who had also run away from his house - for again the same reason - Mediocre Life style.
The soundtrack is also terrible.
Amitabh Bachchan also stars, and while I can't really criticize his performance, his role is terribly flat.
The finesse of taking shots by director Shaad Ali is also missing (compared to his previous "Saathiya").
Even, neat performances by the trio (Amitabh, Abhishek and Rani) also do not bring any magical moments, so vital for such film, which basically works on treatment of certain scenes.
As the professor sets off to work, he and his wife are approached by their elderly neighbor Mrs. Niemoller who complains timidly that the boys in the neighborhood, including Timmy, make too much noise when they play and also heedlessly trample her garden.
In his stunned grief he turns to drink and is also given solace by a colleague (Nancy Davis), a war widow who empathizes with his loss.
There's also scenes of some girls kissing each other & two girls in skimpy swimwear about to wrestle each other in jelly but they never do.
Mr. Clarkson (Henry Stephenson) is kind and encouraging enough to her, but his wife (Mary Boland) is a noisy, irritating, no-talent singer who treats Hilda and her other maid Annie (Una O'Connor) as little better than slaves; and Mrs. Clarkson is especially jealous of Hilda, as she also aspires to a singing career, and is eagerly awaiting a visit by London-based composer and impresario Sir Julian Kent (Conway Tearle).
There is also a romantic interest, a cigarette girl named Irene (Kelly MacDonald), who is rather pretty but stands out no more than any other of today's actresses.
My partner and I won tickets to see the Sydney sneak preview so off we went last night (Monday 16th October)   Let me begin by saying 'that is 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back"   I was set to see a great Aussie flick; instead I found it mind numbingly boring, predictable 'comedy' (and I use that term lightly)   It was more of a reflection on a horde of has been 'comedians' (and I use that term lightly also) who have unceremoniously used their names and positions on radio stations around Australia to tout the movie as being the best thing since sliced breadÂ   Suggest you spend 88 minutes watching the grass grow than see this movieÂ   I think I would have enjoyed having my fingernails ripped off one by one followed by an acid bath more than that ghastly piece of 'Australian Film making'
It also makes one wonder just how shallow the Filipino-American acting pool is in this country.
The cellphone also allows the action to travel which is technically more visually interesting than watching Colin Farrell sweat it out in one spot (a la "Phone Booth").
Almost all of the action is shot from either the Adam's POV (self-held camera) or the POV of the cameraman (also hand-held) gamely following behind him.
I can understand the stylish, 1970s-vibe it tries to recreate, and I can also appreciate the nods directed toward Peckinpah and Boorman.
Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, who is an excellent Spanish actress that I last watched in "The Machinist" with Christian Bale and was also in other English language movies like "A Walk in the clouds" plays Gary Oldman's wife.
LluÃ­s Homar was brilliant, in my opinion, and also the little girl.
In "Cinderella man" with Russel Crowe, he was excellent and also in "In America," but in this movie, he was only interesting when he was not in a scene with Gary Oldman but in scenes with the other actors, he steals every scene.
Harrison's character shares the same name as the film's screenwriter, Charles Dyer, who also penned the stage play upon which the movie is based.
Supposedly according to the gay author, Harrison and Burton did it only for the huge paychecks of 1 millions dollars a piece which by todays standards would be the 20 million monster paydays you see the big stars get.Also,Harrison supposedly was disgusted with some of his dialog and left for Italy -only to come back when he was threatened with a lawsuit from the movie studio and Burton also only stuck around since his lover Elizabeth Taylor was filming a movie close by at the time.
Boys in the Band, like this film, also sends the message that gay people hate themselves and their lives.
A meeting with his adult daughter is brought up, but that plot point is dropped also.
Well, I was pretty disappointed by this one and also pretty surprised by the ovation it received in the web sites I've been browsing after viewing the movie, and that's the main reason I react here.
The guy was also too tall to play James Dean.
his relationship with christine white also never seems to have a reason for ending, and seems much more prominent than the one with Pier, in the film.
- Only extremely stupid (which Derek was not) or psychotic (which he also wasn't) guys would store their ex-girlfriend's pictures in various states of undress on an easily accessible item like a PDA.
But this fake interview is so that Murphy's character can actually gain info about her boyfriend's exes so that she can find more out about him while also doing the background for a potential show about little black books, but then it turns out later she isn't going to do the story about the black books, but then we aren't really sure.
I never found the magnetic stereo tracks, but the print also had the usual monaural optical track, of very good quality.
I also couldn't understand why they would have cast Val Kilmer in the lead.
The concept is also not fully developed.
The other actors do well also but Isabelle stands out.
There were also plenty of chances for both of the actresses to show their boobs on screen, but somehow they managed to pass it up.
He also has his forehead pressed up against it.
The driver, dweeby, pimple-faced Drew(Ryan Hulshof)also gets the gang lost, having missed the highway leading them into hicksville, where a sinister farmhouse and massive barn reside on a country road.
also, the killer looks like the killer from house of wax, another piece of crap.
HBO has also produced some of the best television ever made, The Sopranos, Oz, Rome.
The show also takes an new look of the west, it was not a glamorous world, but also looks at the influence of big business and not just individuals.
The character Alma also suffer from a similar problem, but Molly Parker is a pretty decent actress.
Then the rest of the movie is also the girls getting knocked out by little punches the killer gives them.
she is also emotionally closed off, annoying and, lets be honest, has a deeper voice than Barry white!
The "trained assassins" (according to the movie) were people in generic thug costumes and had no weapons, they also got beat up by a CGI dog that was movie faster than a dog physically could.
Oh, he also chases cats.
But this being a children's cartoon means you've got one of those violence is wrong messages and unfortunately there's also one of those dreamy endings.
Similarly, the overall plot is also assumed to be known.
There is also plenty of nudity, which I need not say is a good thing.
But since I have seen worse pictures (at least you can see they're trying here and my b-movie fable might also play a role), I gave it 3 stars!
Here the hero Theo also goes to join a contingent of youths taken to be sacrificed to the minotaur.
He is also helped by a woman - the consort of the evil Bad Guy.
I also understand that America is not always right.
He's also convinced that his girlfriend, who was sacrificed three years earlier, might still be alive somehow.
There's also a woman who screams a lot - not just a regular scream, but a long, long scream.
For a much better PM vehicle starring our Gary, check out instead the OTT and outrageous, Rage and also Riot - both much, much better flicks.
As a person, Uwe Boll also repulsed me.
While talking to Taskin about the Death Touch case, Bill says he also cares about Amanda, though we never really find out exactly who Amanda is from what I can tell.
We also learn here they suspect a man named Louis to be the Death Touch killer.
We also learn here that he has a son he has not seen in some time.
There was also over-use of special effects ( useless in a film of this kind ) and to boot the whole picture "looked" over-synthetic without natural colours and over dominance of blue and yellow hues.
We are also introduced to three main characters from the Viet Cong, but their development is even worse - with one character who has been given a very clichÃ©d story about why he is so angry at the US, and another female character who obviously has reservations about the war, but this is never really developed any further.
(also, many of the actors don't appear to have been trained how to engage the enemy, or how to hold and shoot their weapons as soldiers of the Vietnam war era would have been).
I actually had to start this movie twice because I stopped it at the first try after 15 minutes not being able to concentrate on the "storyline"(there actually is not really much of a storyline to begin with).What I am trying to get across is that this is just not a movie that captures you in the first couple of minutes and also this is definitely not a horror movie.
Another maddening element are certain jumps in the time line that make it even harder to follow the already chaotic "storyline" I found also utterly unrealistic that a concerned father would leave his terminally ill wive and his deranged son who, as he notes earlier is "not very good with strange people".
It says "Terror by good intentions" and not only does this simple sentence summarize the whole plot, it also accurately describes the entire film production!
There also were no jeeps riding down two tracks in the jungle, for the same obvious reason.
And not just the fastest either, the Italian movie industry, especially in the late 1970's and early 1980's, was probably also one of the most prolific and could churn out seemingly hundreds of films on any given theme (the theme being usually dictated by what happened to be successful in Hollywood at the time) Take for instance the success of George A Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (which was released in Italy as 'Zombi') Within no time at all, enterprising Italian producers had released a whole slew of cheaply made (but often rather watchable) virtual copies of the film.
From what I can piece together the family moves into this house out in the countryside so the dad can research the death of a colleague who also lived in the same house.
But no matter how you look at it, they all die and you'll also die a little inside when you go to google this house so you can stay there for a night and make your own bootleg ghosthunters TV show and try to sell it to the travel channel only to find out that you can't even find this house because nobody cared enough to put it's real location anywhere on the internet.
The killing scenes are graphic and bloody; they're also extremely overdone, and more silly than scary.
The director also used other amateurish tricks like facial closeups and excessive blood all over the place.
I should also say logic, but thats not to be expected from a Fulci-flick.
They also have an infant child, Bob, who appears to be quite androgynous.
Thanks to the ludicrous 'voice overs' provided by a woman who also dubs the voice for a little girl, she makes Bob look and sound incredibly stupid every time he opens his mouth to say something.
This is also just one of the many countless incidents contained in the movie that bare absolutely no relevance whatsoever on the plot, including a scene where Anne is cleaning up a trail of blood off the kitchen floor and an inane second story-line involving a prior occupant of the house who committed suicide after claiming the house was 'possessing' him!
Cinematic ally, there's no real reason to watch it, but there's also no real reason not to.
Dwight Yoakum's performance is also good but Levon steals the movie.
!The acting I do have to admit was well,but the story line,characters and death scenes were either stupid,mediocre,or unexplainable.There are other films that are the same genre and fall under the same category as this one,and they all are way more superior.The concept however,was still just a bit creepy.If what had happened in the film happened to you,you would have to put yourself in the main character's shoes.Most of the ways people died were also avoidable.It just seems as if the director told them that they needed to act so stupid in order to make people like this film.Avoid this film as much as possible,but if you absolutely feel the urge to pick it up off the shelves one day,I warn you with the deepest concerns a person can have for another.
Rocket Power is basically a show about four typical preteens.They are the sports fanatics who love to be better then the others.We got Otto,an airhead who wants to go big.Reggie,who is the smart reporter,but also the surfer girl.Twister is the silly,random jackass of the group and Sam is the super smart kid,who has more book smarts then street smarts.As if I haven't seen this before!
She also has some stupid magazine called "The Zine".
The show also had minimal morality.
It's worth remembering that Hamilton was an iconic photographer of his time and experimented with taking his art into the movie field, in many ways pioneering the penchant for photographers in the adult industry to also dabble in video work.
Aside from the above complaint, this documentary is also kind of boring.
Apart from kidnapping and sacrificing people, Reed Weller also likes to boast and he does so by stating his power is absolute.
Evil Altar offers not only this intriguing plot but also some blood, especially near the end of the movie.
There is also a man with a hatchet embedded in his back, one throat slashing (not too convincing, I'm afraid) and one nice stunt involving The Collector being set afire and thrown into a swimming pool.
What I also found annoying and a complete waste of my life was the little scenes here and there that were totally irrelevant and added nothing to the plot or character development e.g.
Then I also thought, "No way is this gonna fly with the Catholic Church"  Please tell me if someone out there remembers this......my wife does!
It is also obvious that the movie ran out of money before it could be completed (or I hope it did) as the ending doesn't tie in very well with the prologue.
As if that wasn't enough the family also must deal with a real-estate developer who wants to buy their land.
And when they're left to die all on their own a thousand miles away from home, they don't feel like heroes at all and pride and glory are about the last things that they think ofÂ   The whole pointlessness of war is a constant and reoccurring theme in TUNNEL RATS and just like war itself ain't exactly fun and enjoyment, this film is also far from being your typical good time bubblegum blockbusterÂ TUNNEL RATS is very slow-paced, very raw, very dirty, very brutal, very pessimisticÂ and very honest.
Few directors can pull this off successfully (Walter Hill comes to mind) There's also a romance between Lana and a Chinese American that goes nowhere and could have easily been left on the cutting room floor.
I vaguely recall having also seen the two follow-ups as a youngster and, of course, they never really stuck with me since...
That also tells you something about the quality of this lamebrain effort.
The movie could also have benefited from the injection of a little more grindhouse content to liven things up.
(as the cover also warns), I hate to imagine how lousy the version they did want us to see is.
This is also one of those movies where the characters act like a bunch of idiots--they know they're trapped in a house with a maniac yet the split up in separate rooms and one decides to take a shower!
In a way, the film is a rehash of Honda's own MONSTER ZERO (1965), which I watched some time ago Â where you also had an interplanetary attempt at world domination that saw the involvement of a clutch of Toho Studios monsters.
Finally perhaps its most amusing elements to me were the fact that the island personnel (channeling the monsters' individual movements on a monitor) are able to judiciously cross-cut, for suspense purposes, between attacker and prey (a moving train) during a demonstration; the film-makers could have fitted the aliens with make-up or, at least, a mask so as to hide their all-too-obvious Asian countenance (there's no suggestion in the script that that they may have adopted such a disguise in order to go undetected among the Earthlings); also, for a kiddie film, a lot of the human characters are heard cursing the aliens (sure, it's in Japanese, but the implication is unmistakable).
They also feel that the FNG's aren't worth a salt unless they've proved themselves in combat, but that's hard to do sometimes as that they'll probably be killed in the first week, so why bother getting to know them.
Firstly I should admit that I do like the war genre but also realize that like anything else there are good ones and bad ones.
(No one seems to object her joining the group, guess they got tired of the sausage fest)  6 - The good guys (now 3) encounter a fourth acolyte (also a kungfu master) who's kinda mean to them at first, but now he's nice.
It's also definitely a war movie in the true sense of the genre, with heavy political undertones.
But, he is also a pilot and established wood designer.
This way to go would also have been fine if it had been taken all the way, in stead of betting on two horses like this.
That said, Cheerleader Ninjas is a movie that's not only terrible, it's also not the least bit entertaining or humorous.
It also manages to be offensive to women, homosexuals, teenagers, African-Americans, the Catholic Church, and many others.
He has formed an unholy union with a Catholic religious nut who operates the reform school..she believes the Internet is harmful to society and wishes to destroy it forever, while also desiring to quell the sinful image of scantily clad cheerleaders in the process.
We also can't help catching a little spin here on 'King Kong' (1933), for in this case the girl has a thing for the gorilla too!
So does Lowe, except that he also does a fine job of looking bored while he's making this dud.
Sexual Perversity is an intriguing name but it's also a bit too harsh.
The movie is also poorly paced and, at about 95 minutes, it's about 20 minutes too long.
If you want to see a cheesy spider movie that's also entertaining, check out The Giant Spider Invasion.
We're also treated to a stellar performance by Charles Frank, who plays Joe, and who RUNS everywhere shouting and waving his arms.
Deborah Winters & Charles Siebert were also in another film together (the same year?)
"Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo" is not really unwatchable, but it's also not particularly good, unless you're up for a nostalgic "movie of the week" fix.
It is also interesting to note that the general socialist drift of this film has also been shown to be wrong.
Plot summary: Jody(Tyrese) is a 20-something slacker who still lives at home with his mother but is also the father of two children from different mothers, drives his girlfriend's car like he owns it, and basically is living off them both without a actual job.
Baby Boy not only lacks a conscious, it also lacks the realism that John Singleton's earlier movies had.
it also portrays people driven by base desires who live within a fantasy exemplary in the neighborhood without cops, garbage in the streets, druggies or prostitutes, only and fresh lawns with plush green grass, and gardens.
I have two friends who also bought the same film (it was going cheap on a street corner) and they too were unable to finish watching it.
So where could he stash 300K in that length of time where his two partners also wouldn't have known about it?
It also has a problem finding a true voice, which is something a film of this nature hinges on.
This strange idea seemed to impress most of the reviewers but I couldn't get into it--mostly because it all seemed rather fake and I also thought that children playing war and acting as if it's all lots of fun just seemed a bit grotesque.
Although I know it was meant as an allegory about war and heroism and the futility of war--it seemed like it could also be taken as a pro-war film as well!
But it was also sappy from start to finish--and also made war seem pretty cool--like a recruitment film for the next war.
I also have to say I was greatly disappointed with the Jags.
Characters also seemed to be very stiff and movements seemed very unnatural.
In fact, they're extremely generic: we have the main girl, who's extremely emotional in spite of being part of the film's version of SWAT (who also carry out CIA-type missions).
huge spoiler alert.i'm about to give away the whole movie,in the hopes that no one else will ever watch this piece of excrement.a man gets off on taping people and getting their reactions before killing them, usually in a horribly disgusting way.oh yeah, he also talks to his victims as if it's all nothing more than a stroll in the park.he gives them little pep talks.
that's pretty much the whole story.Oh, yeah we also get to hear him narrate too.what a joke.this is without a doubt the most vile,wretched thing anyone could make into a movie.it is not thrilling or exciting in any way,but stomach churning.less than 0/10
There is also an emphasis on taking the horror to its "logical" extreme by exposing the viewer to total violence and sadistic torture - note for instance the current trend of torture porn with films like Hostel and Saw.
It also wasn't entertaining.
He also is well cast.
His parents also seemed to love Pam like a daughter.
History seems to repeat itself, as Graf Saxon's own daughter also falls victim to an assault.
With a taste of Frankenstein, this film also shows characters who show little or no change of attitudes at all.
So, this had all the elements of a good movie, and this also had a lot of elements of a "so bad it's good movie", so I have to wonder...how did it turn out to be just plain BAD?
I was expecting much, much more given IMDb score... Subject of the movie also added to the expectations.
This remains evident even when all the occurrences depicted here were unfolding,   Story now skewed in her behalf, it's also boring as well.
To this end, he has also left her 2 tickets for a bus tour of the English countryside.
The settings and costumes were also impeccable.
The story itself was also very intriguing, with many secrets from the past being brought to the surface (a very common theme in Agatha Christie's novels).
I also found the solution to the mystery to be very gratifying, and it completely surprised me!
'Salaam Namaste' also seems to try too hard to have a little bit of everything.
Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta are also victims of the overacting bug.
But, I must also say that I was offended by it, disgusted by the depravity of most of its characters, and perplexed by the actions of others.
I believe that film is the perfect medium to deal with such difficult topics as rape and misogyny, but I also believe "Deadgirl" is not the type of film to do it.
This project also is meant as a homage to John Woo (which Max Payne is based on)!
Their Captain (Harry Gorsuch) is piling on the pressure, and they also have to deal with a sudden spate of suicides among criminals.
(There are some people in this country that match that description, but not every single person) The direction of this film was also poor and it left decent actors (not the best, but what kind of talent would sign on to this project) with no chance of helping the film.
Wesley Snipes has been largely responsible for how good they are, but there are also smart script-writers and effective directors involved.
Whats even worse is he's still training in the same stupid plimsols that gave him a gigantic blister in the 2nd training sequence, I also don't see how skipping or running up steps is going to help train for running on mostly flat roads.
I was also rather surprised at how liberal our censors appear to have become.
running the marathon and the troubles of this was also completely trivial.
It also makes little sense.
The bit parts are played by the usual assortment of jobbing British actors, also on autopilot.
Regrettably any negative preconceptions of this film are confirmed from the outset, for example, in sticking firmly to genre conventions and expectation the film quickly establishes David as an unfit wimp by him being outwitted by a shop-lifting transvestite (clearly only a transvestite to elicit a smile), it also stereotypes his Pakistani landlord to the point of it being cringe worthy and it reacquaints us with the clichÃ©d "smooth boyfriend" character - brilliantly played by Hank Azaria.
That said, his penchant of filling the plot with as many monsters and weird situations as his imagination could conceive is already well in evidence, as we not only get two werewolves for the price of one but there's also a mad doctor and his female assistant involved, who both just happen to be vampires!
), he's also chained up for a good part of the second half, as if Naschy was as yet unsure how to use his 'creation'.
In fact, the vampires dominate most of the proceedings during the latter stages of the film, while early on there's also excess footage featuring a gypsy couple (who, for plot purposes, unwittingly revive the werewolf which subsequently 'marks' Waldemar Daninsky); however, despite the limited resources at the film-makers' disposal, the Gothic atmosphere is well up to par for the course (though dissipated somewhat by the faded print I watched!
It may very well be independent, but it also is independent of talent in the writing, production value, and acting.
I happen to be gay, but, refuse to enjoy something simply because its subject matter contains characters that also happen to be gay.
Someone who has just come into full physical development, someone who is fresh, lean, and taut, can be pretty exciting eye candy for more people than government and cultural leaders would like to admit -- and it's also a far cry from pedophilia (key term being "full physical development").
But it is also clear that the population of adult men and women who do not see this in their pursuits of adolescents have severe emotional blocks of their own.
There are also some howlingly racist (and tastelessly unfunny) gags involving a black man who obligingly lets the inmates crack open walnuts on top of his head.
There is also little or no attempt to hide how low budget this film was made for.
There are also a few chunks of angst thrown in, and one painfully melodramatic reminiscence scene which might have worked if we cared more about the characters.
If they had dialled it down a kilotonne it could have been at least comparable to "A Very British Coup", which was also a lefty daydream but much more realistic.
Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to DVD fare these days , and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway .
We also have the very implausible travel from central London to the airport (let's say Heathrow for arguments sake) within 5 minutes of receiving a call.
We also have terrible American accents, a young girl who's posher than the Queen, but lives in Elephant & Castle.
The plot was also extremely poor, boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before.
As stated above, pricing is important, in the market world, it is considered to be the most important aspect and also the hardest thing to arrive to.
Michael Rafiel's relationship as well as how he met Verity Hunt has been changed also to an untasty dish served cold.
Richard Grant, also a good actor, is also wasted as Miss Marple's nephew, Raymond.
I also didn't know at the onset that it was about "a post 9-11 New York."
It also didn't really come together.
The photography of the base jumpers was good and the sky diving also, but thatâs pretty standard stuff on IMAX these days.
I usually enjoy the more intelligent sit-coms but also enjoy some of the stupid ones.
She's also foolish and silly.
Great scripts and great acting make for great entertainment and the camera work is also excellent.
But I also like consistency and this movie just seems to have no guidelines of what should be fantasy and what should be reality.
There is also a great underwater scene where Jack Skellington makes a cameo appearance as a pirate.
Do not be fooled by the cast as they were also somehow fooled by the script.
The screenwriters have also shamelessly recycled one of the classic screen thriller moments from the hall of mirrors scene in "The Lady From Shanghai."
Eddie Burns (Ving Rhames) lost the use of his left arm in the line of duty, but also played a role in the death of an innocent man that could really amount to murder.
We also have to endure a close up of a human erection slipping in and out of a human front bottom later on so you have been warned   As for the rest of Kottering's hand at the helm I wonder if he's a native English speaker ?
These trinkets also make Noah, a dim bulb at school, turn into a nationwide science fair champion (since he can communicate with spiders and make then spin webs of his choosing).
He also has become quite an artist, creating drawings of 12th century Tibetan tapestries and other obscure works of art.
She is also designated as a "very special child" by the flaky fiancÃ©e, (Kathryn Hahn, TV series "Crossing Jordan"), of Noah's new age science teacher, Larry White (Rain Wilson, TV series "Six Feet Under," "The Office").
She also shows a brilliant knack for comic timing, by quipping at one point, " I'll stop off on my way back.
The aforementioned flat chested redhead also provides most of the nudity, while the buxom and shapely Melody remains fully clothed throughout?
But don't worry, it gets worse... Of course, as all films showing a minority, this one is also full of whining about how gypsies are oppressed, etc.
In original language (Hungarian that is), characters have the voices of some famous Hungarian actors who also appear in the movie as they were all digitalized.
As for leading man John Halliday, he also overdid it quite a bit.
It reminded a whole lot of George M. Cohan's Seven Keys To Baldpate which also takes place on a windswept stormy night with a group of strange characters intruding on someone's privacy.
I also thought how perfect Leslie Howard or Ronald Colman would have been for the part.
I also love how the  hero/heroine are thrown out of the resort one scene & the next  they go back to have a drink.
They also stuck in 'live-togethers' in the role of a teacher that encourages life styles that never work, as if that aberration of society can be profitable.
There's also a half-baked romance that starts to develop between them, but it's not really followed through with.
There's also a monster egg hunt at the resort (don't ask), a police shoot out, one topless scene (from Ms. Huntly during a topless photo shoot) and overuse of a fog machine during all of the night scenes.
The film also feels about 20 minutes too long and the pacing is just horrid.
First of all, I have seen only some parts of the last episode and also some small parts of other episodes (more then it deserves).
I also read the novel.
Gavroche's role is also misrepresented.
It is also very odd to make Cosette the narrator, as she is deliberately one of the weaker, more insipid characters in the novel.
Jodie Moore, an Australian-born hottie who also dabbles in porn, had a couple of decent scenes.
Nicole Oring, playing Ben's hot Asian assistant, was great also.)
They also encounter several silly creatures.
Produced & directed by Al Adamson who also has a small role during the opening sequence as a Vampire, Horror of the Blood Monsters is as bad as you could possibly imagine & perhaps even worse.
The planet is also affected by "chromatic radiation," so that the inserted B&W scenes could be variously tinted red, yellow, blue or green.
And if this individual also is a teacher doing so with a student, salt and iodine should be added liberally to the resulting wounds.
The bum who went home sleeping stars in some "comedy moment" scene, and there is also some hillbilly redneck trying to chase youngsters away from his property ( a character reminiscent of minor Laurel&Hardy supporting actors ) who provides comedy relief.
I also did not appreciate the fact that he did not admit to the fact that it is a remake of The Miracle Worker.
One this movie is lifted from the Oscar nominated "The Miracle Worker" which also won the best actress that year.
Well you could say that remakes also get an Oscar, nut it needs some originality.
I like Jack Lemmon (see "The Apartment")but not in this movie.I also like Carol Burnett,but she misses the mark this time.The sex of the characters that Jack Lemmon and Susan Sarandon portray are flipped in this movie.I think the characters were funnier and ahead of their time in "His Girl Friday".
There's also a pretty disposable appearance by Carol Burnett as a hooker!
Asylum should also be punished for helping to release this garbage.
I am thinking it must have been shot on a really tight budget as we were constantly shown the same shots from the outside, and also the same areas inside the building, despite the building being huge.
The lead actress, who must be the girlfriend of the director since she also stars in the directors only other film Southern Nights which never even received a DVD release, has all the screen presence of a pile of wet cement, she sleeps walks her way through the film.
The director, who is also credited as the editor fails once again by failing to pace the film.
The direction is also rather uninspired, and with much of the action taking place in the dark, the film is a real strain on the eyes (and one's patience); it also makes seeing what might've been some half-decent scenes of gore almost impossible to make out.
Rider Strong(..who also appears in 2007's "8 films to die for" entry BORDERLAND)has a strong role as the aggressive Ford, the kind of character who thinks mostly of saving his own skin.
I also felt that it was all too predictable that Victoria would be rescued when she was captured, and then she would be the only one with the brains to overcome the obviously stupid cannibals, which she is able to do through the simple trick of not showing her drugging bodies.
I also realize that anytime you read a story and create your own image of things, a movie will have a hard time living up to your creation.
It also has some twists that may actually surprise you in a good way.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
They're also quite secondary.
I am a fan of horror movies and also low-budget movies, but unfortunately "The Inn" is an awful mess.
The time-line is also confused, mixing day and night, i.e., in one scene it is day, and the next one it is night.
It also seems like Hester, the character played by De Carlo, is into dabbling with Satanism and black magic and uses to dog to kill off her relatives.
The plot also seems muddled and the motivation for the killings is unclear.
Greta also has voyeuristic tendencies, because she observes a young couple having (overlong) sex not once but twice.
She also dabbles in black magic of some kind.
The dog also has one on its collar.
The dog also does things in slow motion.
Tommy also offends her Father, Mr. Durant (Hobart Bosworth), who he has replaced on the team.
Update#1 : I've just read that this unspeakable piece of rubbish also won a British Comedy award beating The Incredibles and Sideways.
Writer/director Annie Griffin is responsible for one of my favourite TV series, "The Book Group", a funny and often moving tale of an odd bunch of literary fans, also set in Edinburgh.
When I also realised that I hadn't laughed once in 30 minutes, I concluded that it was time to turn the TV off.
The episodic plot is also patchy - some of the events that befall certain characters have nothing at all to do with the Edinburgh Festival and seem almost to have been put in as time-fillers.
The Last Mimzy doesn't pander needlessly to its core audience, but at the same time it also has a good accomplishment in that it also has an appeal to adults, or at least those that have passed that age of adolescence and look back on childhood with levels of nostalgia and relief that it's over.
It also puts ET to a certain test: can the little creature from another world that needs to get home kind of story hold up to quasi (actually precise) psychedelia?
This strikes up the attention of his parents as well as his science teacher (Rainn Wilson), who also knows of the symbols Noah makes up.
But after a power outage- it also happens to be a generator that Noah conjures- gets the attention of the government, not sure what exactly is going on.
The two kids are also very good at playing their parts, with Wryn as Emma very adept at being vulnerable and smart, and O'Neil being almost too close to looking like the boy Elliot in ET, however not without his own strengths.
Things also go badly for Banek at his hearing.
He is, after all, subject to severe provocation, not only from Banek, but also from his ex-wife Valerie and from a bureaucratic court system that seems unwilling to make allowances in his favour, and he does have at least one redeeming characteristic in that he is a devoted father to his sons.
Although he is not mired in outright criminality quite as deeply as some of his colleagues, especially the senior partner Stephen Delano, who also happens to be his wife's father, Banek's moral standards are nevertheless low.
Affleck seems to have a talent for picking the wrong films (see also "Reindeer Games", "Pearl Harbor", "200 Cigarettes" and several others).
The main character is annoying and not likable but also doesn't serve to make anyone laugh even once, it is just not a funny show or funny main character.
The other characters also are not funny in the least.
The acting of most of the characters was mostly bad: Oliver Kalkofe's strong side obviously is NOT acting, Oliver Welke's (who I like as person) performance was terrible, Bastian Pastewka wasn't too funny nor convincing also.
Not helpful was in my opinion also to include "favorite characters" of the former TV shows of the cast like the roses selling pakistani.
And yes - I could have done without the musical scene also.
Those people will love this movie, where Kalkofe doesn't only play the leading role, but has also co-written the script.
It does start off in a rather amusing fashion, the first seven minutes (which also include the starting credits) promise a funny spoof in the tradition of ZAZ films like "The Naked Gun".
The acting was also not impressive but whoever expected it to be was out of their mind.
Works also in Spanish.
My wife and I also liked that the language and situations were truly appropriate for a family film.
Of course, Al is also very intelligent and frequently finds himself surrounded by idiots - a couple of said idiots wonderfully played by William Sanderson and W. Earl Brown.
(There were also choice bit roles by James Elliott of "Jag," Bob Balaban and Paul Dooley and they didn't recognize them either.)
I also know I have no business writing a script.)
Okay, in addition to being completely hilarious, this is also the most pretentious movie ever made, (aside from The Matrix Reloaded).
But it is also sad to think of what they could have been.
Not only is the story of two brothers who love the same woman extremely boring, it is also very reactionary: the film basically sez that women ruin men's lives, it also sez "thou shalt not go to bed with your brother's wife"... certainly, a good piece of advice, but sit two hours in the cinema just to hear that?
Not only are we not given their motives for the paths they take, but it also seems that the characters themselves don't really reflect on what happens.
You will also see a lot of nudity.
Jordan doesn't know how to direct this sort of material; it pales in comparison to Mary Harron's insanely secure hand over "American Psycho", also based on an Ellis novel.
The attempts at building a camaraderie between the gangsters also falls short and shows clearly that too many people were involved writing this movie.
The soundtrack also seemed completely out of place as they tried to squeeze as many death metal songs in, in an attempt to improve this terrible film i can only assume.
Oh, he also happens to have a really hot nympho girlfriend who gets naked in the shower in a few soft-focus flashback scenes designed, (I presume) for the red-blooded male viewer to give his eyes a rest from women so fat it looks like they're going to burst through the telly.
She also changes accents several times throughout the course of the movie.
There's also a rather nice father-daughter dynamic going on, with Robin trying to shelter his daughter from the dangerous life he lives.
There were also scenes of Chopin in a room with gray and green walls, which were the true colors of the wallpaper he chose for his apartment in Paris.
I also liked the fact that the actress playing Sand in this film actually resembled the real woman, whereas in IMPROMPTU, Judy Davis looked nothing like her.
She also falls in like with a young man and then creates a scene in a library when he won't just drop everything and have sex with her.
I also was frustrated by the way the main characters are presented to the audience, already bickering and irrational.
Her 10 year old brother (who loves more advanced movies such as "Lord of the Rings") also enjoyed the movie.
The narrative builds an increasingly complex story woven around the central female and male characters and also utilises 3-4 key locations including a coffee shop and sculpture park.
She also, had no idea how to hold a bow, though she was more convincing.
Elaine Stritch was certainly crotchety, but also not especially funny as Miss Crock.
This movie also has Sherman Hemslely in a rather large role so once I saw that flash on the screen, I knew the film would be kind of generic.
This Canadian production has Martin Newlin credited as director but that's just a pseudonym for Fabrizio Laurenti & the IMDb also claims Joe D'Amato had something to do with it but the version I saw only had one credited director, anyway this has a pretty bad reputation & I can't really say it's undeserved.
They also make a (toy) helicopter explode by pulling it about two feet to the ground.
Though thoroughly inept, it's also boring, clichÃ©d, slow-moving and far too tame to really be enjoyable.
I'm also not sure of Joe D'Amato's actual involvement since his name (or "David Hills" for that matter) is nowhere to be found in the credits.
The birds were creative, short, chubby, but with an annoying repetitive chirp, they were also a bluish color and odd looking eliminating questions like, "What kind of birds are those?"
I also don't think the title was appealing, it sounds kind of awkward and I didn't see the connection to the film.
It's supposed to be a riot, but Tashlin, who also adapted the script from George Axelrod's play, can't seem to bring the material (both farcial and cynical) into a cohesive whole.
And has anybody noticed that the temperatures of Mars, Jupiter and Neptune have also been steadily increasing?
But they also wanted to make a movie that would be appreciated by more wholesome folks by simply re-editing the nude scenes out, and voila, a movie that can be played on some family network.
It also blithely ignores the speed with which the King degenerated from being the athletic, idealistic, hero of his people to the bloated, diseased, morally bankrupt tyrant he became, as the consequence of his desperate desire for an heir.
"The Tudors" also take generous liberties with actual historical events, characters and costuming.
Amazingly, the right actor was right under their noses: Steven Waddington, who played the (3rd) Duke of Buckingham, is not only red-haired, but looks a heck of a lot more like Henry than Rhys Meyers and also has more the right build for the role.
Unfortunately, although the Tudors are doubtlessly a visual triumph, they are also a fiasco in terms of pace, dramatic development and characterization Â that is, the things that matter.
The handling of Henry's divorce is also problematic.
It's also great that they depict Gwyn and even the aging Robin as people who have a lot of spunk.
It also fails as a drama because we really get no explanation for the behavior of the characters.
I was also curious ( Apart from giving the movie a snappy name ) why he goes by the name " Mad Dog " if he's so mild mannered ?
The producers ( One of whom is Martin Scorsese ) might think they're making a movie for everyone but I promise if you like one aspect of how the movie plays out you'll also be very irritated by the other aspects and when you make a movie with something for everyone you're in serious danger of making a movie with something for no one
The film is no doubt going for some form of quirkiness, but it is also clear that they are going for a serious meaningful angel as well - and neither works in the end.
In my mind the romance at the end is also totally unbelievable.
The reporter races to prevent the murder before it can occur, and also help the D.A.
I also found the romance between Jones and ethereal beauty Yvette Mimeux to be entirely believable and sweet, and ultimately emotionally painful for the characters.
What also drew me to see it was the comment that it is the scariest movie since The Shining.
Jack Palance also returns, not as Curly but as his brother Duke.
BTW, this film is also known as BLOOD SHED.
Belle Mitchell, who previously had appeared in House of Frankenstein and The Beast With Five Fingers, also stars as the landlady of the boarding house where the title character stays.
The scene in the beach after a refusal to kill one Yakuza boss is especially memorable and also close to the work of Takeshi Kitano.
The film has also very few of the wonderful cinematic elements and ideas of Miike like the kinetic storytelling and speed of City of Lost Souls aka The Hazard City (2000), the brilliant and surreal imagery of one of his masterpieces Dead or Alive, the claustrophobic, creepy and disturbing brilliance of Audition (1999) or the manic elements in the soundtrack, editing and camerawork of Koroshiya Ichi aka Ichi the Killer (2001).
Ichi the Killer has also some interesting elements in the form of Ichi himself, who is a traumatized boy with violent environment and society around him.
This important theme is handled more carefully in Rainy Dog and also in Fudoh.
Anyone with not interest in this great cinema and its elements won't likely to be able to sit through the manic and insane (and also the most uninspired) examples of it, like Full Metal Yakuza.
Maybe it's also a sign of what Miike had with better things to come, as it was just a short on-assignment gig to fill up his V-Cinema requirements.
While I do understand that first it's a "Hallmark" (as in greeting cards) Production, so right there schmaltz and rubbish and that it was also a "Mini-Series", it seemed as though the producers were looking only to fill time and in a feature package... (DVD) meant for one complete viewing... it came across so God awfully long and boring.
It is also inexplicable why Viktor could simply make sure that the creatures mate was unable to reproduce instead of torching her in front of the monster.
it is also puzzling that the director did not catch any of this.
I also noticed that all the "GREAT" reviews here, were all from people in Los Angeles where this company is based.
People will celebrate its oddness of colliding civilizations and languages while also mentioning the threads of overlap in poor behavior in both the 'mudpeople' and the merely dressed better actors - this is not enough to make a good film.
Other screen veterans--Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon and James Garner (who is just as natural in front of a camera as Newman)--are also on display, but are not given the screen time to display their skills.
The head of security at the party is an ex-cop friend of the PI, and the PI also has a friend still in the department.
It's not their fault, but the fault of the screenwriter Erich Segal (who also wrote the novel).
There's also the dialog from Tobin Bell, the deaths from this film, taking place in a "hospital" (get it?
The filmmakers of this film also had enough guts to make one of the most idiotic twist in a film.
There's also some very funny moments in the film including the word for "fear of the Boogeyman": Which is called "boogeyphobia."
Boogeyman 2 is the sequel to one of the worst horror films I have seen during the last 10 years.This sequel is better than the first part...but it also is a pathetic crap.Besides the good presence from Tobin Bell and ReneÃ© O' Connor,there is nothing to recommend in Boogeyman 2.The screenplay is horribly bad,the characters are completely generic and the movie is tremendously tedious from its first scene to its last one.Jeff Betancourt,who was the editor of some very competent movies (like The Good Girl or The Ruins),made his first work as a director in this movie,and it would be better if he goes back to editing movies,because the direction from Boogeyman 2 is pathetic for many reasons,but mainly,because it never finds a good tone and it is very chaotic.Boogeyman 2 belongs to the worst kind of horror cinema and I suggest you to avoid this big piece of crap.As I said,it's better (or,more properly,less bad) than the first part,but it's still unbearable and painful to watch.
His hit formula is definitely to imitate senior as much as possible by trying a Paan Banaras Waala type song and also by being biased to his left hand.
Maybe this is another person Tong Po fought that was also named Kurt Sloan (cause the Kurt Sloan we know only had one brother, Eric).
I had also heard words such as 'sophisticated', 'smart', and 'hip' tossed around.
I'm also curious as to why every couple in this film invented reasons why they should stay together, when clearly there exists no believable chemistry.
The acting is OKish, also not what I would think considering who is in the cast - It's not worth wasting your money on!
Yet, while telling a strong, funny, gripping, well-acted story of a young gangster's rise to power, it also manages to paint a devastating picture of how and why crime has spiraled out of control in the new South Africa.
At least Fox Searchlight is also releasing Little Miss Sunshine at the moment.
She's also the narrator.
He also was "Kenny" the doomed cameraman in Scream!
This is not my attempt to completely bash the film , I will also add that there were some good musical parts and dance sequences but still the movie couldn't keep me or others watching the movie glued to the screen or even interested.
Caine also appears in the second most grating thriller mystery ever filmed: DeathTrap.
Deathtrap, also with Caine is a subtle retelling of this tale, only tighter, and with a woman character added.
There is also an amazing lack of humor in it.
Nothing except JLH could save this sorry excuse of a movie, and it's also a waste of your time and a waste of film to make the movie with.
When they arrive,turns out it's the rain season.Why would a radio station give people tickets to the Bahamas in the rain season?Can't they just like,call the station and try to change the date or something?Freddie Prinze Jr.(he has a name,but unlike Ben,I don't still know)also heads for the Bahamas right after waking up from a coma or something to save the day and he kills Ben once and for all,after Ben killed his own son by accident,cos he apparently never watched pro-wrestling.
Perhaps they declined to have anything to do with it on seeing the script by Trey Callaway, who also had a hand in the mercifully short-lived ER-in-space TV show "Mercy Point."
Maybe it was a question of sloppy editing also.
Perhaps the only thing I would save it's the OST.. and also I have to say that some things are not easy to understand if u don't know a bit of the ambient where it was actually filmed.
James Ryan also sports an English accent that indicates a sophisticated intelligence which makes it hard to buy that he could be a killing machine at the same time.
Oliver Reed is also on hand and he is positively terrible giving a performance so cheesy that he could be smuggled into a Green Bay Packer football game.
It's also hilarious to behold and makes one wonder how this got passed up by Mystery Science Theater 3000.
I shouldn't really forget, Jason Lee who is also good here.
Ben Browder and Michael Shanks also comment on the fact that the movie fails to fill in the gaps in the plot developed over the last ten years and how it really only focuses on seasons 9 and 10.
This movies rates with Dracula 3000 which also has a one star rating.
The show is to be commended for attempting to educate viewers about little people and demonstrate how they are essentially "just like you and me", but that is also its downfall - for ordinariness simply hasn't made for compelling TV viewing since the days of "Father Knows Best".
He is also physically abused by his brothers.
CSI Miami is a much better show because it's their job to do forensics and they're also police officers at the same time.
It also shows that he can play a different role then the characters he has played in Kevin Smith films.
The show also suffers from more than a tinge of "Providence" syndrome - the heroine is SOOO perfect (albeit in a "bad girl" way), almost always right when she bucks the system (except for a few "very special" plots where she makes a mistake and Learns Something About Herself), and every man is in love with her.
Silence broken by fast movement of some unnatural effect accommodated with lots of bass... the sounds are also so convergent in all these movies.
While you can appreciate some of the inconsistencies and complexities in character, it's also largely clichÃ© characters and some of the inconsistencies defy all logic, both formal and psychological.
And there's also the fact that the series, in its original format, is only slightly less internationally appealing than Doraemon.
It moves slower than an Ingmar Bergman film played at quarter-speed, the attempts at drama (particularly those in episodes 26, 50, 52, 68, 77 and 78) are laughable, and it is also afflicted with a problem not uncommon in anime: it's mostly made for the fans.
I've also seen the final story of SA2 repeated into the show, proving how lacking of stories these writers have.
Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.
Something that also disturbed me were the characters Tom Cruise isn't really a spy here, he's to busy with his hair now.
Other memorable moments: The slow-mo 80 m.p.h chest slap and waves crashing on beach during the (anti) climatic fight (most of it also in slow-mo).
I say, this is a cheesy yet in a way fun (yet also very boring) ATTEMPT at film-making.
There's also a family of four (husband, wife, teen daughter and retarded teen son) on a camping trip that get attacked, as well as a hermit, a trucker, the copter pilot, his wife and a couple of others.
So sadly, fellow zombie fans, all we're really left with here is an inept film that not only looks ugly from an aesthetic standpoint but is also dull from an action/guilty pleasure stance.
There's also a memorable "love scene" that begins as a love scene, turns into an argument during which the lovers tear each others clothes in anger.
It was released on video in the US as Toxic Zombies, and is also known as Blood Butchers.
I also find the scene in the other film, where the hunter kills Babar's mom, to be more powerful and interesting, even emotionally unsettling, than the stupid war in Babar the Movie, yet, it has an important point, is highly relevant, and is more appropriate an issue for kids.
I can also admit that I enjoyed Midnight Movie more than this.
Upon this flimsy plot hangs Get Yourself a College Girl which is also the name of the song Mary Ann Mobley wrote.
This is also where Buffy finally tells Spike: "I love you".
Xander is also very indifferent when he hears of Anya, the love of his life's death.
This is also somewhat of an anti-climax.
He also wanted her to be able to love somebody else, and not love him.
Which also brings up another question... Why did the spell have to be performed at the school?
I was also rooting for her sis to be a potential which could've led to a very different ending, probably even better, a lot better.
This will also eliminate the ridiculous sub-plot about Annabelle's Senator mother.
I've also known quite a lot of religious in my life (both priests and nuns) and never knew one who was quite as creepy as "Mother Immaculata" from this film.
Johannes Vermeer (played by Colin Firth)as the artist, also has one expression, a severe, grim frown.
He also speaks possibly 20 words in the entire film.
By the way, the Vermeer's had only the one maid, Tanneke, whom Vermeer also used as a model for some of his work.
By the way, it also features Liam Neeson at his most constipated, and Natasha Richardson's along for the ride too, though its hard to notice either of them while Jodie's so busy making funny faces and gurgling.
The outcome of the movie is also fairy-tale material.
Director Chuck Parello, who also made a more recent Ed Gein film (not quite as awful, but almost), has no idea how to make a good movie.
They also have an emotionally unstable niece (Carri Levinson) who draws freaky pictures.
But, there is also some inventive fantasy design--in the story, its odd places and characters, the costumes (even the silly animal ones) and the sets.
It's also evident of how far back children's movies and fantasies go in film history.
On top of that, the new DVD is a huge disappointment also.
I also got a laugh out of the amazing camera technique the "filmmakers" used to let us know that the killer was on the prowl.
It is also tainted by the stupid antics, however.
A ridiculous simplification of the political turmoil in Lebanon in the 1980s, this film would also have us believe that one American high-school basketball coach can defeat a whole army of Lebanese terrorists!!!
And we are also meant to believe that the US Government would recruit this same basketball coach (and his friendly Lebanese taxi driver!!!)
She is also in debt with a low-rate loan shark and, as a result, she is constantly being threatened by them.
However, she eventually meets Joe (Billy Connolly), a man whose wife has just left him and also has found out that he has a brain tumor.
It sets itself up for self-parody -- satirizing the old cartoon show and its absurdities while also managing to make fun of some clichÃ©s of cartoons and feature-film spin-offs.
Cartoon characters Bullwinkle Moose (voice of Keith Scott, who is also the voice of the narrator) and Rocket J. Squirrel (voice of June Foray) are yanked out of their endless re-runs by perky, hopeless FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) in order to combat their arch-enemies, Boris (Jason Alexander), Natasha (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) when THEY are brought out into the real world.
These types of films like Scooby-Doo not only aren't funny because of this but also completely miss the point of the original.
At least, that's what DEADWOOD presents to me in the form of a truly fascinating entertainment that also unmakes the familiar, laconic Hollywood Western hero, who was the self-censored product of 30s Hollywood moguls' anticipatory auto-antisemitism.
Special effects are also done bad.
Even worse then the Tom Cruise wannabe costar who was also horribly bad.
The acting was also horrible, with exceptions of a few small performances.
I rented it thinking it was another version of the Stevenson classic (also, Pirates of the Caribbean was not available).
I also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie.
There were some good parts to this movie also.
I also want to mention George Clooney's tush.
(You should also be aware this film a is a remake of an older film with much higher ratings.)
He is soon greeted by his deceased wife and finds out the two remaining crew members also have "visitors" that are dead.
Kennedy's girlfriends slipping in and out of the White House for rendezvous with the Chief Executive in the "Harding" closet is also passÃ©.
The movie does reveal Judy Exner as being naive not only in romance but also in politics.
It also purports to be something of a mystery, which is daft since there isn't one!.
Hell, the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it.
Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not.
Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.
It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension.
So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it's a failure.
It's predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility.
Not an 'horrible' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clichÃ© elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one.
The plot was boring also.
It has no emotional depth, but if it was meant to be satirical, it also lacks the wit to pull that off.
The female characters are also nicely played, with O'Mara oozing feline sexuality as the promiscuous housekeeper, while Hammer regular Veronica Carlson is also solid as Frankenstein's childhood friend.
While not as big a letdown, the nasty business man was also a letdown.
While an interesting idea, the film falters not just because of the lousy payoffs for several characters, but also because the film was so stark and cheesy (though some of this can be attributed to the fact that this was such an early Talkie).
As for the script, it is by far the best-written, most eloquent dialogue I have ever heard in an early talkie, rising very nearly to the level of poetry at times.The sound quality of the print that I saw(on TCM) was also quite good, with every word clearly intelligible.
Other actors are also hammy, though they don't all reach the level that Howard does when he goes momentarily berserk.
The film's direction has all the staginess of an early talkie---only a few imaginative camera movements, but those eerie lighting effects wouldhave been difficult to duplicate on a stage in that era.There is no music except for the opening and closing credits, and this also dates the film, although it adds to the spooky atmosphere.
Bindler also uses choppy, melodramatic, and extremely repetitious editing techniques.
The acting is also pretty terrible, but the worst has to be the grim reaper.
That also goes for Sandra Bullock being cast as Maria and Shawnee Smith being cast as Olimpia.
There were also a lot of plots that were skipped, like Dario's homosexuality, Carrie's abuse and rape as well as how and why she came to be a prostitute, the stories of Gino's abusive father, and the list goes on and on.
Thinking her nuts, Rachel is committed to a mental health facility, where she finds herself with other inmates that have also cheated death.
She finds five other inmates that had a near death experience and also claim that Death is coming for them, but Dr. Brown tells them that they are subject of a mass hypnosis experiment.
It's great to see someone making horror movies from Canada also.
It was also a relief to see that the Canadian government didn't give money to help this get made.
I also loved it when, in the "police station" (cue outside shot of a police station, before cutting to someone's spare room), the FBI agent asks if there was a phone she could use.
I believe she was also in a movie titled "The Bitch" a year or two after this.
[1954] Â which also dealt with giant ants and where the results had been infinitely better).
Sometimes, these really bad films can also be accidentally hilarious because of how poorly created they are.
I recently watched Empire of the Ants because I like Joan Collins, but also because I wanted to see if it was really as bad as everyone says.
Later in life, after obviously telling the difference between well-made and "B-Movie," I also learned from one of my favorite television shows, Mystery Science Theater 3000 that not only was "American International" bad, but anything from "Burt I. Gordon" was just as horrible.
Apart from the even worse I DON'T WANT TO BE BORN (also starring the great Joan Collins), this is the absolute worst film she ever made (even worse than THE BITCH).
I was channel surfing in the USA and I came across some footage that made me nauseous ,courtesy of SHARK..that showed the wild horse races in the USA!.Disgusting,barbaric, ,appalling and abhorrent.I also note the AHA investigation as stated on SHARK also came up with,like Lord of the Rings..more injured and dead horses..it all sounds all too familiar..problems on set being covered up and not exposed properly thereby letting the self centered film industry get away with it again...-the second time in three years...and again the media covering it up..the bad behavior of the movie industry..I work on films...there is no need for any one or animal be harmed in the making of a movie.Large or small.We have been doing it for a while..we know what health and safety is.We are not all this bad.Kids this ain't no joke.This is not funny.If you have pets..do you let harm come to them in your house and under your care?.This is no different...on TV I saw mid west thugs doing cruel stuff to horses....unnecessarily......thugs with little in the way of common sense or decency treating animals badly ..and I presume there wives.
There are some creepy parts where one of the ranch hands appears to have a crush on Katie, but that's also there for no reason.
I was looking forward to this movie a lot.I wanted to watch it with my grand daughters.I am glad I saw it first.I was so disappointed with it.I never got the connection with the horse and the girl,didn't work for me.I also wanted to see the big race?The one that saved the ranch?She said Flicka the horse came they opened the gate for them to run away?Whats with that?Now oh god shes missing get a search party.I would rather have seen Dekota fanning do the part this girl was a bit over weight for it.
I was glad I never had to pay money to see it,but it's so weired to see the critics saying,I love this movie so good.My god come on don't drink before you see it.The guy ,father never got his emotions working for me.A I also had a hard time hearing him whispering his lines.He was to bland for my taste.Gary
This film totally ignores the original book.There are also many, MANY changes in this one from the original, like this one:The main character is changed to female Katy McLaughlin, when in the original it was male Ken McLaughling.Horses even died on the set of this film.And I'm sick of EVERYBODY saying ''No horses died, its just a rumor.''
I also think that hunky Tim McGraw was superb, and was jealous of Maria Bello when they did the slow dance!
The fights are also poorly thought out and filmed in order to make life easier to include Chuck in his master shots etc.
Daniel Bernhardt, still in his action man prime, is also wasted and of course when he fights Chuck, the simple fact that they are filmed to hide Chucks double and Chucks lack of speed, Bernhardt can't do much.
It also claims credit as a work of sci-fi and as a musical - both of these claims are pure baloney.
The girl who plays Joan looks bad, her father looks awful, her off and on boyfriend also looks ugly.
Even if you argue that this is a psychological thriller, Avnet also seems to have forgotten any semblance of intelligence that would raise this movie above the level of a gimmick.
Pacino plays Dr. Jack Gramm, a college professor who also works with the FBI as a forensic psychiatrist.
In addition, he also includes a woman he had a one-night stand with and a disgruntled student he slighted into his investigation.
If you want to get a closer look at post-war Germany, there are also better movies around.
I am trying to fix a glaring error, which must be obnoxious to Una Stubbs who is still living, I hope and also to Dandy Nicholls, who may not be still living, but I remember watching as a child - but it may be to her family!
The movie wants to have it both ways: be a modern look at streetwise teens and yet also be an old-fashioned musical.
It's also filled with memorable quotes like:  "This your pond?"
Besides these annoying little niggles, there's also the crappy soundtrack, the lighting that makes it appear as though the sun is going nova in every shot, and the apparent sleepiness of all of the cast members except for the dynamic but crazed Lucinda.
I also thought that the film looked amazing, particularly the dragons, with the effects only let down by some shoddy looking explosions at times.
If Ed's character wasn't bad enough Heche's character is also angry and brooding too, I guess it's tough to have a mother who was a Saint.
In the film Richard Thomas also states that he and James Dean were a lot alike and some of the lines make you want to laugh.
It also had some funny moments, and, as expected, were mostly contributed to Robin's robot character.
There were also little details that achieved good laughs...
Again the art in "Robots" also deserves credit using darker color schemes which allowed for a better feel for the robot world.
The design of the city was also impressive: intricate modes of transportation, the ability to carry a conversation with a traffic light, and a walking mailbox that knows you by name...
Any Joe Schmoe from the street tripping on acid can make a movie about some make-believe world, but its an even heavier task to make a world where things not only make sense, but are also necessary for the world to be plausible.
Vokia is also wounded, no idea why, he wasn't in the book.
Oh yeah - he's also so goofy as to converse with his deceased boss and a wax figure of Humphrey Bogart.
I would also say that it is far too short, it only lasts what and hour and a half where it could have easily been streteched to 2hrs at least with maybe showing van Zan killing his first dragon or whatever.
The acting is also dreadful with one very notable exception.
there are also two female characters in the book which are for some reason male in the film (Steven Kramer is meant to be Diane Kramer, jimmy Gomez is also a woman in the book!
He also terrorizes citizens with kindness, and makes minor repairs on the coaches he robs.
We will also use jump cuts when focusing on foreign objects that float in space, such as perfectly round and spherical asteroids.
Of course I would also suggest that with 4 episodes left the writers realised they had very little material with which to use at the end of the season, so they needed something to pad the story out.
I'm a big fan of Christie, not just Poirot and Miss Marple, but also her other characters, most of these novels have been made into decent programmes (although when her short stories are adapted for television there is obviously some padding put in,) but in most cases they tend to stick quite close to the source.
The preacher also uses like 4 different disguises, a skeleton, clown, and something else....
They also tend to stand around in shock and horror after every death while the killer makes a long, drawn-out speech about their sinful lives, letting him say his piece rather than simply rushing the guy and trying to kick his ass.
It was interesting to me how, by trying to detach itself from the political movie tradition, it achieves the complete opposite: this is a film that couldn't possibly make sense unless you are not only aware of the external circumstances that affect the characters but also have already a clear position on the political conflict in case.
PiÃ±eyro's former writer (Aida Bortnik, who also wrote The Official Story) used to be quite annoying to me, but at least she seemed to know and like drama as a tool.
Randy likes this Asian girl named Maggie who is tired of "all the guys all over her", and she's also mad that Randy is the reason that her home was destroyed.
Not only does Daytona lose the championship, but also his coach as well as father--U.S. Marine sergeant Pete Daytona (Robert Patrick of "We Are Marshall")--dies at the hands of the infamous Asian criminal, Feng (tough guy Christopher Walken of "Pulp Fiction"), because he cannot pay off his debt.
Dane also had a strong Aussie accent compared to the original when it was a US accent.
Not only did the majority of the situations completely disregard what was put forth in the novel, but they also turned what was rare and beautiful into a soap opera fiasco.
This turkey is also known by about 6 other titles, including "I Don't Want to be Born" - hmmmm, perhaps the moovie was trying to tell the producers something.
This is never explained and we also never see the baby commit any of the evil deeds so there are many scenes where the characters creep slowly along looking around and never figuring out what the heck is going on.
Their bipolar dynamic was especially excellent, creating tension not just in beliefs but also in culture and devotion to country.
There's also some scenes involving women being in the buff, because of the main character's ex-occupation.
(Bates seemed to specialise in horror films- he also acted in "Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde", and this is referred to when in a hospital scene we hear an announcement for a "Dr Jekyll".
Caroline Munroe also appears in a supporting role but that's still not a good enough reason to make this movie .
Atkins (who is also British) does a better job of it--but every time she says "devil" it sounds like "davel" and is (unintentionally?)
In order to enjoy this movie you would have to love musicals, wacky humour and you would also have to forgive the leads' less than impressive voices.
Not only Chesty's acting is embarrassing, but also the rough editing, the dialogs and the handful of gory killings.
The director also likes to concentrate shots on arbitrary objects in the scene, or a little dog on the grass, for no reason.
Sure, you could complain all day long about the pointlessly long shots of, say, horse-racing, or the sped-up "car chase", or the lack of logic in the story, but you also have to give credit to the film's creativity: it's not every day you can see a punch with the breast replacing the fist, or death via ice cubes stuffed into the victim's mouth!
Maggie Smith is the aunt in "Travels with my Aunt," a 1972 film also starring Alec McCowen, Lou Gossett Jr. and Robert Stephens, and is directed by George Cukor.
Someone else nasty also wants it to make themselves powerful.
Khoa was widely praised for his previous film, "The Finished People" for which he won the independent spirit award and was also named as "Young Australian Of The Year" and Anh was also "Stand Up Comedian Of The Year" a few years back and is an accomplished stand up comic.
If you like this film, you'll also like Mamie in "Girls Town".  
It's clear he inherited the family talent, which he was to squander, because he also inherited the predisposition to chemical experimentation.
Ah Moon dies in a plane crash and the pool guy spots Rosa (also played by Ms. Yau), who looks just like her.
The also always good Sandra Ng plays a laser disc store manager.
It is also painfully slow.
The movie is also looking with some lively, deliberately over-the-top looking sets and costumes (both nominated for an Oscar with the costumes even eventually winning.).
The man who is known for director cheerful and good musical mostly in the '50's and '60's including "My Fair Lady" but also comedies, like "Born Yesterday" and well known serious drama classics as well, such as "Gaslight", "The Philadelphia Story" and for some part, before he was booted from the set, also "Gone with the Wind".
She also had some great chemistry with Alec McCowen, who is obviously the least known actor of the main cast.
He not only shows that he is a great actor but also how well he can handle the comedy genre.
But no, when you look at this movie you'll realize that it also is far from a perfect one.
The movie also too quickly ends some potentially interesting or amusing plot lines and the different adventurous/comedy and drama elements don't always go together well.
There are chase scenes in air-ducts also very reminiscent of ALIEN/ALIENS.
The acting by Jean-Pierre Marielle as the camp doctor was also amusing.
I've seen a handful of unusual comedies from Japan and the most recent one being the Calamari Wrestler followed by Cromartie High School which also featured two well known wrestlers; Takayama and Hashimoto (RIP), playing complete opposites of their fighting characters of course, but in a script that would make the Power Rangers' screen writers shake their heads in disbelief.
Filmed on location in Georgia, this film was also too convincing in it's portrayal of the rural south: I kept waiting for the banjo music to start up, kept waiting for Roger or the sheriff to ask Mick to "squeal like a pig."
Oh, and the character of Mr. Beardsly is also very impressive in his brief stint on the film.
I also found the representation of Brazilian culture, of which I know a thing or two, outrageously inaccurate and small-minded.
And Emilia Fox.. she is too sweet, too innocent and also lacks the character's struggle to develop her own personality.
For the most part this film is pretty lousy as the acting is some of the worst I've seen in a flick with a budget as large as this films' is, the scares are also somewhat predictable as well as unoriginal---however though, when I think about it now how psychotically creative (for lack of a couple of better words) could one really be with a hook anyway?
The violence is not that disturbing here as in the first film, but part two also definitely has its cruel and nasty moments.
It is also the reason we have never seen Ali Landry again in a major film.
Well, the location actually appears to have been used for scenes on Earth - not the moon and also, here's the part that makes this whole movie feel like you completely wasted your time watching it - you NEVER see anyone land on the moon.
The film's abrupt ending also screams "sorry, we ran out of money."
Apart from how boring this was, it was also historically inaccurate (apart from Kennedy's assassination), but even still, setting this during that time frame is somewhat distracting.
This is very sloppy but could also be the fault of the dubbers--perhaps the original film was based only on Greek or Roman characters--not both.
It's also very bad history and bastardizes the story terribly, but is still much closer to the original source material than this silly film.
watchable movie not really unless watch most of it in fast forward.The opening erotic lovemaking scene tells you already forget the sci-fi it's just coating for some rather strange actions that the main character played by Grieco does.He is a pretty boy for the women viewers and that's it For the guys you get to see a lot of Maryam D'abo's body[it's nice] and some of Natalie Radfords body[also nice]So i give it two stars just for the nice bodies on the female leads.If you are looking for plot,acting good script etc Stay Away.
There's also a dialogue reference to Tod Browning's "Freaks" (take a wild guess what 3 word phrase a crowd shouts repeatedly).
Tom Collins was sensitive because he got beat up, smiled a lot at Angel, and is also brilliantly quirky because he stole from an ATM he re-wired, theft being so much more fulfilling than any larger sums derived from engineering jobs in the Mainstream.
I also hung out in the East Village at the time...11th and Ave A was fully gentrified at least 6 or 7 years BEFORE this silliness even takes place.
The film also doesn't work on a purely technical level.
Campbell (Ronald Fraser) is a coward who runs from battle, but also loots the bodies of dead soldiers Â both English and Japanese.
I'd also like to clarify that Troll 2 has nothing whatsoever to do with 'Troll 1' or indeed a troll or collective trolls.
Also why a family would proceed to eat the other family's green icing covered dinner is also better just accepted as normal.
Another tool the clever goblins..err trolls have come up with is Nilbog milk which also turns the person who drinks it into a troll.
The special effects are also very funny, most notably the spear throwing scene.
Before I get into the meat of the story or as I like to call it a double decker bologna sandwichÂTroll 2 has nothing to do with trolls (just goblins), Troll 2 also has absolutely nothing to do with Troll 1.
You may want to give that quote a second readingÂ The daughter is also brilliant in this picture.
Well, the film is also decently acted (for an H.G.
Oh...I should also mention that those blessed maniacs at Something Weird have done it again, rescuing another cinematic oddball and making another fine-looking DVD out of it.
The rest of the film is no better than this sequence and is completely amateurish also; lacking any kind of horror or suspense and the little gore we do get just looks fake as usual.
About a businessman named John Stone, who, one day, receives an inheritance in the mail, two bottles of Brandy., which, unknown to stone, also contains Dracula blood.
The cameraman can be spared for he at least did not use the monstrous hand-held technique used in the Blair Witch Project & Cloverfield ... the camera ALWAYS showed the principle action, what little there was to observe in the midst of the banality.....  Viggo was SUPERB as an actor dealing with (expletive deleted)...his power of projection, his gift, was wasted in this horror....  McHattie also did a SUPERB job of trying to survive, to keep his head above the water in this vain, lame, milquetoast waste of celluloid...
Deal of the Century also wishes to indict the US military build-up of the Ronald Regan administration.
This movie is also a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode.
The party scene with a bunch of obnoxious students dressed as mummys is also grating, and all James Karen does is mope and yell at Ben Murphy.
Were then treated to yet another 'lets tie the woman up and torment her' type of scenarios....we also have not so shocking 'could this be incest' moments when the lone man suddenly has a daughter type tagging along to help him in his deeds.
Not only are they eye-candy, but also strong female roles played by excellent actresses.
It also never portrayed the conflict of Rock 'n' Roll music: jazz music was still popular at the time.
Rubinek's friend Lee Majors also catches on, but he proves a lot more difficult to deal with.
So Majors pokes around and finds something to do with subliminal advertising and also finds that Mitchum's background is not in advertising but with the government.
The female that slept w/ Terrance Howard was gorgeous also.
I also missed the look of the 100 Acre Wood.
Guardian represents everything that's possible to be wrong with a movie, that's also its sole redeeming quality.
The martial arts choreograohy is also pretty good.
(by the by, they also chose a really old actress to play Nelly.
Aside from this, they also didn't put much consideration into the age continuity.
He also mumbles most of his dialog.
While discussing her feelings the next day with her Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffery Rosenberg (Richard Benjamin) he finds out about the bite and says that she has been bitten by a Vampire & also that he is a descendant of infamous Vampire hunter Van Helsing.
Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education!
While it DOES feature a brief glimpse of nudity and plenty of over-the-top scenes, it also occasionally actually has some decent acting (I love the old man who owns the soda fountain--he's great) and writing that make it rise slightly above the rest of the films of the genre--particularly towards the end.
The movie also gives an accurate depiction of quality of the up and coming African Americans in the entertainment industry.
There's also no 3-dimensional characters, almost nothing deep, enthralling, or unexpected, and NO REASON TO LIKE KIKI AS AN INDIVIDUAL!!!
I also loved the mountains in the outskirts of DC (and no, I am NOT talking about the Appalachians).
Carl Weathers as the silent killer is also a little strange.
Let's also get one of the hotter black stars of the era to play the "hero," too, and have him show all those corrupt politicians how it should be done, even though that "good guy."
It's also too profane, but that's no surprise with Murphy in the lead role and a total unknown - who has remained such in the last 15 years, Victoria Powell - as the female lead.
It's also what broke him,at least for awhile.
There's also just a plethora of terrible jokes - including the lame James Bond inclusion, ( Yeah , Ian Flemming , co-creator , got it , back in the 60's , carry on!
Also show him in his playing ways and also show him playing the guitar a lot more like he was working on putting together a record, the way he played was tight.
I love French films and they are my among favorite type of films (surpassing even the Japanese--which I also adore) and I have taken French classes to learn the language.
The film has many absurdist elements that might appeal to some but will also leave many cold.
But let's not give short shrift to the other poor aspects of this film: it was also poorly written, edited, scored, and directed.
It is interesting that Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, and Dorothy Malone also starred together in the movie Written on the Wind, in 1956, which was a better movie, but with very similar character-types.
There is a good mix of very funny and also intense emotional moments and the audience is captured; cheering some of the cast and hissing others.
I don't mind programmes like Till Death Us Do Part in which a character is bigoted but their attitudes are shown as wrong and I also don't like extreme political correctness partly because when there are cases like this and people comment on it others defend the sexism by complaining about "PC madness".
I also notice that a few reviewers are quick to childishly insult anybody who disagrees with them.
It remains inconceivable that such a purveyor of finely crafted films could also be responsible for one of the year's most cinematically redundant and, to quote a previous reviewer, what amounts to little more than a cut-and-paste job of any given 3 TV episodes.
It also lacks the vaguely political or literary merits of a Carry On, or the decent film standards.
He also witnesses the dead man's effects being pawned off.
It therefore follows, that I am also a big fan of the major cinematic productions based on the story, which I have seen over the years (Though that doesn't necessarily mean that I like them all).
The ghosts of Christmases past, present and future were also big disappointments.
The staging at times is also quite weird.
Others have noted that this version also has that cheap, made-for-TV appearance and I have to agree.
There are also two other sub-plots in the mix here.
There are also a couple more things that made me despise this film so much.
There is also a huge gap between the beginning and the end of the movie.
she caused a change in her best friend, a change in the most popular girl in school that also wanted all the attention, and a wonderful change in her rock star crush, Stu Wolf.
9 also why was everyone so shocked when she sang for the first time?
She hasn't been good in any movie since the parent trap (also why are people saying shes hot?
There is also a subplot with a High School play.
Which were also better movies by the way.
the sub characters were poorly written, especially the love interest Sam (Eli Marienthal), who is brilliant in "Tucker" and "American Pie", who is wasted and underused and also completely pointless to help push the story forwards.
The film is also very unrealistic and it sends a bad message out to kids.
The ending is also pretty bad since it randomly ends with Lohan kissing Sam even though they hardly focused on this romantic subplot.
The film stars the beautiful Lina Romay which is always sure to increase the watchability of any film; and we've also got a surprisingly decent performance from the man himself Jess Franco (under yet another moniker).
He is also an escapee from a mental asylum who is wanted by German police for crimes against minors.
It also portrays racial minorities as stupid and really just bumbling idiots.
For example, he also wrote the screenplay for Mr. and Mrs. Smith and that film was heavy on action, low on story.
Samuel L. Jackson returns as Gibbons and he also gives a good performance.
The mild mannered Strauss using the 4 letter word was also quite inappropriate at the moment it was uttered.
The plot is also so silly.
The movie can also be looked on as promoting an unhealthy stereotype of the goofy white guy that knows nothing because the token comic relief in the movie is a white guy that's always out of whack.
The writing (the screenplay is by Simon Kinberg, who somehow also wrote the excellent "Mr. and Mrs. Smith") and acting are dreadful - not just from non-actors like Ice Cube, but even from Oscar nominees like Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson.
And one could also specify that her husband as weird as her tries to make life impossible to Lucas.
Moll's work is also marred by a cosy end which takes the easy way.
I also know that this was meant for a certain audience and it should be seen for what it is...just a simple, slick action pick.
There is some relevance to the events that took place, although I can also say there is a bias to towards an anti-communist ideal.
The movie also seems to take its ridiculous plot seriously, as if we cared.
The film is also very weak on character development.
I also wonder why for the 2/3 of the movie G. Seagal wears the same dirty clothes?
But when Mandarin Chinese (I assume its Mandarin) is spoken, its also couched as "Asian Talking".
I also enjoyed watching the taking of the bomb up an unknown number of floors to a roof, starting a helicopter and then flying an estimated 25 miles off shore and all in 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
I also have to agree with some previous writers that seeing a very over weight Seagal is sad.
As if what i've told you is not enough to keep you away from this drivel, it is also worth mentioning that the special effects are truly terrible as well.
I didn't know that, but then again, I also always thought you had to wear some kind of foil suit to handle raw plutonium, but I guess that's not really true.
The rest is all a stunt double (if you get the courage to rent this you will see what I mean) the gun fights were horrible as usual..... Fire off 50 rounds and not hit a single bad guy..... Seagal is also the heaviest he has ever been in this movie.
Try "The Killing Fields," or "Europa, Europa," also based on true stories.
Jonathan Cold (Steven Seagal, also producer) breaks international arms dealer Michael Donovan (Julian Stone) out.
You might also enjoy this movie if you are blind, comatose, or named Pauly Shore.
I recommend it as a movie that will change one's life for the better forever.It will also help you get to know yourself well as you will question one's humanity and understanding of enduring suffering for the sake of love and one's dignity.
I also saw this movie at a film festival in Philadelphia.
And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.
I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..).
As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her "gal wit an attitude" schtick pretty soon.
It's mostly because of the writing, but it is also because of the casting.
She also said the woman who didn't notice any difference never attended any of the sessions or did the things she was supposed to.
As others have noted, we also get a lot of faux-deep scenes of Derrida going about his daily business (walking down the street, getting a haircut, making his breakfast, etc.).
There's no excuse for poor craft (something forgotten not just by filmmakers but also by tenured professors besotted with critical theory, who crank out bad prose that says nothing).
By presenting them in sequence, the audience will wonder who Derrida really is, and they will inevitably question the process of documentary filmmaking itself, thereby deconstructing not only the idea of Derrida, but also the idea of documentary.
Korvin goes mad, kills the publisher of the review but also gets burned in the face by acid.
This handy box-set also included "Texas Adios", "A Bullet For The General", "Companeros", and "Four Of The Apocalypse".
I totally agree with the message of this movie, because it gives hope to Christians who feel pressured by society, and it also shows Christians in America, that they should be thankful for the religious freedoms our government allows.
Good Western in which the Reno gangs raid bank ,treasure offices ,train,robberies in post-civil war Indiana.Stylish,fast paced,solid ,meticulous and a violent look with numerous shootouts.Randolph Scott leaving times ago the secondaries roles as when he was still playing supporting roles in top films as Â¨Jesse JamesÂ¨(Henry King), Â¨Virginia cityÂ¨(Michael Curtiz) and Â¨the spoilers'(Ray Enright).Scott also played an famed outlaw in Â¨Doolins of OklahomaÂ¨(Gordon Douglas).The support cast make equally notable performances.
The length of the movie, is also too much.
Kate's also been giving Sara the date rape drug to knock her out at night and take advantage of her.
Chances are that this is also available online for free, so those interested might consider that as a less expensive alternative.
This movie also runs far too long.
We also have "light sabers" that are basically plastic swords that illuminate.
Between runs to town to report to his partners, he also is introduced to the three inside men in the town from which the gang operates--played by fine actor Howard Petrie, Edgar Buchanan and "Bonanza's" TV sheriff talented Ray Teal.
The cinematography by Ray Rennahan and the music by Paul Sawtell are very fine, and Walter E. Keller's art direction is above average also.
"Operation Thunderbolt" is also on-point, and has many of the actual players playing themselves, but it is largely unfocused.
While I would've been happy to discover new story lines with the people of Cutter Gap, I could also have been satisfied just to see the love triangle play out between Christy, David, and Dr. Neil MacNeill.
I also felt James Waterston's performance as Rev.
Although Mike is definitely a primary suspect both Kate and Detective Sergeant Turner, who is officially in charge of the case, think Dr.Steiner, a lesbian teacher of not only Anna but also Kate, may know something important because she was the last person who met pre-attacked Anna.
You also had Jimmy Lydon (Henry Aldrich), Arthur Space, Myron Healey, Kenneth Tobey, Denver Pyle, all familiar faces even today, doing what they did best; act, under the fine direction of Tim Whelan, creating what I would think 1866 was like.
The music is also rather similar.
It should also be noted that the two main characters are strong women.
We're to also believe that this thing is running around, abducting women and ripping people apart, and the state police never arrive and no media circus ensues.
The ending is also absurd.
He would have also been remembered as the American Hitler.
I also want my 2 hours and 21 minutes back.
I also know that enlisted men never eat steak for breakfast, as portrayed in the film.
They also had to work in some made-for-Cinerama "thrill" sequences that add nothing to the story and seem to go on forever.
His supporting cast -- notably Lawrence Tierney as Phil Sheridan, Ty Hardin as Marcus Reno, and Jeffrey Hunter as Frederick W. Benteen -- also chew the scenery, and as Custer's wife, Mary Ure is apparently under heavy sedation most of the time.
Donna Murphy was also wasted in her role.
It's an admirable quality for a protagonist, but also a very boring one.
And also, silver bullets and garlic are not the only things that can kill him, as he insightfully explains it to his nephew "a good shotgun blast to the head" will get him too.
He is dead wrong, and soon, as a man also turns into a psycho, killing all the duality of wolf and man, usually found in these movies, which is just too bad, as it could have been a lot better that way.
He is the only one that can suspect that the uncle is not all he seems, and he is also the one who kills the werewolf at the end, and lives to tell, even in the closing shot, we see his "angelic" face down on his paws.
They can show how he was set up by another cop who was also sleeping with her (the movie didn't show how she liked to hop in the sack with other cops, too).
The spasming of the bedridden toadfaced chemokid is also pants-wettingly funny.
Suresh Oberoi also plays his cameo well.
There were also some pretty good variety acts, including another band "Skippy Williams Band", who were great.
Marjorie Oliver was also memorable as Bill's sassy secretary.
You will also not see very much of the "Hitchcock style" in this film, as the movie is not a suspense film or mystery and in places, his quality as a director was very suspect.
I also loved how the husband did such a rotten job "hitting" the other man with his cane--he pulled the blows so obviously that it just looked like it came from a high school play!
One or two martial arts favorites also doesn't qualify to make this movie worth seeing.
However, they also include this line during it's brief segment.
It also doesn't help that La Marre doesn't tell the story in a straight forward manner, events are left out or glossed over and a great deal of time is spent with the Jewish religious leaders which helps make his racial plot feasible, but takes away from the story of Jesus.
La Marre also manages to create several nice emotional moments (The Roman asking Caiaphas how it feels to turn over a Jew) and he also manages to create a human Jesus, that laughs and feels, its a portrait that would be wonderful in a better film with a less distracted director.
If nothing else, I guess that it just seems sad that Chase went from "SNL" to this (maybe it's also the flick's status as a Disney movie).
"Prince" also ranks high on the Eighties kitsch scale--I counted three mullets, and that handlebar moustache speaks for itself.
Anyway, not only is this series not accurate to the bible AT ALL, but it is also pretty boring to watch.
The miniseries also lands us with two main characters - a relentlessly serious professor and a nun who would make Mother Teresa seem like a hedonist - who simply don't register (pity Bill Pullman, if not Natascha McElhone), leaving Michael Massee as a Satanic mass-murderer to prove that the Devil gets, if not the best tunes, at least the best lines; the dire job "Revelations" does can be summed up by a failure to care when our villain, having launched the plot by kidnapping and murdering Professor Pullman's young daughter, lures his unlikeable teenage son into his clutches (by way of a webcam fronted by a Christina Aguilera-type).
Example: Peter (also a black man in the movie) identified himself as Jesus (to protect him from the soldiers).
I stumbled onto this while trying to find something that was similar to other shows that I do like, such as Carnivale, which is also an apocalyptic tale with overt religious content.
I also LOVE David Selter's "The Omen" and one or two of its sequels.
Among Jim's fraternity brothers is Charlotte's boyfriend Wesley (Danny Quinn), who was not only absent from the party but who also told Charlotte that he didn't want her to attend it for fear that she would look like "fraternity groupie", and the token stoner Potto (Keith Coogan) who actually witnessed the rape but remains mostly quiet about it.
I accept that "Toy Story 2" (which I also rated as "poor") may not have been as bad as I said it was, considering that I was in a very bad mood while watching it and didn't really want to be there.
There were also certain rules that we learned about what they were and their terrestrial limitations.
We also learned that the aliens did have limitations that could reveal their identity.
his performance was also awful.
In the middle of the film, the director simply uses Lisa Gerrard's music for the Michael Mann movie, presuming the audience is not only blind but also def.
It's true the man has an awesome talent but he's also working hard on his scripts.
They're also obsessed with perfecting the 'uterus transplant' procedure, a yucky effect you get to see at least three times.
I also dislike films that dismiss the previous one as a dream.
She is also a little aged and has sort-of given up on ever having the life she always wanted or dreamed of.
"The Hills Have Eyes Part 2" is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters,who are attacked by cannibals:Pluto(Michael Berryman) and his uncle Reaper(John Bloom).Absolutely no suspense,even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks(although there's a nice throat slashing).The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid.The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb,but also hilarious at the same time.Avoid this junk like the plague.Not recommended.
They also substituted for the lack of bigger cannibal family.
I recently acquired this via the full-frame Image DVD in anticipation of the HTF Halloween challenge; I knew the film was nowhere near as well regarded as the 1977 original Â but I wasn't aware that Craven only made it because he was hard-up for cash, that he later disowned the result and that the picture was even shelved for two years (by which time he had re-acquired his stature with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET [1984] which itself developed into a franchise and, ironically, the director would also return to much later after another lean period in his career)!
Though Robert Houston (Bobby) is also on hand, his character is conveniently put out of the way at the very beginning: he freaks out when a motor race is set to take place in the desert near where his family was attacked all those years ago and opts to stay behind Â Ruby (who's even changed her name) and Beast, however, go along and, though the former's confession about her past isn't taken very seriously by her companions, both of course prove instrumental in the new victims' safe-keeping.
There is also a scene where she is running through a cabin, note: a cabin she has never been to in her whole life yet she runs through the house as though it is her very own home Â blindness can mean second sight with senses perhaps, but not the way this movie does it; it just looks silly, as I said, its poorly written.
It's a rush job that is sloppy and lazy written and often feels and looks like a B-movie, with some bad pacing, ineffective build-up and lame characters and acting performance, also due to its writing.
There is also too little happening and when there is something happening it isn't being very effective, due to its build-up and overall story.
The movie is also basically the one killing after the other but none of them are really original or surprising enough to leave a lasting impression on the fans of the genre.
Beauty has also flashbacks!
My boyfriend and I didn't even hesitate to pick it up, we thought it was going to be another awesome fright fest of the blood thirsty cannibals with probably better effects since Wes had pretty much made good money at that point and also established himself as a great film maker at that point.
Not to mention the characters from the first film have flashbacks from the first Hills have Eyes movie, but also the dog has a flashback as well!
Hell, the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it.
Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not.
Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.
It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension.
So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it's a failure.
It's predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility.
Not an 'horrible' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clichÃ© elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one.
I would recommend this movie for anyone who is sentimental about Christmas and loves a good comedy and a little romance also.
I also enjoy the ambitious manipulating that April does to get Melanies promotion and how that her boss sees the outward appearance and not the talent underneath.
There is also no resolution.
On top of which, the killer is also a total incompetent pussy, which is contradictory to movies of its genre.
This British production was written & directed by Simon Boyes & Adam Mason who also edited it & it's a bit of an odd film, it's supposed to be a stark horror thriller but it just feels like something is missing.
There's also a strange twist ending which makes little or no sense, why did that guy keep Jennifer in a run down shed?
Apparently she also has some kind of a daughter who she is trying to find.
The end was also fantastic, I'm not even going to get into it.
We also get confused signals to just what happened to Amanda when she's later murdered in her parked car outside the Marlin Bay Club.
(In older films like Bambi & The Fox & the Hound they're not only young for longer, they also grow up to be likeable.)
It also doesn't have the same emotional feel that the first had (with the father dying and such).
Credits also indicate that certain Calgary pubs were of assistance.
For tale, I also own the original B&W.
I hated how Nadja looks & was literary praying it would finish within the first 30 minutes but never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I (just about) stuck it out to the end which was also crap.
There's also a lot of philosophical, boring talk about the meaning of life, but do I really give a sh#t?
The plot actually makes the film sound like it might be worth watching and focuses on Dracula's death, and the resulting plight of his dysfunctional family, who are also being hunted by Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing.
Oh, Boris Karloff is said to star in this film I think he's on about five minutes of film here, but I may be overestimating; there's also a Karloff stand-in who's too tall, too thin, and otherwise doesn't look anything like him.
There was also a lot of snake fondling and a jiggly hipped belly dancer.
It's also the dullest.
Plus it also has one of the worst closing credits song I have ever heard!
It is also very easy to see where things are going so if you want something that will test you, then don't watch it.
We learn early on that Jack's family is being watched also.
It's a shame, too, because "Firewall" also features the talents of veterans such as Robert Forster ("Jackie Brown"), Alan Arkin ("Slums of Beverly Hills") and Robert Patrick ("Terminator 2: Judgment Day").
Mary Lynn Rajskub of "24" fame also stars, reprising her role as the only girl you can trust at the office.
He's also not the most diversely-ranged actor.
There is also this plot - with holes you can drive a truck through - starting with the "mastermind" criminals.
But I also find certain areas of this show very tedious which has lead to me developing a love hate relationship with the show.
Not that it is a total loss, the missing link thing is kind of interesting and it is also interesting that this was pretty much an acting career killer for the five very attractive women featured in this film.
The frame-rate also contributes to the problem.
Scorpions "get over here" is a pitiful remake (which also reminds me, Sub and Scorp are back, the two greatest characters ever, and yet they're midgets.
The ensemble was also being used well, without the "stock character" prejudices and clichÃ©s.
So it stands to also reason that MKA would be about the second game, the one most fans widely regard to be the best.
Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting.
Oh, you also get ATV chases, more dirt bikes, rock climbing, and some escaped ape of a dude who goes around "axing" people.
Somehow this all ties in with an escaped killer called the AxeMan, who is also after the few thousand dollars the girls unknowingly have in their possession.
You have the owner of a bar, Robert(Jason London)who also conspired with Ned for the money.
Gisella is also being black-mailed by someone in her inner circle(..of the remaining still alive).
It's not a total loss, but it's also weakened by the really bad dubbing (Godzilla sometimes fares better), and some really ridiculous characters, like the fat guy that tries to have his way with the older blonde owner of the fashion studio, that aren't very funny.
That said, it's also not that good.
If Quentin Tarantino and a woman made out of horrible movies had a baby and then punched it in the head a lot...it would also hate this movie.
This movie is veritable house of cards constructed of candid "insights" on life (analogies aplenty) and held together by watered down attempts at graphic shock value...also there are some cards.
It's also a slow, grinding ride, and not the good kind.
)However one killing totally cracked me up:unlucky sorority girl has her throat slashed with a record.There is also plenty of nudity to satisfy some teenagers.Avoid this crap like the plague.3 out of 10.Give it a look only if you are a masochist or a rabid collector of low-budget slasher movies.
It's also hard to keep track of how many characters there are.
Another offering that can also be attributed with generating a long line of mostly inferior imitations was Amy Holden Jones' Slumber Party Massacre.
The score also becomes an irritation with consistent screeching synthesizer accompaniment, whilst the less said about the 'jazz band on acid' intro music, the better.
there are some very gory moments in the film, and it also features a lot of nudity in many sences as the title says.
Specifically, we get to focus on Magda (Edwige Fenech), a photographer...and Carlo, who is also a photographer.
Now, as a writer, I understand that ideas are a dime a dozen, but I also know that we've been out of ideas pretty much since we've had the ability to HAVE ideas.
I can also understand the need to draw in the young adult demographic, but having the tweenaged girl be a complete genius and outthink the adults in almost every scene smacks of badly written Mary Sue fanfiction, especially if the concerned father seriously makes such a stupid decision as to take the kid into the heart of the war in Iraq(wearing bright pink no less), let alone repeatedly exposing the kid to an invulnerable monster when there's a perfectly good hidden sanctuary where she'd be safe.
I also do not like the main woman's hair, she looks like a skunk.
1 siren of 70s Eurosleaze, the cast also includes the stunningly beautiful Femi Benussi, who moved her curves through all kinds of Italian cult flicks, such as Mario Bava's "Hatchet for the Honeymoon", Fernando Di Leo's "Manhunt", Luigi Cozzi's "The Killer Must Kill Again" or the strangely amusing Kung-Fu-Western "The Stranger And The Gunfighter" starring Lee Van Cleef.
Joe Spinell and Caroline Munro, co-stars of William Lustig's grimy sleaze-fest Maniac, reunite for this tacky slasher that was shot almost entirely on location during the 1981 Cannes Film Festival, and, thanks to its technical shoddiness and pretty awful script, also feels like it was written, produced, and edited during those few weeks as well.
); clever references to some thematically appropriate current affairs stories (John Hinckley's assassination attempt on Reagan and the shooting of Pope John Paul II); and the film also acts as a nifty time-capsuleÂa reminder of days gone by, where titles like Cannibal Holocaust could be found adorning the billboards of sleazy flea-pits around the world.
It's also a horror film suggesting that watching violent and sleazy horror films is likely to turn you into a mad-raving psychopathic serial killer.
It's also very dated but it's not awful because of it.
Michael Hilliard is a veterinary expert who is persuaded to take charge of the investigation and straight away he sets out to find anyone who came in contact with the dead man before he died, his actions and restrictions don't go down well with local animal lovers and the press also make him out to be a bit of a loon.
I can also say that I have never seen animal lovers portrayed in such a bad light, every single one in the Mad Death, is played as crazy or with murderous intentions, they have no interest in stopping the spread of the virus, even the merest of actions like keeping your dog indoors is treated with apathy and anger, all in all not very believable.
There's also a love triangle going on that is dull in the extreme.
The restrictions set in place by police and Dept of Agriculture are also quite laughable in their laxness, if such an outbreak occurred in reality, the UK would be absolutely doomed.
If the filmmakers were out to scare the audience they failed miserably, if they were out to educate the public as to the risks, they also failed as its a little too preachy
The man who dastardly invented these mutant bugs seems to also have picked up the use of super warp speed traveling while working in the lab late at night.
The locusts are also BORING...although I have to give slight kudos to the fact that it doesn't look like a big swarm of computer animated bugs flying around.
Goren in L&O:CI was interrupted by an episode of The Contender, which also merits discussion somewhere, I was forced to watch this nonsense.
This film was also a testament to how badly Lucy Lawless needs work.
I also agree John Heard should be above this, but who knows his reasons?
I was also impressed with the careful military handling of VX.. providing everyone with full face respirators who handled it.
I also choked on my drink when a certain person died from being bitten a couple times.. sheesh, I survived bike accidents with more wounds than he had!
Blistering black comedy co-written by Jill Sprecher (who also directed) and Karen Sprecher, "Clockwatchers" gives us a suffocating office setting so vivid and real I half-expected my own co-workers to show up in it.
There's also no good 'extra weapon'.
I also think this film suffers from poor editing.
Add to all of that a really awful ending that seemed as though the writers just hit a deadline and tacked something on, which also features some totally egregious slow-motion shots (cut back and forth with regular-speed shots!
This is a very amusing piece of trash by Andrea Bianchi, probably best known for his ultra-gory zombie flick BURIAL GROUND(1981) and the casting of Orson Welles in his second film TREASURE ISLAND(1972), but he also made this entertaining little Giallo, the only one he made, to my knowledge.
This was presumably done partly to save costs but also partly to make the film's message more immediate.
Presumably the craft would have to be remote-controlled from Earth, but we are also asked to believe that the entire corpus of scientists and technicians involved in the project, with one sole exception, would fail to notice that the craft with which they were in constant contact did not actually have anyone on board.
It is not too far-fetched to imagine that the one scientist who did suspect something was wrong might be murdered to silence him, but it does strain credibility to suppose that the Government could not only have him killed but also arrange for him to disappear so completely that his family, his colleagues and all but one of his acquaintances failed to notice his disappearance.
We are then asked to accept that the one acquaintance who does notice also has powers of deduction that make Sherlock Holmes look like a rank amateur and is able to work out precisely what has happened to the missing astronauts from the most tenuous of clues (such as the puzzled look of one of the astronauts' wives when her husband mentions where they spent their last family holiday).
There's also fine score, a mixture of funky Bitches-Brew jazz and woo-woo lounge stylings, which helps bridge the suspense scenes.
Bad, silly, poorly done in every way--this film is one of the worst films of the decade BUT is also strangely campy and worth watching--especially if you are a bad movie freak like me.
The film is of historic interest as it was one of the first (perhaps the first) of many Sci-Fi movies about space travellers who encounter a "lost" civilization of nubile young women, not only in attractive dresses and perfect coiffures but also speaking perfect English.
It has also been released as a DVD, but in non-stereographic format.
The Norwegian/Swedish story (being the original), IS better (also it made the theaters).
There's also a story of a rich, spoiled woman (Eve) who wants a stupid dress like no other so she tries to blow up the other owner of her dress!
There are also obvious lifts from other films.
Worst of all, the plot hinges on the appearance of Boss Duke Bates, a look-alike for Simon Templar, also played by George Sanders.
The problem is that by the end, I was also so confused that I had no idea which appearance of George Sanders was supposed to be which character, and confusion on this didn't seem to be the point of the conclusion.
All this is told in a very heavy-handed and moralistic manner that MIGHT have worked had they also not shoved a few gratuitous scenes of ladies with no clothes on or in their underwear!
Yet with all this criticism, "Meet the Deedles" is also kind of fun to watch.
In short, the Catholic Church has been hiding and supporting the fugitive, because they have also been guilty of anti-semitism, and they believe that he just obeyed orders when he killed 7 Jews and later repented.
Censorship also breeds publicity, and in show business most publicity is good for the sale of tickets to the public.
Hollywood although as multicultural as ever still would seem to orientate towards white audiences and also of course towards men, hence there are few interesting roles written for men of non-Caucasian heritage and also women, but importantly the figures are better.
I won't go into the in's and out's of the plot because my head would start to hurt, but it involves a drug that cause the recipient to have strange visions that seem real and which allow for someone to control their mind by manipulating them in their visions, they will also die after a certain period of time.
Now not only does Snipes, who by the way is an ex military that carries a guilt (now that's original) has to escape from them but he also has to get the antidote or his brain will pretty much fry.
Amy has six hours to find the also stolen antidote and save Dean's life.
The cast is also awful and miscast: for example, the Caucasian Jacqueline Obradors, with her horrible tone of voice, has no chemistry with Wesley Snipes.
i also recommend acting lessons for the cast except for the little girl she will be a star in no time.
or i could also wish that a voodoo doll came with the film, so that i could play with it and not watch the film.
While voodoo is normally associated with creole culture in the southern United States, London's vibrant Afro-Caribbean culture also maintains some remnants of voodoo practices.
In addition to the feature films, the DVD also included some extra film clips.
The theme song is also very exhilarating and catchy, so I'll give an extra point for that as well.
It was dumb but also kind of funny.
Yet I was also left to wonder how they could do this so many times in broad daylight and yet the cops STILL couldn't figure out who these young whippersnappers were!!!
Unfortunately, in addition to the old lady being a horrible actress, she also misidentifies who caused the problems--saying that an innocent kid was at fault for attacking an entire gang.
Sylvia's character development also suffers, as it's difficult to understand why she loves her father so much when he never cared about *her* welfare.
The true motivations of other characters, like Monkley (Cary Grant), are also fuzzy and unexplained.
Hepburn's physical acting is also rather superficial - dainty steps as a female (almost a parody of a girl's movements), and galloping leaps as a male.
I also thought this film might be ahead of it's time and have something smart to say about gender roles.
However, he also seems to be swept by the total stupidity of his material.
I apologize for the size of the comment and I also apologize if some of you fellow lovers of the movies of the 30's find this comment embarrassing or disturbing..but this is truly my view on "Sylvia Scarlett".
You also get the feeling that it was designed to be part of a sequel franchise.
It also suffers from a bit too much avoidance of common sense.
also, of course, to historians of  the lesser directors of the old new wave.
But I also came to the realization that most people I have encountered DON'T know much of Heidegger's philosophy, haven't read more than "Six Characters" by Pirandello, and few seem to have seen even a single play by Goldoni.
Bad acting, especially the main brunette girl who is unfortunately also extremely uninteresting to look at.
This goes the same for Sonia, who I also never really fully grasped onto.
This movie reminded me somewhat of Blind Date with Bruce Willis in that everything was going wrong on his night out too and he also ended up getting busted.
They also made at least some efforts (i.e.
"Deja Vu" I find to be unusual in its structure also.
We're also treated to far too many shots of the midget's rear end during the film (I mentioned the costumes were rubbish, didn't I?)
The episode was also inconsistent.
And even when it was established that you could interfere with the past, the movie explored the theme that you cannot change the past, which would've also been adequate, but we all know this is Hollywood.
And the terrorist guy seemed to also hint at the theme of not being able to change the past, but for some reason the story took the mediocre, uncreative, dull approach.
I also had a problem with Ryder because she was convincing but I saw my four teenage friends play her much scarier, and portraying her for the crazy-messed, kooky, demented bitch she was not just someone like Ryder who showed she was mildly disturbed and only motivated to get Proctor in trouble not because she actually thought she was doing the right thing in her own world.
There's also the baffling instances of being able to hear the wind blow against the mike & since certain scenes were probably shot over a certain period of time the wind from one shot to the next in the same scene has different levels of this noisy blowing wind.
All the scenes draaaaaaag on and on and on and on.. the blame for that is that the so-called director is also a wanna-be editor.. an awful idea all together.
It also features cameos from Oliver Owl, Little Kitty and teacher Miss Cud.
Conceived as a possible replacement for the lacklustre Buddy (Warner Bros' previous attempt at creating a star, many of whose cartoons were also directed by King), Beans was not much of an improvement.
And also, weren't the murders in the first film just a crazy dream the Patrick Bateman made up?
I'll also praise and mention at least once a week movies that I love, such as fight club, the matrix, amelie and other very good movies (my opinion of course)  This movie however I can honestly say was so bad I couldn't sit through it, the acting is nothing short of atrocious, the lines are terrible, the realism pathetic and the fact it "stole" the name from the original is actually insulting!

That the killings didn't really take place was also conveyed (as I saw it) in the original.
It is a waste of money to rent this movie, it would also be a waste of time to download and watch it.
You will also see the main character killed one of her friends and left her in a closet in a dorm room.
It also seems they kind of just ignore the fact he most probably killed his partner, probably 40-50 people on the highway by driving recklessly(if not killed, paralyzed) to save the girl that he had a crush on (real romantic).
Let's also overlook all the scenes where they spied on the girl in the shower and changing - because they should be arrested for that considering that's pretty illegal and inappropriate.
As many people on this site have pointed out AP2:AAG not only hints that not only does it have nothing in common with the original movie it also seems to contradict AP .
The original play was also the source of two earlier and better screen versions.
Ms. Lane is an exceptional employee, you'll have to agree; she also served as director Crane Wilbur's wife.
The banker John Fleming has a minor but also very important participation in the plot.
If you are looking for a compelling thriller, this isn't it also.
Instead I was treated to yet another Cocknee Mocknee crime film, the same as all the others to be released in the last few years (except with even more silly running about, badly filmed gun fights and many many jokes from The Simpsons) Rarely have I found myself laughing so hard at not just bad acting/script/directing (take your pick) but also the preposterous presumption that this is what present day London was really like.
Prior also combined the war and horror genres in THE LOST PLATOON (1989) and also directed KILLER WORKOUT (1987), MARDI GRAS FOR THE DEVIL (1992) and MUTANT SPECIES (1995) in between all his cheapo action movies.
He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry.
There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle class girl (Jessica Alba).
The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.
The list doubtless includes films that some do not consider bad (two films on Medved's list are also in Roger Ebert's Great Movies) but I have not disagreed with any of Medved's selections after sitting through them.
The dying problem is also solved too, with a full recovery taking less than a day.
Full of ballet, opera and the finer things the film also boasts low grade humor from the Ritz Brothers, some middle of the road Gershwin songs and Charlie McCarthy.
That's especially valid when you consider most cartoons from this era also assumed children were idiots and were so cutesy-poo that nowadays they seem not only silly but sickening.
As clearly evident here, the lead flubs lines and ad-libs a lot to the already awful dialog, but since he's also the director/editor/craft service and everything, he can do what he wants.
It was not nearly as good as Little Women - also written by Louisa May Alcott.
There was also frequent jumping to the film which was distracting.
It's also supposed to be its most dramatic point.
First of all this character is only known to us as an Asain women who's friend also goes missing and doesn't want to party.
If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic(there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history.
The large amounts of nudity were also not needed and only added to the lack of morality in this film.
It's also worthwhile noting that the one character that seems to be gay is singled out as the worst of the torturers, further contributing to the filmic stereotype of homosexual as homicidal.
One should also note the historical context of the film.
It's also worth noting that the audience I watched this picture with cheered and applauded at each new horror.
The acting is, also, very much below par, even by low budget horror film standards.
I was also at that Century City screening last night, and I was probably one of the people who were saying they thought this movie was awesome.
I don't know why I started with commenting on the photography (also the editing) of this movie.
It was also really fake looking, when he saw the giant marlin, it didn't look all that big, and also, it was just a movie on a green screen and it looked like the fishing line went through the marlin at one time.
The movie was also less interesting because it did not say what he was thinking, so you didn't feel as attached to him, and a lot of the stuff he thought was important or interesting.
I notice that these four are also never in the tabloids and don't get caught up in the typical Hollywood tripe that is so prevalent today.
Perky Meg Ryan also learns that Whispering Nicholas Cage is an angel, mainly by stabbing him, but is totally turned off by this fact.
The nice little stories of the humans they are watching and also the dialogs between Cassiel and Seth were completely dumbed down.
It also appeared to lose its nerve part way through and introduced much darker notes which were completely out of place in what was a farce.
Rachel Dratch is also extremely grating as a fellow passenger on the Bus of Fools and there's nothing appealing about Alexis Georgoulis who plays the object of Georgia's affection.
i don't think so, maybe the novel it's far way better than this very bad film...by points, i can say some causes for this failure: 1. the script it's very lame 2. the characters are so poor and their background lacks in every aspect 3. the casting it's also uninspired 4.
As well as being a Slater fan,i also like Stephen King,but this really disappoints,It starts off with Jimmy Dolan killing a couple of immigrant's,as he is a trafficker and burying them alive in the Nevada desert,whilst being watched by a school teacher played by Emmanuele Vaugier(check spelling),so Dolan order's her death,she is put into protective custody along with her partner,Wes Bentley,she ends up dead and Bentley goes on the hunt for revenge,he has numerous opportunities but fails to take them,the same being said for Slater,who also has the opportunity to get rid of Bentley,but makes a mistake by not doing so.
I want my sat night back, but more, i want the trust i also lost with my friends back, as i will probably never be allowed to choose a movie again.
I believe you should suspend disbelief to a point when watching a movie, but the movie makers also have a responsibility to keep things within the realm of possibility.
Next the DIA boss wants to kill her DIA agent husband because who knows why and also wants to take out she and her son.
She had also obviously been eating good.
There's also a scenario where Jason finds a hockey mask and puts it on, which feels completely out of place.
There's also some RIDICULOUS idea about Jason taking a prisoner, which was obviously put in the movie to dampen it and ensure that it got the 'R' rating, which helps the producers to make more money.
The accompanying soundtrack was also above par.
2) There is also a major preoccupation with weed.
Don't forget the original "Valentine's Day Massacre" just released, also uncut for the first time ever.
The film also stoops to presenting distressingly stereotypical characters, including blatantly adding the token black guy and the token Asian guy and then tries to poke fun at it!
The cast was also bad.
This means they had to actively decide it was a good idea to get rid of the evidence that they were not the manics that killed a bunch of people, but it also means that they had to take Jason out of the chipper, take the chain off his neck, remove his mask, and carry him all the way out to the dock.
The ending also fails to make clear that there were 2 UK-mounted war crimes trials of the murderers of the 50 escapees.
Underrated Tish Ambrose, a woman I always felt should have been the next Veronica Hart but whose initial promise Â in Revene's own WANDA WHIPS WALL STREET among several prestigious projects Â remained unfulfilled (perhaps due to well-publicized drinking problems), also scores highly as the soap actress who rallies to Eddie's defense in one of the film's funniest scenes topped by their freaky coupling, stylistically influenced by the Kelly Nichols/Ron Hudd psychedelic porker from ROOMMATES.
The music score is also far too lighthearted and bouncy for what is supposed to be a thriller.
Michael Gough and James Villiers also disgraced themselves.
The viewer can also see just where this man is coming from, since the tax system in Japan is painted as any Republican's worst nightmare.
There's also a cackling old witch played by veteran supporting actress Hanna Hertelendy, who's presence is the most interesting role in the film aside from the captain, who's rotting carcass is remarkably spry and intact for a body that has supposedly been festering in the wreck of a ship for a century.
There's the obligatory love interest (Leonor Varela, whose character's name we also don't know for a while), the Crazy Wise Man, The Sexy Spy, The Comic Relief Who Adds Nothing To The Plot, The Tough Soldier, and The Horrible Dialogue.
This film from director Juzo Itami, who also directed the excellent "The Funeral" is about Ryoko Itakura, a cute freckle faced bowl haircut style tax investigator.
I was also sorely disappointed in John Malchovich's performance.
Fay Dunaway also performs very effectively but John Malkovich is John Malkovich, not the Dauphin.
Besson also inexplicably created a sinister tormentor for Joan, played by Dustine Hoffman.
She is both tenacious and brilliant but also obsessed to the point where she doesn't appear to have much purpose in life but her job.
It interesting though how the story also tries to balance itself by introducing new ideas on what is and is not divine and even this element was clumsily and randomly introduce as plot elements, from Faye Dunaway's character fumbling with the vile of "blood" to Joan herself seeing "visions" Dustin Hoffman's performance was fair but totally unnecessary the film could have limped on without him.
A better version of this story would be the one with Leelee Sobieski, also circa 1999.
I also think there are people nostalgic for the innocence of this bygone era.
There also a few plot threads introduced that don't go anywhere such as a potential boyfriend character who is introduced but disappears and the sleazy uncle's aspiration to run for some form of public office which doesn't lead anywhere.
The fight direction is also amateurish, as when Hunter fights the Black Friar.
Cyril Cusack as Albany and Tom Fleming as Kent should also be praised, and Patrick Magee is creepy as ever as Cornwall.
This 90-minute condensation from the early days of live television also features Alan Badel, Beatrice Straight and Micheal MacLiammoir.
Ryoko is a divorced mother who also works for the Japanese Revenue Service.
He's also a fool for love (he has 2 mistresses and a common law wife), and a devoted father.
Now this is one incompetent sheriff who at times is a real pushover, but also he manages to get other people to do his work for him.
Well it's also got interminable Hot-Wheels-In-The-Terrarium sequences, plus the most insufferably wholesome drag racer of all time.
However, inexplicably, it also chooses to insert a lot of 50s rock and roll into the film--even at moments where it makes absolutely no sense at all.
Sullivan also sings well; although, his choice of material definitely does NOT rock.
There's also Ken Curtis' old colleague from the "Sons of the Pioneers", singer, musician, "comic" and long-time Western bit player "Shug" Fisher in an excruciating performance as the town lush, "Old Man Harris".
Fred Graham is also a sturdy presence as the honest sheriff daring to look beyond the conventional answers when examining the disappearance of missing teenagers, and Lisa Simone laudably resists melodramatics as Sullivan's girlfriend, managing the two rarities of providing an intelligent female lead, and not spending the entire picture screaming.
From a cultural perspective, a 1980s Tokyo is also interesting, with shots of the cityscape, pachinko parlors, love hotels, etc.
A small town in maybe Texas is terrorized by a giant Gila monster for some reason.The local sheriff,who mostly talks on the phone a lot,and a kind hearted young dragster,Chase,set out to rid the town of this threat.Chase races around town in his souped up car and beats the sheriff to all the wrecks and bad stuff that the monster does.Save this tidbit for later---Chase,for some ungodly unexplained reason, also has access to nitroglycerin that apparently comes in what looked to be coffee cans with "XXX" stenciled on them.
This movie was clearly trying to capitalize off all the teen trends of the late 50's---kids and their hot rod cars and their music,Elvis was mentioned, and all that.Chase is a good wholesome teen who is helping his single mom raise his crippled little sister.This cool cat is also trying to get a singing career off the ground.Anyway there is some singing and some DJ comes to town for a dance party and all the while this giant Gila monster is walking around.
He also tries to find other band members, and plans for his big show.
The characters are also dull and very one-dimensional.
In the novel, the character comes across as much prettier and smarter, and the sexual relationship with Spade makes her much more devious; it also makes the love talk at the end and Spade's rejection of Brigid logical.
And we also know (because its a film) that the two Victorian poets HAVE a relationship because otherwise the movie wouldn't have been made.
I also didn't care for either of the two modern scholars.
The premise -- an 19th century author who is a mysogenist and also writes about love and dedication (say what?)
She is a rude, frigid 'lady', who also uncharacteristically falls in love with him, an American slob.
This was also one of Republic Pictures last releases.
Hal (Ben Cooper) is a keen hot rodder who falls under the spell of Lynn Novak (Marla English), a night club singer and also part of a gang of robbers (Nick Adams plays Phil, the one with the cold).
It is also very boring and very badly  acted, not helped by some pretty bad scripting.
The scene where Bark tries to seduce his mother is also a classic of sorts.
The pace is also very slow, with Zombies moving really slowly towards there victims.
As if that weren't enough, they were also skilled in the art of using gardening utensils as weapons.
Not only was there very little story here, it's also full of characters who do things that are so illogical that you wonder if they are alive.
Possibly one of the worst but also one of the funniest horrors I have ever seen and believe me I have seen allot.
Bob agrees to go with him (obviously) to Hollywood, because Bob's internet friend May (Wen Yann Shih) lives there, also.
Granted that this was the late '70's, but the special effects are childish at best - and keep in mind that this decade also produced Star Wars.
but somehow it is also quite entertaining.
It also significantly underplayed the role played by Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal.
Well, the director, master craftsman Robert Anderson, who also has credits The Young Graduates and The Hoax (not the Richard Gere one, remember that for the exam), movies no one but his wife has probably seen, and so with Cindy and Donna, his first film, he puts everything he knows into his art... which means, basically, we get a scene like when Donna is totally 'doing it' with her pot dealer in the car at night, and Cindy is looking on but, you know, the angle of the car is so radical so that there's no way Cindy is looking in on the car that the angle of the camera is and... Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, this is, after all, Grade-X trash that has basically no value; a Cinemax late-night flick probably has better production value, and maybe slightly worse music than the repetitive garage rock here.
Acting also goes along with story, there is nearly none that does anything to further whatever point the filmmakers are making - which, of course, is none.
It's sexploitation that has one or two moments of sexiness (the stripper/Ted's prostitute's dancing scene is hot, I'll give the film that), but also many, many dull patches throughout: any time Anderson actually tries to tell the story, or advance any characters, it's like a snowplow running full speed at high-tide on a beach, it just is flat-out s***.
It was also very interesting for me to have to dub in some of my lines after the movie was finished.
It's format is based on a documentary style, and very badly done I dare to say; also, itÂ´s premise is so predictable that it almost becomes painful to watch.
It also establish that Mexican Comedy Cinema can do better things than La Risa en Vacasiones or Corazon de Melon.
It is also an important breakthrough to Limon Films its production company to get its film out of the Cineteca Nacional and to a bigger audience.
The movie is also helped by the sense of dread hanging over every scene with the dog.
His pictures have had widespread popularity--in their day, but also 'Les Vampires' seems to remain one of the most praised representations of 1910s cinema.
When they do arrive, they meet up with Kate Reilly (Helen Shaver), a scientist who is studying the graboids in the area and is also assisting the owners of the oil refinery.
And of course he also plays with himself a lot; we are subjected to many scenes where he seeks privacy in a bathroom so he can masturbate.
Although professional in scope and production, this film not only loses it's self portrayal, self review objective, it also never develops any plot line that pulls you in as a viewer.
He also comes across as an egomaniac as well: none of the real women he was in relationships with look anything like the porn stars he used in the reenactments.
1st watched 2/14/2010 -- 4 out of 10(Dir-Tad Stones): OK straight to video 3rd entry in the Walt Disney Aladdin series tries hard to be like the Disney movies of old that we love(but that's also it's problem -- it tries too hard!!)
DYING TO BELONG(1997) 3 out of 10: This movie features a nice cast for the time, is a good (in more ways than one)look at the actresses Hilary Swank before her days as a Hollywood star and Sarah Chalke before being a regular on the show Scrubs, and also shows that sometimes film music needs variety.
By the way, in Nazifilm there also were a lot of strong women, who had to die at the end.
also the whole movie was a flop.
It's a good way to see that in Latin America they also "just want to have fun".
Lenny imposes himself on the two women, with off-color remarks about their lesbian relationship, and makes a total jerk of himself by also trying to hit on to Alex, right in front of her startled lover Lou!
It's also obvious that Lenny was the guy who attacked Lou earlier in the film in New York City that left her almost dead and that this time, in secluded Shealter Island, he was going to finish the job that he started back there.
There was also the local Shealter Island Sheriff Deluca, Chris Penn, who also got into the act later in the movie, after you forgot all about him and thought that his brainless actions earlier were just comic relief.
Sheriff Deluca is also one of the major players in the plot to do in poor Lou.The ending of the movie was about as anti-climatic as you could make it with the only major actor in the film who, up to then, had nothing to do with the plot to murder and legally steal Lou's money ending up being the "mastermind" of this whole crazy and unbelievable scenario.
All what I'm having is just tons of confusion and even more tons of disgust not only because of me being that ignorant, but also because of me being that patient to stand all of this antipathetic movie till it ended !!
But I also understand these films were made in close partnership with our own propaganda offices in US Government.
Not only in needed physical action to "fight the good fight", but also in our intellectual understanding of complex issues at home at around the world.
I'm not saying that I'm not sad that he died it's just that I think that Peter Sellers would also not like this movie.
Before the first half were admittedly some funny parts, mostly left over material from "Strikes Again" (I thought the car lighter scene was funny and also the scene on the plane).
The pink panther jewel again has been robbed and as suspect is also the famous thief named the Phantom(David Niven),botcher,bungling Inspector French Surete Jacques Clouseau is assigned to investigate it .But his plane is disappeared.His nemesis Chief Inspector Dreifus(Herbert Lom) jumps with joy.A journalist(Joanna Lumley) wants to look for him, she interviews various personages series (Burt Kwouk,Andre Maranne,Niven and Richard Mulligan as Clouseau's father)to make a television programme .
The sex scenes are done in quite a brutal way, and are longer than necessary and the camera seems to hide, sort of like we are spying on them, and also there are a lot of out of focus shots.
One will also ask the question whether these deleted scenes can really last for 90 minutes, and they'll be right.
It also seems a bit pathetic to recycle old clips from previous films.
While the film has many problems (actaully many), it's a good piece of Comedy, and also a nice tribute to the late great Peter Sellers.
This also means the return of David Niven, Robert Loggia, Harvey Korman, Graham Stark, Capucine, Burt Kwouk, AndrÃ© Maranne and of course Herbert Lom.
After all David Niven was already seriously ill at the time and also died shortly after shooting.
I'm sure Blake Edwards wanted to make something special for his good old friend and at the same time also use this movie as a set up for the next sequel "Curse of the Pink Panther", which was also shot at the same time as this movie and is therefor also featuring most of the same actors.
Watching this old cut archive footage also often makes it obvious why it got cut from the original movies.
The comedy in those sequences also often doesn't work out as intended, which explains why they never made the final cut.
It's also confusing to see some sequences that were obviously meant original for mainly "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" and "Revenge of the Pink Panther" incorporated into this movie as part of the story but however these different sequences obviously don't really connect with each other also because most of those sequences are basically the same, though less good, ones that got eventually used in those earlier mentioned movies.
But also the originally shot comical sequences for this movie don't really work out.
He tried to make it work by putting also new characters into the movie, such as Clouseau's father.
This abomination not only uses outtakes but also used takes from Strikes Again and Return.
A fake nose from disguise dealer Auguste Balls is called "Wino And Roses," a play on a previous Edwards film also used as a joke in "Revenge Of The Pink Panther."
But they probably also thought it shabby, which it was.
She also has a moment confronting Lom (who can't give a damn about finding Clousseau) where she mimics his twitching eye.
It is also painfully obvious this was a clear milking of the franchise fans.
Little is also roped in to imitate the voice of Harvey Korman (more successfully) and Sellers (excruciating), which only makes things stranger.
This also extends to the action sequences in which are flatly choreographed, badly directed and completely drained of all possible excitement.
It is also shows a great irony in today's society, where people will go to bed without knowing each other (and this probably happened even before one night stands even existed...).
Watching the movie I also wondered, dressed in black from the top of the head, to toe, a string of white pearls would really stand out.
Watching the movie I also wondered, dressed in black from the top of the head, to toe, a string of white pearls would really stand out.
Sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long, slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose).
Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others searching the pacific northwest for a plane that crashed that his daughter was on and also a special machine his company has built that he wants to also retrieve.
And there is also the POV shots that are right from "Wolfen" and "Predator".
The film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of the wilderness, but there are plenty monster point-of-view shots that add nothing to anything.
It was also very predictable, boring and slow.
Although "En la cama" presents a similar situation to the excellent film "Before Sunrise," which also portraits two young strangers sharing just one night, they are totally different and cannot be compared.
He is also able to be funny as he proved in Four Weddings and A Funeral.
James Caan was vague and Jeanne Tripplehorn could also do better.
One will also notice that with the possible exception of minor characters, not a single male individual on hand is sympathetic, thereby accenting the need for females to rely on each other.
Dallesandro also gets shot and we have a semi-mutilated cat in the garden.
She is also too graceful a Helen.
The remake also tampers with the original script.
The movie also doesn't feel quite at home carrying the Hellraiser title, aside from Pinhead and the Cenobites' presences and the occassional flash of the Lament Configuration.
Inferno was mostly morality and i could deal with it because it was something different but in hellseeker, we have "Lets make a deal" Kirsty and a cheating spouse and also a tale of greed.
Perhaps the writers also forgot that dead people stay that way, as they brought several of them back to take part in the battle.
I decided to rent the movie based on the fact that IMDb's ratings for the movie was 7.1 out of ten and also on the fact that Nick Nolte also appears in the film.
Further, he has a large selection of different hats that he self-consciously picks from every time he has to go and perform some task; when he has to delegate an arrest to his sergeant, he even delegates the appropriate (fishing) hat to him also!
I just managed to bear the movie as it got worse and worse and was thankful when it ended, which is when I realized that it didn't just feel long to me; it's also that the thing is way too long!
1492 also marked the inquisition of the Jews from Spain.
We should have also inquired why this abominable film was ever made.
Characterisation was also poor, with each person behaving in ways that were completely unbelievable.
-- G.K. Chesterton, _The Man Who Was Thursday_, Chapter II  See also:  Chesterton fans will probably remember when Chesterton's priest-detective, Father Brown, first interacts with the great criminal Flambeau, who was disguised as a priest.
It's not like a want to put a gun to my head, but it's also not like I get an urge to frolic outdoors.
The film is also a very personal journey for Jonas Cuaron.
And there will be people who will also enjoy the film.
His character is also completely undeveloped, as are most of the other characters.
It's also either too long, or it just felt that way.
Women get something of a raw deal in it, and also DY seems to think that everyone fancies him as much as he fancies himself.
Yoakam also provides the memorably haunting musical theme runs throughout the movie.
The music score is also a disappointment.
It also makes no sense that I can decipher.
I also mentioned the actresses/actors being bad, I got that feeling where you're pi*sed off at them, thinking, no, that's not how you behaved during that era plus their performances aren't convincing on any plan.
The slow pace is also mentioned, but this pace is nothing compared to Angelopoulos' amazing work, so again that is not what failed for me.
Respectful in the face of Death, duly serious, yes, but also somewhat bored and hoping you can get away quickly.
2nd worst Easy Virtue also another preview freebie.
Heather Graham (who's accent also slips out - when it should be her tits)is gratingly out of place as a prostitute her colleagues all look like hags while she looks like a model.
Kudos are also in order for the wondrous wealth of inspired macabre touches: a chicken in a birdcage, the armchair made out of human bones, and the aged grandfather (John Dugan in hideously wizened make-up) who drinks human blood.
I don't really need to say anything about the excellence in Emily's performance as Brigitte, do i, Katherine is also great as ever, in her best role, only rivaled by her little part in Freddy vs. Jason.
He also knew the killer was rich and educated, and there were more than one suspect at hand.
As a movie, this film is also a disapointment.
In this one she is also sexy.
One suspected his heart was not really in this hotly steaming turd and he just went through the paces playing the exact same role as he did in "Sleepy Hollow," which, though it also had a tired old plot, still turned into a great movie.
There are also fight scenes where it's obvious that the people are NOT the actors--especially when a dark haired guy is standing in for silver haired Scott!!
Another occurence that gave rise to emotions (an unfortunate death) was completely wasted also.
What's sad about that is that the writer (also the producer and director, as I mentioned before) is Indian and Hindu also.
The perspective espoused here matches up nicely with the the view that many Indians hold of ABCDs: that all of them have forgotten their heritage and culture, that all the women are promiscuous, the men are conflicted yet also promiscuous, that all ABCDs hate their parents with a passion and seek to flout their moral standards at every opportunity, and that the women can be redeemed (temporarily at least)by having sex with a ridiculous, platitude-spouting FOB.
Together, they must not only battle against American biases against them, they must also counter their own demons.
Like all its predecessors, ABCD also has some sizzling moments to entice international audiences towards it.
Trouble is, the only help available is the boy's eccentric (I would prefer to call him useless) inventor father and the two most inept law officials you'll ever meet (who also happen to be the only cops on the islands).
Another film which is like an urban version of this is; American Psycho, a film which I also recommend.
This movie also set the standards for low-budget films a lot higher.
Cheryle Ladd was a major disappointment also.
I could swear that I have also seen another movie that used this footage as well.
Maria Schneider is also in this, and it's easy to see why she's been described elsewhere as a "non-actress" - she doesn't even try to act.
I also forgot to mention Jim Seidow's performance which was another fine performance and it has some great chase scenes but that's it.
I did enjoy the hitchhiker part which was really good but I do prefer the remake scene as it was shocking and Leather Face was really scary in the movie, did make me jump in one scene also there were few creepy moment around dinner table.
True, Karen Walton, who wrote the original (with director John Fawcett) also had no experience, but she also worked on that script for four years.
The movie padded out with subplots about a pimp blackmailing the titular banker and Forster's annoying and shrill reporter girlfriend baiting the banker on her news show so she can be kidnapped by him for the predictable finale and also with some pointless soft core sex scenes.
If you've seen Juon/The Grudge/The Ring you've seen it all before.The film also uses people with physical deformity for frightening effect for no good reason other than the film makers have broken through the bottom of the barrel.
So, when the series begins, Christine's spouse has already walked out on her, for a younger, NICER woman, who is also named Christine; hence, NEW Christine.
I also loved Serial Mom and Pecker.
Without a doubt the most influential psychopath in American history as he was also the base for other horror milestones such as Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector.
That's also the only reason why I don't give this movie a 1/10 but a 4/10.
I think Freddie is great looking guy so for his fans yes this is a good watch, but if there is another movie on the shelf that you would also like to see, get that one first this can wait.
Jennifer is going to Italy after graduation, and surprisingly they spend a night together, after which she skitters away saying they should just be friends, and he is withdrawing also.
It would also increase the bottom line $$$, especially if it would have a theatrical release, and not be released straight-to-video (kiss of death.)
It also shows that even though Disney is making shorts again, they're still sentimental fluff on topics the maker's don't really know that much about.
Sure, it's sweet, but it's also impersonal.
Unfortunately, that company is also infamous for their sugar-coated reality and sentimentality, so they've managed to keep that as well.
We're also given glimpses to Leatherface's tortured, crazed soul, bits of characterization like a gesture and a look of his eyes.
As I said before, love concept is illogical also, as they madly fall in love in some guys that they have just seen.
It's also strange considering this take, that Franklyn is the last of the leads to die.
Well he's also got a mean misogynistic or maybe just plain misanthropic streak in him from what I can tell.
The women in it are pretty, to be sure, but they're also totally unlikeable.
There is also the appearance of fellow Chicagoan Anne Marie (Eufala Roop from ULTRAVIXENS) that is all too brief.
my least favorite of all the Meyer films, and although I do like Napier, Supervixens and also Cherry, Harry, And Raquel are the 2 Meyer films I've seen that I really don't like much.
The boy is also a stereotypical Vietnamese peasant.
It is also one of few timeless films that has managed to combine horror and avant-garde styles, successfully.
Daniel MacIvor, you did your best and played your role with heart, for this I thank you...but then again you also wrote it, so I'm still upset.
First,Lets look at the Illogical.How could a doped to The Eyeballs Junkie take down a Vigilante in Peak Condition.His Taser would not affect the Batsuit and,even if it did,Batman is an expert Escape Artist and a few Chains could not Hold Him for Long.He is also a Genius Detective.How could He make such an obvious Mistake as thinking a College Student was part of a Gang?
Couldn't a cop or DA also make that same mistake?
We're talking about a man who saw his parents killed right in front of him as a boy; got hell from all his trainers as he prepared to become Batman; saw a close friend's double personality destroy him; after failing save a girl from drowning, got addicted to a steroid pill for which he had to lock himself in the cave for a month to recover from it(hence the unbelievability of the heroin addiction part); had his second Robin brutally murdered; had another sidekick (Barbara Gordon) paralyzed at the hands of the Joker; saw his other best friend, Gordon, stripped naked, tortured, and tormented with pictures of his daughter, also stripped, just after she had been shot and paralyzed; after going a week with less than a day's sleep rounding up all of Arkhum's inmates after they had escaped, got his back busted by steroid-laced madman; saw his beloved city have its own Black Death from the "Clench" virus, then further carnage when it got leveled by a 7 point earthquake.
There are also scenes of what looks like the Bell X-1 (the rocket plane in which he broke the sound barrier).
In light of all this, I must also say that in some respects, TCM's bark is much worse than it's bite.
In closing, I'd also like to go out on a limb and make the following grandiose statement: TCM is the greatest horror film of all time!
The acting (even from the Duke) is also sub-par from such a cast.
Again, it also has some great aerial footage, which is what you would expect from Hughes.
As a result of this bad writing and questionable acting, the film is a chore to watch and I assume most kids would also balk at having to sit through this flick.
She has also shown maturity in the scenes when the inevitable occurs.
There are shots of the auditorium not only during curtain calls but also during the performance itself.
Heather Graham's dramatic climax also was one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I have ever witnessed.
Well I also do recall the mobsters and the chewing gum.
After you see this, you'll probably recall Jennifer saying "The Rockawho" also.
Like THE ROCKETEER, those two films had also been lightweight, glossy adventures set roughly during the World War II era.
There's really nothing wrong with this (the INDIANA JONES films and Disney's own BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS had also served up Nazis for a family audience); the problem here is that, unlike in other films, here Nazism seems more like a spice rather than an essential ingredient.
Her unkempt eyebrows were also a bit awkward to look at (hey, my friend noticed this too).
The part where he decides NOT to tell Mo about his wife being in the castle worked in context of his character, to a degree, but it also felt like a convenient excuse to take the story down a detour, witch could have been forgivable, if this detour was interesting to begin with.
The book hugging grandmother that decides to storm a castle with her bike also falls under the annoying category.
I also find his "are you a man or woman" shows as extremely insulting.
And I also find his boot camp strategies as retarded since really bad treatment by drill sergeants does not automatically lead to new found respect for yourselves or your body.
The dads are also idiots too for not paying 3 dollars to purchase condoms to make sure that a pregnancy does not happen.
Aside from the reported name-change (from The Maury Povich Show to simply Maury) the tone of the show would appear to have also gone downhill.
I also understand the there are "different strokes for different folks."
I also know that different programs have different demographics - say, "Monk" versus "Friends;" "American Idol" versus a Sinatra or Tony Bennett retrospective.
He allowed his show to morph from its original format with more serious topics, to its present format, certainly for the audience numbers and the financial benefits resulting - but you can also see his tongue is well into his cheek.
I also don't like the construction of the show, recapping what the guests are saying before they arrive on the stage is unnecessary, when they can just say it when Maury asks them to.
But understand that is also viewer manipulation and part of television's contribution to the decline of western civilization.
I also have many qualms with the way this movie was cut -- the weird "is it a dream, or is it reality" cuts were really tiring, annoying, and frustrating.
The therapist character was also incredibly annoying, that that she was completely unemotional and subdued the whole time, even when Adrian's character attempted to murder her.
They also tried to be correct, but Woody Strode wasn't the only race faux pas.
Although the most prolific of those directors who rose from the ranks of exploitation films in the 70s, John Carpenter's flame may have burned the brightest but it also burned the most briefly before he descended into lifeless hackwork.
Also, I thought that getting bitten by a vampire wasn't enough to make you a vampire, you also had to drink blood from the vampire that bit you.
A notable percentage also voted 7/10 and 1/10.
Turns out her sister Mary was involved in a diamond theft and double-crossed her husband who was also her partner.
The movie also shows the tedious and frustrating talks to end the war.
The Spiderwoman (also by Nakamura), follows a couple of magazine reporters who are writing an article on a mysterious monster that has been repeatedly sighted in the town of Ibaraki.
***Spoilers..maybe*** While the "adventure" focus the most part on the "growing" and "surprinsing"(because nobody can actually explain how many powers Will has or how did he get them)of Will Treston, it also points the relationship of him, with his family(BIG family, by the way), and maybe love-wise.
The characters and situations are badly developed and I took a ten minutes nap along the story, but I did not rewind the DVD because I noted that the part I had missed was also boring.
I would agree that you can see the budget in the film, but I would add that you can also see that it was wasted.
The film envisioned by Milestone was also not to end with a voice-over saying how important the battle really was.
He's just turned 14, and has also just discovered that he's part of a prophecy that he never knew about.
Go see the movie "The Serpent's Egg", also, as a warning from the danger of fascism.
EDITEND *  Somewhere, at two thirds of the film, I realized the critical view, the critical stand the direction takes, also against the government.
I agree we should pay the CREW of the movie, all the people that worked in it, and also the folks who gave the money to realize it SOME substitute and reward for their brilliant work.
This also leads me to the fact that democracy is not only way too capitalistic - in the last years, there have sprung out economy con men, partially "network marketeers" and others, by the tens of thousands, even more.
That movie (because it is the same movie) is also a blatant work of nonsense.
I also found that character inappropriately funny given that the movie was released so soon after Corwin's death.
I was so mad when i realized the killer was not going to be a human, and also that the advertisements fooled my friends and i (probably as planned).
It was also too predictable.
anyway there's also a dictator who has the same name as the crocodile which also causes some problems.
So of course not only do they have to fight the croc, they are also in trouble with the local war lord.
3 votes are also for good camera work for initial 30-40 minutes of movie.Its bad movie,its really very bad movie.Don't waste your time as well as your mood and your next day by watching this movie.
The early civil rights-era film seems to also touch on some social issues, showing a camaraderie between all ethnicities.
The script was also in some ways done in poor taste and wasn't well thought out, like I'm not offended easily usually when it comes to racial jokes, but Orlando going on about slavery in Africa went a little too far and was ridiculous.
It's only at this point that the movie even gets up to the quality of Anaconda which also had fake looking effects.
I should make very clear that while this film is clearly derivative of Blade Runner, it is nowhere near the feast for the eyes that the former is, and it also fails miserably at putting its own unique visual spin on the future.
In addition, there was also an in your face, down in the dirt grittiness about the film that many other war films even to this day lack.
The movie goes beyond just being an homage and at several points DIRECTLY rips off Blade Runner (the stripclub, the eatery, etc etc) I could even have liked it in spite of its blatant lifting of Blade Runner's scenes, had it not also had a meagre created world in comparison to the original, and more importantly, had it had a sympathetic main character.
Unfortunately, Natural City turns out to be a remarkable example of what happens with a writer who can't put together a coherent story proves to also be a director who is unable to tell a story clearly.
There is also some attention given to the newer pop-punk/emo acts and the debate on whether or not they are punk.
On the contrary, Robert Mitchum, who was also arrested, came back to resume a hotter then ever film career.
I would also like to take the opportunity to mention that the ending to this almost turned my friends and I off movies for life...  Hey, I even enjoyed "Weekend at Bernie's" a little bit, but this?
Although there are plenty of movies far better than this, which I also gave only a 1/10.
On a scale of 1 to 1,000, I'd still give it a 1...  Perhaps I should point out that all the others I saw this with also said it was the worst movie they'd ever seen, and one of them was nearly 50, so I'm not alone.
I am also a fan of classic war movies (lately that's about all I've been watching as I slowly work my way through the local video store's collection).
The acting was awful,they simply couldn't, and compared to 'bend it like beckham, also directed by Gurinder Chadha this is an utter failure.
Who cares if little miss moneybags doesn't get her boy, she still has her thousands of pounds, her family and friends and her otherwise amazing life (the boy who, by the way, is referred to as a 'sex-god', and is also 16 years old, two years older than her.)
She talked about the lack of acting skill - true, the lack of good direction - also true, and the shoddy dialogue - which i thought was "meh".
The first murder-sequence also comes at the exact right timing and it's quite bloody, especially considering the tone of the film so far.
Spang Olsen's direction is less incompetent than usual, but with the emphasis less on action this time, the film also suffers from many dull stretches.
The ending is also a complete letdown: Laura informs Claus that she has decided to sort out herself and work on her (very serious) problems.
There were also several instances of foreboding-the wife telling the nanny that she won't be back for a while and when the dog breaks free and swims to the boat as if to save the wife.
i would say ignore it,also there are certain people like myself who would (and will!!!!!)
Traces Of Death also includes the televised suicide of Bud Dywhite.
I see its also banned in the UK, normally I think censorship is abhorrent, but in this case the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) should be given an award instead of the baseball bat!!!!.
At this point I'd also like to point out this part does NOT have any death metal music.
As every other "shockumentary", "mondo death film" and the like out there "Traces of Death" also holds nothing back and pulls virtually no punches as we are treated to one revolting and sickening clip after another of people dieing and or being horribly injured in ways that no sane clear-thinking person could ever actually fathom!
The film also has an atmosphere of tragedy throughout.
This is one of the things I liked best about the original; the dark and morbidity of what's happening on screen consolidates with the characters, and are almost an extension of those characters; which also serves in giving the film a degree of intelligence.
AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA was a hit at the BO so The makers decided to make DEEWANE HUYE PAAGAL, and with the now famous Akshay's comic timing there decided to make a copy of THERE's SOMETHING ABOUT MARY  Took Suneil, Paresh added Shahid, Rimii Sen  Made a commercial comedy film  The narrator act of Viveik that starts the film drowns it first only, luckily the film gets interesting with Akshay's entrance and then a few jokes are nice but then we have so many stupid scenes  A boring leading lady whom i doubt any guy of her age will also fall for Sorry Rimii, But why did the director choose her for the role that required someone damn hot and beautiful to explain people like Asrani falling for Budget constraints?
The plot, also involving Indian ambushes, the abduction of a squaw (who, of course, falls for Heston at his hairiest!)
Earlier, after Rudy shot the sheriff's deputy, he not only stole his cruiser but also his jacket.
Each is also promised immortality in 13 year blocks if they are willing to give Father Seaton a "pure" blood relation for sacrifice to Satan.
Melissa's legs also tend to be a major distraction.
Most effects appear to be the practical kind although there are also a couple of dodgy camera effects which are overused.
I also wish that Melissa hadn't disappeared for three-quarters of the film as, from the order of the credits, I really thought she was going to carry the whole thing.
This one is also not all that gory, there is blood and lots of booby shots, but not a whole lot of gore.
You also have an undercover nun and two cops that looked like they were straight out of that Beastie Boys video Sabotage.
There was also no nudity in the DVD (Rhino) that I saw (there is also very little blood and almost no horror).
Meanwhile, the leader of the cult engaged a convicted killer to randomly kidnap the granddaughter's best friends and then Â finally Â there's also a sub plot about a devoted nun going undercover in the cult by order of the Catholic Church.
There's also the Satanist's goon, who goes about like a slasher killing some people, abducting others.
I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).
There also wasn't much gore so again, if that's why you like horror movies, pass on this one.
I Don't get it.... also the use of old footage for the puppets is just bad.
Jane Magrew is also innocent and for some reason loves the "Pinhead" doll.
There are very few people to like here, which also hurts.
She also gets to display her dramatic side in an enactment of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" that brings tears to one's eyes, not because it is moving, but because it is painful to watch.
Garrett also meets Jim Brown, a miner who the outlaws have robbed and left tied up and stretched out to die.
Corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and Â simply put Â nearly impossible to judge properly.
Matthau's windbag character also instantly turned me off.
The film also makes some amusing digs at the French Canadians by French people from France!
They show the city against the background of a early sunrise; however, there was no heavy columns of smoke that resulted from the French artillery shells exploding in the city There was also no sound of French airplanes and having them bomb and machine gun the Syrians' positions.
As for the direction, I can only say this director also directed "Conflict" another third rate Bogart film.
Somehow her domestic problems also and fling with Bogart also don't arouse the audiences interest.
But I would also have to say that Sirocco takes place at a time when certain movements and issues were coming to the fore.
I too like Christopher Walken and also so saw on the box that Nacy Allen was in it.
The protagonists (you CANNOT call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons.
There's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me.
He also looks a complete wuss, especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair, and is clearly a moron.
Mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite.
He is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason.
The bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary.
The climax is also rather nonsensical.
on a 5-day shooting schedule (see also: Ray, Fred Olen).
I also love the bit where the robot begins to severe its left hand.
Alan Rickman (Dogma, Die Hard and the Harry Potter films) is also a fantastic actor but doesn't really pull off being an English hair dresser.
and Rachel Griffiths (Six Feet Under) are also in the film.
I also did not like at all how the plastic surgeon was portrayed.
He also doesn't seem to be aware that he can use takes that are less than ten minutes long.
Although not to quite the same level, the same could also be said of Andrea Bogart and Jennifer Tisdale.
It also didn't look right...many shots had the appearance of high-def video and I was surprised to find, in the supplementary features, that it was actually shot on film.
And also, it took thing's from real life and put it in a movie.
And it also seems like perhaps none of this "detour" was random either, it was planned out by someone & therein lies the twist of this, which by the point it's revealed you are so bored you won't care or you already saw it coming.
I was also able to say, "insert tedious cheap scare... now" and it would always happen.
They also pick up a blonde hitchhiker (Jen) who, for no reason other than to pad the running time, gives out a looonnngggg stupid monologue.
There's also a pointless nude scene which was so obviously and stupidly shoved in that I felt sorry for the actress.
There is also a very good score and some cute directorial touches.
I thought at first I just had a dud.I wasn't able to get a refund only an exchange for the same stupid movie, and the next factory sealed one also skipped in the same exact spot so obviously the master copy is bad and has been transfered to all of the discs.I won't buy or rent anything again by this no-name new filmmaker and hope other's don't make the same mistake unless you like bad quality, grainy B-rated films made by a guy and his friends with a cheap hand held video camera.It is nothing more then someone's student film.All the money was spent on deceiving us with interesting looking cover art and a nice animated main menu.This is the only reason I even gave the movie a 2 out of 10.That is all this movie has going for it.It's a shame because I wanted to like this film but could never sit through it again.Now i've lost 14 bucks that could have been spent on something else.I feel ripped off!
I also recall that the visual F/X were not bad for the early 90's.
I was also gravely concerned that this show would make the networks more reluctant to take chances on future Sci-Fi oriented series, due to it's quick demise.
Jonas paints like a retarded twelve year old but not only wins the hearts and minds of his class, but also Audrey's attentions.
Malkovich (who also produced) is very funny, and so is Broadbent, but mostly this feels like the type of comedy Jerome's roommate Vince might someday make: overly broad, obvious, and very self- conscious.
Worth seeing if you run across it on cable and you're in the mood for a very uneven comedy.It would be also okay to get in the bargain bin at the 99 cent store (which is how I got my copy) since its not worth more than a dollar.
The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf.
It was well shot and had some stylish camera angles...also some of the characters were very very likable.
Sam Neill and Martin Short were both also mis-cast for the title role and sidekick respectively, and it shows throughout the annoying banter between the two.
The special effects and Jim Henson Muppet Shop also deserve mention, but weren't nearly enough to offset the absence of a plausible storyline and great acting as can be found in `Excalibur' and `Dragonslayer'.
Hallmark has done here to the legend of Merlin what they also did to the Bible in the horrible 1999 NBC mini-series "Noah's Ark".
And there's also a court case in the movie.
Had Preminger not also served as the film's producer, I might think this melodrama may have been foisted upon him as an obligation (it certainly doesn't seem like material he'd be attracted to).
Close Encounters also suffers from some rhythmless pacing.
I also agree with the other poster about the huge numbers of homers and long balls being out of place in the game of that era.
Dorothy also runs away because her parental figures don't "understand" her; the same with Joe.
And I'm sure fans of movies with creepy dolls have also made this Canadian slasher a minor cult item.
Did I mention there's also a kid in this film?
There are also many pointless scenes in the movie, and many bits make the viewer laugh.
Steven McKray a expert marine biologist learns that Marc Desantis sister Corinne Desantis ( Jennifer McShane ) is also in town and meets up with her at the Hook & Net bar where they meet hostile fishermen, who blame American scientists for the Shark Attacks.
I was also impressed with the always-excellent Charles Middleton (best remembered as Ming the Merciless) as the villain.
And as if the fact that the protagonist is totally irritating isn't enough to detract from our enjoyment of the movie, there's also the rank implausibility of the storyline.
There were also inconsistent events.
The other brides on board are also strange when throwing themselves into the arms of the buyers.
Los Angeles detective Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is on the case & catches up with the killer but loses him after being stabbed in the heart, waking up in hospital Ferguson realises that he had heart surgery & that the killer is still at large, Ferguson's captain (Steven Williams) is on his case to get results & the pressure is also on from a sensationalistic media & a worried public.
The Fear Chamber is a poor serial killer thriller with supernatural overtones which is pretty bad all round really & it also features one of the most predictable twist endings ever which is a straight rip-off of The Sixth Sense anyway.
That movie was also not as believable as I had hoped.
Then shooting around in an airplane as if you're on the ground, is also not the best idea.
all things considered this movie is pretty unremarkable.it has too many slow spots with nothing happening.then when there is some action,the scenes are way too long and protracted.it's your typical "nut job takes control of an airplane and the good guys try to regain control" movie.i also found it even less realistic than most movies of the genre.the dialogue was pretty lame too.the characters are your run of the mill characters for these types of movies.the acting wasn't great,either,though i did like Ice-T,who plays a federal agent in the movie.the runtime is about 94 minutes with end credits,but it sure felt a lot longer.the bottom line for me,this movie added nothing new to the genre and was certainly not as good as any of the other movies of the genre.if i were you,i would check out "Turbulence" Passenger 57",Executive "Decision" and "Con Air",which are all better examples of the genre.for me,Sonic Impact is a 4/10
But that also has saved some mediocre films and made them entertaining.
The constant "sound library" cheese-music was also a nice touch.
Unfortunately, this film will only be preaching to the converted just as Beavis and Butthead also did in the same era, while sterile and boring masses take it at face value.
But it seems they don't teach him how to tell right from wrong: first he attacks the burglars, but then he also attacks a policeman.
Footnote: There was a spin-off series that was also called 'Family Dog' (1993), but I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's good.
That also describes Christopher Walken, who played Johnny in the movie.
The movie The Apple also rises (?)
In fact, the also deadly serious Billy Jack (1971) made zillions at the box office--not because it was a good film (though it wasn't quite as bad as The Trial of Billy Jack) but because it was a perfect film for the times.
Anthony LaPaglia gives a reasonable performance in what must be a difficult role and, if I remember, the respective actor and actress who play John Barton and Katia Allibrandi are also quite good The script and dialogue, so successful in the book, falls flat in this movie.
The storyline also left me with more questions at the end of the movie.
The exposition, which is long and luxurious, also brings in the tool for the seduction - a young Italian harlot named Sandii (Asia Argento), whose pouty lips, sensuously unkempt hair and beautiful body will be the tool to lure the scientist from his 'ball-busting' wife and displeasure with his current position.
Dafoe is in on the deal, but is also falling in love with Sandii, even though he knows she is prone to lying about almost everything.
I also loved _Bad Lieutenant_, and I'm a fan of William Gibson's writing.
Despite this, she works for a middle-aged couple (Derek de Lint and Alice Krige) looking after their infant child but before long, tragedy strikes when the baby is also killed in a fire.
It will be on TV again in a few months I suspect, and I also expect that I'll catch a few minutes of it then, if I can.
It's only when I saw so many credits at the end I realised the 10 year old directing the film must have a lot of friends, who also must have seen the Australian film called Undead which used similar opening well sort of, but was one heck of a lot better, in fact it was good.
It also doesn't help that the majority of the characters are essentially uninteresting and unlikable (even though the actors for the most part are actually better than expected), and when they die, you don't feel anything other than indifference.
As this movie is also called Gangs of the dead and like it says above Last Rites, if i knew that was same movie, I would never have picked up (What the hell did it give a different name in the UK.
You'll also be giving the film company licence to mislabel any product in the future in the hope that they'll make an easy buck out of gullible saps like you.
John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good job  Now he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)  We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in it  The main problem is actually the storytelling, direction  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined  Ajay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredients  The comedy by Sushant Singh is poor  The film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it further  Direction by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okay  Amongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
I didn't regret watching it, in all fashion is what this movie is really about, not a line of fashion, but many styles, not only in dressing but also talking and even walking.
And as a Canadian, I'm very proud that our filmmakers are capable of making a horror franchise that maintains not only the scare-factor, but also a lot of much-needed dignity.
There's also the part where beer is referred to as the "breakfast of champions".
Not only is it memorable in the fact that it was written by a woman in a time when women were considered the lesser of the two sexes, but it also set up new standards for science-fiction and horror that were expanded even further with following plays and ultimately the 1931 James Whale film of the same name, which featured Boris Karloff as the mutinous, growling monster created from dead bodies fused with electricity.
THEN Victor approached, also on a sledge, NOT on foot!
Yes, it's a novel about creating life and playing God, but underneath that is a novel about both adolescent sexuality Â Young Victor, alone in his attic, fooling around with nature Â and also the consequences of creating a life and then not taking responsibility for it.
and also the scene where Brannagh attempts to save the guy who taught him in the operating room (the camera work is absolutely classic!).
Oh yes and also check out Brannagh's Hamlet - the guy slaughters every film he touches.
His mother also died from illness, not childbirth.
THe movie also lacks consistency and logic.SPOILERS How does a doctor who can bring a creature to life for the first time in human history study it for a matter of minutes before mistakingly thinking it is dead, and then just leaving the body hanging from his ceiling.
In Branagh's defense, there are a lot of difficulties translating the original work into movie form as there are many long passages of time in which critical details are summarized, also there is a lot of introspection and conversation that would need to be translated into something more visually compelling.
Numerous comparisons are made between the monster and Adam from The Bible, also the monster and Satan, the powerful fallen angel.
He also ruined the romantic relationship between Victor and Elizabeth, which in the book started as deep admiration and built with some suspense and tension until it finally culminated in their marriage and her demise, but Branagh decided to have them fondling each other more or less within the first ten minutes of the film.
The viewer is also forced to watch very exaggerated acting from most of the main characters (DeNiro manages to avoid this) as if they're trying to make up for the poor screenplay adaptation by overacting.
We also had ex-cons working in our building, and we had break-ins and crimes committed by maintenance staff, though no rapes or murders.
I also could not believe the manner in which the military was made fun of.
There are also a few good moments provided in cameos by Steven Wright, James Belushi, and Dan Akroyd.
I also think he realized that was his calling after seeing this finished product.
Lord Shin also tires to kill Ryuken's son, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels).
Towards the end Kenshiro has to fight lots of Lord Shin's guards, he literally punches or kicks them once & they're defeated, Kenshiro's climactic fight with Lord Shin was also a let down.
It also could have done with losing a few minutes worth of running time as it drags a little in places.
Lord Shin, the lead bad guy also played by an American, kidnaps Kenshiro's girl Juliet and leaves Kenshiro for dead after brutally injuring him.
Wrestling fans may recognise a brief appearance by Leon White also known as WCW and WWE Superstar Big Van Vader.
He also would not allow the films talented composer Calhoun the appropriate time to score the film properly, so what we are left with once again is the wasted talent of the composer.
After all, this is merely a young man eating a bowl of cereal (this scene also goes on for far too long, I should add).
There were also numerous technical flaws with the film.
The audio also sounded heavily quantized.
He proceeds to rip the hearts out of basically everyone in the hospital while stalking the one girl whose body he wants to inhabit - using his, also unexplained, demonic powers.
It also insists that the company "does everything in its power to prevent accidents", which in my corporate experience is exactly as likely as *individuals* doing everything possible; that is to say, not at all likely.
There also seems to be a 1993 Hollywood remake.
Sharp-eyed movie lovers will also notice the ubiquitous Mike Starr as a 'heavy' (he's the one who hangs on to the car Stone is driving); like character actor Dan Hedaya, Starr seemed to inhabit just about every film Hollywood made in the 90's, though here, Starr's part is strictly dramatic and not his usual comedic one.
Humor, is also fully absent.
With the unexplainable introduction to British education bewildering me at every turn, I must also question the validity of director Marek Kanievska's choice to bookend this film with an aging Everett attempting to explain his reason for being a traitor by using his boyhood school days as an analogy of life and love.
Unfortunately no one had the nerve to tell him it was a small role and he gives us his usual "lovable" foreign schmuck stereotype,shouting and waving his arms.His comical misuse of the word "Pussy" should have you rolling in the aisle.It has Tom Arnold in a rather bigger role.He too spends most of his time shouting and waving his arms in between "hilarious" attempts to kiss Hugh Grant.It also has Joan Cusack,a sort of madonna (with a small "m") figure worshipped for her fecundity.She too is very loud,her screams in labour are truly terrifying.And then there is Julianne Moore wafting through the movie half - heartedly,looking as though her mind is really on where she left her car keys.She is so disinterested she can barely be bothered to look at Hugh Grant,which is a sentiment I can at least have a certain sympathy for.
But they also use nuclear weapons (an apparent evil) and are ultimately protected by radioactivity and then gold (the basis of our monetarist ways).
Yes it's poor but it also has some symbolism and is not that much worse than many other films I have seen.
This includes John Travolta who was also in Staying Alive, Two of a Kind and Swordfish, which are comparative masterpieces.
And, not only did a flight simulator exist in the city, conveniently located so that genius and his pals can train to fly those jets, it's also powered and working after 1,000 years, electrically supplied by .... umm......dunno.
I was surprised that the American version (which was also directed by Sluizer, by the way) really copped-out on the ending.
Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:  * Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.
Ingrid is also having many  visions/hallucinations involving her mother, who killed herself after  a tryst with a strange man.
The sheriff also gets a surprise when Uncle Carl flies in from New  York.
Not only is she the coldest fish on earth but she's also a fierce man-hater.
Number one on her list is the town rowdy Frankie who also works as the butcher in the local market when he's not having a very inappropriate relationship with the sheriff's seventeen year old daughter.
Did I mention that she also has hallucinations too?
There are also many gaps in the humor that result in dull moments.
i hated that radha Michelle, she frig-gin played him so bad and then left him for that other cheating mofo, it was like wtf that guy slapped her and was also a cheater.
Johanna ter Steege is also great as Rex's ill-fated girlfriend, Saskia.
Not only was it filmed in Portland, OR where I live, but I was also an extra in it.
It's also clichÃ© in that everyone falls in love at first sight, somehow confusing lust for love.
As a footnote, the director, George Sluizer, was paid a pile of money to direct a pile of crap, an American version of this story, the English title was also "The Vanishing" but this turd was made five years later (1993).
It is also good to see such films that would otherwise be overlooked get made with limited funding.
George Sluizer also directed an American remake in 1993, to much less effect.
The movie also has a somewhat schizophrenic vibe to it, possibly due to having had three different directors attached to it, or just being plain bad.
Although the action flows nicely, there's also nothing memorable here for action fanatics.
The supporting cast was also horrible except for the guy who played the teacher and a one or two others.
That being said, a good amount of the blame should also be laid at the feet of John Goodman himself, who seemed to base his response to interviewers who asked about the show on its original title: "Don't Ask."
Also, and I know this will sound cruel, but it was also amazing that there were so many unattractive women in the film that were naked.
It bears mentioning that the film's director also made "Blacula", a film that is eons better than this one.
"Dr. Black and Mr. Hyde" also has a bigger problem: it has no thrills or chills.
There's also a fairly effective chase scene where Hyde goes after Linda in an abandoned warehouse.
While I love classic Hollywood films, independent films and foreign cinema, I also have a soft place in my heart for the truly horrible films.
FYI--It's amazing that Brando did this movie, having also done the VERY sensitive movie Sayonara--a movie that really does a lot to humanize the Japanese.
The worst, though, was probably the bright red hairdos of Susan Hayward and Agnes Morehead also from THE CONQUERER--even though they were clearly playing Mongolians!!
The film also features Japan's popular and talented Machiko Kyo as the geisha Lotus Blossom who has been sent away from numerous other occupation villages due to the never specified "trouble" that she had reportedly caused.
Primarily, not only was casting Marlong Brando in the role of the Sakini a horrible decision, it was also offensive and insulting.
Fortunately, the twenty-first century has brought the world and increasing number of films that not only have a conscious, but were also popular among critics and at the box office, such as Blood Diamond and An Inconvenient Truth.
for me,this is probably the worst Scooby Doo animated movie i have seen.i found it boring and not that funny compared to other Scooby adventures.the i didn't think the story was very good either.there seemed to be a lot more repetition than in other Scooby movies.there are also a few elements missing from this particular movie(that i most Scooby Do movies) and one element that was nothing other than annoying and i really could have done without.those elements are that only Shag and Scoob are in this movie.the rest of Mystery,INC are absent.the element i could have done without is the inclusion of Scrappy Doo,which to me is a pointless character.i had to struggle not turn this movie off before the end.this is the exception with Scooby Doo movies,so far in my experience.for me "Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers" is a 4/10
You could also say it's a film starring actors who couldn't act directed by a director without direction.
He's also too old for the part, can't act worth a damn, and always speaks in his famous patented monotone drawl that he uses for every movie he's ever been in.
(Strangely, Jeff and Cynthia are married, yet they are also forced to sleep apart.)
Watching Rex become consumed in every way by his quest to find Saskia was also extremely difficult to watch, although it was certainly inevitable.
The set design is also excellent.
It also seems to come very suddenly, without any building whatsoever.
There's also mainly vapid characterization, plenty of padding including sex scenes, particular focus on sister journalists who have a web log, and a comedic barroom brawl included for no other reason but to pad the movie.
Over the top acting, bad special affects and a bizarre plot that just not translate to the screen make this watchable only if you also enjoy seeing car wrecks.
Curtis was doing pretty much everything to pay the bills about this time period, so although he's not exactly phoning it in as Harry, he's also got this look like he's going over lines for his next gig in his head, even while he's doing this one.
I also recall it being some sort of Indian legend and there may have been an Indian in the movie to help out, but do not quote me on that one.
I guess the sunset years of an actor need to be financed too, as is evident by a cast that also contains Susan Strasberg, Ann Southern, and Burgess Meredith.
I also saw "Ordinary People" about the same time.
It's not all that bad, and William Hunt has his moments as Wang, though strangely for a nudist send-up of 30s serials it's also quite tedious.
For years, I've read of this soft-porn parody of Flash Gordon since it was advertised as one of several midnight movies listed as being at the (now defunct) Cinema 8 at the (also folded) Bon Marche Mall.
Lisa Kudrow also makes a good contribution with her pathetic Paula.
oh god..please save the people who has seen this "comical acting, fatuous direction, futile story, insane dialogues,etc" which gave a non-stop unbelievable maligning experience till the end..people watching this will go into an irrecoverable coma..it was an harrowing experience..  the director-what is he trying to make, it looks as though he was completely out of his mind..the viewers will not condone this piece of work..unfortunately this movie has the same director, story-writer, and also the leading actor..at least this time the blame goes to single person..simbhu takes the sole responsibility for making life difficult for viewers..he has given importance in exposing extreme vulgarity..  music-this is the only good thing about this movie..it has some good numbers and good background score..but it doesn't make this rubbish watchable..  nayanthara and reemasen - i pity them both..i feel that they would have done much better for any other movie..they were doing skin show in this entire movie..reemasen's acting was terrible..nayanthara has and always done glamorous roles..she does it so as to hide her acting inabilities..  bottom line-what more to say..if you want to be peaceful please avoid this like dog sh**..if you want to terrorize yourself you are most welcome to watch this A-hole at the highest level..  actually i would like to give it zero on 10..  but the rating is 1/10
Okay you wanna get laid, get the gal-reel served on a silver plate and also get paid for it if possible.
The performances are also quite poor, the only true reason not to skip this episode is the great Michael Ironside, who at least gives this thing a little bit of eeriness.
And the ending also too standard and fast, just like all the HK films, the film makers seems to spend all the money and have to wrap up with anything on hand.
Artie Lange said at the roast that Lisa Lampinelli was seven bad movies away from being Janeane Garofalo (he also called Ms. Garofalo a f***ing c***, which shows you his maturity level).
Hey - there's also the loose woman with a heart of gold and the villainous villain who struts and grabs his crotch a lot.
Mark Burnett's other show, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.
It also seems like Donald Trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest, I can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him.
It however also means that the movie starts to become more and more predictable, since everything is done very formulaic.
There also isn't that much chemistry between Mark Ruffalo and Gwyneth Paltrow.
It's also one of those comedies that isn't really a comedy at all, meaning that it has no laughs in it or great comical situations.
The dialog also restrain the actors and situations from being funny.
Basically in my opinion she's far too good and therefor also too serious and makes it hard to buy her in a comedy.
Basically the same goes for Kelly Preston, who also gets featured far too little in the movie.
Besides Mike Myers, also Rob Lowe makes a small appearance.
Myers raises a few smiles as a lazy-eyed air crew trainer,but it is still baffling how this eclectic cast felt there was any mileage from a minor potboiler such as this,especially Oscar winner Paltrow (who has since described the film as 'terrible' in a subsequent UK newspaper interview).Gwynnie is a fine actress,and has ability in light comedy (as proved by her AA triumph in 'Shakespeare IN LOVE'),but she can do little with the feeble,uninspiring part she has taken on here (though she does look lovely in the numerous,if rather tacky outfits she wears),as is the case with other cast members such as Ruffalo and Applegate.There are also some rather pointless cameos from Rob Lowe and George Kennedy (recalling his Joe Patrone character from the AIRPORT series,which are actually rather funnier than this film),and the short running time (around 80 minutes) also indicates that much re-cutting and deletion took place beforehand (it sadly didn't improve the quality).
This movie also copied ideas from other movies and in one scene a girl has spiders coming out of her face.
It's also laughably obvious who the killer is.
The film also just looks cheap and slowly paced.
It's also derivative taking from other far more creepy ghost revenge stories.
I would also suffer a severe head pain actually trying to go through the movie again - it sounds terrifying just thinking about it - but for all the wrong reasons.
I didn't hate the movie like I thought I would but I also didn't enjoy it as much as I should have.
There's also a few unlikely occurrences throughout the movie usually involving Bunny .
There was also a lot of needless tit sightings in this movie.
The zombie gore effects where also terrible with the camera lingering to show wriggling gummy worms and pieces of raw meat moving up and down with the rhythm of the zombies heart beat, and zombies chewing down a sausage link (intestines) and not even taking a real bite out of it????
And here's what's also stupid.
Its supporting roles are also weird and unconvincing.
You also do not have really much of anything as far as development goes as this film is for the most part very forgettable.
That's pretty much the side story though as the main story follows a news reporter and his son visiting the town with the father trying to get the story of the original film - he also gets an extremely unpleasant to watch love scene with the woman he's renting from.
The son also falls for a hot girl from the town but alas she stays fully clothed.
There's also another thing I do not get about this film, a lot of those teens in this movie would have been like 7 or 8 in the first movie, so how do they remember all of this?
I loathed Children of the Corn, not only was it totally different from Stephen King's darker and unsettling short story, but it was also boring and not in the least scary.
The man who dastardly invented these mutant bugs seems to also have picked up the use of super warp speed traveling while working in the lab late at night.
It's pretty much the same mixture as before, but we also get boring troubles between father and son, perfunctory romances, and corn-this and corn-that.
It's repetitious beyond belief, seems about twice as long as it really is, and as the plot of this film revolves around Knox piecing together the events of the original movie, it's also completely redundant.
Now, the scene with the wheelchair is not only one of the most freaking hilarious things I've ever seen, but it is also flawed like there is no tomorrow.
There's also some great acting by the church vicar who manages to patronise even the cult who worship the thing named He Who Walks Behind The Rows.
Yes I knew the budget was tight and that there would not be so much money at hand, but seeing they could hire a martial Arts expert, for the fight scenes, makes you wonder why they didn't also spend money on a funnier script (w/o every clichÃ© in the book)!
It's also a true bridge between the first film, which was sexless TV-movie camp, and the third one, which was mindlessly dull soft-core.
The locusts are also BORING...although I have to give slight kudos to the fact that it doesn't look like a big swarm of computer animated bugs flying around.
There's also the scene at the end that's been 'edited out' of recent releases of this film where the butler, Michael Hordern, ends up getting into bed with the divorced husband of the heroine of the film, Maggie Smith.
Goren in L&O:CI was interrupted by an episode of The Contender, which also merits discussion somewhere, I was forced to watch this nonsense.
Angela phones her friend Amanda (Conchita Puglisi) to pick her up at the train station but Angela is brutally murdered before the train arrives, outside the station Amanda is also murdered.
The best thing about this movie is the title, which I'd guess is the main reason why it got distribution; it's also the only reason why I watched it, and fortunately the DVD was in our library for some reason so I didn't have to pay.
They also fluff their lines on a number of occasions, and it's still included in the movie.
The direction is also terrible, has this guy never heard of 'Take 2' the actors and even he himself fluff their lines on camera and did they never think of re doing that take?
Some shots linger on for too long and are completely unnecessary, for instance a 1 or 2 minutes long shot of old whore Jasmine st Claire in the shower, it brings nothing to the film and doesn't join on to another scene, my guess is the male crew told Len it would make a good addition to the film and also that they should all watch.
I'm also a fan of B-horror like Braindead or Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
There's also another fight scene set atop a car park where it starts out during the day & after a few punches have been thrown it's pitch black.
Well, can't really blame these producers when the rest of the bollywood producers are also doing the same except a few who I will list later.
It also deals with husband and wife issues (1985) also get Dilse if you have not yet.
Same cannot be said about its sequel DELTA FORCE 2 in 1990 (also known as the COLUMBIAN CONNECTION).
I also noticed that all Norris does is fight South American drug lords.
It is also a very unmemorable movie as there are very few scenes in this one that I can recall.
This film was also a testament to how badly Lucy Lawless needs work.
And, except for the unfortunate Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, it was also his last.
It also has laughable lines.
I also agree John Heard should be above this, but who knows his reasons?
I also really enjoyed the short but sweet appearances by my beloved Katharine Isabelle as Ginger.
It also stars many noticeable by face but not by name actors/actresses, such as Lorie Griffin, whose character would make it seem that she actually accomplished boning her brains out in "Teen Wolf", and now can't tell sarcasm or an insult if you slap her in the face with it.
I don't have anything bad to say about Lucinda Dickey, except the idea that the MASCOT also goes to cheerleader camp was just too inspired for words.
Simon's creator was also a neighbor who admits to him the glitches in the program have cause him to become sick and the best thing is to end it all.
There is a new cop working with him who behaves oddly, and the case also involves a link to Taylor's (Sossamon) missing father.
The film also seemed very boring during the 'talky' bits so I thought I'd fast-forward through a lot of them.
A tolerance for early 70's films will also help.
I was also impressed with the careful military handling of VX.. providing everyone with full face respirators who handled it.
I also choked on my drink when a certain person died from being bitten a couple times.. sheesh, I survived bike accidents with more wounds than he had!
As somebody else also stated.
By the time I watched half of it, I thought it was an avant-garde movie because it also seemed so naive, but the directors were clearly striving for a typical, joyful Christmas film.
They were very concerned about what went in, bullets also charmingly called "buckwheats" and what went out.
I heard that the new score is all piano and that the composer also did the score for The Mechanical Man.
They are inexpensive, but they're also no bargain thanks to fuzzy or scratchy prints.
Raffles, the sheep dog also gives some horrid deliveries.
However, he had also given himself a rather large black mark in the form of an attempt to be "cool" with a horror-comedy where violence has no visible consequences, and everyone speaks like a reject from a teen soap opera.
It is also very much Nightmare on Elm Street.
It also seems that all the new students that lives in the "asylum" has had some issues in their earlier lives, and now the doctor has come back to "cure" them.
There are also some other characters that should be mentioned.
I also liked Ragnar played by Nicolay Lange Nielsen but thats about it.
all the locals in the bar are vampires.Dusk till dawn 2:Texas blood money though was a whole different kettle of fish.It is a poorly thought out ploy to cash in on a successful movie.Don't get me wrong i'm a huge fan of bad films and commend them if they are in any way inventive or resourcefull,this wasn't.Texas blood money also made use of annoying camera shots it persevered with every point of view shot possible.We had the shot from the pov of a man doing press-ups,we had the shot through the red eyes of a bat and to top it off the pov from a fan moving left to right.Overall it is a highly frustrating film that should never have been made,their certainly shouldn't have been a third installment.Never see this if you haven't,and if you have i feel for you and hope the counciling is going well.
It's also a lot weirder ... so if, like me, you're a big fan of weird, odds are you'll probably lap this up like a bloodthirsty wolf.
They also kept cutting to an edit of the boys watching a porno movie, so it was like they were trying to have some sex in there the cheap way I guess.
After that, I learned that Bruce Campbell will be in the cast, that also made me happy 'cause I love Bruce.
I'm sure everyone involved had "fun" making this dreck, but I'm equally sure that they all knew they were just taking a paycheck, and I'm also pretty sure none of them are bragging about their participation.
This sequel also tries to do the same thing.
Then, those who are familiar with the series should also bear in mind that, although the series ended with a cliffhanger, this one was very badly done, ridiculously showing images of people performing so-called 'miracles' and that stupid thing of Seattle being renamed 'Promise City', and completely evading one fact clearly emerging from that pile of garbage: even if at the end of the series, they found a way to make a test to determine who could or could not take promicine without danger,the fact remains that this 'new world' would be divided between two classes of people: those with abilities and those without, in short, practically two species of humans.
And also, music, title sequence and effects are very well done.
I'm also not sure how they got Richard Dreyfuss or Bill Murray to star in the film.
It is beyond me why Marvin's family did not also feel this way.
I imagine the Brits who know a thing or two also detested the poor props.
Poor accents with low budget special effects and scenery also disappoint - I had to watch the film twice just to make sure I hadn't got it wrong!
It also deserved it for being an insult to the intelligence of WWII genre fans.
Frank Howard as M&M,okay he has the look,but also doesn't even try.
There`s also other serious flaws to the script like the terrible lines that belong in a CARRY ON movie , lines like " When you said uncover the agent ... " and watch out for the obvious revealing mistakes like harnesses attached to the actors as they float in the air and the laughably bad back projection  One final thing I couldn`t help noticing is that several of the cast seemed to have consumed a large amount of alcohol before filming .
The problem, though, is that while the Powers films were sleazy, they also were funny in an undemanding and crude way.
Bright spot: Janice Rule, who is the smartest Matt Helm assistant so far, and also closer to Dean Martin's age than Ann Margret or Stella Stevens, which makes their (professional and romantic) partnership more believable.
Dino walked through this one as did the rest of the cast which looks bored, but also eager because the Matt Helm films did make money back in the day.
I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).
I Don't get it.... also the use of old footage for the puppets is just bad.
Jane Magrew is also innocent and for some reason loves the "Pinhead" doll.
There are very few people to like here, which also hurts.
Of course there's also the "editing by random numbers" nonsense.
But then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.
It's decently made and written, and it also leaves open the possibility of another sequel which I would love to see, however like the 1st the Werewolf effects Wern't that great.
Tatiana Maslany is brilliant as Ghost, she played the creepy psycho very well yet she still managed to be quite likable, she was also energetic had some good lines, had a wicked character, and was totally unpredictable, I predict big things for this young actress!.
I also enjoyed the '70s decor and architecture -- one of my favorite parts of '70s TV shows and movies.
I see that people have already picked up that "Married" was left out... but the thing is that it isn't just "Married" (at one point, we can also hear a record of "It Couldn't Please Me More" and "Sitting Pretty"), but the entire plot line between Fraulein Schneider and Herr Shulz was left out.
What is also telling is that in the DVD, there WERE no deleted or extended scenes, nor were there directors comments.
Celia also saw Maren after the murders and talked to her.
He was also found with property that belonged to the Norwegians that he stole the night of the murders.
There were also witnesses who saw him coming back from the island.
There's also a little fun to be had from seeing just where teensy Nelson will pop out next: during the film, he launches attacks from a wardrobe, a fridge, a box, a luggage bag, and a toilet.
Ah, but this is not all as Dennis Quaid is also having problems with his children after a recent family tragedy What a shockingly original twist in a shockingly original plot!
And convince others who are sad to murder also, because people were mean to them.
Dennis Quade was horrible in The day after tomorrow, and he stinks this one up also.
How about this:   Quaid to Zhang Ziyi: "Well, I should also tell you that...I'm not very good with children."
British man Brian Roberts (Michael York) comes to Berlin to teach English in the 1930's, at the time the Nazi party is rising.There he meets an interesting singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli).The bi-sexual teacher becomes very fond of her.In between there's the handsome and rich Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem).In Berlin he also meets people as Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and (Natalia Landauer).They're both Jewish and attracted to each other.Joel Grey is the eccentric Master of Ceremonies.The cast is absolutely fantastic in this Bob Fosse's musical drama.I read about two years ago Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, which this movie is based on.This week I saw the movie and they're both great.In the movie you can hear the songs being sang and they're all marvelous.I truly recommend this movie to a whole bunch of people.
The script was also a tragedy and the general story wasn't much better, though it does make one re-evaluate one's standards and perhaps learn something.
Don't let the allure of the cast (in addition to McKellan, Eckhardt, and Murphy, it also features William Hurt, Nick Nolte, Alan Cumming, Jessica Lang, and more) draw you in -- stay away from Neverwas!
This globally acclaimed and masterful film was definitely one of the most risky and dared projects in cinema history and thus it also easily could have been one of the biggest failures ever.
This film also stars Nick Nolte who is Zachery's father and the author of Neverwas.
And my co-worker at Blockbuster also thought it sucked.
Haunted by the mythic story of Zack Small, the boy hero of his father's best seller children's book, also titled "Neverwas," Zack attempts to bring peace to the troubled minds of the mental patients and understand the clues which Gabriel delights in leaving for him.
The stories are told in such a dull matter, that it doesn't really matter that a couple of the actors also preformed fairly poor.
While the Godfather un-deservedly got Best Picture for 1973, it got a total of only 3 Oscars, while Cabaret got 8 (including Best Director)--making it the movie to have gotten the most Oscars without also getting Best Picture.
I also thought the 'Waltzheimers' disease joke was in very poor taste.
Morticia is also butchered by the likes of Daryl Hannah ("Elle Driver", Kill Bill.
He also talks WAY too much.
I also thought she was too young for Morticia.
Then the sequel came out 2 years later in 93, also being a hit.
The new child actors are also bad; Nicole Fugere as Wednesday lacks the eeriness and creepiness of Christina Ricci.
The effects are also excruciatingly bad; you would have thought that they'd have developed better techniques through the five-six years that passed between making the previous film in the series and this.
(For those who don't know: SSDD was used in a Steven King book: Dreamcatcher, while not the best book its bad to rip off someone elses phrasing even if you do change one word in it)  It seemed to me that the story was copying 'It' also by Steven King.
It must also be appreciated when a child actor manages to seem evil or cruel, and it must therefore be mentioned that Samuel Patrick Chu does a very good job being a truly sadistic little bastard in a flashback sequence.
Her acting is also not bad for this genre, I could actually imagine her playing a femme fatale type in a forties or fifties set thriller with ease.
May Karasun is also quite attractive but looks bored at times and the actor playing the husband is not great either.
In an Oscar-winning performance, Liza Minnelli literally radiates with an exuberance that she was never able to recapture elsewhere, and also takes time to belt out bravura renditions of exceptional numbers like "Mein Herr," "Maybe This Time," and, of course, the sublime title song.
The film is entertaining and enjoyable, but also contains a haunting aura that lingers long after the picture has ended.
The new cast is also wonderful, easily making up for Ginger having a very small role.
The politics of Meiji Period Japan are also horribly condensed into some oily Japanese businessmen out to make a buck by coddling to the West.
Did anyone ever consider that samurai also lived lives?
There is also another story involving a rich Englishman, Sebastian, who loves music.
It's also exceedingly dull.
Not only does Chris do nothing about her illness, he also turns a blind eye while she does drugs and drinks.
In doing so, they also bring the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray back to life.
One of my friends also said that I have to see "Bride" and "Seed" for the Chucky series, but I didn't want to see those without understanding maybe a few things I missed in the third or second Child's Play.
I just thought that it was very funny instead of gruesome and also very unbelievable.
We also get to follow the story of Fritz and Natalia, the gold-digger looking for a rich marriage and the daughter of a rich Jewish merchantman, and their difficult relationship.
Any film with such ingredients and cast could be great, but Cabaret is however also a musical.
The film is very entertaining, but also realistic, analytical and critical.
This was also Robert Englund's attempt at making a movie.
Her role also calls for a great actress as well, so small wonder she won an Oscar in 1972 as Best Actress.
And Joe Dante regular Robert Picardo also appears as Mark Dark, the manager of a sleazy phone-sex operation.
Yes, he did also work hard, but he really had no lines at all in the film--everything he did was singing and dancing and clowning around on stage.
I was also put off by the attempt at making said local badboy's (J. Trevor Edmund- Return of the Living Dead 3) persona distinctly familiar to the jerk character in the first film.
Linea Quigley also shows up for a cameo sex scene, of course.
Of course, our old friend revenge is also along for the ride, however the parts where one gets revenge by unburying Pumpkinhead and such is gone.
It also features lots of obvious stuff as there are no startling revelations to be had here, just all the stuff one expects from this type of movie.
The first movie already wasn't too great but this movie also adds very little and can hardly be called an improvement.
Of course it also isn't being helped much by its story that provides very little originality.
The story fills the movie with some uninteresting characters and the movie is perhaps also missing a true, good main character.
Pure talking horror, I also have a positive note concerning this film.
It doesn't help that the screenplay also appears stitched together from a host of war movie clichÃ©s, few of which stick around long enough to establish themselvesÂthe wives, the ethnic grunts, the lonely orphan.
This criticism is not for real, it's obviously only a way of trying to be on Western level also than it comes to society satire.
This was this persons first film and I really don't know how he got cast, until I read the credits and I noticed he was the writer and executive producer also.
Any execution scene in the chair is pretty funny too, in one the guys in the background crack up, also I don't think the writer (the Grover-inator)did much research on the electric chair.
The movie also puts on the table an interesting dilemma: are God and the Devil the same "being"?
The story concerns some sort of brain machine that shows thoughts on a computer, that is used to study this superman, sort of the devil incarnate, who can exert mind control and is also psychic.
I also found myself seeing a bit of Brutal Howell but again, not enough to matter.
Hoppers performance was a bit silly also, but I will chalk that up to poor writing.
It is also a good learning tool for young filmmakers of what not to do...
Mowatt, played by Pavan Grover who also had a hand in writing the script, is brought to a horrible prison run by a crazy, psychotic, and also sadistic, warden, played beautifully by Dennis Hopper - who has done so many of these kinds of roles he can probably do them in his sleep by now.
The director needs to take some of the blame for his failure to reign in the actors and the script (although when your lead actor is also the writer and the producer ...).
Oh yeah, for all those who have also seen part 3, I think there's a huge mistake made in 2 and 3.
I could also argue that this movie spoils itself and nothing anyone could say will change that.
One must also applaud Bob Fosse for his direction, for without him, these dark scene filmed with Grey would have just been as bland as the story.
To bookend the positive, one must also ask "Where did 'Cabaret' fail?"
This sequel is very claustrophobic and also very violent, but it deserved a better conclusion.
It is impossible to follow the events in this film, not just due to the abysmal plot, but also because if you look at the screen for too long, you find your retina burning inside your skull.
It may be one of the worst films ever made, and it may be the worst sequel, but it is also a very fun and frequently (unintentionally) funny film.
The film has also been completely re-edited.
Fred Willard also shows up, and while I love Mr. Willard's work, he can't rescue the scene he's in, which is pretty lame.
There is also another, more humanistic: live and let live.
There are also beautiful Marisa Berenson as noble Natalia, Fritz Wepper very believable as tormented Fritz, repulsively attractive Helmut Griem as the rich scoundrel Maximilian and picturesque supporting cast.
But the film has more than that : it also shows how Germany was slowly but inevitably turning to fascism.
In Spain there are also similar films as the films of Paco MartÃ­nez Soria for example.
He also shifted the focus of the way the story is told...the play tells the story from the leading man's point of view, but Fosse switches the focus to the character of Sally Bowles, the brassy, sassy party girl who believes in "divine decadence' and wears bright green fingernail polish.
Fosse also takes two secondary characters from the play, who are older, and makes them young and attractive in order to make their story more youth-friendly, I imagine.
Episode 3, wisely re-named the Horror Show, was an exception because it starred the great actor Brion James (may he rest in peace) He made this film enjoyable and also the story had more horror in it.
"Life is a Cabaret old chum..."  Michael Yorke and Joel Grey are also very good.I have a thing for Alan Cumming from the Broadway version as the MC,he seemed so sleazy it was amazing,but I have to admit that Joel Grey was excellent in the movie.He was all together funny and creepy and I don't wonder why he got the Oscar from this role.
So Cabaret is basically not "just" a musical.It has some darker themes about society,as well as showing us what the night life,and life in general,in poor Germany after the first World War just before Hitler came to power was like.And yes it also has wonderful musical scenes,good acting and is definitely worth the time to check out if these things interest you!!
Jesse's friend Charlie (Jonathan Stark) & his girlfriend Jana (Amy Yasbeck) also move in as well.
There's no blood or gore & the only horror element is the rotten zombie Slim who looks quite good but isn't in the film that much, I also liked Slim's zombie horse as well.
Plot has to do with another house, this one with Aztec-influenced architecture, also with other-dimensional passages now and then.
The pic then dwells on this old dude in unfunny scenes, but Gross and his buddy (Stark) also show why they never had great careers in the movies.
It also all seems to be an excuse to have a few scenes in a prehistoric jungle, with brief dinosaur FX.
A mood-setter is also the fact that there is no dialog in this part of the movie either, almost like an old journal film.
There's Ong Bak, Tom Yum Goong and also Donnie Yen's and Jet Li's latest efforts.
All living organisms consume in order to survive, not only human being, also animals and plants.
It was an entertaining surreal drama, a work of art, a masterpiece and also a movie which everyone interprets differently, to me no message, but according to those people, no, it makes fun of middle class, it makes fun of their lives, their personalities.
It also happened to me at a no-refunds Willie Nelson show where he was clearly drunk and/or stoned.
The Nazis are stupid, even more stupid than usual in these films, but they've also got a lot of intrigues going among each other, between Cedric Hardwicke and J. Edward Bromberg to see who will be top dog under Himmler in the S.S. And Peter Lorre does not think terribly much of German efficiency and with these two around who could blame him.
Many Turks also suspected the US was taking revenge for the Turkish parliament's refusal to allow the US to move troops through Turkey into Iraq during the 2003 Iraq war.
Double Dragon was also released on practically every home platform (don't get me started on the awful C64 version) but none of them, not even the recent Gameboy Advance version, really ever matched up to the awesomeness of the arcade machine.
In addition to this came the economical damage caused by 1991 gulf war and America's prospects of establishing a kurdish state in the oil rich areas of Iraq where also many turcomen are deported from their villages.
We know that Queer Duck parties and likely uses drugs, but we also get the impression he is in a committed relationship with Openly Gator.
I have considered that if someone has a different sexual orientation, maybe they also have a different comic orientation but I don't think this is a case of humor being different, as if written in a language other than my "straight" tongue.
The topper is that is also contains the best ending as you continue to guess who the culprit is.
I hated this one in a way, but i also kinda liked it.
The topper is that is also contains the best ending as you continue to guess who the culpret is.
I also was unable to hear what the zany deputy was saying throughout his five hour long idiotic rambling.
It also shows the fakest kill ever, as No Name kills her girlfriend by playfully tapping her in side of the head with a poker.
And then there is also a mysterious man who was seen near her hotel on several occasions.
Both also pace their story with still, calm images of scenery, Ruoholahti or Scotland.
But her mother also wants her and has some people hunting for her too.
I also really enjoy watching Vin Diesel.
He also fits well with the sci-fi genre because he plays mysterious characters so well.
This film is a great comedy, and full of not only entertaining humor, but also insight into the true nature of human... we're all horny beasts.
So we kill Michelle and kill Vin and we discover Aurora not only knows martial arts but also has telekinetic powers.
I know a lot of people have a thing against Vin Diesel, but I don't think the guy is so bad, he makes a great action hero and also makes a lot of movies very entertaining.
There is one scene, for example, where the trio outrun not only a couple of what look like futuristic Stealth bombers, but also their missiles, and they do it on snowmobiles!
That was not only great, that was also very fitting to the movie.
At first all she want's to eat are flies which is fine, but she begins to grow (it's flower pot must also have the ability to grow as well) & quickly moves onto frogs, then it's dogs from the local pound.
Produced & directed by Carl Monson who also has an uncredited cameo in the film as Officer O'Columbus who is eaten by the plant, I couldn't quite believe what I was watching as the hour & forty odd minutes that it took to watch it ebbed away.
Soon after, somewhere else in town a woman named Annie (Mary Ellen Burke) is also attacked by her cat which bites her throat out.
Edited, co-written, produced and directed by Ted V. Mikels, who also has a music/sound editor credit, on an estimated budget of $47,000 according to the IMDb, I have to ask myself why so much?!
I also remember, even as a young child, thinking the plot was really stupid.
The level of acting was also average, even for a TV show.
We are also treated to elements familiar to readers of King: tedious interior monologues; annoying singing by various characters; inhuman, snarling bad guys; a wise-cracking, delightlessly sassy god-character (here, a giant anteater); and writing which leaves nothing to be spelled out by the audience.
The additional budget also really hurt the whole production.
They also have libidinous capacities, so we are led to believe.
I suspect Sinbad also told a lot of tales about the women as well as the voyages in his life.
They also manage if you can believe to bring Aladdin's magic lamp and the Amazonian descendants of Ali Baba's Forty Thieves.
It also has some characters walking around in the movie that feel absolutely pointless and serve no purpose at all.
Dad also seems to make poor survival decisions.
I also thought it was shot pretty well, it was nice and clear.
Its also rather sad to read comments from persons obviously involved in making the film trumpeting this film as a "10" in press release language.
Making Denmark an American corporation rather than a political state was also unsuccessful, for the continued use of the terms "king," "queen" and "prince" did not fit the new setting.
That scene is also hastily and sloppily filmed.
His jovial, consoling advice to Ophelia to "get thee to a nunnery" is laughable, and while he hits the right note in the also well-conceived, but displaced finish to the scene, leaving the rest of the speech on her answering machine, we're still so busy laughing that the rage loses it's power.
Hamlet's father, the King/CEO of the Denmark Corp. has died, and within a month his mother, Gertrude (Diane Venora), has married his uncle, Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), who has also taken over the company.
Tony Longo as the sailor in the bar was also outstanding.
It also had a great beat, and was easy to dance to.
There is also a great showing of support for each other that really helps make the difference.
There were also some technical errors that should have been picked up during the editing, the most obvious being the microphone boom reflected in the car's windscreen at one point.
The pursuing car is also a Jaguar XK120, usually dark color with a full folded down light colored top, but at the road block it is light with a dark top, and in some shots it becomes an open roadster with a different style windshield.
There are also numerous mentions of Palestine being the "ancestral home" to Jews, but little mention of the significant Arab majority for centuries.
There are also the typical poor and misleading Arabic- English translations, such as "jihad" being translated to "holy war" rather than "struggle", and a dehumanization of Palestinians who believe in their right to the whole of the country.
I feel also there is a lack of flow in this picture that easily could have been avoided by lengthening/cutting i the right places.
These were made for Mack Sennett (also known as "Keystone Studios") and were literally churned out in very rapid succession.
#2: Chaplin was also new and inexperienced.
I also didnt like how the Director didn't remind us who the people are.
It's also mildly intriguing to watch them and know that richness does not protect you from acne, bizarre speech impediments, herpes or yellow tooth syndrome but it does seem to give one the impression that one is immensely attractive and shaggable despite these disgusting attributes.
Running gag of the movie is "the kick in the balls" which they also use in a hilarious scene to take out some amateurish muggers.
Smacking of other successful, but just as stupid, unfunny, uninteresting and ultimately pointless garbage, as "The Osbournes", this show was also set-up as an all-access and occasionally would-be tongue-in-cheek insight into the day-to-day life of one Victoria Gotti, the younger of late notorious Mafia Don John Gotti's two daughters, who is apparently a plastic-surgery obsessed socialite/gossip columnist/author/newly divorced single-mother of three loud, spoiled, lazy, and profane teenage sons.
Not only is "Fingerprints" a supernatural tale, but it's also a slasher movie.
Whilst the spooky happenings are going on, there is also a masked killer on the loose.
When this much liberty is taken with the scenery, one might also wonder how it fared with the plot.
The woman who played Velma was also well-cast, though she didn't quite command the same presence Lillard has.
Rowan Atkins also gives a good, but small, performance as the owner of the amusement park.
It also seems odd with their appearance in the film that Sugar Ray didn't write an original song, instead recycling a song off of a 9 month old album (though the song was probably new when they began filming, but still...).
It also doesn't know whether it should be campy or cartoonish.
Oh yeah and the old run down school was also about to be closed till it was saved.
It also lacks the real saving grace of 'Meet Me In St. Louis', which was an extraordinarily potent central performance from Judy Garland - the scene in which she sings 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas', the one truly worthy song in the film (Don't talk to me about the Trolly Song...), justifies the entire film.
If reviewers are using anything even remotely resembling my criteria for film criticism, I have a difficult time understanding anyone thinking that a film like Sixteen Tongues is great while they also think that films like Boogeyman or Gothika are horrible.
They also have to pay to shut off the television, which otherwise continually plays porno commercials similar to those for 900 numbers that run at the beginning of porno VHS tapes.
We also have Martin Landau, (Garson Jones)who is a scientist studying nuclear experiments which he is very upset about.
She also gives us a run-down at what the surviving characters did with their lives after the incident at Pottsville is over.
It also puts an arm through a deputy holding his heart.
After reading it's description, I thought this movie would be pretty good, and also full of gore, so I bought the factory sealed tape.
The Constitution of the Confederate States also outlawed slavery.
Don't even get me started on him attributing the slash and burn policy of Sherman to Genereal Lee...and also his gross misrepresentation of George Washington.
He also fails to note that the Confederate Constitution itself outlawed the slave trade in the confederacy.
The "history" is also poorly thought-out.
Strangely enough, modern Confederates in this film also share the views of modern extreme right-wing Republicans in our timeline.
This seems like an ignorant excuse to insult Southerners--not just White (both Christian and Jewish) but also Black, Hispanic and Asian.
It's also very questionable that history would look anything like they're portraying it if the South had in fact won.
In the course of the movie we are also told that the Jewish population of America was decimated because of Confederate Aryan attitudes.
Nowadays these stupid ideas are mostly gone which would have also happened under a Confederate government.
It was also boring and rather sickening.
The director also proves to have a nice eye for detail, outdoor scenery, light and shadow.
The art direction is also good, and though the storyline is a bit muddled it's still not too difficult to follow.
She and her minions have also blackmailed a doctor into trying to come up with a cure for vampirism.
This second and much longer portion also seems more rushed and less stylish than the first.
It's also full of continuity errors and hacky editing splices that make it even more confusing.
And be it inadvertent or not on the part of the producers is questionable as it also became an extremely off-center portrait of the very strained relationships she shares with her grown son, lawyer, homosexual personal assistant, varying private makeup artists and all sorts of other creepy annoying people that seem to float in and out of her life faster than you can say: "Trim-Spa Baby"!
A show about the life of a perpetually drunken woman who is usually also on drugs and is barely smarter than fungus as a result of the years of brain damage.
Fans of THE HOWLING series, if any exist after the torrent of awful sequels, will also be disappointed to find that this film is taken totally serious, all the warped comedy of the previous films is completely exorcised in favour of a stone faced tale of werewolf killings.
Audiences might recall that he also portrays another giant of contemporary history, Nikita Krushchev in Jean-Jacques Annaud's, "Enemy at the Gates."
His performance is also excellent.
It's also a landmark movie in it's use of time compression technology, as it makes each minute feel like you've just watched between 6 minutes and 4 months of nothing happening.
It also features a "twenty years older than her" Gregory Harrison as the children's father, who dumps the evil witch and marries Jenny, apparently on a whim, as there is no chemistry, no interest, and to that point, they'd spent maybe twenty minutes together.
He also makes another claim: that he created S.W.A.T.
I also noticed that there were adults in the yard with the teenagers.
In all likelihood the minors would have absolutely no access to anyone of the opposite sex or anyone over the age of 18 who was also a patient.
I had also seen an interview with one of the stars on Fuse a while back and desired to see it then.
A wonderful star-turn by Victoria Abril also carries the film.
Without blowing the revelation of the film, this also proves to be one of the most virulently AIDS- and homo-phobic stories committed to film.
The music held my attention-sort of swung along...I was glad to see Arthur swing in the end also:-)I'm probably not a Hoskins fan.He always seems to try to hard.
It's also the shortest, which is good.
In a year that also produced Reservoir Dogs, Army of Darkness, A Few Good Men and the Unforgiving, this movie should be "The Forgotten" and for good reason.
Not only does this device show an astonishing lack of creativity, but it also grates on your nerves after an hour and a half.
It not only is told slow and perhaps even boring, it also features lots of unneeded sequences with uninteresting characters involved.
Everything also isn't told in the most arousing pace, which causes this movie at times to be a drag and far from interesting one.
I also expected more from John Malkovich.
The movie also features Michael Gambon, Glenn Close, Michael Sheen and CiarÃ¡n Hinds in an early role.
I also don't like how they changed the Mr. Poole the Butler character.
A man is also killed with the end of his walking cane in the films most violent scene.
It also tells the story as more of a dark romance than a horror movie, as Mary Reilly, the title character develops a strange romantic triangle with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and has simultaneous feelings of attraction and revulsion.
I also didn't find the dialog in the film to be very inspiring.
Consequently, this can also give a general outline of the plots for several years to come from now.
p.s the actors who play ben and mickey are also terrible please cut them from the show
Seeing a survivor talk to the guards is very interesting, but they also needed someone neutral, as Vann has no patience for their explanations.
But, if this film also looked at those who did it and why, it would have been much more effective.
We also got more typical bad makeup jobs of our main characters growing elderly in a time dilation field and putting on razzie worthy, tear jerking scenes of pretentious sentimentality.
I also enjoyed "true lies" better than "La totale" though.
It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome.
This was also true of Cast Away.
She also played a great game in her second season.
Rupert, easily the most popular contestant the show has ever had, also played a great game both time, and everyone loved him.
The film is too cheesy for most adults, but it also has some unpleasant scenes that are unsuitable for kids - making you wonder what audience exactly they had in mind.
I also enjoy the way certain characters grow on you and others are repulsed as each season draws closer and closer to the end.
I also wonder why Chance still behaves like a terminally-naive puppy despite his last experiences in the wilderness which would surely have taught him a thing or two!
About half the characters are also homeless, which is nice although it's not exactly a social-realist or intimate portrayal.
Not much is happening in its first halve but also from the moment one when the cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers show up the movie doesn't really know to become exciting.
Who knows, perhaps if the movie featured some more gore and it would had been a better and also more entertaining one to watch.
The movie has a quite ridicules story that also isn't being made exactly believable by its storytelling.
Douglas Cheek's directing is lacking and the movie also makes a mistake to feature several very different characters, of which the movie looses its focus on from time to time.
The movie really lacks on good clear main hero and instead the movie focuses just a bit on each of them, with as a result that we as the viewers also just don't really ever start to care about any of the characters.
The movie also isn't helped by it's bad editing and the movie features a couple of moments that make you wonder what it was what you were just watching there.
The movie also features John Goodman in one of his earliest movie roles.
also seems inexplicable to me.
I also like 80s horror movies.
There is also a funny part where one of the characters swallows a quarter when preventing someone from making a phone call.
Then there is the "brainless man of god", who also forgets about such Scripture as, "judge not least you be judged."
I also love Doom Generation and Mysterious Skin (Splendor isn't bad but it isn't one of my favorites).
Bart and Cowboy are a queer couple who are also in a band together.
There's also talk of the big party later.
Recurring characters pop in and out - the drug dealer who supplies Bart as well as the two ultra violent S&M girls he pimps (Dark fantasizes over them), a giant scaly alien from outer space with a ray gun who wanders in to blast teenagers from time to time (this also may be the key to the apocalypse talk), and a soapy televangelist with an 800 number who actually becomes the key to the film's "point".
It also has to do with the song that is played over the end credits.
In the film, Christopher Lloyd keeps on stressing that his tales contain no moral at allÂWell, it would have been better if he also mentioned they were pointless and a complete waste of time.
"Well, it's kind of like Armageddon, except it occurs at the middle of the earth, and it's also kind of like..." Basically it borrows scenes from every disaster/action movie you'll ever see.
This movie also completely misses the point of the "science" in sci-fi.
I also managed to make it through the end.
But also on her tail is that of a male werewolf who wants to mate with her and Ginger is keeping a tab on her by haunting her mind.
Though what made the original rejuvenating was that it had warm and natural relationships between the characters, especially between Bridget and Ginger, but also with the parents.
The plot is an absorbing one, which doesn't break a whole lot of new ground like the original, but still comes up with enough hunger to set it out from most other horror flicks of the last decade, but also adding another dimension to the tale.
It also recaptures the slickly handled production of that of the original, but it looks like it had more to work with here.
The spectral sound effects also worked its way into the picture and it was hard to shut out its thumping vibration throughout.
But its not only on the comedy where Lucky Numbers fails to produce results... its also the day and age the film is set in.
But its not only on the comedy where Lucky Numbers fails to produce results... its also the day and age the film is set in.
I recently became a fan of Gasper Noe's `Irreversible' and that was an amazing, brutal and brilliant piece of filmmaking, so this also being a French film I thought it might live up to the hype.
).I also noticed that all the actors were at least in their thirties while their characters were high school kids.
He also becomes very friendly with Marks girlfriend Theresa (Kimberly Beck).
Maybe the problem was the exploitative title Massacre at Central High, it was also known as Blackboard Massacre here in the UK as well.
Did I mention, there's also a space alien?
Walsh also directed the original story, "High Sierra", with Humphrey Bogart, Joan Leslie, and Ida Lupino in the same roles.
Van Damme movies also lacked a sense of humour thereby ensuring his status at the box office was short lived .
I was also going to mention the climax with the tiger and the sports staduim that`s been mined but you`d never believe it
Oh, a certain kind of audience will love this kind of thing, but somehow, this particular movie seemed to permanently typecast Van Damme as a 2nd rater, a hack actor in the same vein as Rutger Hauer, Dolph Lundgren and, yes, Steven Seagal...All these actors also started off with a big splash in well designed vehicles that showcased their talents...and then faded into B-to-Z movie hackdom as the casting agencies and action directors moved on to other, fresher faces.
There is a particularly bad scene in "Harvey" that not only proves my point about how bad the film is, but also make's public an obvious flaw that the majority of an audience would miss the first time watching it.
Dennis Waterman in his pre-Minder days is also an unfortunate actor.
Mr. Morris feels at home here as an eccentric estate agent, but only because his character has very limited screen time and also plays no part in the unpleasantness that almost the entire remainder comprises.
The Beatles also make another appearance of sorts when Mae's agent, Dom DeLuise bursts into an exuberant rendition of Lennon/McCarney's "Honey Pie"Âand guess who he was thinking of when he was singing it?
and mobster George Hamilton (who is also seen pleading in broken Italian to his "Godfather" - cue the Nino Rota score from that film!!
It also doesn't help that our hero Timothy (Lamberts) is a really annoying hippie prone to acting like a immature child and talking about his career path as a clown (another variation from the story and source for the odd title).
Bloomfield was also obviously inspired by the previous year's STRAW DOGS and more interested in making a film like that.
The two Doberman Pinschers are also quite good and deliver all of their lines perfectly.
also the whole alternative reality thing has been used so much in Sci fi its not funny and this had no right to use it!.
one should also have a sense of humor as all kinds of teens are bashed with the witty araki trademark dialogue.
The lack of Ginger herself is also evident.
this movie is not that great.i found the story too banal(ordinary).there's not much originality here.it's a combination of many other movies.it's equal parts a Christmas Carol,It's a Wonderful Life,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,and Even The Cat in the Hat movie.the movie isn't very funny,but there is a bit of slapstick that works.this movie is,i felt,overly sentimental and preachy.in fact,i felt like i was watching a 90 minute commercial on how important family is.now,don't get me wrong.family is very important.i just find that subtlety works best with these movies.this was just way too heavy handed for me.but there is some good news.the movie has a great visual style.i mean,it looks fantastically magical.and Martin Short is terrific as Jack Frost,the baddie of the piece.he's not really scary,more mildly disconcerting than anything,and even a bit sad.i also like the look they gave him.this movie is also a bit of a tearjerker.anyway,this is a case of style over substance.and while it's not nearly as mean spirited or creepy as part 2,i still don't think it was as good.the negatives just outweigh the positives.for me,The Santa Clause 3 is a 4/10
I also hate the way the returning supporting cast is treated.
The attempt to bring a bunch of family members to the North Pole seemed to also take away from the formula that made the first two films so successful.
Tim Allen was pure genius with the 1st movie of this installment, and surprisingly enough the 2nd was also delightful.
This is just an obnoxious rehash of "Who's the Boss," in which Danza also starred as an overprotective father, but in a more intelligent way.
Billy "Froggy" Laughlin is a one-trick pony, riding on the voice (okay, he also had crossed eyes), but he never looks like he's actually enjoying himself "acting"--- he reportedly never did and died tragically in his middle teens in a motor scooter accident.
In this short, there's also another kid named "Happy".
Oh yeah, plus there's an Alien about, and Dark is also a little down about that, you know how it is.
One teacher has poor eyesight, the gym coach is clumsy, one student's father is a millionaire posing as a poor man, he also has a mistress, and a fat assistant....seriously, does anyone care about any of this?
Ah, but this is not all as Dennis Quaid is also having problems with his children after a recent family tragedy What a shockingly original twist in a shockingly original plot!
And convince others who are sad to murder also, because people were mean to them.
Dennis Quade was horrible in The day after tomorrow, and he stinks this one up also.
How about this:   Quaid to Zhang Ziyi: "Well, I should also tell you that...I'm not very good with children."
How about a GPS receiver that we're to believe also transmits its location, despite it being noted in the dialogue as simply for finding one's position?
Foolishly, Denise appears to have tried to buy her way into their lives because she's so desperate for love and for a family, but it also appears that she likes the role of favorite woman, lounging around while the others are cooking and cleaning.
I also enjoyed all the young, now-famous, actors in this film.
She's also a very powerful actress, turning in an excellent performance here.
{{--Possible Spoiler: In once instance, he sits his wives down and told them how to behave, telling Denise that he would end their relationship if she didn't obey him.--}}  Brian Wachtendorf also has a book out, in which he apparently talks about some criminal activity (I hear he's quite the idiot).
I was also bothered by the cynicism and irony.
Their friends, an older couple, also have sex.
The acting was also pretty dire, having wondered "whatever happened to Jennifer Jason Leigh" for the first few minutes of this movie, I soon realised why i hadn't missed her.
At film festivals there are times when one is forced to watch absolutely bad films.This happens as a particular time slot is booked for a bad film.If there are no other films on other slots,one is inevitably forced to experience a lousy film.This is also the case with British film called "Rag Tale".I encountered this film in 2006 at Women's International Film Festival Film de Femmes Creteil,France.
I was also disappointed with the portrayal of Janie and Tea Cake working in the "muck."
Janie was described as the tragic hero of the novel, who was also dim witted and beautiful.
There also isn't a specific plot to follow, just a game of CLUE.
The rest of the film plays a bit like "Ten Little Indians" (also made into the movie AND THE THERE WERE NONE).
He was also offensive for no reason and annoying.
I also noticed that Frankie Muniz and Jamie Kennedy had their names on the cover but they also only appear in one sketch only, and Jamie Kennedy whom I normally find funny is just disgusting in this one.
the musical scene at the end was also a bit humorous, but again severely lacking.
But what Araki also manages is to elicit an emotional response from his audience, even amid all this hyperkinetic chaos and frenetic drug-fuelled sex.
The writers also embarrassed themselves implementing poor, poor imitation scenes from Weird Science, Girl Next Door and Not Another Teen Movie, so much it ruins the original.
It was a huge review that showcased the talents of the artist and the director while also giving us a backstage pass to a play many of us probably never heard of.
The film has also been described as satirical, although it contains little satire worthy of the name; it is hardly cutting-edge humour to satirise the ways of a hundred years ago.
Talking about success of 36 China Town is also talking about repeated success of its directors duo Abbas Mustan who started off as directors in Hindi films more than 15 years ago with a flop Agneekaal (1990).
I also thought it about time that since "Selena" Lopez is finally playing a character with Latina roots.
Duval also was the key figure in the previous entries of Araki's apocalyptic trilogy, carrying the very imaginative titles `Totally F***ed Up' and `The Doom Generation'.
A lot of people preferred the first film also with James Ryan as Steve Chase in "Kill and Kill Again", but I must tell you that the box-office figures tell a very different story...in fact, depending on how old you are, you might remember a film made by Bo Derek's husband John Derek called "10" ...a 'tits and bums' vehicle to show off the many charms of his lovely wife that did very well at the box-office and was released the same year as "Kill and Kill Again'.
Not only do these teenagers lack a shred of sympathy, but they also have no common sense.
Apparently also known as Off Road in Canada this awful Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' was directed by the generally untalented low budget film auteur David DeCoteau (despite having nearly 80 directorial credits to his name you can count his good films on one hand) & is as bad as all the IMDb user comments & the low 2.5 IMDb user rating would suggest.
It might also be a spin on THE TOXIC AVENGER, as the bear apparently had been drinking water polluted by toxic waste.
Intelligence on the people, a tire iron is not going to do much against a adult bear, going off alone over and over when as a group they would stand a better chance, not trying to make weapons such as spears at nigh they sit around 2 flash lights instead of building a large a fire as they can for light to give warning of the bear but also to use as protection not to mention to maybe signal someone that at least they were in a no trespassing area to get rangers interested.
The cabin seemed to be set up as a defensible position but they don't use it or get any of the weapons from it, also who built it when and what happened to them and when, as recent chicken remains are shown but the cabin it self look long deserted.
My rating: D- So don't waste your life on this junk like I did, it is also possibly the top ten boringest film I have ever seen!
Mind you, I did miss the very start of the movie, however once I was involved, I also took notes of things throughout the movie (mainly pertaining to survival given the circumstances) and figured I may as well post them.
These people also sustain some incredible injuries, such as falling on a bear trap, which are quickly ignored when things need to move on.
This also allows a character to run a considerable distance on what appears to be a broken leg.
The cast also includes: Frank Gorshin, Mark Andrews, Roxanne Arlen and Dabbs Greer.
It would probably be a good idea to see the film first then read the book to note the comparison, and in doing so also raise the bar on the story.
And then the Turtle (don't ask, read) is also gone, losing the relation to the universe that Stephen King set up in the novel.
The recreation of a close-knit Southern community is also somewhat stereotyped and rose-tinted, with not a worried-looking rooster in sight.
The title is also apt, because 'simple' perfectly describes the A to B plotting which could comfortably fit on the back of a matchbox.
Breaking down the character name is also telling, not least the unsubtle Biblical reference of his first name.
Not only is it of it's time but also of it's place in history.
It's hard to imagine that the same man who did the wonderful Secret of Nimh also did this piece of trash.
The villain was also one of the weakest I've ever seen.
In arguably one of the few memorable lines this movie offers, he also sneers, "I positively LOATHE rock and roll."
It also suffers from the problem of a major identity crisis: on one hand it tries to be a simplistic fairy tale, on the other it attempts to be a musical parody of Elvis (Chanticleer's rock star persona and his songs are very closely modeled after the legendary singer, from the slick hairdo to the deep voice and the mannerisms).
There are also two live-action/animation sequences in the movie, but unlike WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, they come across as very patchy and unconvincing--the real-life surroundings don't mesh well with the drawings, and it looks especially bad at the song and dance finale when the kid actor playing Edmond, Toby Scott-Granger, is brought back to the cartoon world.
The underscore, as mentioned, is also beautiful, far better than this movie has any right to be.
It was also bothersome that this movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a full-blown musical or not.
I also taught my 8th grade language arts class part of James Otis' wonderful speech about the price of independence.
They also occasionally break out into song- "Oh, we are the Sons, oh, we are the Sons, the Sons of Liberty!"
Apart from this most obvious flaw in the movie, we're also expected to believe that these coronal mass ejections somehow keep satellites from burning up on re-entry, so they can take out streets full of people (for example, if the Soviet spy satellite which scattered itself all over the Yukon Territory back in the late 1970s had done so over downtown Detroit instead, the carnage could have been impressive).
And according to this movie, we can also dispense with all the money we're spending on ballstic missile defense - F-15 fighter planes can handle terminal stage ballistic intercepts just fine.
The last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu  N Chandra disappoints Music is okay, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out  Govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times Karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries Tabu is okay Nirmal Pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
The plot involves this guy who wants to seduce a high-up lady in society, so he needs this aphrodesiac-making kettle thingy, but he also for some reason switches the heads on these two other girls...see, it's all very confusing, and makes little to no sense whatsoever.
But this movie's also got: Priscilla Lane, who's always charming.
One-dimensional, of course, but also seeming so stupid that you wonder how he could be such an important and rich man.
Eventually this woman's brother is also taken over by Abigail & he's turned into a "sex vampire".
Why exactly a sex vampire needs fangs would be something I don't want to think about too long, but this transformation also makes her brother lurch along like Quasimodo, perhaps because he has an erection; again, not something to ponder very much.
It was also a surprize seeing the final guest star, playing himself, and in fact a reason for searching IMDb for this movie!
It also had some really well developed characters.
The side stories about Pryor's daughter staying behind in Jersey because of her new boyfriend also just falls apart.
Everything that happens in this film is so incredibly implausible, ONE (there are several I could provide) example of this is when the two heroes come across a room guarded with laser death rays that can supposedly cut through stone and also flesh.
Dana Carvey also shines, as the clean cut SAAB driver with multiple personalities.
It also happens that Mitchell's 14 year-old son Chris, Jeremy Lelliott, has hid in the embassy, in Chris' avoiding to go out on a date with a chubby Romnian girl, and causes so much trouble for everyone , the Serbians the hostages as well as his dad, that he almost causes the Atomic Bomb to accidentally go off before it's disconnected!
It was also the 25 million dollars wired into the mole's secret numbered Swiss Bank Account that had a big hand in him, or her, keeping the lid on the nuclear device and thus keep it from from blowing up a city of over two million people!
But it also has a ropey plot, poor acting from the three leading women (including the beautiful Jean Wallace) and its one leading man, Cornel Wilde, and a suave but unmenacing villain, the blandly-named Mr. Brown.
There are also some moments where low production values produce moments that might be from a comic strip: the private airport set identified by nothing (such as an aeroplane or runway) that reveals its function but simply by a sign reading "Private Airport", for example; or the box of labelled dynamite.
The ending is also weak, not because the idea (a shoot-out in the fog) is bad, but because it's impossible to believe, while watching it, that you're seeing anything other than one man alone in a studio pretending to be in a fight.
Brown's girlfriend, Susan Lowell, a former classical pianist, also can't seem to shake off her physical attraction to her gangster boyfriend (despite the fact there is not one scene where the two show any good feelings toward one another).
Clearly Kurosawa (who co-wrote the script) is making some social commentary particular to scandal-mongering in post war Japan, but also returning to a familiar theme, that of urging individuals to step out, speak out, to identify injustice and corruption and oppose it, even if this results in social or personal discord, since often the consequence of not doing so is a silent but soul-destroying evil.
also there was no plot and nothing that seemed to want to further the plot in any portion of the damn thing...weak, just utterly weak.
Mathias Hues reveals his real identity: he is also an idiot, and the Legion of Idiots is finally defeated.
The very beautiful art of the cover also attracted me.
The storyline is horribly plagiarized from 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and is also divided in two parts: the first one tells the 'saga' of two morons hitchhiking and being kidnapped by a psychotic killer.
Emily obviously would not protect Steven at that point since she not only didn't love him anymore but also had a reasonable belief that the thug was hired by her husband to kill her for her inheritance.
It seems to mean more than anything else that Jia wants to hit us over the head with the idea that his characters have nowhere to go, and it also seemed to me to be somehow a too-late subconscious attempt to steal from the kind of effects we get in Kiselowski's Dekalog.
The main difference is that the Gina Gershon character is played by a male, Jason Schnuit (see also, Club Wild Side 2).
We're also inundated with the all American look of every man having dark hair and every woman having blonde hair, a neo-Nazi trend used to glorify the Hitler Nazi machine by many movie makers.
Dominic Purcell and an animal loving Patty McCormack also feature in minor parts.
And Lori Loughlin, also no rookie to 80s teen movies, delivered her lines like she was suddenly picked on in English class to read the parts of a boring play.
The script is also way too taxed.
Henry Silva's wooden histrionics also are just too much.
A friend of mine says that his defining image of modern China is of a marble facade slapped onto a jerry-built wall; and it's this kind of picture that also emerges from 'The World', a touching movie about the lives of a group of workers in a Beijing theme park in which all the planet's tourist attractions are copied in a single location.
He is also a bad singer.
Chabrol was also interested in the games of truth and lie that link his two main actors and real suspense lies in Magimel's personality dangerously attracted to the bridesmaid.
The filmmaker's touch is also discernible at the wedding ceremony where he ridicules its crucial steps.
So, an absence of interest for this story of manipulation is surely due to its actors and also because like for "la CÃ©rÃ©monie", Chabrol made dull Rendell's novel.
There is also a clear illusion to PSYCHO.
(also to the others of cause, smile)  I lost and sorry, I wanted to write a comment but so much English and register again and again...   Forgive me please and maybe one good soul may help me to find that song.
There is also nothing edgy or controversial with such nudity; people are not shocked or attracted to films just because they are not afraid to photograph under the belt, literally.
There are also some wonderful images and cinematography.
I also enjoyed how the movie stays focused on one central character, and there are no obvious plot distractions by unnecessary sub-plots.
He was able to emulate real emotions not only by his realistic delivery of dialogue, but also by utilizing his body language and facial expressions.
The plot also turns out to lack any depth.
Banderas in the end is CIA and he was working undercover trying to prosecute the other thieves and it was all a misunderstanding and thats also how he got out of the jail in Paris.
A waste also for fans of Meg Ryan, with or without Botox.
Directed by Tom Cairns, who also translated the material for the screen, shows us a couple of misfits that have been together far too long and would have been better off dissolving their marriage some time ago.
Wyatt Knight also isn't bad as Tommy Turner.
My regards to the ever so beautiful Lisa Ray and also Sheetal Seth.
There is also a great conversation scene between two characters who don't share the same language, and the use of reflected light that is truly remarkable, make sure to watch for this scene.
Zhang also does something so miraculous that I thought would be impossible.
It was most likely Steven Baldwins worst film, I also noticed that One time Bond star George Lazenby had a small part in the film, I thought he did really well considering the type of movie it is.
They are also not very articulate, which writer/director Zhang Ke Jia compensates for by spending a lot of time slowly setting up individual scenes and watching people interact, as we see how different they are in different contexts with different people, as body language becomes more important than words, whether spoken or in text messages.
We would see disaster as the result of man's folly - think "The Towering Inferno" for example - but also as the quirky acts of nature they are.
There's also a mad scientist who's conducting experiments in geo-thermal power which involves digging deep into the earth and using the heat to power a generator or something.
There's also a lot of time spent as some federal bureau comes in, shuts down the work of our heroes, and blames the whole thing on terrorists.
I also got a kick out of how a wood frame house could contain molten lava - until the guy opens the door!
Telethapy, from The Shining also rings a bell.
I also suggest that other film makers see it as an example of how the excitement can be sucked out of a storyline by too much exposition.
There are also numerous gratuitous scenes--such as a clumsy dance by unattractive, would-be cowboys in a gay bar, and a song by a singer whose off-keyed wail is so bad you will reach for the mute button.
There is also an interpolated scene with two people we have never met before who have a tender, highly erotic love scene.
And also perhaps about the generation gap between 1st Gen. parents and their 2nd Gen. (or Gen. X) US-born-and-raised kids.
This is basically a ghetto version of "Road Trip," which also sucked.
Well, uh, it's about Will Smith running around in slow-motion while talking a lot, and yeah there's this other guy Martin Lawrence who also talks a lot.
He was also a highly skilled and dedicated leader of men.
There also was not enough explanation as to what was going on.
And he was also a general, and a very good one at that, something the filmmakers seem to have conveniently forgotten.
The music also was very strong and helped support the dramatic moments of the film.
The climax of the film is also the last ten minutes, and the only part of the film that doesn't take place in the asylum or in flashback.
Despite not being old enough to have been emotionally scarred by the same events that sent his older brother over the edge, Ricky has also become a psychopath.
It is even admitted in the Anchor Bay DVD release that it was mostly edited from the original to extend the video shelf-life of the first film, which was also less than Citizen Kane.
Police investigate as the bodies pile up, one officer also getting the hots for Katherine.
Fortunately there is no silicone also, and the naked bodies are indeed very beautiful.
Dolph's rather wooden, and we also have Shriver's annoying voice to contend with.
Not much of a thriller, Juncture is a beautiful drama that also raises questions of moral importance.
Deservedly it was his biggest flop to that date, as it was, perhaps non coincidentally, also his worst movie at that point.
That said, the move away from comedy and into action also doesn't help, Murphy getting his final "huh huh huh huh" after seeing himself and his friends shot and bleeding to death.
Not only that, but Wilder also samples his older films' glory to drive his point in FEDORA, which, in turns renders the whole thing even more pathetic than it needed to be.
Casting Marthe Keller and Hildegard Knef was also a very bad idea.
The music also doesn't help at all, it's annoying at best.
You are led to believe M is saving herself with her unconscious or whatever, but you are also led to believe heroic measures from the living are doing it.
He also wants to send a message to the control tower, to express his outrage at their non-cooperation.
Compare this to another Cary Grant film that came out the same year, North by Northwest; or Tony Curtis's Some Like it Hot which also came out in 1959.
It's also great for Adam Brody fans to see the acting change from this to the O.C.
The music was catchy the first two or three times you listen to it but can also be repetitive and annoying after a while.
Characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten.
The movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three is too much), but failed here too.
It was also great to see Brody give such a different performance.
They also center some of the story on some kid named Denzel, i don't know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time.
So the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration.
But, also a really bad movie.
The acting was also somewhat acceptable.
Did I also mention this movie is almost a surefire cure for insomnia?
the story was real good and the acting made it very interesting  for Adam Brody's first big role he was awesome as was the young Vietnamese girl.I don"t know if it was a true story or not but i found it very entertaining as I always wondered how they did these sort of searches.i watched it with my teenage son who also liked it.especially the snake scene with Adam Brody.i think it also gave him an idea of what was going on with all the Vietnam issues of the 1960s/70s.i have an older brother who is a Vietnam vet and i have recommended to him and his family.i like that it was both serious and funny as it was a very emotional movie especially with the music.
Beloved by Hong Kong movie fans worldwide, the film's mixture of period detail, balletic action (among the best of Chan's career), uproarious farce and slapstick comedy is undeniably entertaining, but it's also something of a mixed bag.
They should have aged him up a bit, especially during his stint as Monsieur Madeleine - I also don't think Liam Neeson looked powerful enough.
The film can also be especially appealing at this time since it deals with losing someone in the war.
Her character also makes the point that the poor are the essence of a city population, and somehow are easily forgotten.
With his new honesty, he has also gained kindness, compassion, and love.
There's also a wonderful song in the film called 'Chupke Se' performed in the film by Rani and Vivek.
You can also see his difficulty in staying relevant to his audience during later seasons, as he addresses guests who happen to be in their mid-teens (Christina Ricci being a good example) as if they were three years old.
It was also British.
Shame, because the opening scenes are very promising, with Eriq Ebouaney portraying a very sympathetic hero, and Fatou N'Diaye also impressive as his deceptively strong partner.
Then you also should avoid this one, because it's so utterly bad that it's not even funny.
The movie also has absolutely no closure to it whatsoever.
Kim also informs some local tribal chief of poachers killing the poor Elephants and Rhinos..You have to see this guy, man, what poor typecasting!
It also is a light-hearted attempt to examine the lives and loves of the youth of the modern and very westernised India, and doesn't bother the viewer too much with too serious and pretentious issues of life and the universe!
This also wouldn't be a Russell film without the gratuitous nudity and they're are a couple of lulu's here.
It is all about flashing boobs, also masturbation.
She also has strange visions with lots of blood, and has a surprisingly quick temper.. a fact that her father has already found out to his cost.
There is also a tedious half brother/sister relationship that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor, and a cute dog that always turns up where it's least wanted.
Granted, it can also be fun and extremely exiting if only one person is at risk, as it was on the first season.
Oh yeah, It also has great, great, great (have I overdone it yet?)
I should also point out - As people have done on this page - that Peter Cushing doesn`t appear untill well into the second half
I had also read that the movie had some gory scenes, which led me to believe that the print I saw had some footage removed (it's practically goreless).
She certainly had had a tough job on her hands not only having to spout forth such hackneyed drivel but also having to give depth to a thoroughly unappealing and one-dimensional character.
The original story, a novella by Paul Theroux, was turned into a screenplay, also by Theroux (he wrote several).
Signing Sigourney Weaver was a blessing but also a problem since she's taller than most leading men but fortunately, so is Michael Caine.
I may be wrong, Indian movies were never worth considering seriously before that also barring a very few exceptions.
But Clint, for the most part, also faced cartoon bad guys.
I also agree with Bobby Flay's comment that cooking can become an athletic sport and it should be on ESPN2.
Vivek Oberoi is also good.
Given the filmâs title, this one obviously highlights the living dead â but, thankfully, it doesnât follow the then-prevalent flesh-eating pattern cemented by George A. Romero; the plot, in fact, is pretty complex and also involves transcendental, voodoo and occult rituals as well as a masked assassin!
It also had Mirta Miller.
There is also a bad wrestling scene, a pop can on a guys neck and too many redheads.
It also sinks any chance that the gags and the humour might have; but the jokes are mostly mediocre so it doesn't matter.
For the record, the executive producer Laurence Myers was also responsible for the nerve-shreddingly awful Gary Glitter vehicle 'Remember Me This Way', the low-budget glam-rock ragbag 'Never Too Young To Rock' and the oddly entertaining seventies time capsule 'Side By Side'.
There's also one of those hysterically pretentious sex scenes in which naked gyrations (Beals no doubt using a body double) are intercut with archival footage of nuclear explosions, war crimes, etc.
The ending was also way too manufactured so as to keep commercial audiences happy.
The actresses are also fine-> young, beautiful and talented (I especially liked Fiona Scott).
I also felt a little bit sleepy while watching it.
Lisa Morton and Brett Thompson have also given us a dodgy script with little interest and beyond stupid (I mean one of those "Thralls" had snake thingos come out of her boobs, now that's just plain dumb).
One consequence was they had to park the caravans a quarter mile away and then walk the actors to the set and also use a "simple" lighting rig to simulate a full moon which reflected light off the clouds and manged to cause a complaint from aeroplanes landing at Gatwick Airport 10 miles away!
Rani Mukherjee also acted very well.
I also think a Scottish person should have played Charlotte - I did not find the accent of Cate Blanchett at all convincing.
Although being somewhat tedious, the story then begins to take on a vestige of reality, regarding the fate of two parent-less Jewish children and the resistance group leader's father who is also of Jewish ancestry.
The rules that Tilo lived by also came across as hokey and impractical for a store-owner in California.
I went to this film because it was advertised as being in the "Bend It Like Beckham" vein, which was not only a misleading come-on, but in the end also a film as ineffective as the real Beckham in the recent World Cup.
She also has to relinquish any sort of personal desires, and can never leave the shop.
Hellraiser Hellworld is painful to watch and by that I mean really poor, cast with a stereotypical British actor in line with the current US trend it always seems to be a cockney or someone who has the Pride & Prejudice Mr Darcy, Mr Darcy accent, there are other areas in England apart from London, period dramas and Narnia, this film is very predictable and boring, the box and pinhead seem to have taken a back seat in the later movies and also people seem to just die instantly as opposed to being taken to hell or within hell, as IMDb user troyanov states, 'Lance and interestingly even Pinhead looks bored', probably due to their 'uninspiringly' crap dialogue.
I enjoyed Lance Henriksen presence in the movie and the film also includes a few cool kills.
The climax also in Tamil which has a more realistic look is better than in Hindi which is too filmy despite Vivek's performance and Rahman's orchestra.
I was also quite surprised that the Cenobites seem to be progressively less frightening and devious with time.
There's also a couple of nods to SAW which like HELLRAISER started off as a well regarded horror film then became a franchise factory churning out sequels to lower acclaim and box office .
The story is also clever and good.
And yet in this eighth sequel, Rick Bota; also known as the dude who doesn't allow the Hellraiser franchise to die peacefully; presents Hellraiser now as a popular internet game that has nerdy followers and organizes secret parties in isolated mansions.
Rahman and Anil Mehta who were also part of last year's Lagaan are once again magnificent.
Then the ghost of Lance appears briefly in the car of the barely known "protagonists" to scare them, also for no apparent reason or logic.
But the people who take the stuff seriously must be slow on the uptake, so the producers also dress him in sinister suits, give him a decadent haircut, and give an office where he keeps a big picture of himself hanging behind the desk.
This cartoon was too confusing for children, and also not recommended for them either.
Normally the Kraken only lives in the Northern regions, like the cold seas of Norway and Iceland, but according to the script of this low-keyed and forgettable made-for-TV creature feature, the monster can easily also dwell American ocean stretches and it suddenly even got promoted to being the guardian of ancient Greek artifacts!
Unfortunately Nicole & her crew are hampered by a few unforeseen problems, first off is Maxwell Odemus (Jack Scalia) the son of a Greek mafia gangster who wants the two relics returned to Greece by any means necessary & there's also the small fact that a gigantic squid is guarding the precious bounty & basically kills anyone who goes near it.
I'm also sorry to inform you that there is no nudity at all.
I also love the "metal mask," that looks like a pie-tin mold.
You can call this a "personal style", but it is also a trade-off for creativity and experimenting.
"Dealer" certainly has a different approach, because it makes you mostly laugh at, and/or - to a lesser extent - feel sorry for drug users, whereas the other movies were intended mostly to make you hate drugs (and/or - to a lesser extent - also feel sorry for drug users).
The twist here is that she also beds every other guy she sees in an art museum or on the train to her next 'performance'.... as it were.
--a film that was also directed by Mike Nichols.
Originally billed as rollicking family entertainment (though rated 'M' for mature), things take an odd, disquieting turn with an extended trip to a cathouse, where the kid's guardian (Steve McQueen) tussles with his favorite prostitute, who wants to go legit and get married (there's also a bloody fight between two youngsters that seems to come out of nowhere).
That would also be her lasting (?)
The words mata hari literally means "the eye of the day", compounded to matahari (she also spelt it "Mata-Hari") it means, literally, "sun" in Indonesian (similar meanings in related languages like Malayan); today it's also the name an Indonesian supermarket chain.
I had trouble also working out how plan of the 'Evil Savage' linked in with the Bermuda Triangle type section, and what control (if any Savage had over that).
I'm also a big fan of Willem Defoe, and he's very good in what little he does.
I am doubtful that Lady Chatterley is also cut or not.I am not sure about it but i is also "R" rated.And it may also be cut.Fifth Musketeer is also cut omitting all of the nudity.For example uncut version contains much more nudity from Sylvia Kristel and Ursula Andress.
The character's got on my nerves to start with but they sort of grew on me & I ended up quite liking them, also I couldn't but help think that if Doc knew what was going to happen why didn't he just stop Johnny & his friends going to the party in the first place & prevent the whole sorry situation?
If you enjoyed the location photography in THE BLUE MAX, you will also like MATA HARI!
However, what kept me watching was the fact that I liked the cast, James Russo, Brad Dourif, Theresa Russell and Micheal Rooker are always great to see on screen no matter how the movie is, also I can safely say director Richard Pepin has done better films in the past, so I can easily let this one slide Overall, it might be worth seeing but you won't miss anything.
I'm a huge fan of really bad movies (HellGate, Texas Chiansaw massacre the next generation, Troll 2, and Slumber Party massacre 2 have all made it to my collection and i love watching them) but this movie is too boring..maybe if it was a 15 min short it wouldn't be so bad...not a movie that trys to stretch itself for an hour and 20 mins...the ending was a crap fest also.
So, this is the best I could figure out: The government is evil, large corporations are evil, aids is killing blacks and whites don't care, (these are the easy ones) then I guess that Spike is trying to say something about fatherless black children which is hard to understand, then I guess he also has an opinion on sperm donation, but what is it?
The desires of family and fidelity are also universal, irrespective of familial unit structure.
this is the only show ( at least i watched until now ) that not only helps to know how our favorite stars are... but also helps to develop the craft for professionals ( being and wanted to be ) and know the difficulty of the craft for non-professionals, you may ask why general public should know how difficult the craft is and that is because they are the people who comments ( usually bad ) on them.
The problem is that you also come into the movie already knowing what a socially and politically conscious filmmaker Spike Lee is.
OK. Then there's also all this stuff about lesbians and impregnating them.
And in a moment that seems completely arbitrary, Lee also throws in Oliver North into the mix of Watergate figures.
Not only are all the lesbians attractive, but also they want to get impregnated the old-fashioned way.
The movie may have salvaged itself if they didn't try to also make the main character, try to talk like a ghetto person one minute, and then a respectable, sensible person the very next.
I didn't take this dark movie out to laugh at its contents, which were trying to be very real and were also very graphic.
Should have spent more time on the main character, less time trying to build up the minor characters, and also should have taken a closer look at the dialog on this script.
It also makes the scenes seem shallow, and they were supposed to be powerful scenes.
And this is also what works against it.
I also live in LA if that means anything.
I was also surprised that so many people rated it highly on this site "Christian Bale's performance is as mesmerising as De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver" some mug wrote.
I also live in Parkdale and this place and its people are close to my heart.
I also found the film to be really funny and I feel that I got to know each of the characters.
I am also interested in the process of making the film and the community's role, and would like to find out more info on that.
The film also was relevant to me because I am currently working on a report to the Premier of Ontario on the Roots of Youth Violence with Mr. Alvin Curling and the Chief Justice Roy McMurty (please see www.rootsofyouthviolence.on.ca).
Secret Mission is also cheaply made (watch for the model boat chugging across a miniature set in an early scene) and badly written by future Bond-helmer Terence Young, but it's Mason who is the cerise sur le gateau.
There are also a number of very odd situations created that are plain annoying, and as with so many recent movies the attempted 'twist' is just pants.
Well, in my opinion, if the first halves of these couples suck marginally worse, the second halves are also all bad.
Robin's rise from simple outlaw to leader of the gang also seemed a little too quick and easy, although I appreciated the background that was offered to his character, which offered a reasonable explanation of how Sir Robert Hode became Robin Hood.
I also found Daguerre's jester irritating after a while.
It was well done, all right, if you ignored the tedious lines, the "absurd theater" construction and the utter lack of imagination which rendered the situations as completely uninspired and made you go "ahhh come on..." I will not even waste my time on explaining all the reasons I thought this movie was purely awful, I just want to know how anybody can think it was beautiful, clever or touching... And I would also like to know how a movie which is as "real" as Liz's life is considered authentic and worth watching.
This also doesn't work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end.
Okwe lives with Senay, a Turkish woman who also has come to London in the hopes of finding a better life.
This is also one of the earliest films of Shirley Temple who's big scene is when one of the Colbys shoots the head off of her doll.
I also enjoyed Roland Young's Watson and Powell's chat with Barrymore in the taxi.
I'm not familiar with the particular Allred comic, Grafik Musik, that served as the basis for the film, but it must have had a relatively lengthy run, or otherwise it must have also been a mess in terms of story.
It also has inexplicable elements of sci-fi thrown in and Little Nicky (2000)-styled supernaturalism.
The film also features a score from Vince DiCola responsible for two scores I loved in the 80's in Transformers and Rocky 4, however this is not 80's style and his score is mostly generic, aside from some moments that have the Vince pazzazz.
The snobbery is also present in the extraordinary character of Michael's 'unsuitable' girlfriend Veronica, a middle class woman who drinks martini instead of sherry and thinks that letting a horse run around the kitchen is "unhygenic" (she's got a point).
Apart from being crazy, he also lacks skin, and for some reason, every shot that contains him is blurry, either because they spent all their special effects money on pictures of the sun, or because the director was a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, and thought it was a good idea to recreate those fancy shaky-cam effects in a visually beautiful scifi-movie.
The crew also faces lots of other dangers, but they are all forced, unlikely incidents that would only happen in a bad movie.
Still, it may have been jarring, things such as the >1 year journey that is inside earths orbit also jarred me, but other than that first one I don't think the average viewer should have noticed, and unreal-ism, even in the case of this movie, shouldn't lose more than 1 point from movie's score, rather it was the plethora of other problems that doomed Sunshine.
It's a shame he didn't want to inject some humour and more action into the story also, because its quite heavy going.
(Which thus also endangered the mission) Since when do we let computers make judgment calls?
The movie also features some real bad editing, an horrendous musical score, stupid sound effects and bad looking gore effects.
Not only the storytelling of the movie is really lacking but yes, also the actual story itself.
It also rips off one or two too many other movies.
The movie also actually features very little action, especially for a genre movie, and the action that it does feature is done incredible bad and is just plain lame.
The cast also really didn't do a good job.
But also actors such as Mark Frost and Isabel Brook do a real horrible job.
It also had a community leader that was trying to make a difference by having community group meetings once or twice a week, having people come out and participate in making a change in the community.
And also you'll lead a deviant lifestyle!
also, the show lacks any originality.
Christina Cox as heroine Vicki is also lacking.
However, it is also a primer on scamming and could be worth watching before a trip to a car dealer.
The cast also lived in Parkdale during the filming.
including âWithout Youâ, which has become perhaps his most representative song; among the session musicians one can also recognize other popular figures of the era such as guitarist Peter Frampton and drummer Keith Moon!
By the way, Mrs. Michael Caine (Shakira Baksh) also appears as Merlinâs feline housekeeper.
There is also a woman hung upside down in preparation for virgin sacrifice, with no explanation as to how she got there.
Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) also used to be Countess Bathory's loyal servant when they were executed several hundred years earlier for their gruesome crimes.
Not only because it happens in winter (hence snow) and not only because the world of this small black Toronto community gets shaken (as snow globes do) by the accidental shooting death of a young child ... but also because of the closeness and intimacy of everything.
But I am also responding to the fact that this is a film of legend, which Sean Welbourn described to me in wonderment back in Grade 11.
What makes this movie come alive is not just the stories told through a group of men seeking answers, but it's also the passion and emotion evoked by Miss G (played by the phenomenal Leonie Forbes).
"Hickey and Boggs" and "Shout at the Devil" also come to mind in this respect.
I've become quite a fan of Rachel McAdams recently, and I quite like Anna Faris's films also.
and loudmouth, money-obsessed American manager (Allan Klein), as well as Essex's character's own career path which seems to echo Jim Morrison of the Doors (who also died in seclusion in continental Europe), but the situations are too conventional and predictable to really engage.
Another weak point is the original music, (a failing also of the much later "Dreamgirls") which especially when set against contemporary classic tracks by The Who, Kinks and Mamas and Papas, to name but a few, is sorely lacking in catchiness and leaves you wondering just how The Stray Cats actually got to the top of the charts.
That's pretty interesting but also didn't help me decide whether or not to watch the film.
The music in this movie sets the tone like it should, but also reveals when something isn't right - a good tool when figuring out the plot in advance.
Bobo Vian as the housekeeper also was good with the little she was offered to do.
Andrew "Dice" Clay has been called a lot of things in his life, I'm sure, but when he was called "a comedian", I'm also sure that was said with condescending laughter, snickers and Bronx cheers aplenty.
Andrew Dice Clay, thankfully, has also been blackballed in the industry, but instead of one random moment of anger, he built an entire career out of it, and by the 20-minute mark, I felt uncomfortable, like I had accidentally tapped into a white power forum.
The DVD also looks like it was copied from a VHS tape, rather dark, and about three quarters of the way through, the movie suddenly backs up about 15 seconds like someone accidentally hit the fast rewind button, then goes back to play.
Having seen episodes 5 and 6 from my local library (And also some scattered episodes from when I was small), I decided to pick this one up as well, thinking it was the End of Evangelion (It was wrongly labeled by the library, despite how obvious it wasn't from the big words DEATH AND REBIRTH on the cover).
I also saw The End of Evangelion and loved it to death, and I think if I had seen The End of Evangelion before this I would have liked it more, however that does NOT change a thing.
She is also the object of his perverse sexual gratification.
also, you know how plot twists are supposed to make you think "wow, i totally didn't expect that!"
Cinematography is also good.
I think here also you are better off waiting for a few months by when this should be coming on channels.
Aside from not being able to cope with this affliction, it also starts affecting his mind and he can't resist the urge to kill women any longer.
The murders are also pretty bloody & squirty, so that's a plus.
Doing it like that, might get you on with the story, but it also causes more than one problem for other aspects of the movie.
Deodato has also made pure exploitation trash like the 1980 La Casa sperduta nel parco aka The House at the Edge of the Park or Inferno in diretta aka Cut & Run (1985) both of which are mostly just extremely gratuitously violent but also have at least some thoughts and themes to make them more interesting than other nasty and gory Italian films of the period.
Off Balance is written by Gianfranco Clerici whose other credits include the mentioned masterpiece Cannibal Holocaust with Deodato as well as The House at the Edge of the Park but also Lucio Fulci's sadistic and misogynistic terror tale Lo Squartatore di New York aka The New York Ripper (1982) the last two of which are perfect opposites to the firstly mentioned and its subject matter.
The things that are discussed in the second part are also interesting and important but they are presented with too much contrast with the more lively first half.
The film works also as a pure giallo thriller as it has its moments of suspense and mystery and of course the graphic blood letting.
I also took into account that the film maker appears to have made a genuine effort in comparison to some of the other no budget trash I have seen.
It is also inaccurate to call this show "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever", because after it was released at least a dozen more "awesomely bad songs" appeared on the radio.
i think the second Die Hard was strong also, but when the wife's character disappeared, a lot of the heart was lost.
Greedy, untalented hacks who attach themselves to a show they think will be a hit, also suck.
It's also flatly directed with poor characters and dumb dialog, some of it spoken unconvincingly even by Brando himself, "man", and it comes off as almost laughable!
Al Lettieri plays a small role as a pilot who's also part of the plan and his work here led Brando to push for him with Francis Ford Coppola to give him a breakthrough role as Virgil Sollozo in The Godfather.
I also don't understand why she was choose to be the lead actress of this show.
Stephen Rea's acting is very simple so I'd like to question that nomination also.
And even when you don't know what will happen, which you now know because I said it, it is also not worth the time.
Today I went to the movies to see "Funny Games," an apparent shot for shot remake of an Austrian film produced ten years or so earlier which I also didn't see.
Stupid and pointless it is also.
Die Hard is simply a very progressive, accelerated and perfectly paced action movie, not only does it tell a good story, and even comes with a few complexes, it also brings some of the best and most solid action ever to be seen.
In 2008, the re-make, also directed by Haneke, debuts with an all new cast and this time in English.
These were made for Mack Sennett (also known as "Keystone Studios") and were literally churned out in very rapid succession.
When I saw KÃ´rei I've already seen the very interesting KaÃ¯ro, also by Kiyoshi Kurosawa; after that positive impression had someone told me that Mr. Kurosawa was capable of clumsiness when dealing with a fantastic story I wouldn't lend him or her ears, but unfortunately that would be true.
He's also pretty arrogant as he points out the Rolex that he and the company gave to Holly for all her hard work.
They also managed to make Sylar into one of the most obnoxious characters on TV.
My mom was just absolutely in love with this film and told me how much I should see it if I love action movies, also I had become a Bruce Willis fan, so when she mentioned that, I decided to sit down and watch it.
I mean wow guys turning on the TV will also automatically turn off ur brain too?
Nikki also became popular with the men, probably because of that lovely crotch shot in the first episode, so they continued on her dull struggle to keep from becoming her alter ego, take care of her son and to not go to jail, when they finally put her in there, she murders some couple guards or something, and then... they release her!
The idea of how the heroes have their powers is ridiculous, putting it on a scientific theory that is an incomplete theory in the first place: "evolution" To say that a person needs the ability to fly is rather foolish as the brain is people's weapon, and if they want to go on Darwin's theory of evolution, they best realize that it's also "survival of the fittest" which goes into the idea of the food chain.
It would be quite unfair to hunted animals if we not only have brains to figure out how to make weapons, but we also had the speed of the animal, everything would become extinct!
Bruce Willis also introduced the action hero as tough but eminently, realistically woundable; by the end he's a bloody, torn, shot and beaten mess.
Morris Chestnut is also very good as he is one of my favorite actors.
The movie also consist of many A lister star such as Gena Rowlands, Sharon Stone, Gillian Anderson, Meat Loaf, and James Gandolfini.
It simply is the catalyst of the blockbuster generation of the 90s and it's also one of the best action movies of all time.
And there's also these scenes where McClane shoot two terrorists in the legs, making them literally blow out with blood.
There's also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes' limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies.
Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs.
He also writes an amusing note on the persons jumper, meanwhile hes in the lift above the one that stopped taking notes on what hes up against.
I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over.
I actually had high hopes for this movie when watching it in the cinema at a film festival in Copenhagen, the director Amirkulov was also present at the viewing, so it felt like a special occasion.
Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's marvellous performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader.
He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.
Yes I also remember it closed down 12 years ago' (Reference to Stray episode).
I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s  DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character .
It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies.
I also like good drama movies f.ex.
Trying to woo some women he gets constantly clunked on the head by a jealous man, and also a butt from a goat, so he think something doesn't want him to be with those women.
The concept of an ongoing truce between the resistance fighters and the occupying German army also seems ludicrous to me, yet this is a central theme of the movie.
The original Italian title of this film (Dalle Ardenne all' Inferno), the sleeve notes for the English language video release are also grossly misleading.
It came out way too soon before too many facts were out and it's also way too favorable to Scott Peterson.
It also makes Laci's family and friends look bad.
The attempt to recreate times that Laci's family and Amber went to the press are also bad and look poorly staged.
There's also a fictional (guessing) couple who are supposed to be friends of Laci's and Scott's who fight over whether or not Scott did it.
They also figured that maybe the first movie wasn't humorous enough (yeah, you really need humor in a movie about POW torture), so they stuck in some really, really unfunny "comic relief".
There is also a Marxist undertone from the gardener and general "hero" Mario, who is so heroic he has sex with the youngest daughter very quickly so that Dracula will not be interested in her!
Headed up by screen favorite Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense), "Die Hard" also features the talented Alan Rickman (Galaxy Quest) and Bonnie Bedelia (Needful Things).
(Coincidentally, the two stars of this film -- Kiefer Sutherland and Emily Lloyd -- also had actor fathers.)
On the one hand, he's cold-blooded and cruel, yet he also enjoys dressing well and seems very cultured.
John C Reilly also has a minor role as a kindly officer trying to locate Ryder over the whereabouts of baseball star Ulrich.
It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller "Predator," which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.
He also meets Anita Ekberg trying to buy a panther in a circus.
And also, it makes even ROTK and DW look bad.
The fights themselves are also underwhelming mostly involving random kicks, punches, and throws, anything to flip the girl upside down or get her leg up to show her rump.
The dub is also bad, although Hakufu's dub made me giggle a bit.
The younger of the brothers, Will (Andrew Stevens, who also produces here as well as contributing heavily to the screenplay), a rather artless character, does in fact espy Nikki in flagrante delicto, but this apparently fortuitous event for Brian is nullified because Will has succumbed to the physical charms of the wayward wife and has decided to withhold the evidential tape from the musician and his attorney, played by able supporting player Paul Carr, causing a viewer to recognize that the lovestruck security guard can not be considered as an example of rectitude.
Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.
There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next .
(The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.)
but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.
(The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)
It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.
There are some standard plot elements and moments of discovery.The animation for the little girl is also very good.
The environments also look amazing, especially when the human world comes into play.
I also completely disagree with the reviewer who said that people with long attention spans will enjoy this movie.
Meanwhile, a serial killer is leaving a trail of blood on his way to the house, and soon the game of murder becomes much more than make-believe"  And that also sucked!
Rachel is also a scientist who has knowledge of Teleportation which can transport people from one area in the country to another, something like a time machine.
I will at least give the filmmakers credit for making their intentions (and level of aspiration) known right up front - with a title like "Karate Cop", the viewer knows EXACTLY what he's getting, and also how good it's likely to be.
I also admit that this Ron Marchini film is far, far better than an earlier film I saw that that he "starred" in ("Death Machines") because he actually has dialog to deliver in this one (in "DM" he was a silent zombie killing machine) and he gets to kick people in the face on a regular basis (where in DM, the actual fights were few and dully staged).
"Karate Cop" is also better in two ways than the stream of similar post-apocalyptic themed Italian rip-offs of "Max Max" and "Escape From New York" because it appears to have been made by Americans.
But it is also worse in the score for the soundtrack, which is obviously scored and performed by one guy with a synthesizer.
The pictures are also depressing, the whole film is very unpleasant and misses any taste and good human feeling.
which, of all things, is also an opera sung in Hungarian!
The film under review, then, is original to be sure and mercifully short â but also rather pointless...to say nothing of dismal-looking, dreary and thoroughly depressing!
However, CAMP BLOOD was also filmed entirely in daylight and did not even have the benefit of a claustrophobic indoors setting, yet it surpasses SERIAL SLAYER by miles in terms of entertainment value.
It also has very high saturation, not to hide the action as other reviews might suggest, but because the lighting guy mows lawns on the weekend.
The packaging, which features an evil Vin Diesel lookalike with a crossbow standing by a dark and creepy house, is also misleading.
Having a slasher film set during the day, so that the killer cannot lurk in the darkness, is also a neat idea.
They also discuss how the past victims were all killed outside of their homes, which apparently brings them a sense of safety...even though none of the windows are locked, these women seem 100% convinced that the murderer is not going to break-in and kill them.
On a side note, the movie also features a small "comeback" performance by Judith O'Dea (Barbara in the original Night of the Living Dead), but it is nothing to write home about.
Given the filmâs title, this one obviously highlights the living dead â but, thankfully, it doesnât follow the then-prevalent flesh-eating pattern cemented by George A. Romero; the plot, in fact, is pretty complex and also involves transcendental, voodoo and occult rituals as well as a masked assassin!
It also had Mirta Miller.
There is also a bad wrestling scene, a pop can on a guys neck and too many redheads.
I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it!
The acting is also great.
She also starred in Ryuhei Kitamura's Alive.
I also didn't see what people hated about Pauly Shore.
Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s.
Yukio is also recently married to a young woman he met by the riverside and who is suffering from amnesia.Soon a dark figure is lurking about and after Yukio's father dies under mysterious and unnatural circumstances things begin to take a turn for the worse.
The minor characters of the Barrymores and the convict were also very well done.
I also like that he got shot, which did add a bit of... something-- some kind of emotional tension between the two supposed friends.
I also liked seeing Holmes get the needles out as it's a part so little told on the screen.
He also changed a major plot-point: in Edogawa's original, the doppleganger-brother (Sutekichi) murders his brother, throws him into a disused-well, and steals his identity permanently.
As-usual, there are also the themes of class and one's standing and honor in Japanese society.
Gemini has a tension to it that resembles Poe's stories, and it is also about the psychology between people.
Rin also plays her part in educating Yukio what it is to be poor and desperate--to live like an animal.
The doctor will return to his practice a full-man, but there is an ambivalence, as he also looks menacing striding towards the camera.
This is an ancient movie that claims to spread the word about the dangers of getting syphilis bluggg.. pardon me, ladies and gents, I think I just vomited a little... but also takes the time to be an exploitation flick by showing two lesbians coming on to each other at a strip show,etc.
I also thought the point about the "quacks" was interesting because it's harder today to figure out if a doctor is a quack since we have such a high rate of suing for malpractice.
Watch this movie to see how drastically times have changed but also to educate yourself about this disease.
It's all about the horrors of syphilis and appears to be well-meaning but is also VERY heavy-handed and silly.
In addition to the overly melodramatic and silly story, the movie also passes along a lot of information to the audience--some of which is wrong (I taught sex ed and could tell).
It also feels like it aspires to be a macabre comedy which might work if the humor was smart enough.
The acting is amazingly unextraordinary, with the exception being the sole survivor from a group that was abducted and killed a few days in before this story (fittingly enough, she gets in one set of dialogue before she is separated and killed) and Leatherface's little sister, who is genuinely unsettling from first encounter (she holds tea parties with skulls and a doll made from what looks like a mummified infant), but is also barely given any screen-time.
They run into (literally) survivalist Benny (Ken Foree) who quickly becomes chainsaw bait also.
It is also interesting that even though this film barely clocks in at an hour and twenty minutes, it feels like it goes on for an eternity.
This certainly is not the worst of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, but it's probably the hardest to sit through, despite also being 75 minutes without credits.
And, are we supposed to believe that the entire extended family is also made up of inbred cannibal serial killers?
I saw it the same night as I saw another popular Japanese horror, "The Ring", which curiously also features a well, but I found Gemini much more sinister and frightening.
There's also some sort of queen that the women go to who howls and makes statements.
Then I"m also convinced that the aliens abducted some 50's femalien to do the voice-over for this movie (as she sounds totally spaced-out).
I suspect they also used her voice to provide ALL the other actors and actresses with dubbed voices (adding some treble & bass tunes in post-production, as well as pitching her voice down a bit for male characters), as ALL cast members speak in this same monotonous type of voice.
Suppposedly this movie also was to feature a tribe of vicious, warmongering Ape Men, but due to some strange, probably outer-space logic, we only get to see two of them, who even get ripped to shreds by some very green-looking ("Pathecolor" again) crocodile.
I also learned one or two things while watching this movie:  -- Women are foolish objects.
-- Pre-historic Ape-Men also wear make-up.
I wonder also, why such rubbish is dubbed, while really good movies are only subtitled in Germany.
Here you can also see, that Tony Danza slowly is going south.
He also makes fun of people who think that God will always protect them if they are good people, intentionally misquotes Scripture, saying "Well, something like that" regarding a verse, totally twisting it, and gives us a few other of these kind remarks.
It's also sad to see how mean-spirited some of these "creative" filmmakers are, but the real agenda of this film - the bottom line - came in the last minute - it's another George Bush-bashing cartoon, as "George" is pictured as a cowboy with an itchy trigger finger now, just killing everyone in sight and enjoying it.
In addition, you should be aware that 1979-1980 also gave us perhaps the WORST musicals ever--not just Roller Boogie.
The film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies.
Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.
Epic Movie temporarily halts the predictable, unfunny jokes close to the end of the film, when Kal Penn (who made two Harold and Kumar references, also falling quite flat, even amongst the largely tweenage audience) spells out the film's moral--a sappy and poorly placed monologue on the importance of family.
The repetitive use of the word "Bitch" to refer to the antagonist, played by Jennifer Coolidge ("Stiffler's mother" in American Pie, a point also mentioned) got tiring.
No it's not as bad as the Attack of The Eye Creatures (also in color and having the "actors" speak on camera) but man for a spy flick from this glorious era, this one is close or is rock bottom.
I was mostly familiar with Scott for his Tarzan portrayals of several years earlier, some of which were quite good; of course, he is also well known for his roles in Italian musclemen epics, playing mythical heroes named Goliath or Maciste.
The video is also fairly unrealistic.
Well, the story is very poor, the cast is very poor and the shooting is also poor.
However somewhere in between the feuding twin brothers who also happen to be spies and the repeated sequences of bondage sex and violent rape, this movie made me want to die.
He was also a troubled soul with a horrible family history who murdered his wife then took his own life.
The film also avoids answering some simple questions such as if it was so popular why didn't Z channel expand to San Francisco or New York?
There was also no identification of who the interviewees were, so you could not relate to them in any way.
He's also got just enough stage combat ability to make some of the fights vaguely entertaining.
The episode is also completely forgettable, I keep forgetting about it unlike other bad episodes like 'Space' where you immediately know what it was about.
He also looks pretty unattractive (but that's just my opinion).
I'm sure it also tried to be well made.
Angelina also wants to continue the family bloodline so kidnaps a teenage girl (Katie Chonacas) for Norbert to rape & impregnate.
I also have to mention the soundtrack which I found extremely annoying & some of the songs used gave me a headache.
The editing is also poor on occasion with some scenes not making any sense & character's suddenly popping up from quite literally nowhere.
The movie was also very poorly written and badly acted, every second word the main female protagonist said was a curse word and the male character didn't was mute or something.
Larry Hagman also features, in a bold casting against type, as a fast talking wheeler-dealing Southern entrepreneur who runs the race.
Oh and somehow a bandanna and a magazine page also survived intact( WTF? )
Eye witness testimonies also suggest many other things including there was no plane at the crash site and some claiming to have seen it smash into the ground.
United 93 also made some stuff up, as was necessary considering the mystery surrounding the whole thing, but at least it was believable.
The DVD also has amazing extras with interviews from the actual families.
Upon research, it has also been shown that it was virtually impossible to use cell phones in 2001 at that height & speed.
A hero can also be defined as someone remaining in their seat and whimpering, as many of the women did.
It was also so stupid that the plane was shown going out of control only a few hundred feet over a farmer and then crashing.
When I was a kid I also didn't care about the plot...All I thought was beaches, skating, pretty girl, pretty boy...happy ending.
ÂGeneral Richard Myers, chairman, US Joint Chiefs of Staff at Pentagon  "On June 5, 2006, the Muckraker Report contacted the FBI Headquarters, 202-324-3000, to learn why Bin Laden's Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Usama was also wanted in connection with 9/11.
I also couldn't identify with any of the passengers.
Jill Schoelen plays Paula who is Dwights girlfriend and is the love interest of Brian, also.
Schoelen, who played several roles like this, is also well past sixteen - but, bending over, she is still sweet.
The cast also includes: Brenda James, Eric Boles, Dirk Blocker.
The film also has a slightly fuzzy look that makes it seem older than it is.
There's also the fairly original running gag of the killer's first victim surviving the assault and fruitlessly struggling for help for the rest of the film.
The acting also does little to improve matters, with future A-lister Pitt being unmemorable, unlikeable and offering no hint of star quality, Leitch giving an equally unimpressive turn, and a performance from poor old Roddy McDowall that can only be described as extremely embarrassing.
He is also a fine mechanic (although not as fine as the sexy school teacher whom he initially patronises when she offers her help), he can handle a gun, he can give moving speeches and he is an explosives expert ("Where did you learn to do that?"
The only black guy in it also mysteriously turns up and immediately starts telling people how to react in a nuclear war kind of way, like some kind of expert or something.
I am also a huge fan of post-apocalyptic movies, shows, and books.
They also lack any sort of military adviser given the way they handle every armed encounter.
There also does not seem to be one short wave radio operator in town that can get a signal from even the closest town.
There are also already some typical Bergman postures, with one woman talking intensely and the one next to her staring vapidly past her downwards, seemingly lost in her own inner world.
My eye was caught by Eva Dahlbeck, who I also recently saw in SommarnÃ¶je sÃ¶kes.
We also learn that the people of Jericho turn to the mayor and police when their utilities stop working.
Worth seeing if you run across it on cable and you're in the mood for a very uneven comedy.It would be also okay to get in the bargain bin at the 99 cent store (which is how I got my copy) since its not worth more than a dollar.
But there also should be films for the humans on the leftwing - they prefer their fantasy world, where facts and evidence does not have any value.
Then let us look at the leftwing: Stalin (killed about at least 20 million), Lenin (killed 4 million +), Mao (killed about 20 million also), Pol Pot (killed 4 out of Cambodia's population of 8 million) and Saddam Hussein (killed 4 million Iranians plus 1 million Kurds and political opponents).....
There was also lots of nonsense about satanism, with plenty of chanting and ranting thrown in.
At the very end we also get a woman moaning in a tortured sort of way - I think the implication is that she's in hell, but I'm not sure.
I should also mention the faces of the satanists/devils, they have white faces with blank eyes which looks rather disturbing.
Veterans Borgnine and Lupino (who was also part of the cast of the awful "the food of the gods") tried to regain prestige in horror movies as Bette Davis or Joan Bennett did.But "the devil's rain" was not a good choice,by a long shot.The story is nonexistent,I dare anybody to find something looking like a plot in this flick.Pre-"Star trek" William Shattner is tortured all film long.Pre-"Saturday night fever" Travolta is featured,but where?
Then the mother -- played by an unrecognizable, tired-looking Ida Lupino -- also is forced to join the cult and put some cheap-looking eye-patches that are supposed to make her eyes black.
Well, it surely was but in some odd way it was also watchable because it had a certain stupid charm.
It also causes a cold front to inexplicably appear in that little Arizona ghost-town.
William Shatner also makes an appearance as the good guy and the rest of the cast is filled out by the likes of Tom Skerritt, Ida Lupino and John Travolta, in a small early role.
I also like Dan Dailey, who plays the boy's father.
He also introduces him to the life of hustling, stolen cars, and the like.
"); episode 2, 'Premonition,'; episode 5, with his daughter Pat, but which is really a twenty-two minute version of his film 'The Lady Vanishes' (1939) and is called 'Into Thin Air,'; this episode 7; episode 10, the amazing 'The Strange Case of Mr. Pelham,' with the goofy looking Tom Ewell, but the episode may have won an Emmy; the performance of Barry Fitzgerald in the 12th episode, 'Santa Claus and the Tenth Avenue Kid,'; episode 17, 'The Older Sister,' with a strong performance by Carmen Matthews; episode 22, 'Place of Shadows' with Mark Damon and Everett Sloane; episode 23 'Back For Christmas' with Hitch's main star, John Williams, also directed by Hitchcock; episode 26, 'Whodunit,' with John Williams and Amada Blake; the anti-drinking episode 30, 'Never Again,' with Warren Stevens and Hitch's anti-drinking speech; episode 37, 'Decoy,' with Robert Horton, Cara Williams and Frank Gorshin, and then finally, the great 'Momentum,' a 22 minute film noir with Skip Homeier and Joanne Woodward.
He also is the lead singer of a band which does a couple of songs of which I did like the beginning of one of them.
It's also a nice idea to have the Yakuza guys talking in Japanese (with subtitles)
These prehistoric women also wear makeup for some unknown reason.
They also needlessly hurt animals, killing a black panther There's a giant who goes around terrorizing everyone, and in the end, the hero ends up winning the respect of the heroine by defeating this giant with fire.
If that wasn't enough to turn you off, there's also a very annoying and monotone narrator as well.
The writing and acting to the show are also great.
I also commend Francis Cockrell and Louis Pollock for writing something so original and so riveting.
That was also the name of the main male tribesman in the 1958 flick, "Wild Women of Wongo".
That film also followed the exploits of love starved prehistoric women who set out to enslave male captives for the purpose of, well you know.
Watching that film might also lead you to the same query as posited earlier, but at least WWoW had a campy flavor and didn't take itself as seriously as this one.
"Breakdown" (Season 1, Episode 7) was the second episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" to be personally directed by the host, and, tellingly, it's also the best of the series so far.
While looking back at some footage of his wife and son, Abe sees the man who who murdered them, Henry Caine (Craig Fairbrass), and when he sees him (very badly scarred) he finds out that he was seeing light on people also.
Abe realises though that after saving the people he did, days later they commit an act that kills many others, so he knows that Sherry must die also, but in the end, he ends up dying himself and saves her as a spirit.
I also think that the first movie was more creepier!
Unfortunately, at times, White Noise 2 feels like plagiarism of not only 'The Ring', but also 'The Eye', even worse, it uses elements of both films to create inferior scares.
It was also totally un-necessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie - can you imagine a film version of "The Untouchables" with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss Eliot Ness?
There is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure; one feels that it would like to be a cold-war style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end.
We are also treated with highly annoying anti-American propaganda.
I also dislike this movie on its movie qualities.
The film often blurs in and out of focus, a visual trope of IrÃ¨ne's eyesight minus her spectacle, but also a metaphor for the blurred reality of international terrorism and the involvement of US and European secret services.
She is accompanied by a detective that happens to be trying to catch this vampire and is also lured into his cult of perverts.
We also get some S&M, a threesome, two token lesbian scenes, some awful computer effects (the slow-motion bullet is hilarious) and typical Ray movie in-jokes.
I've also seen enough of these things by now to recognize that the music itself was even reused scores from 'Haunting Fear' and 'Sorceress.'
This film could also have been called, "Drink Booze" since almost every other scene involves people drinking.
I'm also surprised by the number of user comments this thing has written about it.)
They've also got a problem with giant shrews on the island.
The thrilling conclusion is also somewhat implausible.
Drake and Josh is also awful - bad American kids' comedy is now becoming a big business.
SpongeBob has changed in a bad way, and also the humor has changed.
The idea of a comedy sex musical was not really new and was also re imagined here in Australia in the mid 90s: we saw a very similar locally made farce/musical/comedy created in 1997 called MONEYSHOT which unbeknownst to the producer with whom I later became friends, alerted him to MUSICAL which saw him flabbergasted at the similarities.
This also has the gratuitous female nudity and the now requisite lesbian couple (notice we never see a gay male couple?).
Not only did "The Butcher" turn out to be another tired "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ripoff, it was also as dull as dirt.
Now dear Indian they must have also got marriedÂ.what does one do after marriage Â but of course !
Â Basically lack of knowledge and education and also probably lots of greed for money Â which can buy one new expensive dresses and jewelry Âanother set of necessities required to make a woman completeÂor look good enough in order to turn on the husband who will eventually part with his secretions (refer movie "Look who is talking too" title sequence - where the fertilization is shown in 3-d animation Âmade the sperms look like devils Âtraveling through the fallopian tube & later only one succeed in invading the wall of the ovum ) and give the greatest opportunity to a Woman Â motherhood !..to be later kicked by them,as shown in BagbaanÂ Anyways story of Aa ab laut chalen Â So the hero wants to make quick easy money Â gets hooked on to a rich girl Â who has shown a lot of her skin , cleavage etc.- who boozes and drinks Â dances with other boys and treat him as dirt Â but greed keeps him clinging to her.
In the meanwhile Aishwarya (heroine) also lands up in foreign Â she had also come to try her luck in marriage Â the only vital reason of human birth, meets him and falls in love with him !
We also DO NOT negotiate with terrorists.
The acting is also pretty thin.
The side characters also got on my nerves.
The accents were also pretty bad.
I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.
I had read the book once before when it was first released (I had also read Angels & Demons which I enjoyed only slightly more than TDC), and a week before it's release decided to read it again to brush up on the story.
The premises in the book about equally intelligent etc male and female counterparts, also found in the relationship between Neveu and Langdon is missing.
This also happens when the beginning hints at Sophie's falling out with her grandfather and later Langdon suddenly says: what happened?
By not adding anything interesting to the script to make it an original and captivating new controversial art product, and also by choosing an actor with the aura of a good Christian family man, Howard took out the exciting atmosphere of the book.
The actors who played Fache and the bishop were also excellent, but did not have enough camera time.
There is also a moral to this story as told by Carradine that focuses on the evil nature of greed.
Naturally, there's also a chase through the woods guided by the obligatory banjo music and incompetent cinematography.
Aishwarya also exhibited her decent (and evolving) acting talent as well as graceful dancing skills.
And as you also can obviously guess,he's done nothing since then...that we know of that adds to much of his resume.
The film in the child of Ralph Lauren's son, Andrew, who also doubles as a cast member named Adam Gordon, Summer G's publicist.
It's low-budget and it's directed by Michael Winner who also wrote this garbage!
Some of the voices are John Huston (Gandalf) who also directed Annie, Otto Preminger (Elvenking) who also played in The Human Factor, Rosebud, and Skidoo.
Jules Bass, the director, also directed The Wind in the Willows, 'silverhawks,'flight of the dragons, the Thundercats, the Coneheads.
Maury laws has also done Wind in the Willows.
I also didn't think it could get any worse, but it did.
They also leave out all about the mens expedition except finding the miners body in the mine in northern Russia, and don't mention that his widow who was a lot younger than himself in 1912 is still alive in 1987 now aged 93 and gives an interview to one of the important people.
It also changes the ending of the story about at the one miners grave, where they find that the just and rocks are actually in the grave but they leave the grave untouched in the movie, which went totally contrary to the book.
Also anyone who read the book will also remember that in the book Gene Segram was not in the submersibule that they had to rush the Titanic up with to save the men in the sub.
They also left out the Hurricane that Titanic had to survive getting to New York or the 2 Russian born spies that tried to sabotage the ship drilling holes in the bottom.
It also looks very cheap, more like home movies than a TV show.
It also looks very cheap, more like home movies than a TV show.
The film follows first year law student James T. Hart (Timothy Bottoms) on a series of misadventures and anecdotes mostly revolving around his borderline obsession with one of his professors, but also dabbles in his relationship with a local woman he meets, the lives of some of his fellow students, the pressure of finals, etc., etc.
The background score is also very dull.
Script is also very dull.
I also have a question for Keb Mo.
Seeing him on the other side arguing before Macdonald Carey (also a two-time Daytime Emmy winner for "Days of Our Lives") to save that butt-ugly child of his was hilarious.
Weird direction also accompanies the players; odd angles and points of view that only distract.
We also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend, an extremist student leader, and a soldier in Vietnam.
My hopes were not only dashed, but they were also horrifically bludgeoned to death by a blunt club.
There were many holes in the plot also, like how did the orphan kid survive the Ebola virus in the first place, and why did that crazy doctor lady fake her death?
Also there is the huge coincidence that the only person who survived the Ebola virus in Uganda (the orphan) who is also the only person whose blood can be used to make a cure, miraculously is at the hospital where the breakout of the virus occurs.
also the ending was abominable with only two minutes before the bomb goes the doctor must find the little boy with the cure, kill the villain, and inform the general that she has the cure.
They also seemed as if they wanted more of the money instead of really liking the movie.
Not only was the story hard to follow, it also made no sense.
I also was amused by the extremely bad acting.
There was also not a very accurate representation of what the Ebola virus can do to a person.
Similarly, it was also hard to believe that the supposed antagonist of the movie could be disposed of by a flying bungee tunnel off the roof.
Credit where credit is due: there were some amusing parts, and I suppose there haven't been many movies that made the President of the United States seem as much like a human being as "Contagion" did (the movie also gets the prize for the closest a movie has ever come to an actual Presidential sex scene).
It`s also difficult not to notice that in real life leaders and former leaders of the IRA , Irgun , Stern gang , EOKA , PLO , UVF and ANC have all shaken hands with the American president .
It is, of course, a flashback, like the other two stories, but the story itself is also told in flashbacks.
This film, as befits its age, also features a capitalist morality and the oddly unattractive (to contemporary eyes) fashions of its times.
They are also somewhat unnecessary since they are based on Wilberforce narrating his life while pursuing a late-life romance that never existed in reality.
I would also like to give endless amounts of praise to Julia Stiles in her portrayal of Katie, she was great in a way that stood out!
The body parts were also very fake.
A silly subplot/twist also fails, as does the irritating "flashback" way the story is told.
The performances are also pretty terrible, with the exception of Jillian Swanson who does a nice job as Noelle.
While many of the cartoons fall flat, far fewer do and you also don't need to feel ashamed if your kids decide to watch it with you.
You can also throw in the triple threat, double title match featuring Benoit, Jericho, and Angle.
Not only were those radical times of change, but also very confusing times.
We are looking at a unique solution to social problems, and also how issues divide us...
It also shows that not a one of them ever went to school, either.
It's not just the contrived conflict that makes Wife Swap so painful to watch but also the fact that you know the wives are posing for the camera.
It is also a non sense to show the people from the Ministry of Culture in Cuba not knowing the musician Chano Pozo at all, and letting Arturo take away Gillespie (without official authorization)in his 'car' once he arrived in Cuba.
This movie also tires to give heartwarming "messages."
It could have shown how people who are friends grow apart as they grow up (but that might also include showing ACTUAL individualism and something that could happen in the real world rather that a bunch of annoying, clingy girls who would die without each other).
It also makes the it seem a bit to nice and immature.
It also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and make-up.
I also think it sends out a really bad message to pre-teens or younger girls; all these girls are too pretty and no one can be so popular and likable and it happens that they all get guys.
Oh, also the girl who is awarded the scholarship at the end of the movie... because she "needs it"... can afford to go shopping all the time and has a big house as well?
also, there were too many things going on at once, from a sweet sixteen party from a girl who has already had one, to a talent show, to a deaf boy who can happen to hear a girl sing.
It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?
It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.
It's also needless to mention that none of these young women has even the most remote acting talents, whatsoever.
Oh, there's also a deaf kid, Dylan (Ian Nelson) who somehow has the power to hear Yasmin singing (oh, and he can spin turntables, as well).
We learn that Wesley Crusher could also have these capacities in time.
Actually all of the characters bugged me except for Eliza Dushku's, who I liked, I also thought she did a very good job, she stops the movie from getting a lower rating.
There is also the scene where a choreographer, who is recycled out of every dance movie ever made, trains the girls.
There are also storylines that seem to go nowhere.
Apart from the gushing blood from her wound, there's also a gruesome shot of the blood filling up the bottle on the conveyor belt.
He later takes her down to his "inner sanctum", which it is cooler, but also isolated.
Its extraits of silence, eerie fractured music pieces, strange ideas, empty surroundings and odd images (and also the lead actress) are why it works.
You should also set it straight that this is not a completed film.
There are also various security and janitorial personnel on hand.
The robots also kind of reminded me of vacuum cleaners, but that was just me.
(Philosophy in the Boudoir also came to mind during In The City of Sylvia).
It also takes quite a while for the killing to start, because the makers of this vaguely likable crapfest thought it necessary to introduce us first to the utterly dull and unfunny humanoids.
The acting was also quite remarkable.
The director also felt that some sequences could be cut entirely, replaced instead by the all-knowing Voice-over from God.
L'Annulaire is the second feature film from director Diane Bertrand, who also wrote the screenplay for this adaptation of Yoko Ogawa's novel.
- The director of photography is also a photographer, which accounts for the look of the film.
There are subtle foreshadowing events that reveal her insecurities building...not only as a mother, but also as someone responsible for another life.
Left alone to fend for himself in the rubble of the Warsaw ghetto, 11 year old Alex (Jordan Kiziuk) must try to survive and also avoid the ever-present Nazi soldiers in this gripping, intensely moving film.
The producers also apparently feared, perhaps correctly, that they would lose audience share if they didn't have white faces on the screen every fifteen minutes.
She also has one of the most embarrassingly stupid scenes in recent movie memory, where she has a little monologue about how much ventriloquists turn her on.
Maybe the actors deserved more for the acting, but they also deserve a penalty for signing up such a bad script.
anyway,this movie is part of the Twisted Terror Collection also sold in a box set also entitled The Twisted Terror Collection.there are 5 other horror movies contained in the set.as for this movie itself,i'm afraid it's terminal and the prognosis is not good.
Freddy Kruger also makes jokes like that so they were nothing new.
With amusing caps on all their humorous conceits, but also making the title woman look mysterious and creepy, and looking like it had a lot of dark scenes.
I also dislike seeing women treat their husbands like children and their children like adults.
We also see Picard's dead mother for a moment in a touching scene too.
I also hated that the acting was about as convincing as the acting done in my ninth grade drama class.
The vampires at the end where not only completely lame, but also ancient beings still dress in long flowing capes.
The acting is real bad, the camera-work is also very boring and the 'action' is mostly plain stupid...
These vampires also don't want their food source (humans, apparently they never thought of raising pigs, or cows) dying off from aids.
So they get Michael Dorn, don't forget the name because they say it like 5000 times during the movie, to create a vaccine to cure HIV, but it also turns the subject into a vampire??
It also had a look like it was filmed exclusively using security cameras, which gave them an extra bit of annoyance as one moment you can't really see what's going on because you're too far, and then the next not seeing it because the camera is shaking like mad.
It also features constantly ringing rotary phones that no one decides to answer for at least four to five rings (is this to tell us the story is set in another decade, and if so, why?)
Just before Scruffy and this other dog are about to be euthanized they are adopted by this family, and I think Scruffy wins a beauty pageant and she also has a big pile of puppies.
It was also rather dull, at times though, maybe it's because I'm not a major baseball fan either so I wasn't that into that part of it.
The previews were also very misleading making it look different then what it actually was.
Because the story is absolutely meaningless, which becomes more and more obvious as it developsÂ also the "real life" killing footage is absolutely tasteless, especially because it is advertised so strongly on the front of the DVD coverÂ No wonder the critics walked out during the screening in Cannes Â (I don't think it was because of this films "controversial" qualities) Â rather the embarrassment that a film like this could reach Cannes!!!
This is for British audiences only - but if I tell you that this film also stars Christopher Biggins - and he gives an almost academy award winning performance compared to the leads in this film - then I think you will start to comprehend that this is a complete waste of 91 minutes of your life.
The script is also littered with inappropriate swear words in the wrong places, much like Spock's "they're not the hell your whales" line in Star Trek IV.
The lighting is also all over the place...massively overlit for the most part and with smoke machines pouring out pointless smoke effects through white light to give it that 80's Duran Duran video look.
Adrian Paul plays a vampire who, it seems, has been living under a rock because he seems unaware of all the contemporary slangs used by his human partner (who is also a cop).
Unfortunately, it's also satisfying that it IS the end.
The mysterious killer is also there, he most definitely resists arrest & even though Grant repeatedly shoots him he kills Phil by biting his neck.
He carries on to inform Grant that there are about 4000 Vampires worldwide & they revealed themselves to 'us' to try & live in harmony together, he also says that Vampires are genetic mutations & feed on a synthetic substitute for blood.
The breed also makes a few feeble attempts to say things about racism, trust & acceptance, you know all the clichÃ©d things one would expect.
This film also contains the worst fight scene I have ever seen.
The "super-high security" of New Angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to Matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there".
I also trust that anyone who has seen the original Zoltan Korda's "The Four Feathers" (1939) will concur that this movie does not hold a candle to the original.
The set of his hide-out is somehow graphically appealing: a solitary, broken brick wall arrangement, with atmospheric lighting, and momentary interludes: a solitary dog on a street, paper off the ground dancing in the windÂ  Music is by Zbigniew Preisner (Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" 1993, "Rouge" 1994, "The Double Life of Veronique" 1991, also "Fairy Tale: A True Story" 1997), hauntingly complements the plot.
He also did it in a very exploitative pandering manner...to the point of being grotesque.
If you didn't learn from those 4001 holocaust films that the Nazis also exterminated gypsies, gays etc.... Well the Nazis wiped out a lot of other groups beside jews too.
(native americans...also numbering in the millions) That would make a historically relevant film.
The story also has to move a bit on it's own, this one lurches ahead by having the two "friends" (...who needs enemies?
I felt it warranted this second watching and my daughter also approved of it.
MY LOVELY SAMSOON also had weak writing and no chemistry between the actors, although the leading lady had an endearing quality about her.
But I digress, the survivors of the wreck must walk out of the jungle, avoiding not only the cannibals but also the cruel slavers who would just love to get their hands on some fresh meat... and are picked off by a variety of methods.
It's a shame that the British Film industry, which has produced some of the best independent films in recent years, also produces the odd turkey.
Adult film director Gerard Damiano ("Deep Throat") directed this movie, and also appears in it.
Another porn king, Al Goldstein, also appears in the movie.
This episode also shows glimpses of Tasha's violent past on Turkana IV, and even an illusion of Jean-Luc Picard's deceased mother Yvette.
Also, it gives a musical performance every now and then in the movie, making it also a musical genre.
It was also so extremely bad that i sat and laughed through it.
There's plenty of violence in forms of kicking, hitting, punching, slashing, snapping and so on so this is no less violent than your average Seagal/Damme/Norris vehicle which always tend to share these same no brains elements but also sometimes something cinematically noteworthy and interesting.
In this movie they also totally blew away any believability.
The antagonist was also quite disappointing on appearance and acting skills.
The sea monsters, also known as humanoids, are guys in cheap costumes like the Godzilla movies.
There's also a subplot concerning Native Americans protesting the pollution of their waters, but it seems like an afterthought, as no one could really stretch a story about horny monsters out for an hour and a half.
There's also an infamously gross-out climax (no pun intended) in which a rape victim gives birth to a monstrous fish baby.
The nuns called to mind the witches of Macbeth, but the suggestion of occult, if intended, also led nowhere.
A story would have been helpful and if the director knew what direction he wanted the movie to go that would also be a good thing.
The acting was also poor at best.
I also think some of the problem is it tries to be an artistic film but doesn't have any interesting plots or story, except for the tiniest interesting part at the swimming pool.
There is also nothing I like better than to be grilled by Zorro in a condescending fashion.
The movie also has decent dialog.
He also stresses the psychological aspects of survival, focusing on keeping his spirits up to avoid the depression and lonely solitude of his situation.
More unremarkable events take place: Zoe also confides in who we're led to believe is her best friend, Boris, a stereotypical nellie.
We have the conflicted husband Ignacio (Christiane Meier) who can't conceive; the unhappy, confused and childless wife Zoe (Barbara Mori); and the husband's brother, a scruffy, ever-cool, always foul-mouthed Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona), who also just happens to be a talented artist (why are these people never accountants or claims adjusters?).
Ignacio- he says he loves his wife but seems to love men also, works a lot, is rich, loves Bach, hates moonlight swims, and as for sex, never on a Sunday... or Monday... or Tues... or Wed... or Thurs... or Friday... with a woman.
"Necronomicon" is an analogy of three short stories:1)"The Drowned"(Christophe Gans)2)"Cold"(Shusuke Kaneko)and 3)"Whispers"(Brian Yuzna).In my opinion,the first one is the best one maybe because it's highly atmospheric and a little bit creepy.It has also very appealing cast(Bruce Payne,Richard Lynch or wonderful Belinda Bauer).The second one is very weak:boring and full of uninteresting characters.I didn't enjoy it.The third one is too bizarre and also very ridiculous.It has some nice gore effects and nothing more.I suggest you to watch only the first story-"The Drowned".Don't bother with rest.My evaluation:4/10 perhaps 5/10.
There was also unnecessary sexual innuendo of a minor that was not vital to the plot and that is just wrong.
He also questions suspects in a way not really fits an FBI agent.
they lost their estate and all their money, and ended up living back in the area they were living in for Rocky I. I also could not believe how Rocky's son from Rocky IV looked about 8 years old when Rocky left to fight Drago, and then when he gets back, his son in Rocky V, (who is Sylvester Stallone's real-life son) looked about 13 & dorky!
Further issues show up when it is revealed that Rocky has suffered head trauma and further boxing can seriously injure him (watching this movie could also give you head trauma).
He also shows you how to use what is available.
There were some very funny moments (including the band, which was hilarious, and an attempted mugging of a blind man, the results of which also had me laughing) but most of the humour was lost in the drag of this plodding film.
I thought it was possible, and it was also suggested to me on either IMDb's I Need to Know or Horror message boards, that this was a trailer for Silent Scream (1980).
For some reason, I also wonder if it could have been a fire safety promo, or an antiabortion ad.
The ending was also a big disappointment with a dull so-called shocking revelation that really isn't anything like being shocking, surprising or interesting.
I also enjoy clever dialogue and deeper characterization.
What they also share with "Babylon 5" is that they are all better than "Battlestar Galactica".
I can only hope that it is also truly final.
Ludicrously similar to the (usually) teen-aged modern "role playing game" fans who constantly talked of the lack of "darkness" in some game they were involved in a decade past, but themselves had so little experience of "DAHKNESSSSSSS" that they'd have shrieked and run not only from anything remotely like one of the creepy crawlies (usually human appearing, but horrific in some psychological or spiritual way) they wanted featured and emphasized into the ground but also shielded and run or simply self-destructed from any realistic darkness that had presented itself into their unthinking little lives.
Come to think of it, they had the the same rabid reaction to anyone pointing out the fact that the last few generations have also had a cadre of black-wearing "originalists" in high school...LOL!!!
These things are bad by themselves but also taint all the earlier episodes.
He also wants Bryan to stop lying to him and once in a while actually show some responsibility.
The father also has the nerve to get angry when poor, misunderstood Bryan decides to kill a pet rabbit.
There's also a hysterically stupid monster that pops up every once in a while to rape and kill the native girls.
The sores that later appeared on Montenegro are also kinda cool (though watching him transform was just plain silly).
I also found some irony in the movie's last line uttered by Costner's "Jake", where he simply states, "We'll be back!"
The acting is generally not only slapstick but also slapdash.
I also understand the director is an African American woman.
They also wanted to indicate that the working conditions in prisons are terrible, again, they failed to truly show this--instead it came across as if the prisoners felt they shouldn't have to work at all, that they should just be allowed to loll about entertaining themselves all day.
I also understand that they had problems just getting all of the scenes that they needed to complete the picture.
I went to see it at the cinema on the strength of the trailer and persuaded my cousin that it looked better than "Dead Poets Society" which was also showing.
That was my crime, it was also my punishment.
I also saw a few comments stating that the violence is unbiblical and ungodly.
God also commanded the Isrealites to destroy nation and when they didn't kill everything in sight in the book of I Kings they were punished.
Recently, I was channel surfing and came across the RISE channel, one of several religious channels that my cable provider carries (along with Prayer Channel, EWTN) and they air not only D&G, but also Bible Man.
It also taught me that even if it's bad to lie, cheat, be prideful, or be angry, it's just fine to fight people with lightsabers!
This also could have been due to the sound at the venue where we saw it.
The music added to this as well with a very simple soundtrack that was also just there to fill the void.
it also hinted somewhat of the nastiness to come.
now, i also realise that some may say Cronenberg often favours the more direct approach and tries to test his audience with occasional bouts of realism straight out of a comic book, but i'm sorry, just because he has built up a reputation of doing things this way (which on many occasions i've hugely enjoyed), does not mean he get away with sheer sloppiness of this magnitude.
the acting, i also thought, was below par.
some of the sexual content also struck me as crass.
Among the psychics there is also Linnea Quigley (who has the usual shower scene) and she is in the finest scene of all the movie, that is overacted by most of the cast (that is not very good at it).
This movie is a must for persons who also want to make a movie in the future.
It's also, included, no kidding, as a notice right before the title sequence for WITCHTRAP.
I have to also say, that compared to a lot of direct to video digital cheapies I've seen in recent years, some of these ultra low budget filmmakers could learn a thing or two from WITCHTRAP.
It also helps that it is so dated.
There's also a surprising lack of romance here or other kitsch elements.
The Flash's costume was also rather well put together.
Isn't she a citizen of her home country (where she really will be just 'going home'), but also a citizen of the USÂwhere she can be tried and sentenced like any one of us?
Emily Stiles also gives a pretty good performance as Gwen; sure, she's way over the top--but it mostly works in context of the film.
He was also campy to the point of distraction, but again, I blame that on the screenplay.
Masturbating Woman also spots Aristocrat and Mistress and decides to continue masturbating.
Directed by the guy who we all now know as Ben Dover and starring his girlfriend, former Penthouse Pet Linzi Drew, this also makes you think there's more been filmed than the running time listed offers.
If all this painful human suffering isn't enough yet, the waters are also infested with bloodthirsty tiger sharks.
The exact same shark footage is shown no less than four times and, if my memory serves me well, these scenes also already featured in Cardona's other sea-adventure "Tintorera".
The cyclone scenes were also really cool, especially the ones of the seawall breaking and subsequent flooding.
If you think I`m apologising for the Serbs I`m not , try and track down news reports at the time , go into a libary with a large archive and look through newspaper reports from 1992 to 1994 , read accounts like The Fall Of Yugoslavia by Mish Glenny , talk to British soldiers who were there and you`ll find out little of the crimes ( And they were crimes ) were done by Serbs though they were guilty of terrible crimes elsewhere in the region   This annoyance is not only down to ignoring facts , it`s also down to director Peter Kosminsky trying to set some hidden agenda .
It should also be remembered Kosminsky made the anti war documentary THE FALKLANDS - THE UNTOLD STORY about a black and white conflict , so for him to make a pro interventionist drama about a deeply complex war is very hypocritical   WARRIORS is only worth watching to see Damien Lewis and Ioan Gruffodd when they were both unknown actors
What Odile doesn't expect when she takes up an offer to join the couple on a trip to an isolated island estate is the Count Von Karlstein(Daniel Katz)and Countess Wanda Von Karlstein(Carmen CarriÃ³n)a wealthy elite who are also into kinky sex with sado-masochistic tendencies.
Franco successfully builds their scenes, starting with the eye-contact between Odile and Mario's wife, while we also see that Odile ogles Mario, from their hotel windows..an opportunity is presented, and we watch as Mario's wife makes the first move.
Not only had it received excellent critical reviews, but I also found various postings on the Internet praising the film as a masterpiece.
We also have the scene from "Sixteen Candles" where a couple leave a dance to go sit in the backseat of broken car within the building.
Like the title says, Blockbuster video gave us a refund on the movie PLUS a free rental because they said 5 other people also complained about it.
The inevitable tragic finale is also very well-done.
This is patently untrue, and I take such comments as a highly offensive slap in the face to the REAL independent, low budget film makers who can not only deliver on a clever story (which I will admit, 13 Seconds had), but they can also get something close to a decent performance out of their actors, better sound and editing... hell, everything involved in making a movie.
The sword fighting with the dino was also way lame.
Then you also should avoid this one, because it's so utterly bad that it's not even funny.
His comment about Christopher Reeve sat badly with me, also.
But I also know well almost all the science fiction films made to date including those with serious as well as comic presentations and WALL-E does not rate well for me when compared to them.
I'll also use this opportunity to say "thanks" to Cold Bishop and the other morons for taking my texts so seriously - and making me laugh very loudly!
E-mail me if you want to read my totally altered subtitles of Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata", "Cries & Whispers", or "Passion Of Anne", but also the non-Bergman "Der Untergang".)
while i didn't mind the original The Shaggy Dog(1959),i thought this sequel was not too good.i found it way too silly and absurd,and not realistic.by that,i'm not talking about the premise,a man transforms into a dog.that i can accept as being within the confines of the movie.what i found unrealistic was how most of the characters acted and or reacted.too say there was some overacting going on would be a massive understatement.i also didn't find the characters endearing.i did however find them annoying.and the acting in general was unimpressive.and i found the ending abrupt with no real resolution.i'd say this would be a good family movie,a family comprised of only 3 year olds.maybe they ran out of money or time.whatever.this film had none of the fun or charm of the original.for me,The Shaggy D.A.is a weak 3/10
It also shows us how kids can easily be influenced in what they think is right.
Side-note: There's also a blooper played at the end of the credits, nothing that great but worth a gander.
The story is unbelievable, which is hardly a problem in a horror anthology, but it is also poorly acted and very dull, which is a major problem.
The final part of the film, "The General", is pretty bad but also entertaining.
This film also had flashbacks to scenes that either happened twenty seconds ago, had no significance, or weren't even in the movie to begin with.
The movie is very well put together, the editing is surprisingly good and the directing is also pretty solid.
The film is based on the play by David Dean Bottrell and Jessie Jones, who also wrote the jumbled, unorganized screenplay.
There is also a rich loudmouth Cousin (Toni Braxton) and I already mentioned the gaseous Rev.
In a year that saw other notable and lauded Westerns also released {Stagecoach, Jesse James and Destry Rides Again} give credit where credit is due, Dodge City deserves its place amongst those offerings.
It also felt out of place (Meaning, the shouldn't have ever aired on Nick).
The other cast members are also so bland and boring.
Here, Flynn takes charge in a Western as sheriff of a seedy cattle town in dusty Kansas as he attempts to overthrow the corrupt cattle buyers that also run the town of Dodge City.
It also happens to be produced by Linwoods brother Darryl L Neverson and Agustin.
Writer-director John Sayles is good, also, as Klenck's coke companion.
This also, but slightly more exclusively, involved a has-been actress ignominiously doing very little for the money (Gloria Grahame in that particular instance).
Although I gave this movie a 1 because the director put in the horror Genre I couldn't help but laugh at the awful acting the saddest most hilarious part about this movie is that the best actors were the crazy Hillbillies that beat the hell out of Harding speaking harding the other characters had some sort of hatred for this man because if you pay attention the three phrases you hear most in the movie are "Harding your an a**hole" "Hey Harding F*ck you" "Harding acts like a 5 year old" The movie also has randomly disappearing characters,Name Changes,obvious picture cropping,misleading plot,awful sounds,windows that break but actually are just copy and pasted triangles flying through the air well anyway if you watch this you will be sure to laugh its a riot trust me!
I also found the actors choking on their lines more than I was choking on that slice of bread.
A stranger with a hodge-podge English accent who's a drifter "in these parts" also gives the reporter a cryptic warning about darkness and evil.
It also enjoys a good witty script and wonderful performances from Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland as well as from the rest of the cast.
It was also interesting to see a host of a show I enjoy called "Cities of the Underworld" on the History Channel have a bit part here.
not only does this film manages to have no plot, it also has some of the most awful dialogs i've seen.
Burton is also too old for the part, he was only 43 during filming but looks more like 50.
(and speaking of porn,the story might even be better).pointless,gore,lame dialogue.the whole thing is one big long boring mess.with no real beginning,middle or end.not only is there no conceivable story,there also a pointless non subplot that attempts to tie into the main non story.i can't see who the target audience would be for this particular movie.but everybody has their own different taste.however,this is added to my list of worst movies i have ever seen.this gets the big goose egg.definitely not recommended.but then,what do i know?
Eye Candy: Carlee Baker, Eryn Joslyn, Eve Mauro, and Robin Sydney all provide T&A (Robin I saw topless before in "Big Bad Wolf", the other three are baring for the first time) There's also nudity in some of the extras (noted with an asterisk)   My Grade: D+   DVD Extras: Optional Intro by Al Jourgensen; commentary with Director Zach Passero, Actresses Robin Sydney, Carlee Baker, & actor Justin Stone; 19 & a half minutes of bloopers & deleted scenes*; photo gallery; Advanced trailer* & theatrical trailer* for this film; and Trailers for "The Oracle", "Love me deadly"*, "Blood Sisters", & "Witchery"*
also there is a scene where a feminine dude literally cries (while running) at the camera for five whole minutes and you my mouth was open the whole time in shock.
Robin Dunne was also poor.
I haven't seen "American Psycho II" yet, but no doubt his laid back "cool" style has ruined that film also.
This movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech.
Of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video.
The film is also misstated: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that.
This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review!
There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie?
Dodge City also represents the high point (or should that be low point?)
Dodge City also features one of the weaker Alan Hale sidekick roles.
Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also.
You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont... Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother.
Kathryn also wants to get revenge with Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school assembly.
Other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students.
The film also had a major problem of sexualised 15/16-years-old.
Then the dialogue is also crap.
And despite being also always formulaic they yet always felt like something new and original.
This movie also feels totally fresh, even though it features all of the formulaic elements, such as a saloon-fight, cattle-driving, card-playing, a hero who becomes sheriff, scruffy looking villains and stuff like that.
However when the movie starts to take form and Errol Flynn gets his sheriff-badge, the movie becomes interesting and also totally likable to watch.
The role is more demanding than his usual swashbuckling type of role and he already sort of shows in this movie that he also knew how to act more seriously.
It's well done and makes sure that it's never featured too prominently into the movie but it also at the same time doesn't make a redundant impression.
It also definitely makes sure that this movie doesn't feel as much outdated as with many other '30's and '40's, black & white westerns, is the case.
The musical score by Max Steiner is also quite good.
There was actually another craze that swept the western world during the early part of the decade also; What was it you may ask?
It was inevitable of course that these seemingly semi-mystical beings would break out into other entertainment mediums also.
Unfortunately, our veteran ninja is also being hotly pursued by a fellow ninja from his clan (Kosugi) who is incessantly intent on sending him to the great beyond.
I also wonder why here in the States we had to wait until September of 2002 to see it when the first comments about it, from a viewer in Turkey, are from February!
And also, I hate the movie!!!
Because, it wasn't a fantastic movie trial and also a political propaganda!
The whole movie is also very zany, with childish humor (like teletubbies).
Errol Flynn rides to his first western in this Technicolor movie from 1939.Michael Curtiz' Dodge City is a fantastic western.Flynn plays Wade Hatton who has to safe the city where violence flourishes.It is ran by the villainous Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabot).He runs the city with the ways of a dictator telling what to do and what to say.The citizens are helpless until Wade comes to safe the day.There is also a lady along.She's Abbie Irving, played by who else but the wonderful Olivia De Havilland.Soon there might be romance that flourishes.Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland work great together in this film as they always did.Whether they were in the Sherwood forest or in a western town, there was always chemistry between them.Bruce Cabot makes a fine villain.Alan Hale brings some comedy to the picture playing Rusty Hart.The brilliant Henry Travers is Dr.Irving.I must also mention the kid Bobs Watson, who plays Harry Cole.The scenes with him are the most moving in this film.I really enjoyed this western story.They should make more movies like this today.
For politicians to pretend otherwise for the sake of mobilizing ignorant voters is disingenuous, just like this movie's insistence that abortion is a politically significant issue on the national level, one that divides our political spectrum, is also disingenuous.
Subtler changes in party platforms during this time are also ignored.
It's also a bit dubious because he seems awfully fey about it all.
He is also a romantic, and in this film (as in a number of others) Flynn's love interest is played by Olivia de Havilland.
His death scene in BOYS TOWN is almost legendary and he was also the cute little goner in ON BORROWED TIME--it seems his specialty was dying on film!
There is also a golf bit that is supposed to be funny - it may have been a little funny the first time but when they pulled the same bit at the end all it did was elicit eye-rolling moans in our little audience.
It would have also allowed for a more imaginative application of the intriguing premise as well as provided greater opportunities for improved imagery, which quite frankly sucks here.
It was also extraordinarily fortunate that Agent McGregor (Hemingway), who had never attempted rock climbing in her life before this trip, was so instantly adept at it that her next climb was a two hundred foot vertical climb without tether.
He just threw this away along to work on an oil rig which he hates also and ends up quitting.
You can also tell Bobby is a loner because every time something big happens he goes off by himself and gets drunk.
And to top off all of this awfulness, it also looks horrid.
There are also elements from Happy Feet, and some other recent movies.
i didn't like this movie at all.i think it's supposed to be a parody of March of the Penguins.but for me,it just wasn't funny.plus,i felt the humour consisted of mostly vulgar,crude language.there's a lot of the F-bomb(among other words) dropped here.this definitely isn't for kids.but i also just found it boring.i actually couldn't watch it all,because i found it too slow.as for the crude language,that doesn't always bother me,but i just found it gratuitous and too frequent.i don't think you always need to have swears to make things funny.it's not for every taste,that's for sure.if you don't mind a lot of very crude language,you might want to check this one out.for me,Farce of the Penguins is a 1/10
I also found Tracy Morgan's role to be fun as well.
I know, I know--how stupid of me for not picking up on the "Full House" alumni that are also in the credits.
Meanwhile, as the females wait, there's also a lot of talk about sexual relationships back at the breeding grounds, especially between Melissa and Vicki.
Another thing, you guessed it, there are some fart jokes, which are also lame.
Not only is the humour severely lacking, the plot is also dull, it never improves along the way.
Harry Crumb is also not Candy's best film by a long shot and a good deal of the slapstick humor falls flat.
Besides his music capturing all the heat, dust and passion of the bullring the composer also incorporates into his score the sumptuous traditional Spanish guitar melody "Romance D'Amour".
I think its also safe to say that Mort Ransen should not be acting.
What the story tellers also fail to mention is that they weren't coming forth about the abuse (if that's what they thought it was then) to anyone.
the delivery also gets real annoying after awhile.
There were also some reenacted moments concerning the Bounty and they have the same stilted and uninteresting quality you would expect for a non-theatrical release.
It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power.
I'm also the sort of guy who makes a note of who the producer , director and screenwriter is .
Besides, director William Friedkin is also to blame, if anything for his bland, indifferent direction.
"Body Count" also provides an opportunity to see David Caruso doing much better work.
Some of the soundtrack music is also better than routine.
Apparently there was also the voices of Jon Lovitz, and, in his last film before his death, Rear Window and It's a Wonderful star James Stewart.
It has plenty of unintentional laughs also, and is rather entertaining at moments.
To prove that first impressions aren't always everything, we also have Errol Flynn giving his screen debut, in a performance that doesn't show any signs of the charisma and appeal Flynn would have only two years later in "Captain Blood".
It also had a decent script.
Not only is this pure unadulterated propaganda crap, it's also EXTREMELY dated and isn't worth watching due to it's horrendous use of fear tactics.
As the second cinematic presentation of the 1789 mutiny aboard the BountyÂthe first was also made in Australia in 1916Âthis film is required viewing for anyone interested in that historical chapter.
A pre-credits crawl announces the documentary and travelogue endeavor, to follow in the Bounty's wake: promising this is the first of a series from Expeditionary Films that should also entertain.
It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome.
There are others that non-readers will also notice because they make so little sense to the story of the film and this is where the problem lies; in trying to make a faithful adaptation of the small details the screenwriter has forgotten to put any plot in.
Oh, Alan Turing is also considered the founder of computer science -- but f*** that let's just make a piece of mindless spooge.
He was also the founder of modern day computers and artificial intelligence (just Google 'Turing Test').
It probably pitches like it could be funny (and even successful), but it falls apart as a film, completely...If you understand this, then you also understand it sounds more like an off-Broadway play...As a matter of fact (and the ore I think about it), this 'movie' would probably do very well in a live theatrical format...Heck, it could take on a life of its own and become syndicated, making the US cities tour, complete with building sized promos appearing in each city months before it premiers to build the anticipation...I'm certain performing arts centers all over the country will sell out all the shows quickly as anticipation grows and of course the wealthy season ticket holders would let everyone know they'll be busy on Friday evening, because they will be at the 'premier' of that play...'The Grand'...As a matter of fact, the more 'I' think about it, given the opportunity; 'I'd' pitch it!
It is also worth watching to see the germs of stardom in Errol Flynn.
Godmoney not only copies from other GOOD movies, but also includes some very mediocre acting.
Thus, here it's easier to pick apart his feigned cockney accent, as well as co star Warren Clarke, who'd also become more well known in time.
Some hammy writing/acting also lowers the tone, and a tendency to veer into theatrical operatics loses it some points.
In the second part, Nukie gets to know some talking monkeys, humorous tribesmen and their cute kids, a nun, a drunk, and Steve Railsback (probably also drunk).
OK back in 90whatever in the UK,the episodes of different series were not shown a year apart in order to catch up with the years and also since I didn't have a TV for most of 94/95 I ended up seeing episodes either on video or in whatever order they were on TV,so I saw them in totally the wrong order and never knew which ones were series 1,2,3 or 4 until 10 years later when I found an episode guide online.
I'm also caught off guard as to how many reviews IMDb has for for NUKIE.
I also don't remember Hargats house being set a flame.
This also means, they put in the attack/house fire to replace the Christmas holiday when Scrimgeour visits.
The ending also seems to have been completely misunderstood, the agony in the book being Harry physically cannot move to protect his mentor.
Evil plot Quitich cup match, unless that is the match shown in the movie but you couldn't tell The alterations in the film are also a huge let down.
IMO this episode also has some of the best guest-actor casting in the series.
Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say: "They could be anything"!!!
MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD  So, not only did they destroy the capodopera that this movie could have been, but they also didn't set up the next movie/s.
Too little Tom Riddle also.
Matt Damon is also very funny.
The story line was also ridiculously clichÃ©d, lacking any real original twists.
She also acts WAY out of character by falling in love with a black man.
This might also explain why the audience is also forced to sit through not one two entire songs sung by Caffaro in a Las Vegas style review.)
The cast includes some of the top stars of 1976(year of release) Micheal Caine, Donald Sutherland,Robert Duval,Donald Pleasance,Larry Hagman & Treat William, also Jenny Aguiter & Jean Marsh plus others.
The early part of the film also goes way over the top in its laboured efforts to show us that Michael Caine and co are non-Nazi, honourable Germans.
I also love the frogs falling from the sky scene and I love Scully's need to explain it somehow and showing up to tell Mulder about the tornadoes that could have picked them up and dropped them down on top of them.
These scenes are relatively effective and the killer does have an ability to appear menacing, but there are also some ludicrous scenes thrown in and some weird, unexplained stuff, and fantastic leaps of logic needed when the end is revealed.
There is also some guy in a mask running people off of the road.
I also can not fathom how they chose such horrible and ugly actors to bring it to life.
In this case, it's not sufficient that the protagonists be wealthy, landed, titled and surrounded by boatloads of friends, they also need to find themselves at the center of an international cabal (w/o even getting out of bed), who wear clock-face masks, and generally behave like superheros on behalf of Dear Old Britain.
The dialog was also okay, but not wonderful.
Apparently the producers (who also happen to be the 3 lead actors) worked for years to secure financing and otherwise make this project happen.
We only get two CGI top-shots of the Mars-based Alpha City in the beginning and the end of the movie, and we also see some actors stumbling around on a pile of red sand.
There's also supposed to be a big successful mining-company on Mars, but all we see is three man drilling outside.
Olivier Gruner fails to impress the viewer as the protagonist Caution Templer, a lawman who must defend himself from attackers while investigating the mysterious death of his brother (also a lawman) on the Martian outpost Alpha City.
His brother, also a keeper, has been murdered on Mars, where the company has a mining interest.
However, I also believe that both Chad Allen and the actor that played Lester were great as well.
It also has very little to completely nothing to do with the original Stephen King short story (this film was released as a second sequel to SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK, so go figure...).
Faith Ford is adequate in this non-comedic role and is the most talented of the cast that also features Max Perlich, Clayton Rohner, Jennifer O'Dell and Daminan Chapa.
But make no mistake, while outwardly a horror film, this is also a sexploitation film equally.
Inevitably that is also used for a sexual encounter, and it's one that's more than strange.
"Buyu" also features shameless sexism and absolutely sick sequences, such as women being raped by spirits-no, I'm not making that up!
Plenty has been written about the 'Fog of War'--that is, the fact that when the bullets start flying, not only do politics go out the window (regrettably the politics seems to have gone out the window when the film cameras started rolling as well), but so also do the best laid plans and what small levels of good sense there were to begin with.
You can also, as so well shown in the film, be gay and religious at the same time.
It is also a stunning misrepresentation of what happened in Somalia.
Aideed, who was certainly a ruthless and dangerous man but also just one of several clan leaders competing for power in the country, was blamed for all Somalia's troubles.
Arsenio Hall's segment and the seductive women segment are also fairly entertaining.
It is also true that some crew members were loyal to the London government (which had to be build up) and that they refused to give their ships to the Vichy government.
The silly torture scene at the end is also out of character for him.
There was also a crack about what type of watch Bond wears:  BOND: "Did you know that I'm a gaybo?"
The story was so silly it also made me sick.
It may also be because the chase scenes with Will Ferrell seemed flat and uninspired, both as a science fiction and comedy plot point.
I found the humor to be pretty juvenile, which would make it great for kids except that the juvenile humor also has adult themes.
Judith Light was fantastic in a subtle and deep performance as the head of a house that gives those with addiction issues, and who also happen to be gay, a chance to find themselves.
There is no doubt it will join the class ("Bewitched"-which Will Ferrell also was in, "Dukes of Hazard" and "Wild Wild West") of films so bad that they make "The Brady Bunch Movie" look like the "Ben-Hur" of the genre.
Dino poop and gross insect infections also get high regard.
As the professor sets off to work, he and his wife are approached by their elderly neighbor Mrs. Niemoller who complains timidly that the boys in the neighborhood, including Timmy, make too much noise when they play and also heedlessly trample her garden.
In his stunned grief he turns to drink and is also given solace by a colleague (Nancy Davis), a war widow who empathizes with his loss.
At a pinch ,you might find something "polanskiesque" in this turkey:the conspiracy against a lonesome hero ,like in his masterful "Rosemary's baby' or "the tenant" ;the claustrophobia which is present in almost all Polanski's canon,not only the two mentioned works ,but also "repulsion" "cul de sac" "knife in the water" "death and the maiden" ,all these stories which happen "in camera".
Richard Grieco and Jamie Pressley are also wasted in this film, although Grieco is humorous at times.
Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original Â but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two.
Oh ya, I almost forgot, Mothra and the twins (or, as it seems this time "mothra/the twins") also show up a few times for no apparent reason.
Our ex-android friend is the hired killer sent to even up for the bad guys, and there's also a lot of time wasted on another character who is Molly Ringwald's (ex?)
The story is a beautiful discussion of both the goodness and healing qualities of the Christian faith, while also exploring the brittle, rigid quality that faith by rules brings to the table.
I also find it extremely utopic and epic, yet it is your choice to watch it or not.
Longer than the average Warner cartoon, 'Old Glory' is also notable for its complete lack of gags.
TIDBIT - Campanella and Pankin, who appear in "Hangar 18", also starred in "Earthbound", another movie on the same sci-fi tangent released a year later by Sunn International.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Dolph Lundgren plays a captain called John Foster in this DVD sci-fi film, who's also one of a select group of people in 2209 Los Angeles who is 'genetically unique' and has an immune system that can fend off the effects of a deadly bacteria which has come off some meteorites that have crashed on earth and caused death and disease amongst the people.
As if that alone wasn't enough, they also added typical Japanese corniness: psychotic killers with environmental nonsense ideology and how the entire human race should be purged.
This also could've provided many interesting possibilities, such as the Kira cult becoming involved in the plot, or characters such as Misa and Ryuk playing new roles and continuing to develop.
Cinematography is also a step down, losing the smooth, rich clarity of the Death Note movies for a dry and altogether bland visual style.
I also laughed aloud at several of L's displays of quirkiness, and flushed with joy at the rare but delicious moments of Death-Note-style "intellectual pwnage."
They have also stereotyped the French enough to call it discrimination.
I didn't dislike this film, but also found it to be very slight and very forgettable.
It also becomes apparent through the lead actor's (Shinya Tsukamoto) interview that director Shimizu gave his actors little to no direction which he politely (and somewhat embarrassedly) tries to spin as as a good thing but reveals that he (as a director himself) wonders why there was so little thought and effort behind this project.
Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him, he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also.
And just like the first VAMPIRES, this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect.
He's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight (is almost a sequel of Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starred by James Woods), Derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad acting also) a teenager without experience, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a particular vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another expert vampire hunter.
It was also piled high with errors in detail that just irritated me.
The romance that appears in the film is also laughable and totally unnecessary.
i also learnt that if you are shot then there are no bullet holes and no blood.
There was also an inconsistent use of subtitles in the film whenever a character wrote in another language.
Not only did the filmmaker used the basis of The Shunned House for the movie but he also used Music of Eric Zahn and Dreams of the Witchhouse.
Lovecraft stories into one horror anthology, entirely taking place in one and the same house setting, is definitely ambitious and original, but at the same time also hazardous and unrewarding.
The stories, and thus also the suspense, are too often abruptly cut off to return to the present day main characters and their continuous uninteresting bickering.
The problem is that here, as in all storytelling, a tragic ending must also be a satisfying one for the audience.
At the same time, the crew of the Enterprise is worried since they lost contact with Kirk and the officials on the planet say they have no idea where he is but also obviously hinder the investigation.
The scenes of Kirk with Odona on the empty duplicate copy of the Enterprise on Gideon also don't make much sense especially when you consider that the planet is supposed to be chronically overpopulated.
The ending was very ambiguous with a terrible song that also opens the film.
It's a shame that this is just another entry in an overpopulated genre too, as the film features a good cult cast - Rosalba Neri is one of my very favourite actresses, and the film also features the likes of Maria Schell and Maria Rohm, as well as the great Herbert Lom; but the cast considered, this is still a rubbish film and I wont be recommending it!
Simon is also not aware his brother Peter is dead.
Can one really hold anything against that once famous film critique who said that the new German film did not only start with Fassbinder, but also ended with him?
There's also a lot of variation in this questionable sub genre of cult-cinema - largely determined by how old they are - as most of them are really nasty and exploitative whereas some (the pioneers mainly) are more sensual and emphasizing on the drama-elements.
The attempts at humour are forced, painfully at times, the supporting cast also exaggerate their playing, none more so than the choice hunk of ham that is Zero Mostel as the movie moves episodically and elephantinely to its even more improbable ending (a safe-deposit bank employee gets hypnotised by the floor-selection buttons in a lift...!).
Although this was also an uninteresting and cold film, it had something of a story in it.
Madchen Amick also performs greatly, yet can't save the script, either.
I also don't like the voice acting.
I must say though the sound effects for when they are fighting are top notch, the sound effects are so crisp and satisfying and ACTUALLY sound like punches not "PHsHHH" slashing noises from FUNImation... also out of the 3 Pioneer movies "Dead Zone, The Worlds Strongest" and "Tree Of Might" this one has the most stupidest lines!
Oh yeah -- and there's a lethal, clawed, slime-drooling, steam-expelling extraterrestrial subterranean creature the pair also uncover and do their best to protect from the conglomerate's vile, greedy clutches.
The Japanese contact the wise-talking Eddie and he assures them that he was not only stationed in the Canal Zone during his six years in the Army but also that he knows a sergeant who can get him to the plans to the zone.
Now, "Betrayal from the East" not only kills off both Peggy (she dies in a sauna bath) but also the chief Japanese villain (Chinese actor Richard Loo) kills Eddie just as G-2 breaks down the door.
It's also graced by a dumb plot, and bad acting.
Another thing, the cops are also not treated nicely in the movie.
The film also never notes the sharp irony that Dudikoff really is not a good guy, in that he's just as insane as the villain of the movie.
They are also funny, and especially one of them lasts long.
The dialogue is snappy in parts, but also lame in places.
He is also the best thing about this movie.
The horrid death, which conveniently isn't shown to us for the sake of a PG-13 rating (yet more was shown in the previous movie, which was also rated PG-13), just happens to occur in Astoria, Oregon, the far and distant land where Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) have escaped to all the way from Seattle.
It also manages to give sequels an even worse name than they already have.
All were also emancipated from any studio intervention which more often than not can destroy a director's vision.
At least two of the Friday the 13th sequels surpass the original and if you are talking non horror, then you can also add films like Lethal Weapon 2, Bourne Supremacy and of course classics like Terminator 2, Aliens, Godfather II and Empire Strikes Back to the list of sequels that either equaled or surpassed the original.
I could go on and on with the HOLES in this POS movie....I was a big fan of the first Ring and also the original RINGU, but this was just TRASH!
Legend of Bigfoot (1976, not to be confused with Capture of Bigfoot -- 1979, which also went by that title) was so bad I couldn't finish it.
Oh, and there's some other fine upstanding campers in the area, and the girl, after a fine show of cellulite, dresses up in a red frilly skirt and shorty top, yecch....and I think she's also got on patent leather shoes and white knee-socks.
You can also find Piper Perabo in "The I Inside" but I doubt you'll be interested after all I've said.
This movie was also a lost opportunity for Hollywood to make some self-sarcasm of itself, since it is a powerful "system" and the Dukes could have taken some yeeehaaas against it.
It's also interesting to consider that a spirits ego may be capable of realizing its spirit, and maybe it was meant to realize more than just that, maybe it was meant to realize itself as the spirits instrument to experiencing a projection of individuation, which would further assume that the spirit is singular, and this would align with what could be considered as god, or maybe it's just something that couldn't otherwise be explained as the answer to life due to the bounds of our existence.
There are also some Walruses?
?--that are also going to croak because I spent and extra two minutes in the shower this morning.
I'm not sure how much bear death is on my hands..I do drive a Civic, but I also take long showers.
The sound is also poorly edited, and, while I can not be SURE, I would guess that many of the sounds did not occur as shown in the film (pull my flipper??!!)
There were also subtle problems such as some of the film was not properly edited to make it feel like it fit in the movie as the lighting was off and it seemed the purpose of it was to purely drag the film on.
Simon deadly injures his brother and covers it as a car crash ( In which he was also involved).
The one thing I didn't understand was why Simon Cable's mother was never shown.There was only a quick mention of her being dead.His father also died but later appeared in visions along with his dead brother and his girlfriend.
At one point in the movie he felt he was lost in a never ending confusing void and the one doctor who was also his father was telling him he died.The spooky thing about the ending is that it gets you thinking about what lays ahead after our own death.
I was also surprised to see the gushing reviews that this rather clichÃ© film garnered from some major critics.
Shrek 1 & 2, as with all Dreamworks animation, are bent on bombarding the audience with modern pop culture references ad nauseum -- partially because the creators believe such recycling is humorous, but also I suspect because they understand, smartly, that modern audiences desperately sop up pop references as a means of affirming their own image of themselves.
Mixed climbing, acceptable, but the movie called him an ice climber (which is also different from alpining, which is what hiking in the Himalayas would be).
Bugs also seems excessively brash and obnoxious in this cartoon, from his loud "Am I the first to arrive" routine at the beginning of the cartoon to his frenzied cat-calling at the end.
Finally, fans of "what in the world" moments should also keep an eye out for the scene where Brian Keith, being photographed by terrorists, gives them the fingerÂwith his ring finger!
It also has much the same agenda as "Clueless" of taking a gentle poke at affluent society's rigid class system and wafer-thin "caring about the environment" values.
I'll be expecting Jackie Chen's next performance, and I'll also try to avoid the production from others in the crew..
And Emily's boss doesn't seem too bright to accept her plan so uncritically and also to form a small team to back her up!
Ariel was Yaakov's best friend, a brilliant scholar who is being groomed as the Rebbe's successor, and also the future bridegroom in a just-arranged marriage to the daughter of a rabbi in Paris.
She also meets Mara (Tracy Pollan), Yaakov's fiancÃ©e, who tells Emily about her (Mara's) sordid past and how Yaakov found her, took her in, and later proposed to her.
Cool quotes as these can also be found (in Elizabeth Â not Arn!
Simon starts out in hospital in 2002, being a victim, presumably of inhaling poisonous fumes while working in the house (but it is also suggested that this might be a poisoning attempt by his wife Anna).
The movie depicts several religious themes, most clearly the violent clash between Christianity and Islam but also the clash between domestic Swedish Christianity and the medieval swedes.
Music  I am a person that is very fond of classical music, and have also interest in orchestral music in movies.
I realize they can become invisible and also have some other powers in their little alien bag of tricks, but you take one look at them and you just feel like a group of military folks (even ones like the misfits we so clearly have here) ought to have been ransacked these aliens in and out of this secluded island in about 5 minutes.
I have also heard the director valiantly try to explain every one of the incalculable plot holes in the movie.
That's also a horribly stupid answer and it's bad story telling.
The director also thought he was being clever giving subtle clues that maybe Marie was a little nutty herself and that's great, but it's not clever when the killer is introduced as clearly a totally separate entity.
It turns out that the main character has multiple personalities and is also the killer, or something to that effect.
The Frenchman is also there, observing the scene and introduces himself as an insurance agent.
The lead as a little girl and an a young teen were also quite cute as were the other young people.
I was also interested in seeing Pepe Bojorquez's first film.
There's also a subplot about psychic powers that just doesn't go anywhere.
In this one we actually see the other dimension and also we see the evil demons or spirits in physical form.
(Hey - that also describes the attire.)
We are also supposed to accept that a considerable amount of time passes over the course of the film, but his character never looks or sounds any older.
Not only is this laughter hard to justify from a story-telling standpoint, it's also hard to accept it as believable.
In many of the shots, the animation was also just *slightly* too slow to feel natural.
It is also worth mentioning that a substantial portion of the dialog in the film consisted of single words.
They also liked to answer questions with single word answers, whenever possible.
There are also a number of similarities to The Butterfly Effect (2004).
Richter also manages an eerie mood of displacement throughout the film.
It's also worth briefly mentioning the fantastic music by Nicholas Pike, as it does much to enhance the mood.
I would also encourage people to view some of the other fan films out there.
I am filled with much anger and disgust, and also filled with thoughts of genocide.
For me the highlight is Charlie Drake failing to deliver a cake but it's also fun to see Diana Dors sending herself up - as she used to in later life when she lost her slender shape - in fact I just cannot watch this film without getting a very broad grin on my face.
who has also fallen victim to the evils of drink.
Well there are also two escapees from one of Jack Kerouac's bad dreams who are also suspects and a family friend who is a drug dealer with guilt feelings.
Happily, Laura Linney-- proving the old adage that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger-- earned an Oscar nomination for her work in her next project, giving an extraordinary performance in an extraordinary film, `You Can Count On Me,' which was also one of the best films of that year.
The film is notable for the fact that it was written by and stars Jacinto Molina; also known as Paul Naschy, who is apparently a big name in Spanish horror cinema, although this the first film that I've seen from him.
La Maldicion de la Bestia also contains a few scenes of nudity and an attempted rape, too.
This film also contains probably the worst day-for-night shots I've ever seen.
A very exhilarating and pleasantly deranged exploitation highlight, you'd expect, especially if you also throw in some lurid vampire women in a cave, evil Tibetan smugglers and an ancient myth about Genghis Kahn (*).
Unless I'm mistaken, I also didn't spot any Yetis, Sasquatches, Bigfoots or whatever type of snowy monsters until very late in the film.
However, there are also times when one should not make the mistake of confusing the lowering of personal standards in order to enjoy what might not be a very good film, with just plain, out-and-out stupidity.
A lack of direction for Dempsey was apparent, also.
That was a part of the "crime" and also a part of the "punishment."
Besides being badly written, poorly acted, weakly directed and cheesy, this film is also unimaginably boring!
The story is also pretty non-existent and incoherent as hell.
Wasn't he also responsible for the more recent but equally stinking pile of garbage "Feardotcom"?
Unfortunately this apparently includes 99.9% of typical American audiences who also believe that 'Father knows best' and 'Leave it to Beaver' factually depicted typical American family units.
And it also made me sad for the actors.
I guess she also needed the money wanted to finish and go home because like everybody else, her acting was extremely cheesy.
I'd also read comments about the state of her lips and thought it was just internet geeks going overboard, but they are really big now, significantly moreso than in her trek role, I think she needs to ease off on the collagen before they take over her face, they're starting to look like she was beaten up.
I also recall having a nightmare about the wailing (no pun intended) theme song: "Looking for a frieeeeeend.
But what it shows also is that true friendship can overcome many an adversity, misunderstanding, and even time.The first movie about "Male-bonding" to come out of Bollywood!
The movie also includes a few characters that have only a few scenes to play but they play them well, and they ALL add value to the story.
I also love the way the story did not portray a clichÃ©d relationship between an older women, and younger man, and how they kept both the characters dignity in tact.
Oh yes, Shatner also has a totally forced romance with the boy's mom (naturally, Kolden plays a fatherless child) Whale of a Tale is actually pretty funny if you can accept it as tongue in cheek.
The mayor has a beautiful, intelligent daughter who serves as a topnotch public defender but who is also being courted by a top law firm.
Some of the 'emotional' reactions, as well as actions, by these actors is also over the top.
Joaquin Pheonix in Ladder 64, but he also qualifies in the subgroup of the young family man who gets killed.
I am also glad to see that some of the film companies are starting to expand into other more controversial subjects about the morays and tabu's because I find not only is the films entertaining but I have learned a lot more about the culture and it's people.
"The Bostonians" still remains a politically offensive minor effort easily overlooked because it also commits the crime of being dull.
It's also a puzzle as to why did a talented man of the stature of Walter Matthau ever saw in the possibility of this turkey having any future.
this 90 minute movie has a plot that could either have been resolved in 15 minutes but it also had the plot to stage an entire 90 minute movie if they did it correctly.
And the pizza-faced monster effects which created by Rino Carboni are not only simply cheap but also problematically unrealistic; at least his face seems to be too swollen to eat raw human fresh.
So much attention being paid to not only the materialistic side of the film but also the character depth.
Tonino Ricci is certainly one of the worst Italian film-makers, also responsible of the terrible post-atomic romp "Rush".
The show's plots also leave a lot to be desired.
The greatest of these was the last that he wrote - THE MASK OF DEMETRIOS (also called A COFFIN FOR DEMETRIOS) which Greenstreet, Lorre, and Zachary Scott turned into one of the best portraits of a totally amoral criminal in cinema.
Dil Chahata Hai also has an incredible storyline of interweaving 3 different storylines into one big picture of life in progression.
What we also get is a lopsided sermon on the hard-line lessons of the Bible, without much in the way of counterpoint.
In the end, its all different and the community's "chieftain" changed his mind also - again it is pretty unclear why... Was it all Chernobyl?
They also cut tongues of people.
I was also a skateboard freak at the time as were a lot of the punks.
The movie also was complimented with great acting.
is very pleasant and you also get a nice scenery of Sydney, Australia.
Basically an outer space remake of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, as just about everyone else has noticed, this also manages to include elements of THE THING, PRINCE OF DARKNESS and non-Carpenter sci-fi films like ALIENS and SPECIES (also with Henstridge in the lead).
He also wrote "Ghosts of Mars" (referred to as GOM from now on), which sucks even more.
There's also an automatic rifle, which I've forgotten the name of.
What also bothers me are flashback scenes that aren't called for.
It also does not help recruiting for the Submarine fleet.
Of course, anyone who reads the comics will also notice that the League's origin is completely different.
The Weather Man, while also lame, did pose a worthy threat to humanity, and the JLA's actions in dealing with him were entertaining.
... yet it also has some very sad moments which genuinely touches the heart!
I also became a fan of Dimple Kapadia after watching this movie.
Good thing he's also found Quetzalcoatl, the legendary Aztec serpent/bird god, and has learned that the creature will track down and kill whoever is in unwitting possession of one of its feathers.
It is also an absurd time so show a villainous Pakistan when Indo-Pak diplomatic ties are underway.
The audience doesn't care, nor did the original distributer "Senator Film" who also happens to be a co-producer of the film.
And there is also for Peter as for Thomas nothing more as a filmmaker then their very funny first movies.
While this is true, it is also a highly artistic movie that never misses a beat or an opportunity for depth.
May Robson is also very amusing as "Granna", the ancient frontier woman who won't be left behind and who nurses a maternal affection for the aging Brennan character.
B western regular Raymond Hatton also puts in a patented supporting performance as some kind of wilderness man to round up the rather generic but pleasant nature of the cast and film generally.
His relationship with this lower class girll who is also an upcoming fashion designer creates a scandal and you can figure out the rest.
We also get here another of Lillie's stage schticks: she is seen standing still on stage, wearing a formal gown that reaches to the floor, entirely concealing her feet.
The pretty Preity Zinta, also gives a noteworthy performance.
If you want your child to watch this, you may as well have them also watch The Exorcist.
There are also amateurish mistakes, going to substance and style, that make the movie feel like even more of a waste of time.
As a matter of fact, one of the few redeeming qualities was the quality of the body-double (though the transition from actress's face to the body-double was also poorly done).
And it's also completely awful and the writing is horrendous.
That can also be said about the creature, you can hardly see it and that may be for the best because it is bad and awful.
It is also one of the first sci.
Using real Bush footage and not making the movie based on a fictional character is just stupid and also inviting if not inciting assassination as a glorified and approved method of action.
Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), whom he wants to marry.
He has also dared to be different.
He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father.
It also demeans just about every group in society with its feeble attempts at humour, and insults viewers in the process.
The Plot also has none of the mystery of Sherlock Holmes.
Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy combination was also refreshing and different from all that mushy mushy Hindi film music.
I know that plays into the plot, but it also added to my confusion as a viewer.
The film also failed to clarify why the characters were doing what they were doing.
The film also suffers from a portentous score from composer Hummie Mann, which elevates the final scene--involving a fresh baked pie from good ol' Mom--to the overdone levels of a Richard Harris and Jimmy Webb collaboration.
Fall Time also features the world's least believable sex scene (involving Sheryl Lee).
He also learns that she was pregnant.
He also starts a romance with Katharine Ross, who plays the assistant to veterinarian Hal Holbrook, husband of June Allyson.
I also didn't see the point of the young boy's character, although I guess it is an Ann Hui trope (if that's the right word) to have a character's story told through the eyes of a kid.
I also couldn't buy Vicki Zhao Wei in her role, and her appearance and back story came so out of the blue that it almost seemed like a joke.
I just finished reviewing all 9 seasons of the X files (while watching the 8th and 9th seasons for the first time) and i guess that my comment is not only about the last episode but also about both last seasons.
That would save us the 2 seasons that took the show down and also would be a great point to a sequel movie if there is ever gonna be one.
The Skeptic/Believer structure of the show was also handled poorly - turning Scully into the believer, and Doggett into the skeptic was daft.
The currency of death was also cheapened - characteristic of too many US TV shows (I'm looking at you, "Heroes").
this movie represents the slowest and most boring of the franchise(so far)i also found it pointless and even more devoid of any real story than any of the previous entries.there's some action scenes which are not bad and Mark Dacascos has some good fighting mood and i like his fighting style.he seems able to carry a movie all right,but the movie doesn't carry him.i did like the inclusion of James Ryan (from "Kill or be Killed"(1980) and "Kill and Kill Again)(1981)as the villain of the piece.he makes a pretty good villain and also has a very cool fighting style.but the problem with this movie,besides the hackneyed plot,is it is mostly just a bunch of endless foot chase scenes.in my opinion "Kickboxer 5" is a 4/10
We can also forgive KickBoxer 4 from switching the tong po character star Michael Qissi, though this movie barely connects to the kickboxer franchise, the only connection is a weak Six degrees of separation to the character of David sloane which is obviously mentioned to justify the title.
They were also more dangerous, but not that much more dangerous.
You also have incompetent army guys, conspiracy against humanity, unjustified spousal death, unwarranted use of makeshift flamethrower, and lots of screaming and fleeing in terror.
I also wanted to mention Preity Zinta.
The movie also dragged on!
The music also didn't live up to expectations.
The movie starts with the grandmother(Rekha) discovering the remarkable powers of her grandson.Fearing that his 'shakthis' will not give her 'mukthi' as they will be a cause for his exploitation,she leaves the place with grandson in tow to a remote corner of the world.The kid grows into a stud along with his horse.He can leap like crazy and climb trees like Tarzan.He is also supposedly very smart and very strong.
One of the only redeeming scenes was the "Alein Autopsy" scenes, the black and white with grain texture was by far the biggest expense to the budget; however, this scene is also has some of the worst alien acting in the movie.
Then it switches from winter to summer a few times outside also.
In fact, it is also without a doubt the worst movie EVER made.
There's also another alien, an evil one, who looks just like Trumpy, whose reeking havoc around the forest, where the cabin is located.
in which it is featured also sucks.
(It's also got an English dub created with a tin ear and ESL voice actors reading their lines from cue cards for the first time).
It also gets off to a rousing start by subjecting us to a full length performance of the worst version of an 80's pop song ever heard by human ears.
Seriously, as if the movie didn't have enough problems with pacing and atmosphere and dialog and characterization, it also alienates us by subjecting us to a supposed "studio session" where the pop star sings a would be song about driving a car with some of the most maladroit lyrics you will ever hear.
There's also poachers running around, and pretty soon there's a group of teenagers driving around.
It was also the very first episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 I ever saw, way back when, so it will always have a special place in my heart.
There's also the usual Juan Piquer Simon stable of actors, including Ian Sera (Kendle in "Pieces") and Frank Brana (the guy who says "You don't have the authority to declare Happy Birthday!"
I think the "Horror" categorization was also stretching it quite a bit.
Whenever you see this movie in your programmeguide (it's also know as Marabunta btw) then you've got two options: you either ignore it as hell and live your life further without any memory to this piece of crap nested in your brains, or you can watch it and laugh your socks off due to all the flaws, lousy acting and most importantly: CGI-effects that make the original King-Kong look realistic
The only good thing this movie's for is to show film makers how NOT to make a movie, and it would also be a good comedy about making fun of other bad horror movies.
I also liked how he fared in the Plaza Hotel.
The acting might have been better than expected but also the cinematography was rather breathtaking in bringing the Alaska's wilderness on the screen.
The Indian guy is also Grey Wolf or Red Wolf depending on when they are talking to him.
Actually at least one other actor has also been deprived since Mohamed Al Fayed the owner of Harrods also appears in a walk on part .
In addition to the plot strongly resembling Robert Heinlein's "Puppet Masters", the music was also not original.
I also recognized an excerpt from Sergei Prokofiev's music score for the Russian language film Alexander Nevsky.
During the cold war it would also have been difficult for Shostakovich to pursue legal action against the film company if he even knew his music had been used.
I also would not be surprised if it turns out that the source of the performances were records purchased at a record store and the musicians were not compensated either.
The editing of the background music was also poorly done.
There are also a myriad of corny coincidences and gaping loopholes that only serve to alienate the viewer.
Tom also spends a lot of time laughing at his own cartoons, which are painfully unfunny yet somehow earn him enough to pay the rent.
She also wears only two very unstylish outfits before she becomes his pet.
I also found that the situation was very unrealistic.
second, He also felt that American audiences wouldn't feel comfortable with a creature evolved from cats so was there a way to write the Cats part as human, and lastly, Does it HAVE to be set in space?"
Director Harry Bromley (who also directed the first two flicks) is really clutching at straws with this flatly handled and too practical project.
This pilot version also gives life to a female cat who is not at all like the UK version; instead, Terry Farrell, was casted as courageous and sharp-witted - obviously casted as a sex object.
There's also a saccharine and quite repulsive score by Benny and Bjorn pre-ABBA.
Chris Columbus has also borrowed an idea or two from his debut feature, Adventures in Babysitting.
Which also happens to be a sequel.
It is quite amazing how much they did with CG and how well they did it, also compared to other current anime projects.
Unfortunately it is also impressive how hollow and lifeless the plot and characters of this anime seem.
And it also shows how desperate the film producers are trying to convey the story, no matter how unprofessional the movie looks.
The pretty boy is played by Derek Rydall who fellow aficionados of 80s teen horror will recognize (or, not) as the freak at the center of ERIC'S REVENGE: PHANTOM OF THE MALL, which also had a somewhat bizarre, once in a blue moon cast (Paulie Shore, Morgan Fairchild, Brinke Stevens, and Ken DAWN OF THE DEAD Foree).
She also doesn't mind if young Billy watches her at work through her windows, gives him cans of beer and flashes her cleavage at him whenever she gets a chance.
Meanwhile (there are a LOT of meanwhiles in this movie) Michael J. Pollard also has porn starlet Teri Wiegel chained up down in their basement, and she gets to display her naked breasts for the camera before being slaughtered as a ritual prize for Satan.
Each scene is also longer than it really needs to be, with lots of silence and blank expressions supposedly conveying - well, what exactly?
You know yer in for it when the main character ( the priest), which whom we are supposed to empathize with, not only collects trivial horror film memorabilia, but also porn mags and frequents strip clubs.
He also was one of those actors, like Gary Cooper, who simply didn't age well.
He also finds himself in a noxious mess that combines crime, nativism and the reactionary beliefs of some of the privileged few.
We also meet an elderly and slightly eccentric lady with a pie to greet the family.
Coppola's unimaginative handling of the dance numbers is also a big problem.
I'd say that Cary Grant (a screwball comedy veteran) and Ginger Rogers had zero chemistry as the married couple and I also thought Charles Coburn uncharacteristically walked through a part he did many times before in better movies.
When Kevin McCallister comes out Duncan's Toy Chest store then also Marv and Harry come out Duncan's Toy Chest then Harry say "So where to next" then Marv says "should we go to the Central Park Zoo" that was hilarouis.
Her character in this movie is pretty dull (no surprise there then), she is being portrayed as the beauty who is also profound (well, that's maybe a matter of taste, but I really don't find her that beautiful, and certainly the character was said to be profound, but it was not shown).
On a technical level, there are also an incredible number of annoying, shaky, hand-held shots that serve absolutely no purpose, other than to distract.
This may not have been that bad a decision, but they also decided to have it feature Sellers as Clouseau!!!
So basically it's made in the same way as those other successful earlier Pink Panther movies but never does this movie work out as good as any other Pink Panther movie and it also is definitely the worst out of the long running series of movies.
This was also the last movie he appeared in before his death.
The inside of the U-boat is also completely unrealistic.
The way every night fall in the movie almost always ends with Fonda and Kristofferson making love is also not real for two people well over fourty as the movie portrays.
We also are never given much background or motivation for the events and doings of the people wandering about this epic of high finance.
At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated.
The metaphysical imagery of X is also very peculiar, mixing a lot of Christian iconography with rivers of blood and gore.
There is also a lot of pointless killing, and characters die before you even get to know them.
Christmas decorations are also very present in this movie, as well as lovely Christmas carols and good messages about Christmas, allowing us to feel the Christmas magic and spirit.
Eddie Bracken is also great as the kind hearted Mr. Duncan.
That sequence with Kevin at the top of the World Trade Center is spectacular and nostalgic, but also painful and depressing to look now because it brings back memories of the tragic date 11th September 2001. Who could possibly imagine back in 1992 that, some years later, such horrible thing would happen?
The means by which the dragons of heaven defend the planet through the usage of "shields" and the construct in which they work is also an absorbing premise as these sequences provide the high points but, unfortunately, it's not enough.
Oh yeah, the music is great also.
I also found the political system described majorly oversimplified (why did they need the queen to cast a vote of disconfidence) and, really, doesnt starting a war on a planet sound like a somewhat risky plan for a smart person like Palpatine?
Jar Jar Binks, say no more he sucks big time  I also discovered having read many comments from others on this page that many who liked this film were very offensive to those who did not,saying that they were not true Star Wars fans or did not get it.
But it's also a kid's movie in the bad sense: it's deeply witless, and inexperienced children might - I say, MIGHT - fail to notice just how witless it is.
I also couldn't think of another film that was single-handly ruined by one single character like this movie is.
A friend who saw "Phantom Menace" also noted that the special effects aren't that much better than the original films, either, and ILM is Lucas' real legacy to filmmaking.
The film is also politically objectionable on several counts.
Are you still with me, OK stay tuned it gets more and more hard to follow, the family also have a sister who was locked up in an asylum after she murdered her father, except she didn't, as the truth the doctors told them would be worse for her mental state.
The orchestral score is unusual for a Gialloish film and its also pretty mundane and distracting, as is the awful dubbing.
Other negative damage is also noticeable, at the very start of the movie, and through most reel-change points.
I also the love the juxtaposed images of birds in flight, stars, flowers and streams trying to denote sweet love making!!!
There is also Edna May Oliver's performance, and she is excellent in the role of Juliet's babbling nurse.
It is also very slowly paced.
Pretension also comes to my mind because we, the viewer, are asked to accept significant illogical plot points presumably because it seems artful to do so.
Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder.
It's also well produced against the exotic backgrounds of New Orleans and Key West.
This is somewhat shocking not only due to the sexual situations (explicit with Cuba Gooding Jr.), but also the huge departure from the film's story-telling feel.
Only when Chaplin comes out- also again Rossellini herself playing her along with David O Selznik- does some praise come out.
Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first.
The movie has also lost a lot of the edge and suspense it had in the first movie - I seriously feel like the directing in this movie is worse than the first one.
My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom "What kind of idiots do you have working here?!"...
Unfortunately, it was also one of his worst.
This latter effort also holds the distinction of being Bela Lugosi's only movie to have been filmed in color.
I must also add that this is the first DVD from Alpha Video that I've viewed that seems to have been taken from a respectable-looking print; too bad it was for this pathetic little stinker!
There's also put-upon maid Lilly Beth (Gladys Blake), who Bill seems obsessed with and who finds herself clinically dead at one point.
I actually liked this because so many people in the movie had good motives for killing this harpy and it also felt very satisfying to see her literally scared to death.
Sandy Dennis is also quite good in her role.
This is also the only movie that Bela Lugosi played in that was released in color.
As I mentioned before, the cop was there for no reason but to wait for a murder and the reporter was also there waiting for something to report.
There was also a dwarf who seemed to just be hanging around to make the movie strange, a man who wanted a divorce and couldn't figure out how to get one, a doctor who never saw a single patient and a maid who sometimes seemed like she might be a nurse.
It's not an expensive movie, I bought it on a DVD that also has 2 other Bela Lugosi movies on it- White Zombie and The Corpse Vanishes.
It has also another rather unique aspect: it's a sort of alien-revenge-flick (there aren't many of those, are there?)
While it's true that Costello had more push and was the business head of the duo, he was also a man of many sides, including a love for children, that this biopic prefers to erase.
It also has one of the worst performances on screen by Australian actor Michael Dorman.
I don't think the movie is as bad as the first two comments, i also don't think the movie is as good as the third comment.
I was very excited to see this film after all the hype, i was also looking forward to a funny, insightful portrait of 'SUBURBAN MAYHEM' especially having grown up in a place like the one depicted in the film.
This also coincides with the announcement for the AFI awards.
I agree and was also surprised that this film got commissioned.
this is a very cleverly written movie by Neil Simon.it's directed by Arthur Hiller.it's a 'everything that can go wrong does' comedy.and it is funny.it's not dirty or filled with foul language,like many of our modern film use for laughs,or try to anyway.it stars jack Lemmon as a strait laced,high strung worry wart salesman,and Sandy Dennis as his down to earth calming influence wife.George Kellertman(Lemmon)and his wife(Gwen) are on a trip from small town life to the big city,(New York)where George has a very important interview that could put his career on the fast track.it should be aroutine trip.the only problem will be getting there.Neil Simon really has a gift for words.the dialogue i this is witty,intelligent and sharp.the words just seem to flow smoothly,whether it's subtle conversation or rapid fire interplay between George nd Gwen,or themselves and others.But Lemmon and Dennis deserve a lot of credit.they work perfectly off each other.bringing realism to the characters and sympathy.whoever cast these 2 together hopefully got a huge bonus for doing so.there are also some funny cameo appearances by some stars of the day.this is one terrific little movie.it's charming and warm and has heart.it may be low key,but it works.i vaguely remember watching the remake with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and being less than impressed.for me,the original"The Out of Towners" is a definite 8/10
The wolf in the movie has more personality then all the characters in the film and the only believable character is the crazy kids sister who is also in love with the best friend.
There is the proverbial love triangle between two best friends and the girlfriend of one of them, also including the sister of one of the guys.
The main character is annoying and not likable but also doesn't serve to make anyone laugh even once, it is just not a funny show or funny main character.
The other characters also are not funny in the least.
This movie was written directly for the screen by Neil Simon, and his mastery of creating a hilarious but also surreal story perfectly works in this uproarious comedy.
The plot is also a bit nonsensical with characters behaviour, the villains in particular, not being believable.
genre of films is my thing (I also love "After Hours"), but I stand by my claim that Neil Simon's writing and Jack Lemmon's and Sandy Dennis' performances all combine to create one of the funniest movies ever made.
Looking at some of the other user comments, I realize that many sought to extol the purported virtues of this film, professing Lucrecia Martel's artistic brilliance and method for capturing personality and conflict as demonstrated in this, her "ouevre," but as far as I'm concerned, these people must be blind, if not also deranged.
I could also take this in another direction and say that the director wanted me to focus more on the characters, but I wasn't able to form any kind of relationship to them which is why this film wasn't one of my favorites.
You can also see every plot twist coming from a mile away (such as where both guys get their girls in the end).
The movie also takes shots at the disco-dazed trendiness of the seventies, a quality that was also never a big part of the series.
This film (with Hutch initially playing both sides of the law) is deliberately cheesy and does manage to get some details right, but it is also muddled, offensive, overlong, and not big on genuine laughs.
Juliette Lewis adds some spice and edginess to it also.
Steve Johnson, who provided the gore effects in the first film, also does the make-up FX for this one, and he does a pretty good job; particularly impressive moments include a woman's tits transforming into demon hands and a wonderful snake creature with a huge lashing tail.
Featuring stupid characters, including: a perpetually annoyed priest who doesn't allow anyone to complete a sentence while speaking to him; a dry-boxed old penguin who morphs from cheerless octogenarian virgin to yardstick-wielding commando an hour in; mean girls who are also dumb sluts; mullets; tawdry demonology; bad boys time-warped in from the '80s; and a thoroughly despicable wuss-boy hero.
And I was also certain that the writers had never seen the original night of the demons.
Like many reviewers here, I have also been a great fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, being very grateful that they did the work of scouring film libraries for the dregs of the cinema, so I didn't have to.
invasion of inner earth also known as;they is a extremely bad science fiction movie.we don't see any aliens or flying saucers,not even a pie plate on a string nothing,its a exercise in tedium,but the music on the soundtrack is OK.there are killer flashlight beams however.i don't get it what was directer bill rebane thinking?even the giant spider invasion was entertaining even if it was crappy.and there's no well known actors in this film.is it worth watching?i would have to say no unless you really want to be bored to death.the title does sound promising but really does'nt deliver.this is about 90 minutes ill never get back.but if you like bad dull boring movies then invasion from inner earth is for you,shame on you bill rebane.1 out of 10 awful!
But there's also a crazy guy flying a plane who crashes in the woods.
But it's also so cheaply shot that anything that could possibly be in the script is obfuscated by the meandering take of the material.
The atmosphere and cinematography were also above average.
It also captures awkward moments without fixating on it like Seinfeld.
It also boasts the always enjoyable Larry Miller in a too-small part.
Kind of annoying really, but at the same time, it is also entertaining.
Figgis also fails to make the movie cinematic with most of the (in )action taking place inside a kitchen save for a few scenes in a studio exterior .
It should also be pointed out that because it's a stage play the dialogue is very important but due to some very poor sound mixing it's almost impossible to hear what the actors are saying .
The same linguist who had done my favorite translation of the play (Helen Cooper, the Methuen Drama Translation) also did the screenplay, so naturally, I expected something mostly faithful to the script.
I learned a lot watching Reefer Madness (AKA Teach Your Children...hey did you know that the CSN song "Teach Your Children" is also also known as "Reefer Madness?"
Besides the rather loose and fast rules about drugs (Calling marijuana more dangerous than heroin for example), the producers also tend to have difficulty with things like suspense and continuity.
"Reefer Madness" falls into the same category, even though the production of it was somewhat better, with an added bonus for the folks involved with the making of it ...It was also meant to be used as a "teaching" tool.
Neil Simon's story might also be interpreted as a critique of modern society, in which citizens in the bustling metropolises are unwilling to offer help to those in need of their assistance.
I also had a serious problem understanding how anyone could fall in love with Sinclair , he's one of those bores you find at every golf club propping up the bar as he tells everyone what a success he's made of his life , but even so I doubt if that would have been enough to drive Natalie into the arms of her loving brother - YUCK .
I also hated the ending, I mean after killing people, stealing cars, threatening people at gunpoint, taking part in an armed robbery where innocent people are killed & breaking every rule in the book McHenry gets off scott free & even gets a vacation out of it!
I've already mentioned the love aspect of the story, this was also supposed to be a dark plot with plenty of evil and of course Anakin turning to the dark-side.
The lack of invention in it is also stunning, why introduce Jango Fett at all except to cash in on the popularity of Boba Fett, why have Kenobi hide behind an asteroid like Han Solo does in Empire Strikes Back with a star destroyer?
Stewart also happens to be the father of two young boys, and his young wife is pregnant at the farm.
In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Stewart also played another gutless wonder who had to be saved by John Wayne.
In Firecreek, Jimmy Stewart basically spends the entire movie "turning the other cheek" while also trying to be the volunteer "Town Sheriff."
They also have strong, non-wacky story lines.
The weapons are nice but have unrealistic damage to objects also.
All this on a nice dreamed of vacation in New York for this middle America Ohio couple who are combining business and pleasure as Lemmon is also in town for a job interview.
His roomie, who is the topper (also hates him), helps him stay.
Captain Kong, who was captain of the ship that the princess traveled on, and Captain Kelso, who was the supplier of the planes for the princess, are both determined to see that Chan and Davidson make no further progress on the murder case, which has also added the princess' maid and a mute Chinese boy who may have seen the killer.
There's also the painfully comic Maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals).
Rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't stage epic battle scenes.
In addition to these two leads, Bert Wheeler and Dorothy Lee also sing a bit--as does Robert Woolsey near the end of the film.
The Wheeler/Lee songs are more cute and enjoyable than the rest, though it should also be noted that Ms. Lee sings almost exactly like Betty Boop!!
She also is an outstanding percussionist.
Oh, and speaking of Elvira, I should point out that if you do get this version, you also get Elvira interrupting the film periodically to make comments.
In summary, an also ran....
The main characters are quite far off the ones they are in the book also, which does change the whole story significantly.
Kelly Sheridan is also in this film.
so, on we go to round three of the "House" series.we(my sister and i)had watched the first entry all the way through and were underwhelmed,to say the least.the second one lowered the bar for crappiness even further.how bad could number 3 be?it starts off promising enough.after all,it had Lance Henricksen (he should've passed) in it and it looked like it had a bigger budget.however,it soon became apparent that this movie was also a dud.another ridiculous plot,bad acting,bad everything.i think this one made it 40 minutes tops.any longer and my head would have exploded.again,no horror,and no comedy.i must be missing something.i wish i knew what it was.
It's also extremely stupid, whoever thought of the term 'electromagnetic evil'?
This film also commits the crime of wasting two great leading men, the always watchable Lance Henriksen and the delightfully over-the-top villain Brion James, who's barely in it to be honest.
The prominent British horror production studios like Hammer and Amicus sadly ceased to exist during the mid-70's, and this loss also seemed to have a negative impact on the creative skills of the contemporary writers.
Mitchell-Smith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall, we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered, which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.
Somehow, a nuclear missile is also involved...
At every moment of the movie they remind you not just that it is a movie but also that it is a bad movie.
Julia Ormond plays Guinevere and also brings no charm to the part.
It was also hard to believe the relationship with Lancelot because of Gere's performance.
I also felt that Camelot was not grant enough.
The film was also not particularly loyal to the Arthur legends and this is another example of Hollywood butchering an English legend, similar to Robin Hood films.
And also unfortunate, because what would have been an interesting question is then quickly brushed over.
Effortlessly sophisticated humour from writer/producer Stavros Kazantzidis (also of "Love and Other Catastrophes"), classy direction from Croghan and magnificent performances from all involved make this film one to be remembered for a long time.
The Phantom of the Opera the year before also starred Susannah Foster.
Somehow Bey also gets the idea that by destroying the atomizer in front of her, that his lady friend will regain her voice.
The story also gets an extra element of mystery through Virna Nightbourne; a clairvoyant who draws the crimes before they happen.
The director of this movie also directed HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE.
Having liked that movie and also being tempted by the attractive DVD cover depicting a gloved hand over a woman's face, I had high hopes for THE KILLING HOUR.
Without revealing spoilers, I can also mention the presence of another scene in this movie outside of the killings but was clearly meant to be disturbing.
He identified known communists in the film industry when ordered to do so by not only the film companies but also under penalty of perjury by Congress.
As the granddaughter of a coal miner who was also a union organizer, and having been born and brought up in Appalachia, I was highly interested in the theme of this film.
And you just as sure can't make a horror film simply by dealing thematically with vampires; you also need some scares (the movie's one potentially scary scene - in a shower - is badly edited).
It also concludes with the threat of a sequel, to which I can only respond with the Wilheim Scream our hunk unleashes just before the end.
I think it is also problematic to make a piece of fiction and pretend it to be real keeping the real names of persons and places.
So it's a bad movie, but it's also disappointing because the premise of a campy slasher flick seemed to have potential.
So that segment is good, which also means that it is totally out of sync with the rest of the movie.
The scene in which the dwarf tears off his victims/guinea pig's ribs with sound effects, is perhaps the most disgusting scene in the film, but it is also very stupidly made and the make up effects look as realistic as ketchup flying to the wall.
However, I should also add that this does not mean that the actors were up to the task of being convincing during the said scenes.
The characters also get more developed towards the end, which explains some of their behavior early on.
This was also a disappointment.
"Magnificent Warriors" finds its leading star, Michelle Yeoh, in top form: her speed and dance-like grace make her fight scenes a pure pleasure to watch (she's also good with a whip....and a rope....and a spear....well, you get the idea).
Eventually the film revolves around the woman's daughter and granddaughter also drowning their husbands with the complicity of the local coroner.
Ugh The dialog also made no sense for most of it.
I also asked people who had also left before it was over what they thought, and they agreed with me.
Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie "Miami Vice" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it "Miami Vice" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it "World Vice" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.
also, if you do decided to go to this movie, it would be wise to take a book with you ,as you will get bored.
both of us own the movie on DVD because we enjoyed it so much, and have in turn showed the movie to others who have also enjoyed why we had to kill bitch.
Although I find this coupled-bodies-with-their-coupled-expressiveness interesting I have to say the most of the elements of this film are nothing but those of a bad B-movie; Dee Barton's old-TV-movie-like easygoing music is entirely unsuited to the 1980's horror film especially to its horror scenes, and Worth Keeter's special effects are not only cheap but also unnatural, and so forth.
The laser scenes are the funniest, also watch as THE TERMINATION MAN throws the worlds tiniest bomb which is also completely invisible.
The final fight scene which comprising the worst fight choreography ever seen in a crappy straight to video film is also a highpoint of this brilliant movie.
Obviously, for most parts this movie isn't meant seriously (there's a hilarious Robert DeNiro-like character called Nick Duran who curses in a ridiculously rude manner and who even gets to sing his own little song when the credits roll) but on the other hand the makers also seemed eager to gain the respect of horror audiences.
This film also features stalwarts of the British film scene such as Stanley Holloway, William Mervyn, Bill Fraser, Dora Bryan and Lance Percival with early bit parts for Bob Hoskins and Mike Grady.
The film reduced its wonderful source material to just another preachy, moralistic, stating the obvious 'kids, say no to drugs' diatribe.It also didn't have the guts to push it main character's decent into the hell of drug addiction further.
It also has a blasphemous scene early on when they hold a "wake" for the paper and smugly use Christian terms (i.e.
The production values are also woeful with some of the worst dubbing ever imaginable.
Not only is this the cinematic gem the worst thing ever put on celluloid, it also shares the dichotomous distinction of being the funniest film ever made.
I also got a screener copy of PSYCHO SANTA thanks to the generosity of one of the people involved in this film.
They also take the time to answer e-mails and converse with fans... something their Hollywood counterparts never seem to have the time to do.
Padded out movies are not only boring to sit through, but also make you lose complete interest in the film and what is going on in it.
There was actually only one talking scene with sound but also a few musical performances by Jolson and Cantor Josef Rosenblatt.
There was actually only one talking scene with sound but also a few musical performances by Jolson and Cantor Josef Rosenblatt.
The change of scenes are bad timed, and the focus in some of the scenes are also unbelievable poor.
There was also the added bonus that it appeared to be overtly sexual as well...
It also had the unfortunate effect of ruining any of the impact of the movie, because it was extinguished by the horrible use of music.
I also sensed and element of Imaginary Heroes,a movie that has stayed with me almost as a guide as to what this genre can truly but but rarely is.
i am still not sure about the "killer" in this movie, OK i get he was an escaped mental patient that looked like an idiot, but was he also a super hero?
Action movies never really need deep plot (just watch the first "Resident Evil"), but they do need visual flair (also shown in the first "Resident Evil").
After a handful of survivors have escaped, Alice is caught and put in a lab, where she not only manages to escape, but also to manifest psychic powers while quipping off several lines that were used to advertise the movie in commercials.
This obscure Universal "B" horror flick is also included in that yet-to-be released Box Set I mentioned in my review of HOUSE OF HORRORS (1946) above and, unfortunately, while I would certainly say that this one is more readily enjoyable, my verdict overall is equally lukewarm.
Why Universal and TCM chose this for their "Cult Horror Classics" boxed set instead of the neglected 1934 masterpiece "The Man Who Reclaimed His Head" (also with Atwill) or the interesting 1942 Edgar Allan Poe adaptation "The Mystery of Marie Roget" (also with Knowles) is a bigger mystery than the supposedly "mysterious" identity of Dr. Rx in this plot.
That also leads me to think about the 20 person protest against the President of the United States.
The DVD box cover shows a black and white photograph of the Whitehouse, which is also the title screen of the DVD itself.
The box also lists its Special Features as Scene selection and Trailer.
There is also some FBI guy who leads some "special agents" and "tries to rescue the president".
And what's also really funny is the part where the bad guy falls off the roof.
It also has a cast of famous names, Eric Roberts, Ice-T, and Michael Madsen.
I also very much liked Daniel Dae Kim who was perfect in this role.
Besides being motivated by a plot contrivance rather than logically occurring as it did in the novel, it was also horribly dragged out.
Don Coscarelli provides one of the few times that gore is also scary with his flying silver orbs.
She also didn't seem to have many facial expressions and her deliverance was wooden at best.
The story also went downhill from here on out.
The only bad guy who ever came close to being interesting was Cole, seeing as he was evil but also loved Phoebe.
That's just bad dialog) and the charmed ones were good (also just coming out and saying it out loud).
Of course, I was also younger when I started watching, and my tastes have developed a good deal since then.
To close, I'd like to also communicate my displeasure with other reviewers who have imposed informative psychological content INTO the film when the filmmaker himself failed to do so.
Lastly for those of us who also have seen Cabin Fever I'm sure a lot of the draw of this movie was Cerina Vincent.
It also started another horror icon: the Tall Man.
I am also ready for the next movie if there will ever be one!
We're also lucky enough to get flashbacks - numerous, uncountable flashbacks - of the accident.
I also don't understand how the writers thought it was okay for so many people to know who Spider-Man's alter ego is.
If all of this isn't bad enough, the studios Morality Department also got hold of the script somewhere along the line.
It was also a disgusting overly dramatized exercise in attempting to concentrate more on the gross out factor than reporting the facts.
When I see the phrase "great cast", I think GONE WITH THE WIND or TWELVE ANGRY MEN, not a film whose lead is Lyle Talbot (the same guy who starred in a few decent films in the 30s but also PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a lot of other turkeys).
Additionally, since this is its pedigree, captioning and a high quality print are also absent.
But the doctor also chooses to experiment on the normal person and a lady he presumes is guilty but is actually quite innocent.
An attempt at comic relief fails, also.
He was also really creepy.
I also found the special affects really good for this movie since it was made so long ago.
The acting was above average, there are many fright scenes, the music was frightening, and it is definitely worth buying and also a movie you can watch over and over again.
He worked as a Ice Cream salesman, and he's also a warrior at heart.
We also had Night at the museum 2, which wasn't art but was still decent.
Them and their friends help also.
A lot of this film is unfeasible also.
The brother and sister team have also been secretly keeping a pet dog, Friday, who uses automated gadgets constructed by the mechanically inclined Bruce to get food and to remain hidden.
Complete with screamingly bad acting and ridiculous, unnecessary, illogical plot contrivances, this movie also features a gateway to another dimension, an abandoned mineshaft, a flying ball-bearing, some severed fingers, a couple of unmotivated sex scenes, a giant housefly on wires, a few shotgunned dwarfs, a bald guy with a ponytail and a 1970 Barracuda.
also, there is a tiny snippet of gore where two of the protagonists burst open some goon's heads (pretty fake looking, but kind of entertaining).
He also eventually finds out where this stuff is being stored.
I also think some of the scenes were removed from the film as well.
There's also a laughable scene showing intercut shots of Sly Stallone doing some ballet aerobics (or something) in his house while Sharon Stone just stands in the middle of her own living room doing a Marylin Monroe in front of her open breezy windows.
Stallone and Stone's love scene, which shows plenty of Stallone's icky spider-web shoulder veins, is also pretty strange.
Oh yeah, James Woods is also in the film, but charitable audiences may do him a favor and forget he was even in it.
I was also surprised to see that Stallone is no taller than Sharon Stone ("Munro-Hastings").
I must also comment that micro-mini skirts were not in style for the 90s: a huge, veiled hat and a dress that hardly covered her panties, in a church?
Although Stallone was already a big budget Hollywood star with many a title under his belt with Sharon Stone who also had a few films (most noticeably 'Basic Instinct') going for her and James Woods, again, with some reasonably successful outings (most notably in my opinion a 'Simpsons' episode), 'The Specialist' fails to live up to its talent hype and attempt as a film noir come action film.
What makes the film also rather cheesy is the editing at some points.
The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room, one guy fell down before the other was also laughable.
Regretfully, Phantasm also suffers from a few overwhelming negative aspects.
I also hate The Specialist as well, luckily after both this & Anaconda tanked at the box-office & were critically torn to pieces Llosa hasn't been allowed to make an American film since, there is a god after all...
I also laughed at the way he'd constantly be yelling "Shut up!"
The hip 70s score is also incredibly funky and spooky at the same time.
It's also very different from the typical 70s horror formula.
The setting of rural California is also a refreshing change from medieval castles, hick villages or haunted houses.
He was also the one holding the sceptor so now it is gone.
Michaelangelo also has an encounter with Mitsu, Kenshin's love interest.
The turtles also have an encounter with fury fighting warriors and whip them in their own creative style.
The turtle outfits also look terrible.
There's also plot holes, countless continuity errors, and so on.
They were lucky enough to win against the odds, at least for a time, but in this interview, they also mentioned something about believing the phenomenon would go on forever.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, also known as Turtles In Time, picks up with the turtles milling around their sewer hideout with Splinter (who now looks like a shag carpet with eyes).
The films score is also perfect and mesmerizing that fits well by Fred Myrow, it was in fact one of the most powerful elements of the movie that really had me engaged.
His voice is also totally different and he seems a touch more upbeat and lively.
She is definitely charming, but it doesn't carry this particular movie unless maybe for the younger girls of this generation who also like the similar plot-less "Olsen twin" type movies.
Coscarelli, who I think is planning yet another sequel in this franchise, has also made a few other films over the years: the recent "Bubba Ho-tep" and the ubiquitous cable favorite "The Beastmaster" are the most memorable.
But there are also too many tedious stretches (this is one of the longest 78 minutes you'll ever spend), and too many predictable gags (hmmm, they have made a trap for a gigantic orangutan, do you think Lou will fall in it?).
Joe Besser and Shemp Howard also provide for some additional laughs.
Oh and it also points out how ultimately Hollywood is a friend to the every man and provides a great social service, kind of like Clooney's Oscar speech.
However, there are also many slow-paced films that are simply boring.
Rachel Weisz is damn beautiful and also skilled in acting, but most of the film is killed by absolutely expressionless Burns.
This movie has many different layered meanings, over the years some people have said that it's a reference to corporate America coming in (in the form of The Tall Man) and killing off everyone (by turning everything into a 'business') and some have said that this movie is also about a kid's loss of innocence and fears about everyone around him leaving (or in this case dying) Whatever the hell this movie is about it's still great fun followed by a couple of really disappointing (and belated) sequels.
Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark.
The heavy British accents are also hard to get used to.
The film is also not helped by the story.
I also found it a much more believable reason for a apocalypse type virus than in other movies, at least the virus didn't come in an asteroid or something.
I also liked how there is a little more to the story than just fighting off zombies.
We also get a "ghost" with braces.
The movie is also very dark - bad lights i guess.
The film we see from point of view of a husband but that also gets lost somewhere.
Bernard Bresslaw also flounders with a film that has a "comedy whistle" sound effect as he sits on a cactus (twice).
The small setting also concedes the lack of ambition present.
Loving was underrated, and descended into slapstick homage, while Convenience was also an amusing exploration of the coarseness of the series.
Girls was also overlooked, however, and Dick earned its reputation as "the last decent Carry On movie".
Also when the killing urge takes over you can actually see the changes in his face and mannerisms and there are also some nice atmospheric scenes at the end.
I also like the portal gateway scene where if you go through the two chrome poles, you'll get to see the Tall Man's alternative universe where the slaves are busy carrying caskets down a stone pathway.
It managed to keep Avco/Embassy in business so they could bring us later horror stuff like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1980); THE FOG (1980) and DEAD AND BURIED (1981) The MGM DVD also has a lot more extras on it than you would expect from other DVDs released by the same company, including 8mm behind-the-scenes footage of the making of PHANTASM; a 1979 interview down in Miami with director Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm; an appearance at a 1989 Fangoria convention by Scrimm, and movie & TV trailers for the film.
It's also made by MTVÂwhich is not surprising.
They both also have the one 'nice' guy attracted to some attractive girl.
There's also a reason its only on Oxygen.
also considering th ratings of many other soaps/dramas, for example east-enders, coronation street and more recent ones such as torch wood, heartbeat does not really compare.
I also happen to agree with other viewers that say that this film has one of the most haunting yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's Halloween theme.
It is also uncanny to see some of the similarities to A Nightmare On Elm Street and Phantasm.
To a small degree it's creepy in the way it intends: It does seem as if Harper Lee may have seen this before writing her lovely "To Kill A Mockingbird," also about children (here just one child) wrongly suspicious of an odd neighbor.
The fifties gave us some fine music and art but a little item like this serves to remind, or show someone unfamiliar with that decade, what an unpleasant time it was, also.
I also didn't like the fact that they showed the dragging so violently.
The film also presents a credibly downbeat atmosphere of rural eastern Texas.
The show also featured Richard Gilliland (husband of Jean Smart in real life).
If you still think your discovery holds after you've gotten a good scientific background knowledge, then you should have also gotten to know some people with whom you can discuss it...
Stalker , Solaris ) ,while it also steals from Kubrick's Odyssey series.
The last scene is also reusing some elements introduced in 2001 a Space Odyssey, like the Ligeti-like soundtrack and some psychedelic CG effects.
The plot also includes some supernatural elements that are out of place for this kind of movie.
As they fall in love they have to deal with the unusual ways that each of them have created purpose for themselves--the very reasons society has rejected them--while also facing their prejudices about age, race, and sex.
Sure, you have to wonder what happened to the kids, but you also feel hope that maybe a couple of them got smart and got a job.
While it's nice to see that he was able to put something together without a budget, it also would have been nice to see a movie not rely on Adobe After Effects.
And also if you like to watch the worst of the worst, this "movie" is highly recommended!
That's the worst thing, it's stupid and shallow, and very lame, but it's also really funny, and you end up stuck to the screen waiting to see what happens next!
There's also some mumbo jumbo about a little girl and her twin sister who's dead, and a green ball.
Once in a while, you watch a movie where you can just immediately tell that the directors mother is also his aunt.
Not only with its acting and visual style but also with its technical aspect, such as the editing, camera-positioning.
The movie just isn't ever tense, scary or mysterious, were also lies a big problem of the movie obviously.
The musical score is also quite horrendous.
Of course the story also doesn't help much.
The movie also tries to be more clever than it really is, by putting in many plot twists and making things seem different than they truly are.
Without doubt they also did this to make the movie original.
Through the many twists the movie also starts to make less and less sense.
Not only are there many improbabilities but also many things that just plain good old fashioned plot holes, mistakes and other things that don't make much sense.
Granted that the script with its many weak and often pointless dialog also doesn't help them much but honestly, it's obvious as well that the actors just don't have the talent for the job.
On her way Rebecca picks up a hitchhiker named Stan James (Timothy Prindle) who also lives near the lake, they quickly become friends as Rebecca still feels bad about her parents & needs a shoulder to cry on.
Written & directed by Jay Woelfel who also appears in the film as a 'shadowy figure' & if that wasn't enough he also composed the music, is there no beginning to this mans talents?!
I also understand why this never made it to the big screen.
However, it is also one of the most hilariously atrocious movies you will ever see.
I also compare this game with Half-Life 2, which is a great game.
It's a traditional Western (partly comedic and partly melodramatic) that plays like a bunch of TV Western episodes pasted together in slack fashion, while also projecting some of that "spaghetti" dirtiness and desolation.
Janice Rule, as Fonda's testily neurotic and misguided female antagonist, is also stellar, as is Aldo Ray as the wildly destructive stranger, an anarchic monster periodically haunting this muddy little outpost (which can hardly be considered a town).
My 2 other sons (ages 4 and 8) also enjoy it, especially the character Mr. C. Jr. (Michael E. Rodgers is hilarious).
I think it is also good for the kids to watch since it contains very little violence.
It also has the added bonus of being filmed at the Strasburg Railroad using the very same train that we ride on every year.
His offhandedly mean treatment of the Stooges also alienates the viewer.
Nearly everything else is "eh" though there's also some entertaining xylophone playing by another comic foil named Fred Sanborn and a little kid named Billy Barty amusingly attempts to pop a balloon as he keeps somersaulting.
It doesn't help when Thomas the Tank Engine (Edward Glen) and friends are being attacked by the nasty Diesel 10 (Neil Crone), who also wants to find the missing train Lady (Allcroft) and the Magic Railroad it runs on.
Stoltz also co-produced, and the small budgeted film has a very stylish, quasi-surreal look that bolsters the limp action.
In his biography of Haines, "Wisecracker", author William J. Mann alleges that Haines's career was on the decline partly due to his aging out of the roles he had become typecast in, and also to becoming pudgy.
Bronson also knows a lot of louche people and bounces from one to the other in his search for the solution to the various mysteries.
This left-winged friend of mine, I must tell you also believes in UFO's and that CIA created LSD and AIDS to get rid of opponents Â but he is a great guy none the less.
She also has an acquaintance from way back when pitch in.
In GREASE, she was (and still is) the embodiment of sex appeal in those black tights and red slides, but she also looked beautiful and appealing in her girl-next-door costumes.
And also, the musical numbers are far too gaudy and over-the-top; the mixing of time-periods doesn't work.
It also doesn't help that there are only two good songs in this film, "Suddenly" and "All Over The World."
And calling it a musical is also a put-down on the whole musical genre.
I think it is a great movie, and I also liked the part where Gordon says he knows everything.
I also like the parts where Mr.
The characters are also horribly developed, and in the end, this movie is a complete mess.
This riddle sounds like the set-up for a lame joke, and that happens to be also the best way to describe "The Visitor": a lame, bad, drawn-out and overlong joke!
The club dancing scenes, also ridiculous and hard to watch.
also it'd be unlikely for Sarah to be out doing club dancing before an audition for fear of getting hurt or pulling something.
also far too many of the black characters are given very bad attitudes about themselves and their relationships to white people.
And oh yes, the programme makers seem to think that the parents of Hindley and Brady's victims are also boors, since the only time we ever hear a peep out of them is when they talk about wanting to kill Hindley and Brady for revenge.
Unfortunately for the programme makers, Longford also comes across as being just as one-dimensional as those boors, just that he has a different opinion to theirs.
The only character who's given more than one 'dimension' is Longford's wife, and it's also telling how the writer does so.
There's also the acting, which is horrible even by the standards of children's movies.
Why, break in, of courseÂa stroke of genius which not only results in an outbreak of the plague, but also the resurrection of a murderous plague doctor.
She claims to have this huge historical knowledge (and also does that intolerable thing late in the movie where everyone is fearful for their lives and she is frantically giving history lessons), but is astonishingly clueless about how to handle the Plague.
And if the special effects weren't bad enough, they also throw in the "I don't think any of this is real" thing, so none of it matters anyway.
Superman II was also very good, it lives up to the first one, and the new Richard Donner cut coming in November should be even better than the one we're all accustomed to!
The Salkinds also made some other choices that killed the movie.
The script was also way too Campy.
(But without Lois Lane he had to start over again with the Lana in Smallvill, and Pryor also made too much of a competetor of all the attention)
To be frank, the only redeeming qualities of this film are Ol' Supes fighting his evil twin (also known as Bizzaro) and the first appearance of Lana Lang, played by a young Annette O Toole who is much better in Smallville than she is in Superman 3.
But it's not enough to save the entire movie from being an embarrassment: the writers & director have overemphasized the comedy, casting not only a lame Richard Pryor (who lost his sharp wit after he almost torched himself), but also a typical blonde bimbo as the villain's mistress, and the guy who plays Lana's drunk ex-husband.
It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that Lois Lane barely appears in this movie at all (the Salkinds were punishing Margot Kidder for openly sticking up for Donner), that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful.
It also contains one of the best moments in the series, as Clark Kent and the evil Superman actually battle each other.
This could also have cut out much of the unnecessary comic drivel that ruins Superman III.
The pie man could have stepped over the gum-balls easily also.
The film also gives some nice nods to Romero and Bruce Campbell, and for that you have to respect it, as it's paying homage to the great zombie/gore films that are it's precedent.
There's also illegal re-kill teams to pick up some slack.
It also tries to tell us a message.
It's also a great film for Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange or Dino De Laurentiis to watch so that they can see that by comparison, the poor 1976 KING KONG film is like a Merchant-Ivory production!
What also cracked me up was that the ape has apparently no vocal cords of any sort : he does not make a sound during the whole movie!
The credits also thank the US military for their cooperation.
Viewing historic, albeit, stupid films such as "Boys beware" is important in understanding that as a society we have made progress in our acceptance of things outside the heterosexual norm, but also sends a chilling reminder of the times we missed only by a few decades.
Basically, most of the actors rush their lines, and except for the two Antonios (Lochlyn Munro somewhat OK), the acting basically sucked, which means the directing also sucked.
It's also funny that the writer (Mike Mains, the worst actor in the film) wrote himself the part of having the first primary relationship in the film.
Not bad efforts from the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in a "Sex and the City" role again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role).
Try also a not so popular film from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth)
The direction was also terrible.
But teenagers and adults alike will also enjoy this movie.
I can ONLY vaguely remember watching Faune Chambers in "Epic Movie" which was also a flop in my eyes?
It is now having the same effect on my youngest son, who is also an avid Thomas fan.
Word has it that Miss Stiles will also appear in four more movies in 2000 -- there's still hope!
Pretending like these people go to Columbia University-- also not cool (although Julia Stiles actually does and she's very nice I hear, so I don't want to bad-mouth her, just her choice to play the part).
Full Moon pumps out sludge better than this all the time... although after seeing "Gingerdead Man", I can assure you they also make much worse.
They meet in an isolated parking lot where things get out of hand & Lincoln shoots Matt dead, Matt also happens to be Judith's lover so she has extra incentive to take both of them in.
No explanation is given as to who this demon is or where he came from & Goyer also throws in some of those annoying dream sequences & the demon taking the form of dead characters trying to trick those still alive, you know the sort of thing.
I would also like to know how that killer teddy bear managed to grow to human sized proportions.
The music by Richard Band sounds like, but not as good, the theme from the far superior Dolls (1987) which isn't a surprise as Band also scored that.
Jane Froman was also definitely a highlight for me as well.
His father was (also played by Christopher McDonald) an archaeologist too and wants to finish his father's work (finding a tomb of an 10- year-old prince who sold his soul to a demon for eternal life) after he finds the map in a book cover.
There are some huge holes and non-logical things in the story and the story is also very simplistic.
There also is an irritating lack of gore and there seemly weren't enough budgets to buy a couple of extra light bulbs, as entire sequences are filmed in the dark.
Seagal starts the movie off with some Tai-Chi and kicking that Stevie can't possibly perform in his shape and also sends his opponents flying through walls.
I also like the variation on Thai boxing : Thai Transvestite Claws and High Heels Boxing.
The shocking rape scene was really well done but I didn't like how she treated her boyfriend afterwords since he was helpless to save her.And then to kill herself afterwards was cowardly and not believable.Yes it was traumatic but I have never heard of rape victims taking their own life because of it.What the skinheads did was rotten,but then so was what the group of black men did to her and her boyfriend.And then later the same group of blacks targeted the white girls.I am sure it probably happens a lot also,but they don't seem to be depicted as bad guys which is a total double standard.At that point I was waiting for the skinhead group to get even with them for shooting an innocent kid who was only lured into it because he was mentally challenged.And they were also protecting their female members from being nearly assaulted which any gang would do no matter who they are.
)acts poorly also,usually having a rant then remembering he should be angry so suddenly starting screaming...I could go on and on about how pants this film is but ill summarise:  -Cardboard characters -Very disappointing storyline dealt with by earlier movies (eg: The Crow) -Diabolical Dialogue -Very amateur looking  Id recommended Romper Stomper if you want a skinhead bashing-fest or American History X,which is thousands of years ahead of this film,despite being made earlier.
Which was also a low-budget film, but with a vastly complex story-line and amazing acting-- let alone, actor.
The characters in this movie also have a complete lack of personality.
As I mentioned I also liked the nicely photographed corners of Strasbourg and the drama inherent in the smattering of tracking shots...  ... alas, these tracking shots are mucky, inconsistently rendered (an un-steadycam?).
I was also easily off-put by boom mic intrusion and imperfections on the print, as well as hopelessly rendered foley sound (really bad!).
What a bunch of idiots thinks about some delusion is interesting only if the filmmakers and audience are also aware that it is delusion.
I also have a problem with much of the acting.
The film also felt especially long.
It was just depressing and also boring.
> David Hartman also stars as a clueless pilot whose wife is kidnapped.
And we also get a public service announcement subplot in which it is revealed that businessmen tend to be stuffy and prejudiced, while guitar playing hippies and airport security chiefs can relate to each other.
Pernell Roberts' character is incredibly smug and self-important, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the director and the screenwriter - don't forget that "McGarrett", the hero of "Hawaii Five-O" (a very successful hit in the same era) was also arrogant and hard-nosed, and I think the writers were hoping to mimic that series success with a similar protagonist.
It's also not a comedy.
They also don't tell you that in every single state that has passed laws allowing concealed carry (there are 27 at last count), violent crime has dropped by as much as 50%.
However, a great role was also wasted, David Schwimmer could have done so much with his role as a gun crazed homosexual, but instead he was boring and useless.
There's also many misogynist images, such as the woman in the pink dress sweeping the porch.
It's also quite lame.
If your a die-hard Christian, even this is to much for you and your kids will be traumatized by the sickeningly overjoyed atmosphere of this tiny town which also evidently doesn't have any sort of Police Department, just the gang itself.
I also received this movie in the mail as a kid and did like it.
Not only is this the worst movie ever, it also has the most misleading cover ever.
After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials, head to the house, and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom.
The hole film is about a stupid disk on wich an old man says he found the key to predict the futur and wich is also the proof that god exists.
If a character runs for his life let him run till the viewer also is breathing heavily.
Every single one of them also either has commented on no other movies, or has commented only on other movies that starred Jim Fitzpatrick.
Robert Englund is also featured here, a few years before taking on his most famous role, that of Freddy Krueger in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies.
And Erin Moran of TV's "Happy Days" should be ashamed of herself for agreeing to appear in this (she also gets the unfortunate task of having the most gruesome sendoff in the film, a moment that still makes me cringe big time).
The film's big "reveal" also makes a mockery of the deaths we witness - only about 2 or 3 of them could be attributed to the supposed cause - at least 4 of them were just typical alien tentacle/arms/claws,teeth pouncing from some vent or pipe, and grabbing/mauling/suckering the victim to death - YAWWNN!
This forced drastic cuts all throughout it, especially in the "Second Generation" section, also at which point they'd run out budget for animation for the most part (filming at high contrast and using rotoscoping does not make animation).
They were also forced to sacrifice personality and development for most of the characters.
Well, shouldn't the others' human spirits also be able to resist Brother Blood, since they're all human?
It also tries too hard to be meaningful and deep, but it just isn't intelligent enough.
(I also cringe when I see 10 stars for this movie as they are obviously affiliated in some way) A film is either good or bad no matter how big or small the budget.
The dialogs are cra-p and also the whole story.
Legend of the Mummy, or Bram Stoker's Legend of the Mummy as it's also known is a tepid, dull, bland, boring none event of a horror film with a confused plot, no gore & minimum Mummy action.
would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10!
And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie?
I am also a fan of Louis Gosset Jr.
If you like watching bad movies for pure fun, I also recommend 'R.O.T.O.R.
Theoretically speaking, this is presumably one of the worst movies ever made, but simultaneously also the most entertaining piece of rubbish I've seen in years.
in fact,it's your typical action/crime drama.the characters are stereotypical for this genre.i also found the movie slow and depressing.i was quite disappointed.i was expecting a much better movie than this.the action is slow,and there really isn't much originality here.Andrew Davis directed this one.he also directed The Fugitive,Under Siege and Above the Law,all after Code of Silence.but it's not all bad.for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys,although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a 4/10
The film's single genuinely erotic encounter, a tiny puddle of style and sensuality in a quagmire of crap, it showcases the talents of cinematographer C. Davis Smith, who until then seemed thwarted by Wishman's ham-fisted approach, bringing to mind that he also photographed Â extremely well, I might add Â such adult classics like Howard Winters' practically perfect NEON NIGHTS and COED TEASERS, one of the frequently despised Lenny "Leon Gucci" Kirtman's finer films.
His uncle, who's also a police detective, goes after him using Arthur's address book as the only lead.
There are also too few scenes with the alien.
Bad acting from one person only doesn't necessary make a movie a total disaster, but when just EVERYTHING ELSE also are as horrible as they can be, then we have a movie that never should've been made.
Being on an epic movie kick lately, I decided to check out again this "lost" debut of Arnold Schwarzenegger's where not only is his then unpronounceable surname changed to the unimaginative Strong (in the manner of the stars of Italian peplums) but his voice was also dubbed by an American actor for U.S. theatrical release (which is unsurprising as his original vocal track - which is how I watched the movie myself - is virtually unintelligible at times)!
He also befriends what many believe to be the most interesting character ever created in cinema-"Pretzie".
Hercules in New York also boasts the finest action scene in cinematic history- Hercules versus the Bear, in which our protagonist, upon seeing an escaped bear, decides the best course of action is to beat the living crap out of it in front of his date.
Arnold also fights a group of sailors with a plank and throws them in the sea, the sound effects and horrible choreography in that scene is hilarious.
This may on one hand actually well be the worst movie I've seen, on regular movie basis that is, because on the other hand it's also the funniest movie I've stumbled across since I saw "Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail".
Then we have Olympus, not only home of the Gods but also home of the big evil city traffic, you can hear cars driving by and honking every second.
I have only listed a few of the errors in this movie here, since I won't spend the entire day of writing this review but I think the fact that Arnold Scwarzenegger actually managed to not only have a movie career but also got elected as a senator has to rate as the biggest of the lot.
Koronel's acting was also the best in the film - in fact, I think it was the saving grace of the whole flick.
While we're treated to an endless parade of bodacious ta-tas, we are also clobbered with a line-up of dorky dudes in wet Fruit Of The Looms.
There are also a babe with big breast in an almost see through t-shirt at 07:38 for 3 seconds, plus another babe with huge nipples at 25:03 for 5 seconds (!)
Finally was it also a strange "romance" that is hard to call romantic or funny, but at least didn't fail completely!
It is also surprising that he got a scholarship because throughout the movie he rebels against the coach.
But once he's is done playing the part with the section leader also playing on the star's drum, the band teacher walks up and says somethin to the effect of "you do what i tell you to do, and you're an asshole."
(And besides, I was also in band in high school.)
But...something that is worth a watch is also worth a telling, right?
She reminds me of the actresses of the 30's and 40's like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ginger Rogers, who had glamour but also a strong personality and presence.
The mother was also not amusing because she allows this psycho (Jackie O) to continue with her behavior and doesn't even care.
Why anyone would pay money to watch any sports movie is also beyond me.
I should also mention, this movie is painfully unfunny.
and then also has exploding diarrhea's out of fear (is this suppose to be funny as well?).
The earth is also invaded by CJ7s...what should be a happy ending is just awfully contrived.
You also have to wonder what the cast and crew thought when they sat down to watch the post-production cut of this movie.
Long shots also seem a bit of an alien concept for director Terry Marcel, who cut his teeth as a third assistant director on Carry On Cleo and never seems to have scaled those lofty peaks again.
It's kind of fun also to see how the scenarists managed to leap from one implausible, contrived plot development to the next - but that's a secondary matter because most of these films were beyond belief.
It also has some drawbacks, physically you are limited with what you can do.This is where Blackburn errs.The first half hour of scene setting as the characters get to know each other is fine, and the sex scene is convincing.
Not only that, but it's also hard to tell what's happening on screen for most of the time.
It also worries me that we have sunk as low as this in terms of humanity to consider this as entertainment,I love horror movies, but this had no redeeming features whatsoever.
The acting is also atrocious, and if you have not been living in the UK for the past few years you will not understand there mumblings.
But as soon as the titular incident occurs (and the titular incident really does occur; just in case anyone else suspected that the title was merely a jocular come-on) the plot suddenly helter skelters straight into a brick wall; turning into the kind of dated, tiresome trash that isn't only shockingly predictable, but also entirely unaware of its own predictability.
The film's twists are broadly apparent a full ten minutes before they occur on screen, which makes for an experience that isn't only boring, but also deeply and repeatedly annoying.
There's also a jealous & snoopy cousin, Chick, who's basically the villain of the piece.
So, the deaf and hard of hearing can also enjoy watching films that are awful piles of dreck!
The film is about a group of losers (listed above) who go to Costa Rica a week ahead of their fellow senior class members so they can ski the K-2...no, wait, that's also BETTER OFF DEAD (and about 4523 other teen films).
Garfield is also insecure and needs the approval of his rigid, unyielding mother who disapproves of his career choice and would prefer to see her son become a success in another profession.
I might have forgiven 'Surf School' for being an awful movie, but it's also one of the few that's managed to offend me on multiple fronts.
I also got the impression that there were gaps in the story in terms of explaining motives, but it may be that if I had taken more of an interest in the film I might have understood it better.
He just can't do no wrong - and also he can right all the wrongs done by Ash's character.
It also didn't have any humor to speak of.
Government cover-ups and high drama court scenes also lace this film, and they do so in the most predictable manner.
Tommy Lee Jones (Colonel Hayes Hodges) plays the same role he has played in the last 4 films he has been in, but he also shows the only intensity in the whole film.
Ben Kingsley is also disappointing in the small amount of screen time given to him, he basically appears to be a back-stabbing enigma, very hard to figure out.
{Aside from several future blacklist victims, it also boasts three future directors among its credits (Robert Aldrich, Robert Parrish and Nathan Juran) as well as montages from a fourth, Gunther Von Fritsch, whose directorial career never recovered from being fired from Curse of the Cat People.}
There is also an awful lot of shouting and screaming.
It could also be that this is always not a very good subject to base a movie around especially when there's documentaries like THE WORLD AT WAR that shows the very real horrors of what the Nazis did to their victims
Stella's life also turns out to be a tragedy in the making; she eventually discovers that those she loves have created a world of illusion for her and that reality is not a fairytale.
That film not only appeared a million times more real but it also limited the "quirky" quotient to one character -- Ruth Gordon.
The girl is Ginny (Anna Kendrick, also pretty bad in this.)
it also anteceded 'Marty' the quintessential realist U.S.struggling migrant antihero movie Where are you Paddy Chayevsky now that we need you?
You also get the usual villain driven soliloquy at the finale explaining his grudge he unbelievably held for so long (and the lengths he goes to settle it), and some homosexual undertones in one of the minor characters too.
Cecilia Cheung also lit up the screen, but not for her acting nor the character's development though.
It also boasts an unusual and exceptionally talented cast.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
Charlie also realizes what a jerk he's turned in now getting his brains beat out in order to enrich a bunch of gangsters who'll use him for as long as he's is still useful to them and when he isn't they'll drop him just like they did Ben.
(I wish I was making this up)  "I would also request, marine and navy helicopters and every reconnaissance plane the Air force has available!"
It's also really sad to see two fine actors--Ida Lupino and Ralph Meeker--reduced to crap like this.
Garfield is intense and charismatic, Palmer is sympathetic and warm yet also keenly intelligent and aware and Canada Lee gets a striking role as Ben, the role being a major move forward for the portrayal of African-Americans on-screen.
All I can deduce from what I've seen is Eddie Murphy refusing to sell his club to the local Lunar mob (who also has some grandiose plan to takeover the Moon or whatever), and as a result, he and company are chased around for about 2 hours (I assume 2 hours).
Hollywood has done much better, but it's also done far worse.
Not that E.Murphy's name is a guarantee of quality cinema anymore but at least he used to have some dignity, usually top notch character actor Joe Pantoliano(just watch"Memento") also sets something close to a career low here.
Written by Matheson, also the author behind Bill & Ted, I can't imagine what he has done to loose all talent the past decade.
Unfortunately, Robert Montgomery, playing the lead (appearing in mirrors and editorial commentary), also directs.
James Garner- a 60s laidback version suitable but also a precursor to Jim Rockford who had his Chandler moments.
Director Robert Rossen is also a master at creating pictures where a flawed main character creates his own suffering and pain and has a fundamental misunderstanding of women.
I`ve also got to point out that having the terrorist attack take place before the title sequence somehow feels wrong .
There's also a sex scene that I believe they did just to show what actress InÃ©s Vernengo really have under the dress... you know what I mean.
Of course there are positive points in this movie: It ends; it have some nice criticism about future of mankind and the paths that man are taking; the thematic is very interesting, although it's poorly developed; for a low budget movie, it's well produced for that age; the sequence where Rantes conducts an entire orchestra is wonderful; the doctor plays sax very well; the soundtrack of the movie is also brilliant; and it makes me wanting to watch K-PAX all over again.
All of this is probably foreign to those who haven't read the Bible, but this movie is just one man's interpretation of what he's read and the movie is definitely trying to sell his point of view as him and his wife are also in the movie.
Fredric March, though perhaps better known for his dramatic roles, can also handle comedy quite well (e.g., he was fabulous in "Nothing Sacred", and even in the dreadful comedy "Susan and God" he was one of the few who made the film bearable).
This fact renders the knowledge that Racette is none other than Sutherland's own wife in real life as well almost impossible to believe, since this is hardly borne by their interaction here Â least of all during a fragmentary sex scene that ludicrously apes Nicolas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW (1973) which, of course, also starred Sutherland!
And screenplays often take liberties with novels; also expected.
Not only did it not stick to historical facts (which would be understandable since Gregory didn't either), but it also completely changed the plot of the novel.
The Tudors on Showtime is good but also rife with historical inaccuracies.
She would never have broken the incest taboo; also, if Henry was really shunning her bed by that time, as Anne suggests in the film, then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the Tower!
It also suggest that something other than Henry's brute desires were at play here when he charged them with treason, which is not the case.
I also think Jill is a great actor, but was she's looking pretty anorexic these days.
There are also so many overly-stylized, almost campy moments that the film sometimes feels like a half-hearted parody of "The Exorcist" (the boys' 'good voice' when he tries to hoodwink the priests is utterly laughable).
Using better actors would also have lifted it out of boring mediocrity.
Findley also has some obvious, how shall we say, peculiar interests as we are shown various scenes suggesting sexual aberration of some kind and scenes suggesting sick violence with a sledge hammer.
This annoying little gimmick does not only interrupt the pacing and tension; it's also very pointless because the wildlife footage is unclear & fuzzy anyway.
It's also funny how the pivotal scenes in the film all seem to involve action being staged with the Angkor-esquire ruins looming in the background.
I'm sure that Cleopatra's make-up is also wrong but like I say, it's the story that keeps you watching.
Much to the chagrin of his wife who also doubles up as his secret secretary, Anjali (Takia) who tries to rid him off the habit, the obsession never seems to leave K. Enter, his friends who have quit the butt, introduce him to a certain âPrayogshalaâ with guaranteed results.
Irene Dunne who was 52 years old at the time and approaching the end of her movie career was poorly matched with Fred MacMurray who was 10 years her junior, which might also explain perhaps the lack of chemistry between the two stars.
Irene Dunne also sings in this movie but as much as I love and admire Irene for having been a great actress, singing was definitely not one of her strongest attributes and especially the first number is quite embarrassing; it would have been better if a professional singer had dubbed her voice.
It is also made quite obvious that the fast horse riding and being thrown of the horse was done by a stunt person.
And it is a funny film occasionally, but it also annoys with its constant attempt of being the hippest movie ever made, and partly seems like an overlong rap-video, which is more than tiring after a while.
Actually, he is such a nice guy that he is just being used by his two smoking hot girlfriends (played by Christina Applegate and Lela Rochon), and most of his hit-men buddies also hoodwink him whenever they can...
OK, Lou Diamond Phillips is quite funny at times, but as often as his character is funny, he is also annoying, simply because he is too exaggerated and stereotypical.
The supporting cast includes Elliot Gould, who, not surprisingly, delivers the best performance in the film, and Avery Brooks, who also fits in quite well as the hit-men's boss.
Yes, because there are some very attractive 'eye candy' actresses starring in it, some of whom also end up locking lips at several points (I won't spoil that part for you).
This is also a film that most parents should NOT let their younger children watch, due to the various adult themes.
Terry Bradshaw was also awful, actually revealing his disgusting rear end at one point in the film.
But I also have to have something holding the character back from intimacy, so the last woman he was in love with died tragically, it's so romantic, it explains everything so neatly, and it turns what looks like a negative into a positive.
There is also no chemistry between McConaughey and Parker which makes the so-called romance hard to notice.
Gee - wonder if she will with Matthew - er, sorry - Tripp...I also cant believe that the movie invested sooooo much time in a subplot where someone wants to murder a mockingbird.
He also has a poignant scene with Michael McKean as a lonely transsexual.
Vladek Sheybal as the head Russian spy is also quite good(he just oozes Eastern European charm).
The plot also was worse by ten fold.
His aim also includes freeing a General who is being prisoned by the Nazis at a concentration camp.
It's also filled with 1980s' pap pop music, which sucks.
Some may also find it heartless at who it pokes fun at.
Jeffrey Tambors portrayal as a disaffected bachelor is a quiet, sweet performance, but one that also has these moments of assertive strength that you are not used to seeing out of him as an actor.
This move also shows us the vulnerability of people negotiating a relationship which is rarely seen on screen.
It also addresses the reality of life after divorce in our culture.
Give me a break this is a very very stupid movie the story is ridiculous a total peace of vile crap.The gore in this movie is like no other movie I have ever seen they must have spent 2 million dollars on fake blood.It was almost sickening to watch the violence in this movie it makes "fargo" look like "the lion king".Uma Thurman's acting was absolutely dreadful.The screenplay was very bad also Quentin Tarantino tried to get clever with the directing but didn't quiet pull it off in my opinion.
After a blind date goes south, Jill unintentionally winds up in a gay bar with her girlfriends and they decide to make a night of it; luckily, exterminator/part-time jazz musician Jeffrey Tambor has also wandered in and the two singles 'meet cute' (he tells her he's open to "experimenting" and thinks she's a transsexual, she finds the situation amusing).
He's thoughtful and deep (and troubled), but also an old-fashioned romantic at heart, and Clayburgh's salty, sneaky wit brings out the best in him (he's dry, she's wry).
I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction.
The visual effects also vary, from the good (the robot looks menacing), the average (the spaceship sets) to the bad (the rocks in Saturn's rings look like they're in a pond).
It also proves that despite his age, Kirk Douglas remains as fit and athletic as everÂand that Farrah Fawcett's talent is really how loud she can shriek.
He has also brought along a new robot, "the first of the new demigod series" to aid them.
The captain also takes more than a passing interest in Alexis and decides to steal her from Adam.
The special effects also were exemplary staged and especially convincing.
- weren't exactly inspired (Douglas, by this time, was past his prime and, unfortunately, his stint in the sci-fi/horror genre - which also comprised HOLOCAUST 2000 [1977; the only one I've yet to catch up with, though it's been shown on Italian TV quite a few times], THE FURY [1978] and THE FINAL COUNTDOWN [1980] - is best forgotten!)
Some other things as well before I forget: - Bubbleshock (SJA) = Slurm (Futurama) - Mrs Wormwood (yeah that was also Matilda's mum but no matter) - The map of the Milky Way; according to Wikipedia its from Star Trek: TNG.
The director also doesn't give any reason why they would do so.
Then, we have Memento moments of going backwards in one part of the film, also parallel actions without interaction as in David Lynch films and all this cheep mishmash is followed by pale and somehow drunk zombies that look like bad navigated extras on the poor stage.
Nothing really good to say about this crap-fest....the acting as horrible,the script was lame,even if it was ad-libbed it was still bad stuff.Special effects non-existent,they mainly consisted of newspapers blowing around in the streets.The zombies were those half-ass done kind with just some pale makeup smeared and there and some blood dashed on here and there.Long camera shots of a dead spider on a counter and rain splashing in a puddle were also counted as special effects I assume.Apparently the special effects budget was shot in the opening scenes where a handful of soldiers wearing gear that looked like it was from WWII ran around for a few minutes taking cover behind objects as they moved toward some buildings as though they expected the zombies to shoot at them!
From the fevered mind of Howard Hughes came this warning to the American movie-going public that not only do we have to worry about the Reds conducting germ warfare on Americans, but they're also polluting our streams.
I also liked how all three video diaries are connected with each other...but that's all I liked about the movie.
The thing that annoyed me about this film was the shaky camera movements, it was tolerable at first but became a nuisance after a while, the storyline is very confusing, it even at times felt like there was no storyline, because the characters were never really developed enough for me to care about any of them, they actually bugged the living hell out of me, it also never really built up any suspense, at least not for me, because given the fact that I didn't care for any of the characters the film just bored me, plainly put.
To be fair to Olmi, he handles the events with some imagination - as they're presented in the form of campfire tales narrated by nomad Antonutti (who also takes on the role of Noah) to his people - and the images (accentuated by Ennio Morricone's wistful score) are often poetic...but the over-familiarity of it all and the distinct lack of excitement displayed throughout results in sheer dullness!
I also liked the way it was directed.
I also liked the way it was directed.
To add tedium to odium, it is also badly made.
The only sympathetic character is Rudge, and his character is also involved in the only piece of truth in the whole shoddy exercise - he gets into Oxbridge because somebody knew his father.
Saddest of all, the film misses the heart of the man, a man who was the greatest wit and lover of his age, a man who relished life and lived it to the fullest, but who also recognized the absurdity of the idea that man is a "rational animal."
I was very excited at getting to see new material of this wonderful classic - until I realized to my dismay that some scenes were also cut out!
I also felt like I really spent time in their lives and didn't just watch a story.
He also gives a jolly rousing speech in the House of Lords which makes us actually care about him for the first time in the film.
Further examination of the case reveals that it also has Ed Harris & Julia Ormond.
he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from.
The ending also was VERY interesting I thought.
The movie also consist of many A lister star such as Gena Rowlands, Sharon Stone, Gillian Anderson, Meat Loaf, and James Gandolfini.
Besides being a woman from 17th century England, Elizabeth Wetherby, It's also brought out that Andera was this 1950's looking spaceman, or spacewoman,in the very distance, about 300 to 400 million years ago, past that came out of the primordial soup and was to become the precursor or mother of the human race;The She Creature!
He also falls in love with Andrea which bothers Lombradi a LOT....
However unlike other screen villains, Lombardi is not only committed to his mission of calling forth an all powerful presence across the span of ages, he's also out to make a buck off of it.
He can also use the woman to call forth a creature from the ocean to kill.
Meanwhile another hypnotist who is also a researcher is staying at a house where an older couple and their daughter live.
There are also some cops looking into the deaths of people killed by the creature and the rich old guy makes a deal with Lombardi to bring his act of asking questions on the road.
There is a dog and also an unfunny butler and maid...all in all a rather talky movie with a lame monster that appears here and there.
Directed by Edward (50 movies a year) Cahn and written by Lou Rusoff (who also penned Dragstrip Girl, Cat Girl, Runaway Daughters, Apache Woman, Oklahoma Woman, and Girls in Prison; hmmm, I notice a violent femme pattern here), the She Creature is notable for Albert Kallis evocative poster, Paul Blaisdell's terrific prehistoric "she" monster (complete with scaly hooters), and the mesmerizingly gorgeous Marla English in what appears to have been her last role.
I also remember the little Sarah a real good actress at her young age.
And you'll also see a lot of strange "games" with food - befor and after having been eaten...I know i didn't understand the deeper sense of this movie, but it just was to strange for me...Don't!
On the technical side there was enjoyable urban and rural photography of Britain but there were also several very over-exposed sun-bleached shots.
why does she keep winding up in horrible films like this and Urban Legend (she was also in Scream 2 but that film was decent.)
also, Rose McGowan believe it or not, doesn't get naked in this movie.
I was also moderately impressed by Judy Greer as Fern/Vylette.
So if you eliminate any hope of subtext, you can also wonder why exactly it doesn't seem funny.
There is also a guest appearance by Michael Moore, but he does not have anything relevant to contribute, apart from a self-satisfied smirk.
And even details such as the houses, the seminary, and the view from the garret window,whence the howling of the bitter winter wind on the rooftops could be heard,were quite as described in the book.The screenplay also followed the book closely, adding new details,leaving out many others, but most importantly,never contradicting the story and nature of the characters as portrayed by Burnett.
If this film had been an original I would be inclined to give it 7 or 8 stars but because the best part of it (the plot) is lifted (and in the final credits it acknowledges 9 Queens) and also because I am really annoyed by pointless remakes - (Don't even mention Nikita!!)
The viewer also witnesses the brutal discipline of the Japanese military of that era, replete with punishment and beatings for those who fail to meet the exacting service standards demanded by superior officers.
It also takes a while to explain what exactly is going on, but overall it was enjoyable enough.
Interestingly, the film also features two other male characters, a shy, daffy researcher and an effete, snobbish actor, whose sexuality could also be questioned.
As if the absence of story wasn't enough, the action scenes are also poorly directed.
Him and the Japanese guy also kill the Hispanic dude and he's #6 dead.
And also he is very very smart and fast, and strong.
I also have to address the laughable hypocrisy in the film-makers trying to make a message (you read that right) at the end of the movie.
One can also see that Vinny Jones seems to be having more fun with his character than the rest of the cast because he has something useful to do.
Maureen Lipmann's performance as the selfish, conceited head mistress is also very good.
That also might be the reason this is also one of the least funny Cheech and Chong movies.
His opening soliloquy is also quite funny.
Michel Gondry, who directed this, also directed "Endless Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind".
*****SPOILER ALERT***** White Goodman (Ben Stiller) runs a very successful gym also and he won't stop at anything to get his hands on Peter's and he even agree's to give him more than $50,000 but that doesn't convince Peter to sell.
The funniest parts of this film were the ESPN graphics and jokes and Obscure Sports Quarterly, also a visual gag.
Not only because Kobayashi is one of my favourite directors and arguably a true titan of Japanese cinema any way you look at it but also because if his brand of socially-minded, emotionally cathartic tragedy could make the leap from his jidaigekis set in Tokugawa Japan to any other genre, that would be the war drama.
Kaji, full of youthful optimism as he is, attempts to befriend the Chinese POW's in an effort to both make their living conditions better but also improve their labour efficiency to appease his demanding military superiors.
I was somewhat insulted, but when the film began settled for enchantment which was sufficiently strong to keep me around when the second installment (I think there were only two, but this was 20-odd years ago) came along next night, when I also learned that the picture would be replayed throughout the promo which allowed me to make a tape of it.
We wish, sometimes, that Sara in her times of trial would be more defiant but realize, too, that she must submit to survive and also to protect her friends.
She remains compassionate toward and grateful to those who are her friends, including Melchizedek (you have to know the story) toward whom she is also a benefactor.
The 'video' does also not really appeal to the reality happening.
You also see the head moving when the actor gets replaced by the dummy of which you can then easily see the fakeness.
There's an unnecessary sex scene between Colum and two lesbian women(..Julie K & Regina Russell)that should also be erotic but comes off surprisingly empty because the director fails to establish whether or not they're actually even on top of him!
She also has a rather effective strip scene, removing her gown inviting pleasure.
It also seems that the film makers didn't follow through with all of their plot ends or ran short on funds or some other such nonsense (I will elaborate below).
The woman is trying to help him remember that he is also a wolfhound and that his human form is only one side of him.
They also never fully explain the gorgeous woman wolfhound's relationship with him.
Some childish special effects are also seen.
The Western trained top Pakistani military brass, who also speak English in their private environment, don't commit to war unless encouraged by the USA/UK.
They also seem so disinterested in modeling, except for maybe one or two, the rest of them seem so unsure.
However, the film also contains an offensive sight gag, when L&H accidentally slap white paint all over the face of an African-American passer-by.
This film has the grotesque tone/imagery also seen in - CABARET.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
He also doesn't count on structural flaws in the ship which cause it to take on sea water.
I remember seeing this film when it first came out, and also remember that is disappeared from the video store shortly thereafter.
He also knows that they only have two hours of so left before they go down.
To top it off, Jasper, down below somewhere, also happens to know of the sinking deadline.
On the vessel, also, is the wealthy businessman who provided the funds to spruce up the ship, as well as a hotshot football player and a lovely television journalist, who has a past with Aaron.
The supporting cast is very good also.
This painfully predictable comedy tries to delay the inevitable by coming up with a series of forced scenes and situations, and it's also visually dreary, despite the potentially majestic locations.
MANFAC also enabled Caidin to have his final say on some of the exaggerated powers of THE $6M MAN, especially that "running at 60 mph" trick (the suit's legs literally run out from under the wearer).
I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her.
I not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like Sollace Mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick.
I also am amazed that a movie with such seemingly humble and unglamorous themes has such a breathless pace -- no one could ever fault this sleeper/swimmer for being "slow."
I watched FRAT FRIGHT (also known as HAPPY HELL NIGHT), NIGHT SCHOOL, SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE and this film, HELL NIGHT, one after the other during the span of an entire week, and I have to say that all horror films in academic settings pretty much suck.
In other Kitano films I have seen, such as KikujirÃ´ no natsu, Sonatine and Zatoichi, there was violence (particularly in the latter two) BUT there was also a certain likability of the main character--even when he was not a "good" guy.
It also has their videos from back in the day.
Also, the idea of "robot-prostitutes" so to speak was also a bit disturbing and lame.
It also has some interesting extras like Chester Bennington's Tattoos and what they represent and some audio only tracks like high voltage and my December.
It also goes in great detail about the making of the in the end video.
Richard Benjamin and James Brolin also make efforts to make this movie better but miserably fail.
The problem may also be that there were some of the clichÃ© Hollywood scenes that seemed to be built in after the fact for the sake of wider audience appeal, leading to less audience appeal.
It also includes the making of 'In the End,' two extra songs which aren't on their albums and 'Crawling' sung by Bryson Jones and the Sweethearts of the rodeo all-star band.
The film also has an anachronistic cynical air , what on the eve of the Somme ?
I`m inclined to believe them and I`m also inclined to believe people in 1916 probably swore less than people in the 1940s so I doubt if the men in the trenches used the " F " word in every sentence   Unfortunately who German bullets didn`t claim on that grim day have been killed by the passing of time so the chances of someone who was there writing into this site and telling us their opinion of THE TRENCH are very remote .
Besides being an early film of Olivier, this film is also noted for being the film debut of Bonita Granville, then ten years old.
The always lovely Ann Harding is also worth seeing, as well as Florence Lake and Edgar Kennedy, who have a nice bit of comic relief in one short scene aboard ship.
I also did not understand the locations of certain scenes.
Jeffery Combs also appears in a spooky cameo part, that called out for more screen time.
It also bugs me that they must walk into a person's office when they're lost, especially since they know where it is and in spite of a few of them being killed along the way.
The music is also horrible and probably taken from a commercial or something like that.
The film also looks very amateurish as if done by a bunch of amateurs and it is no wonder this didn't even have a theatrical run in Italy.
The gore scenes are also very bad and the effects don't even look real as they did in the classics, created by Gianneto de Rossi.
They are quite sadistic and graphic at times, the "body splitting" and tongue impaling, being the most memorable examples, but still they are not as haunting as in the earlier films that were also effected by the soundtrack and visuals.
The butcher house sequence, however, is a pretty nasty as an idea and has some interest in it, too, and that is also easily among the film's "most interesting" parts.
Gore also lets down.
--Anyone who watches this video should definitely also watch Television's Vietnam: The Real Story, and The Media's Impact because that video would break so many of the lies contained in the PBS series.
Pyun also tries to justify the use of MacLish's exotic looks and stone-cut physique by mixing in plot elements involving tribal Indian traditions, shamanistic mysticism and and obsessed revenge against the men who killed her parents...but the results are ham-handed and clichÃ© ridden.The 'bad guys' are so slimy and one-dimensional that no one could possibly swallow it.
There is also the "professional" bounty hunters, who suffer from all the classic problems.
Enter Soccer Mommy on a her motorcycle and also carrying a whip.She comes in and beats up all those mean biker dudes all by herself beating them up with no trouble at all.The movie suffers from the four p's,it is predictable, preposterous,phoney,and putrid.
for me,this is easily the worst disaster movie i have watched to date.i didn't find it compelling at all,and the special effects were not believable.the movie was not exciting.usually,acting is not a big concern in these types of movies.however,in this movie the acting was the worst i have seen so far in the genre.i nearly quit watching before the end,but i decided to give it a chance.regrettably,it did not improve and i lost close to 90 minutes of my life.in my personal opinion,i would avoid this movie,as it is painfully tedious.i also felt embarrassed for the actors at times.the movie was directed by Tibor Takaks,who also directed,"The Gate" another movie i hated.he has directed other things since"The Gate",but i haven't seen any of them.anyway,I'd have to give "Nature Unleashed:Earthquake a dismal 1* star.
Especially since that OL episode also has the same level of scientific misinformation and technobabble.
I also think the addition of a love interest was a good idea despite its inaccuracy to the book, because that wasn't the goal of the show.
Director High Wilson, who also co-wrote the screenplay, doesn't just have a sitcom sense of priorities--he formulates each scene into a situation as well ("The golfing scene", "The supermarket scene", etc.).
Until tragedy brings everyone together, the characters are fairly exasperating--and, since the characters also function as gags, the "comedy" is rather mean-spirited.
aside from that, the theme song was also quickly slapped together, many of the lyrics were much like many children's shows, not rhyming, but sugar-coated and sweet.
Here little Abigail is also used to promote another modern-day form of elitism: the victims of today's economic woes get their shots in at today's fat cats (no doubt Corporate Executive types who get big bonuses).
It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.
Beside the fact that "Untraceable" is a shameless hit piece against net neutrality, it is also tasteless in its display of extreme cruelty, the kind which makes one wonder about the screenwriter's mental health.
I must also say that it wouldn't have mattered which character bought the farm in this movie because I couldn't care less about any of them.
The movie also ends somewhat abruptly, and the closing shot is utterly stupid and does not fit in with the scene.
Untraceable IP addresses could potentially cause a huge security risk for the country, and could also be exploited to be used BY our country for espionage.
They also don't pull up video, websites and webpages that fast.
Just that my 2 out of 10 rank is because there are some average battle scenes and incredibly you have the feeling that producers didn't try to save money though the outcome also looks cheap.
I am also very impressed with his work here.
And I like I said above, Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz and Thomas Gomez's acting was also very poor.
The happy ending all around seemed too pat for me also.
This was just the second film Powell directed (the first was Split Second, a 1953 noir film also for RKO that starred Stephen McNally and Jan Sterling), and it showed.
Of course this also means more predictability in the already thin script.
I just looked back at my notes on Highland: Endgame, still the only other Highlander movie I've yet to see (also never seen an episode of the show), and an a little surprised at how high it was rated then even at a C+ grade.
The music is also another kicker to go with the director's scheme of assault on cinematic style.
Owen and Rose's son, Philip (Angus MacFadyen), is also a gay man, but he has no problems with his sexuality.
There is also talk of it going through a re edit, but without addition filming I can't see how you can fix it.
This is the only film I know of which deals with angst over what must be a common enough fact of life among gay men and lesbians - that one of their parents is also gay.
It also concludes with the threat of a sequel, to which I can only respond with the Wilheim Scream our hunk unleashes just before the end.
There is also no reason it could not be translated to a fiction time and place without connection to actual events and then be a successful movie without the baggage.
The film is also filled with many superfluous characters who add nothing and simply confuse the story (something the rest of the script achieves quite well).
I was also taken aback with seeing the concept of the Vietnamese secret police travelling to Thailand to bump off our hero like an oriental KGB , sorry but I was under the impression the Vietnamese just wanted to be left alone and wouldn`t have the inclination to bump off Americans in foreign lands , but why let reality get in the way of a film that screams America good , pinko commie scum bad .
They have so much stock-footage from war films or from "National Geographic" specials.Yes, I have also seen the Japanese version too.It's not any better,they too sound like they are reading the scripts STILL.
Okay,I admit,I do like silly movies.Let's see,I sat and giggled, through "Esupai"(ESPY).I grinned at "Dakaiju Baran".Yes,I also sat smiling throughout "Godzilla vs. Hedora".But "Nostradamus' Fearful Prediction" is Toho's biggest,most fattest folly since "Godzilla's Leverage".
A butler/house-keeper type who also plays for humour and fails and a detective (Chance Ward) who is also very annoying and very unfunny.
Some of the scenes in "Apartment 1303" even fully replicate (or perhaps I should say 'steal from') "The Grudge" but are less effective in every way (for example, the scene in "The Grudge 2" where victims are attacked by the ghost's hair also appears here in much the same way).
It also reassures me that Mandy Moore can't act and Robin Williams can't seem to stop being an annoying asshole in every role he plays.
we also see the kids (these are the secondary subject, or maybe the primary)as they plod along setting up the camera but not in a childlike or juvenile way, they rig, set up the mixing boards, set the lights and rig the camera completely.
Some thoughts on this subject made me think of the new generation of filmmakers Cronenberg has to encounter (he also could be calling new filmmakers 'Kids', but this illustrates a more profound answer - maybe they are not, and they are taking over).
It could also just be a fragment of cronenbergs sense of humour.
Luckily, the hotshot police detective hired to the case also has the hots for her..
You also see some of the porn photo shoots for the website.
The interviews are also cut together terribly.
There is also a "no talking" feature which allows you to watch the movie without the interviews, which would be better, although if that's your bag, just get a Gothic porno.
Girls want to be sexy, but what if they also want to be cool?
True, but that is also the plot of this mediocre Lina Wertmuller film, Summer Night with Greek Profile, etc., as well as the plot of that other mediocre Lina Wertmuller film, the remake of Swept Away.
There is also the isolation of old and yough, and the gap of understanding.
There's Burgo The Slayer, and his motley crew of mutant turd warriors (seriously, their faces look like dried up bat excrement), who also serve no purpose except for getting all poisoned and dead, which gets Burgo very angry.
There's also an old dude with grey hair.
Cue our Hold Warrior, who plays the sides off against each other, to collect the rewards for doing so, but he also has his eye on a captive sorceress (Maria Socas).
I don't have a problem with the acting as such - I've seen much worse (but also much better) but Carradine seems a bit wooden throughout.
I don't need to mention that the villain #1 is also a bad-ass pilot.
Cronenberg has dedicated his career into revealing the ugliness behind mechanism by connecting it with monstrous things such as the scientist who becomes a fly, the victims of a car crash who become perverse, the TV producer who becomes illusional, computer game players who can't separate the game from reality, the exterminator who starts sniffing bug spray and also becomes illusional and can't separate truth from imagination, and most of his other work like in Dead Ringers, Scanners and The Dead Zone and probably in his older work that I have yet not reviewed.
Not as good as SHORT NIGHT OF GLASS DOLLS, the giallo film Aldo Lado did the year before, which I also happened to see the same time as this one.
The voices are also poorly dubbed with the children having adult voices, sounding like children.
This old actor, unhappy with the route of his career is also the symbol of the great problem faced by the elder ones: looking back and not finding something to be proud about.
It also rips off Citizen of the Galaxy with the whole "beggar/spy-in-foreign-land-buys-slave-boy-for-secret-society -and-gives-him-special-training" I'd also like to point out that they not only filmed a renfest in Northern California for the medieval/renaissance/whatever setting, but the exterior of the Ancient Greece scene was apparently filmed in San Francisco at the Palace of Fine Arts.
It is also quite possibly in violation of AFTRA rules, but given the quality of the rest of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised to discover that it was a non-union production.
Many watchers would also recognize Richard Kind in the role of wise man/Magi Wamthool.
Of course, that plan backfires in the mother and daughter's faces shortly after their new adjustment due mostly to the racked-up guilt that the young woman has for not being a real mother to her child, and instead having her own mother build up a facade around the actual truth of the situation just to save face of both her mother's and her own, also for not telling the baby's birth father her reasons for running out on him was that she was pregnant and scared and finally because of the interest a childless sex-education/sociology teacher (played by Jane Krackowski), herself trying desperately to become a mother with little luck, takes in her seemingly odd situation eventually forcing Panabaker to reveal the truth behind it leaving her character wondering if putting her baby up for adoption wouldn't be the best answer to her and her family's pressing problems.
I would have so loved to hear what Precious was saying, in her own way, but she mumbled, talked street while also mumbling, and a lot of it was just drowned out.
It is all MOMS idea also to move the family and not tell the father of the child that he made a baby.
I should mention that Lori Nelson (playing Van Doren's little sister) is also pretty hot in a "My Three Sons" kind of way, and she adds some nice eye candy to the scenes she appears in, kind of a "sweet" balance to Mamie's brasher, more assertive style.
There were also some questionable elements which I think are positive but can't really decide.
The slow reveal also applies to the introduction of Brad to the film, which occurs maybe halfway through.
I didn't quite get what it was all about because the whole movie just seem's like an endless montage of violence, one scene more violence than the other and of course there is also a lot of sex scenes.
Interesting from the viewpoint of seeing an early De Palma effort and also applauding his courage in making a film so critical of the Vietnam catastrophe, but the film lacks focus and ambles from one scene to another, lacking the incisiveness it needed to make its mark among the several really good anti-Vietnam War movies that came after.
I also think it showed the incredible sacrifices mothers will make; most other films and programmes about this subject show cold mothers who either kick their daughters out or resent them if they stay, which is not always the case.
I was also amused about how people riding inside the freight rail cars were standing.
The movie is also full of cliches (a love triangle, a young boy, a cold-eyed enemy, supporting characters early deaths - some of which you'll be grateful for!)
Most of the installments ran 15 minutes and Carlton Morse, the man who also created and wrote "One Man's Family", wrote all.
He also was a key character in Morse's "One Man's Family," playing Cliff Barbour when the series started in 1932 until he died.
We are left too often with Wade Boteler's far too bellicose Mad Hatter, and are also forced to suffer far too much tiresome comic relief from Tweedledum's Franklin Pangborn, although admittedly William Newell's occasional input as Tweedledee is just about right.
It is also responsible for several of the film's best scenes, most notably the nighttime feeding frenzy on an oil factory.
His ray is also a mess, possessing little texture or perspective, goes off in any direction and has an odd and distinctive curve to it.
There's also the kiddie aspect of the film, with a child lead who shouldn't be there, lots of pop-culture references and scenes, as well as a pop song for the main title credits.
The special effects are also disappointing, the film gets pretty slow later on and the dire music is completely at odds with what's happening on-screen.
Hedora is also a shape-shifter, which helps him fly through the air with the clumsiest of ease.
You also see dead bodies lying around.
So, although this is most likely the worst Godzilla, it's also the most creative.
There's also nonsensical exchanges like this, between Keane and another attorney played by Charles Coburn, who rivals Peck, Valli, and a young Louis Jourdan for giving the worst performance.
In the end, Valiant is mostly a harmless film but it's also a dull one and it isn't worth watching.
Most Disney fans are prepared to learn a moral lesson whenever they sit down with the popcorn and the kiddies to view the latest Disney venture, but they are also prepared to laugh, to have fun, and to enjoy the family time.
Troy thinks the map may also lead to answers to his father's death.
Maybe they can also find out why Rowswer is a... hopeless drunk.
PS--This film is also known as the MAY IRWIN KISS and is not the same as the 1900 film THE KISS--a knock-off film also made by the Edison Studio, but with more intense kissing and a more attractive couple.
The spirit of Buzzy contacts his twin brother, Edwin Pringle (also played by Kaye), a stuffy bookworm, and asks him to testify before the D.A.
Seeing someone act funny is not funny, unless the people around them are also funny.
When he wrote the book, he also said that was not an autobiography.
Julian Sands was also terribly misplaced as the Phantom, and didn't fit in at all.
Some symbolism is used in this movie: Vecino's dog (loyalty but also guardian) is used to remind us of the disloyalty towards the father the mother experiences when she meets Vecino.
MarÃ­a and her father sniffing on people, also demanding dog-like loyalty.
As he is also unable to structure the story in an interesting way, he is certainly no match for Pedro AlmodÃ³var who has better visual skills and has learned how to structure a story.
But that's also a little reassuring from the country that by now makes the most interesting movies in Europe.
Steckler hated sound and he also hated spending money on recording sound so he made a silent movie.
What makes this film so unpleasant and non-funny is that the film, though inept, is also a bit like being inside the mind of a sex pervert murderer--and seeing his depravity up close and in person.
One can't pass this story by without also noting that it could have been improved in many ways.
And the also big heart but with more bad mood heart of MarÃ­a.
I am a fan of Bela Lugosi but I also realize that he often appeared in cheesy films.
Despite this cool start, I also immediately realized that because it was made by a so-called "Poverty Row" studio, that the budget and overall quality would be suspect.
Note:Lugosi's arch rival Boris Karloff had a series of Mr. Wong Chinese detective flicks also directed by William Nigh.
It also seems to work on a visceral level, providing entertainment and laughs that it wasn't really intending.
Duncan is also rather stupid.
Daddy Day Care is also a lot better then The Haunted Mansion.
I also noticed when "Jericho" and "Cueball Carl" (*rolls eyes*) are playing, they rack the balls in numerical order.
Shooting Gallery was also an apt title.
Beyond that, there is also the question of whether humanity itself (presumably Western civilizations in particular) now saddles itself with unjust laws and punishments which do not "fit the crime."
But one could easily also imagine Bosnia.
There's also a bunch of bad guys out to find a map which ends up in Jackson's possession.
It's not an outstanding movie by any means, and it's also not a bad movie.
It also should be noted that viewers allergic to Christian propaganda should avoid this one at all costs.
The revelation that the hero is independently wealthy (evidently, at the age of 12, he invested in Microsoft stock) also warrants a few good guffaws.
Do I need to mention that the hero also is soulful and artistic (he sculpts!)
There's also a nice song over the end credits by late 80's/early 90's singer Neneh Cherry.
It's also full of eye-rolling schlock; like a bird that lands on Tracy's finger to listen to one of countless sermons.
Of course there was some good fun in it, but there was also far too much vulgarity and other tasteless forms of humor that I happen not to appreciate.
Little Brandon also holds his own.
There are also only two cases of female pirates (a common Hollywood clichÃ©) and neither were captains--just crew members on the same small and insignificant ship.
I was also wanting to get together with a friend I hadn't seen in a while.
Anyway, Marius, not seeming overwhelmingly disheartened when Valjean won't let him marry Cosette (and also says they're leaving for England), ends up at the barricades.
It also appears to be a flashback to the 1935 movie, where there was one present in those sewers as well.
'The Commitments', directed by Alan Parker, was virtually a musical; in the original, Doyle hilariously peppered his text with fragments of the lyrics of the songs his protagonists (a soul band) were singing; in the film, the songs were played straight, and pretty much in their entirety, and some of the subtleties of the plot were also lost.
Stephen Frears did better in making a low key film of book two, and is also at the directorial helm for this film of the final book.
He also looks a bit ridiculous swinging that Fred Flintstone papier mache club.
There's also a kid, who's annoying but he's in one of the film's best scene: the kid hides in a vase and the leopard sniffs him there.
It was very cheesy, especially the two minute period in which Saphira magically grows up; also, periods that spanned two months in the book spanned several hours in the movie.
I hope the Eragon is redone in the near future and is done better, and it would be great if the characters look how the are described in the book.For example Aray's looks don't fit her personality, which was also changed.
The C.G.I work done for Saphira was also well done, making her more lifelike than her human co-stars as well.
It also sets a stereotype that everyone who cheats on their husband or wife their husband or wife is cheating on them.
Not only that, but he is also a disgrace to the entire human race.
And also, i hope the so called 'stars' of this 'feature' understand that they will never get an 'acting' job again.
I also feel bad about the people who worked with him on this 'project' did they, like, know he was a joke?
I also thought it might have been made as a joke or something.
Not only did the script completely lack any true depth, but also R.Kelly's performance as the singing narrator was accidentally comedic relief, as the whole film was, though not intended to be.
However, if you liked AlmodÃ³var's excellent drama you will also like 'Solas'.
The two films have certain similarities inasmuch that also in 'Solas' the accent is very much on strong characterisation, profound human feelings, though perhaps a little less intense here than in AlmodÃ³var's film.
Benito Zembrano - as AlmodÃ³var - , not only directs his film but is also responsible for the script, which is truly magnificent, especially taking into account certain Andalucian styles of speech.
The actors are also mostly to be rated B, the series wasn't very challenging anyway.
IMHO they focused on the wrong characters (the kids and the overprotective mother were just plain annoying) and the plot just dragged on and on(which can be said about pretty much every episode, but also on the series as a whole), without reaching satisfying peaks, without noticeable progress on the characters mission to reach "new pacifica" and without a closure that suits the promises made by the set-up of the series.
My vague -and perhaps mistaken- recollections also include an absence of visual attractions: In my mind, people are walking all the time on dirt; all around looked like brown dust, and that's all there was.
The soundtrack is also poor but the animation is 'ok'.
And how does GrÃ¼newald react to this remains also a mystery.
Everybody plays on the piano in this hotel which is also without interest.
(which by the way is the LAST thing a killer would leave laying around without washing it off - duh)  It's also unusually sad to leave the cute little son an orphan because of his dad's bad behavior.
It also very well deals with adversity just as things are going so well.
He also loses his job because of his obnoxious ways.
This film is also known as The California Axe Massacre which is strange considering it was filmed in North Carolina.
Written and directed by Frederick R. Friedel, also known as Lousy R. Director.
It also features a poorly developed plot and characters (apparently due to a rather rushed production in order to meet distributors demands), several totally unbelievable moments (Lisa being able to dismember one attacker in the bath unseen, and then even convince the gullible 'nice guy' that his partner in crime did it!)
Ray Green was also in only one other film.
The title escapes me, because the heroine uses an axe (again off screen) but also uses many other devices.
A group of guys force their way into a farmhouse where a girl lives with her paralyzed father who may also be a deaf mute -- who knows?
It's also fair to say that this film is merely a dull reworking of better and more successful films that came before it, and if you want to see some sick seventies blood and guts; you could do a lot better than this.
and some axe wielding and also boringly slow moving terror soon happens.
This is definitely among the things that I will remember about this film, and also the final nail to the coffin of these "so twisted and insane no wonder the directors don't have plenty of future films on their credits" films to which the mentioned Pigs, in which, the pigs of a mysterious old farm keeper eat people, also belongs.
Still this is an exploitation film and includes also some nastier bits and gore, with the kind of close-ups and other camera proofs that make it clear what were the motives to make this film and market it like.
Some imagery is impressive, and well worked out in the relation with the soundtrack (also not bad), but i don't consider it enough to justify the time it lasts.
I also wanted to see it because of the star filled cast.
I also found practically all of the music to be terrible.
I also pitied Merle Kilgore, who is a true song-stylist of high quality, having written many big country & western hits including "Wolverton Mountain".
If this isn't enough this movie is also boring and not scaring at all.
The acting, apart from a 17-year-old Uma Thurman and a cough and a spit part from the ever-reliable Steve Buscemi, was also abysmal.
This truly obscure neo-noir from 1988 is memorable as Uma Thurman's first starring role and also has a bit part from Steve Buscemi.
uma thurman fans will also apply, but will need to beware just in case.
and i always found that weird how Hollywood also lock away films for years and then releasing them whenever.
But I think this is a case where the director (also a primary actor in the story) got himself too involved and lost perspective.
You could also say this mixes the various sniper/killer films popular at the moment with an xmas film.
The climax also looks artificial & abrupt.
Abby, also named Ugly Duckling who gives advice to Chicken and establishes nothing except for a weak love antique.
There's also an alien invasion taking place which proves to be a perfect opportunity for the latter.
Keep a look out, because there are also Finding Nemo (lawn-mower) and Signs (corn crop-circles) references.
IRINA PALM also has problems with genre.
For years, Cannibal Terror was believed by many to be the work of horror/sleaze director Jess Franco, a reasonable assumption since the film bears what seem to be most of the prolific Spaniard's hallmarks, most notably a dreadful script, unconvincing locales, inept direction, terrible acting, and endless meandering shots of nothing much in particular (and I guess, for some, it was also hard to believe that there might be another person out there who could make films quite as bad as Franco).
It was also mistaken for Franco's DEVIL HUNTER because it basically shares an almost identical kidnappers-stranded-in-cannibal-country premise.
It says here that "Allan W. Steeve is an alias for Alain Deruelle, yet also lists the films co-star, Olivier Mathot, as well as Spanish actor Julio PÃ©rez Tabernero, as additional uncredited directors.
It also commits the cardinal trash movie sin of being extremely boring.
Meanwhile, the parents of the kidnapped girl have also arrived in the jungle (don't ask me how, though), but they're good people and hence don't get eaten.
"Cannibal Terror" is also set in the jungle.
Apart from being the whitest savages ever seen on film, they are also astonishingly well-behaved, as they never seem to leave their territory, and their hunger for human flesh obviously concerns bad people only.
But pretty much everything else is rubbish - not only do most of the characters overact, they simply also act stupidly and in many cases with no logic at all.
In all fairness, this is also the fault of bad direction.
Halle Berry was number 99, and Dame Elizabeth Taylor number 77 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses.
Rarely have I enjoyed a film this much when I also found so much wrong with it.
Dorka Gryllus is also wonderful as the young veteran of glory hole work.
Its a pretty stupid concept which is not scary at all and also can be a little confusing at times.
And though not a master, Crime Spree also steals liberally from Guy Ritchie as well, right down to the bridge scene in Lock Stock.
On the other hand, this multifaceted actor, is also well-known for being in some of the most bizarre and random horror movies throughout the 60s and 70s.
Several films with Paul Naschy are well-known for having a little bit of everything, so I supposse I should give a friendly warning to anyone who thinks "La Noche de Walpurgis" is also going to be like this.
It also has another agenda for the blue collar Archie Bunker and fat-ass delusional shut-in set: "Turn off the damn TV!
He's also FANTASTIC at comedic development, in really building up the various circumstances that snowball into a torrential storm of humor.
There were some nice touches here and there - the valet's father is chronically sick, but the doctor who attends him is even sicker and the father ends up attending to his physician more than the reverse; I kind of liked the jag-off cell phone salesman who is also pursuing Ledoyen, at least at first, he's so over-the-top smarmy.
She also had way to many flying fighting moves.
He also teaches Chun Li the Kikoken.
There are also sub plots connecting the characters to one another in essentially stupid and pointless ways, just to fill in the lengthy gaps between action scenes.
This movie could have just been some run of the mill, stop the bad business man movie, and aside from the names of the characters and the organization, and also TWO moves from the games...it is.
Nash (Charlie from the games) also has black hair, works for Interpol...and that's it.
There are also a lot of over played scenes by useless characters such as Chris Klein's Interpol character and the other Asian chick that also has no purpose.
The choice of camera shots used to try and show the story was also done badly.
THE BAD The costumes in this movie can also suck it.
Cremaster 2 proves two points: that art and art films alike are not judged as works alone but run as a popularity contest by a small elite few and also that the less people understand something the more intellectual it must be.
I've also seen two other projects.
But Maggie's role as Irina Palm has given her confidence and also opened her heart not only to her grandson's future but to her own happiness as well.
She also finds a good friend in single-mom Louisa and seems to be getting a long fine in her new business.
The dialect used by some characters is also incorrect.
This is very wrong though but very obvious and unavoidable also.
2) Tiled swimming pool and hose pipe were also not available during that time.
The whole love story also doesn't work for me.
You would also think someone 12 and under (I'm just assuming that most teenagers wouldn't take this part too seriously) would not want to imagine that some adults with really big guns do, in fact, hunt kids for a living.
It's a gauzy, soft-focus, soft-headed confection about a playboy who becomes smitten with an attractive woman while on his way to marry somebody else; she's also otherwise engaged, and their on-again/off-again relationship has the same old-fashioned complications as the other versions of this highly-concocted plot.
Irina Palm is also one.
However, this also works against Ursula, because since this is a relatively polished piece of film making, it doesn't even have the unintentional humor of ineptness that gives many trashy movies such as this cult following appeal.
He has also co-written the script with Philip Blasband.
So at least, he aims to please and for the bigger part also succeeds.
"Deathstalker II" also features an Amazon tribe and warriors with human bodies and pig heads (one of those was my favorite character in the first film).
Because GALLOPIN' GAUCHO appeared after these two other films, it is less interesting from a historical viewpoint and also, unfortunately, isn't quite as entertaining.
There's also a cool soundtrack.
It also requires Jimmie to clean up his act before Anne leaves.
I assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was I wrong.
She too notices Mickey and also finds him very attractive and they dance together (once both have impressed each other a little more).
Minnie is also quite hot, and Pete is suitably villainous.
I also don't require movies to spell out everything for me, but this was certainly one of those adaptations where people who had not read the book were a bit lost.
There are also numerous scenes of somebody playing billiards with himself (no, not pocket billiards!)
Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain.
There is also a photo gallery and the original trailer.
The director and writer, Audrey Wells, also directed and wrote The Truth About Cats and Dogs.
Audrey Wells also wrote Inspector Gadget; clearly, her writing leaves something to be desired.
"If you like this title, we also recommend...  Boa vs. Python (2004) (TV)."
Of course, they wait till the last couple minutes to bring his son, who also has healing powers and can bring people back to life.
They also seemed to miss a major plot point after all of their study.
Unfortunately, this silly miscasting was common in the 30s-50s, as the likes of Rock Hudson and Kent Smith also played Indians (among MANY others).
While still chilling and ambitious, he is also sympathetic and loves his wife to death.
It's also the last time we see the Batman characters in the Fox style before their revamps on the WB network, plus, with the exception of the "Old Wounds" episode, it's Dick Grayson's last adventure as Robin.
Arkham is also the hot spot for zombie activity since Dr. Xander (Christopher Slade) had already used his blood sample to turn a female student who tried to blackmail him into a zombie.
She also hitches a ride from a guy (played by Jim O'Rear) who takes her to a drive-in playing SEE NO EVIL and SILENT HILL.
Second the soundtrack, which had a couple decent rock tunes, but also featured some really weird out of place techno music during a love scene, that was quite laughable.
Fran Striker who created The Green Hornet also created the Lone Ranger and the Ranger's creed was always to shoot to wound.
One of the detectives, George (Lorne Brass) is a homosexual steeped in sadism and it is Marcel's determined efforts to keep the hidden money from the duo while fiercely struggling physically against them that comprise about half of a plot line which also focuses upon the young man's endeavour to repair a severed relationship with his dying father (Roger Le Bel).
Also the fact they could seem to defy gravity by crawling on walls and ceilings also detracted from the enjoyment of the film.
Shirley Walker used Elfman's theme in this one and used it well, she also created her own themes and did a great job of not letting the music get too loud but rather score the emotions that the characters are feeling.
After all those years without shooting a blockbuster, Miner gets a cast which is above average, gets a decent budget, he also gets the name "Day of the Dead" (being a remake of George Romero's original one from 1985).
I am a big fan of Craven, but i'm also a big fan of horror.
I also want to point out that i very rarely will comment on films because it is almost pointless, but this film was one of the biggest let downs in all of the movies I have ever seen.
Acting was also mediocre at best.
Acting was also mediocre at best.
It also might be Jack Lemmon's first film too.
This film, one of the more notorious titles on Great Britain's 'Video Nasties' list, is nihilistic, grisly, and darkly funny...but also shallow and ultimately unsatisfying.
This movie also serves as notches in the acting guns of Urich and Torn.
However, the film attained it's nasty status primarily because of the graphic cover of a hobo being drilled in the head and also because it had a catchy and memorable title which the British tabloids could bandy about whenever they produced an article about the dangers that this new breed of violent films posed to civilisation as we then knew it.
He, of course, is mentally ill, but he also has that same sad vacuous thing going as well.
There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons.
I mean, I do like "Under siege", "Die hard" and also some of Jacky Chan's works, but these flicks at least do have descent settings and some funny dialogue.
The beginning is also good, but as the whole film it's said in just a few words and a movie would never look fine read as a bedtime story.
And also how is it possible so many people found it funny??
Oh, and also, Will Ferrell has a terrible voice!
Oh that's right, Adam McKay, the guy who directed and wrote that movie and also directed and wrote this one (There was a script?
The two stars pulverizing a playground full of eleven-year-olds is also, you guessed it, not funny.
The film also suffers from a degree of unoriginality, nothing is recycled directly from the previous McKay movies, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I've seen this all before, or that McKay and Ferrell weren't even really trying anymore.
You also get the feeling that, if nothing else, the actors are having a good time, which keeps the film from being something truly terrible.
I'm also a sucker for randomness, and it succeeded at making me crack a smile a few times because of it.
The soundtrack is also quite disappointing, especially in terms of what was chosen as representative examples of Moog performances over the years.
In other cases, the interview location (city) was titled, but not the name of the person speaking with Bob Moog and that was also disappointing.
I also agree that certain comments were repeated, especially Bob's comment on having a feel of what was going on within the Moog's circuitry when he played it.
Since he also discussed the Theremin (which seemed to be a major portion of this documentary) it would have nice to included some commentary about Miklos Rozsa and the role the Theremin played as the only recognized synthesizer as an "orchestral instrument."
I also seem to remember that Tangerine Dream are never mentioned or any of their music played.
Bill Forsyth went on to the film "Local Hero", which is also right up there with the greats in my scoring.
I also really didn't learn much about Moog's life, or the real history & development of the instrument.
Not only is THEREMIN incredibly informative, but also rather touching.
The TV movie before 2010; KR2000 was crud but it at least had some relevance to the 80's series, Team Knight Rider was also terrible but still had ties to KITT and The Foundation.
It's also full of funny moments in the background, such as the hopeless high-jumper or the penguin wandering the corridors of the school trying to find the right room.
It's also good to see a Scottish film that has nothing to do with drugs and "murdur" and is instead a light-hearted comedy.
I also do so, but to utilise the character of Noah Wyle in a more fruitful manner.
Not only that but Young Danny also happens to make a mean enemy (can't he ever get a break?).
Here Myagi must settle affairs with his dying father, and also face an old friend who holds a forty year grudge.
But one is soon also reminded of why it proved such a massive hit, in spite of it's low budget, unpretentious nature.
But the gentle narrative eschews the obvious clichÃ©, and it's also nice to see a story set in a Scottish housing scheme that isn't just a tale of drugs and A.I.D.S.
These were made for Mack Sennett (also known as "Keystone Studios") and were literally churned out in very rapid succession.
Jim is also a bitch to Kim throughout, throwing constant attitude at her and caring about nothing but his job and reputation.
The fools also, though by now it's obvious that the little men are afraid of the light, never turn on the lights.
While the main plot is obviously about Gregory there are also plenty of other interesting characters including two boys who work for the school magazine who make money selling photographs of Dorothy in an unofficial shop they've set up in the boys' toilets, here we also see Gregory's brother selling assorted pastries and various boys having a smoke.
They also knew when to hit the breaks, and take their money out in time first: Insider Information.
Oh, I also like to take MW's challenge on playing Hockey in the vicinity of the Capitol !
maybe they should also check out how the evening news are edited.
I also like horror movies but that's not because I think psycho-killers should murder people.
I read the reviews of this film here and decided that, as a Michael Moore fan, it would be interesting to see this filmmakers arguments and also to see what a jerk Michael Moore can be.
That way, you can judiciously edit the film in much the same way you accuse me of doing - that is to say, so I look like a complete idiot - and also get to become a millionaire in the process."
Okay, so that's ridiculous, but still, this filmmaker is suggesting that Moore owes it to the NRA or Charlton Heston that his film also includes all the nice things he said at his NRA speech?
A big difference between Moore and Wilson is also this; Where Moore gets people to speak their mind, Wilson will get to use the interviews as long as "they don't look bad".
In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king.
But he also has personality.
Personify good, and you must also personify evil.
The ending for the American version was also changed.
Incidentally, the old lady who says something unintelligible in the bookshop is also called Clift.
The nightmare however does end , but only after you've suffered a wasted 70 or so mins of this mess .Fans of bad films will enjoy this , it could also be used as an example of how not to make a film .
If Hawke was trying to channel Linkletter's Before Sunrise/Sunset, he should have also created characters whose motivations and reactions are at least somewhat plausible, even if they happen to be 20 year olds.
To be fair, there is also no attempt to call it science.
I also find the scenes between Gregory and his sister Madeline very touching and heartwarming.
That also describes the whole episode.
Its also a really good thing the the library keeps a drawer of civil war era photos and that they just happened to have both Mulder's and Melissa's past personas there.
Then I also love the following dialog between Mulder and Scully:  MULDER: Dana, if, um... early in the four years we've been working together... an event occurred that suggested or somebody told you that... we'd been friends together in other lifetimes... always... wouldn't it have changed some of the ways we looked at one another?
Evil Eddie also enjoys pulling grotesque faces, saying 'Feed me' every eight seconds in a deep, synthesized voice, and stomping around town, turning the local people into zombie followers so they can eat food for him.
Director Bill Forsyth, who also wrote the script, populates this, his second feature, with characters we can relate to so easily that watching them trip over their hormones makes us care and feel embarrassed for them.
Forsyth's first outing, "That Sinking Feeling", also gave us very real characters and placed them in situations not far removed from the everyday.
Robert Buchanan, who plays the lovable Andy, also appeared in "That Sinking Feeling", and here turns in an unaffected, terrific performance as a horny youth who longs to travel to Caracas, Venezuela, where -- it's a "well known fact!"
After seeing A Walk to Remember, I was confident that Mandy's new film will also be good, but it was rather disappointing.
I also thought that Mandy will be singing in the film, but since she didn't, a prettier, more proportioned actress would have been more fit for the role.
She also directed the completely bland Wedding Date.
The movie also gets pretty dull and I didn't really feel for any of these characters.
Much like Julia Roberts in Steel Magnolias, Mandy also gets an awful boy haircut and maintains her vulnerable but compassionate spirit despite all of womanhood's trials and tribulations surrounding her at every turn- through the guise of her caricaturishly naive and impossibly flat-haired pregnant friend, her sister who has a dwarf's build (no neck, huge head)and does the worst-ever portrayal of a drunken bachelorette, and her constipated-looking crone of a mother who got dumped for a younger woman who dresses badly.
The plot was all over the place; my friend (also a seventeen year old female) and I would stare at the screen and whisper, "What the hell was that?"
The lack of character change/growth and of any conceivable end goal also made any attempts to generate a conflict or climax to the film moot.
(Although he also yells something at Van Helsing)Preys on Lucy only when asleep and/or sleepwalking.
Wender's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying.
I won't spoil the ending, because I was too confused by the uneven plot to know what happened (I also stopped paying attention mid-way through.
It's poorly made to be sure, but somehow it's also fun and mesmerizing at the same time.
It was finally sold to TV with the lucrative title of MAN WITH THE SYNTHETIC BRAIN, but Sherman thought it could be milked further, so the movie was also played at theaters where it became known as BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR.
But this man-made killer's got an angry dad who's also a scientist and is even nuttier than Dr. Vanard.
The film also shows all the hilarious vice rackets that existed around 80's schools during lunch breaks, plus the pompous 'cock of the walk' bravado that naturally seems to accompany young men around the fairer sex.
This version is a British live production with a few notable British comedians covered in makeup and costumes so you hardly recognize them(especially Dudley Moore but also including Peter Sellers).
Offbeat director Andrew Bergman has done better work I suppose ("It Could Happen to You" -- also with Cage) but, to tell you the truth, I just don't connect with his style or humor.
I also wonder if Pierce Brosnan ever looks back and winces when he recalls being the star of this film?
The director also achieved a great contrast in moods and environments, with the 1970s prog-jazz score and understated sterility of a boxy 1960-70s planned community with its plain institutional nature shown by the modern school and town planning.
It's also chock full of incredible sexism (some of the lines had me cringing and EVERY woman was falling for Cosby and Hope--who were in their 50s) and pointless song and dances.
Cosby did have a beautiful voice and some great songs--Hope also had his songs and some very funny comedy but none are evident in this movie.
The horribly conceived "it's time to grow up" moment in question though is when Sam (Shane Powers), a friend of Jacksons, kills himself because he's also secretly in love with him!
The film's pre-credit sequence, in which a German fraulein is being pursued through the forest by a barely-glimpsed fiend is promising enough but, as it turns out, it's also the best sequence in the whole filmÂwhich ought to give you an idea about the worthiness of the whole enterprise.
but also made the parts of the narrative and the revelatory climax particularly incoherent!
But little Davey also gets himself hit by a car while chasing his dad.
The special effects themselves were also erratic - obviously a lot of money was spent on the set of the sub, but the cgi shots ranged from the okay to dreadful.
With David Jason as the lead and also one of the producers, I expected a lot more than I got when watching this.
There are also too many main characters.
Featuring some really fine musical performances, it is also at times cloyingly unwatchable.
It's also a movie that IMDb reviewers have greatly praised .
The directing style was also confusing.
This jump cut editing also seems a bit dated as well.
The scientists also recreate a 'virtual reality" setting that looks like something from the 1960s where the scientists hope the spy will be duped and eventually hand them the missing memory (the spy knows a lot about history, which is the explanation for the elaborate set-up.
It's also cheaper this way.
I also feel that sophie and riya sen must get some acting lessons.
There are too many stuff in this movie that is really cheesy, like a boy she just met Â she called him Boyfriend, who happen to get every jobs in London, who is also happen to be hired in the Lord's party to sing in the band that can play any song, just ordered!!.
John Gordon Sinclair (Gregory) and Claire Grogan (Susan) have gone on to become well-known members of the British acting profession; Claire also had a pop career as the lead singer with Altered Images.
Much of the humorous dialogue also had something of the surreal about it; Phil, asked by the headmaster how Dorothy will cope with having to shower with the boys, replies "Oh, she'll bring her own soap".
Unfortunately, while there is something to some of the plot, this Italian film also has a lot against it.
Nicely though somewhat statically directed by Michael Curtiz, The Matrimonial Bed also features some nifty set design and a few memorable shots in silhouette.
Fans of "Last of the Summer Wine" (though it had stronger character development) or "The Vicar of Dibley" (if you thought the humor in the latter is too intrusive) will doubtless take to this series like ducks to water, but others be warned: this has nothing of the warm character development of "All Creatures Great and Small" or the sophisticated humor of "Yes Minister" or "Hot Lead" (but also blessedly none of the camp of "Are You Being Served").
(Fortunately I'd also rented a Midsomer Murders DVD as well, so we watched that.)
I also didn't like the fact that the scummy rapist judge didn't get shot at the end and was allowed to completely get away with forcing himself on another woman!
To see more things that ruined this great idea read the "goofs" section and also the "memorable quotes".
The gin-swigging, hard-bitten crime writer, the grief stricken parents, the old guy with months to live, the jive-talking pop star (Sonny Bono sporting a hideous shirt and massive flares), the rugged, no-nonsense Captain (Robert Stack - amazingly also in Airplane!
He also has some of the worst lines in the movie: "I was in a motel room when I got this call.
also, you can basically tell how the movie ends about ten minutes in to it and no one in the movie can act very well.
It was also flatly directed, attempting some form of style (no wonder it's Phil Alden Robinson's first film in ten years), which only managed to irritate, and STILL that American anti-smoking message gets through, because, as this film wants you to believe, only neo-fascists who kill innocent people smoke.
There's also some hideous stock footage of emergency vehicles on the ground, as well as tiresome sidebars to George Maharis playing a security chief at Kennedy Airport with a toothache.
There is also very little character development, the President's motivations are poorly understood, the paranoia of Fowler over the new Russian President's motives was poorly developed, etc etc.
It is primarily set after the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the nuclear arms race with the Russians, however it's also a prequel with a younger, cocky Jack Ryan (plug-in flavor of the month Ben Affleck) and with the principle villains being Nazis.
It also doesn't help that we can't connect with the characters.
It also has one interesting little monologue about how the internet and technology has connected terrorism globally like never before.
But I also have read the book several times, and the comparisons are inevitable, as several other people have done.
The gin-swigging, hard-bitten crime writer, the grief stricken parents, the old guy with months to live, the jive-talking pop star (Sonny Bono sporting a hideous shirt and massive flares), the rugged, no-nonsense Captain (Robert Stack - amazingly also in Airplane!
He also has some of the worst lines in the movie: "I was in a motel room when I got this call.
The plot is confusing and mind-numbing, Jake unknowingly plays a role in releasing a deadly spirit as he attempts to learn tatau, the Samoan tradition of tattooing and at the same time trying to hook up with an asshole father's daughter who has also an asshole of a brother, the 3 are as bland as Jake himself (with possible exception of the asshole father).
There's also the moments when Jake tattoos people, they just sit down in his chair & the goes to work, they never say what they want or where they want it & then these people just get up & walk out without paying, I'm not being funny but if I was having a tattoo (which would be for life) then I'd at least want to pick the design & where it was going.
Like the girl he is also a gypsy and lives in a hut he made down by the river where he spends his time lying around waiting for women to wander by.
It can be very appropriate, believable and effective, but it can also go badly wrong.
It also boasts the always enjoyable Larry Miller in a too-small part.
Adding to the inescapable feeling of absurdity here is a cheesy score; the twist ending, then, is entirely predictable but also incredibly daft.
On their way out they drain and turn Veidt Schmidt(played by Reggie Nalder, whose wrinkles are more frightening than anything in this movie), who also skips the 'dying' part.
For plot motivation they also bring along their two dogs and a litter of puppies.
It's just middle of the road, never taking itself seriously enough to be campy, but also not self-aware enough to be tongue in cheek.
The dog's name is Zoltan, and Veidt can apparently communicate with him via telepathy (he talks a lot without opening his mouth, so either they are telepathic or Veidt is also a talented ventriloquist).
There is also a "hooter honker," which is a pair of bulb-type bicycle horns.
The gin-swigging, hard-bitten crime writer, the grief stricken parents, the old guy with months to live, the jive-talking pop star (Sonny Bono sporting a hideous shirt and massive flares), the rugged, no-nonsense Captain (Robert Stack - amazingly also in Airplane!
He also has some of the worst lines in the movie: "I was in a motel room when I got this call.
The mock documentary approach (also used in Bechard's PSYCHOS IN LOVE), where characters talk directly to the camera, is fun and used well.
More deaths occur as the new Doctor, Patrick Roland (Joe Dallesandro) can't quite believe what is happening at the hospital and he too also starts to have his suspicions about Sister Gertrude.
On an interesting note, the stewardess uniforms that Brooke Adams and Farrah Fawcett are wearing were actual uniforms for TWA and can also be seen in 'Catch Me if You Can' at the end when Leonardo DiCaprio climbs out of the plane through the toilet.
The only good thing about this is that his obnoxiousness overshadowed the few times that the normally funny John Pinette was also obnoxious and unfunny.
The laughable dialogue also helps this clunker speed along towards its action packed finale.
There is also a woman which half of the movie fights against Rodman and the rest fights and sleeps with him at the same time.
We also have a villain, so mad, it would be an understatement to call him a caricature.
And he has maybe the first computer ever, which has not only a little animation looking like him, but this one can also talk for itself and change visually in order of the things happening around it.
As I said, he also drives with his motorcycle up a wall and along the ceiling in a tunnel.
& also known as The Amazing Mr. No Legs here in the UK this is one unique film that doesn't quite hit the giddy heights that it could have but none-the-less provides a certain fascination & entertainment value.
I also thought they showed the babies to much in this one and this kind of made the impact of seeing them lessen to a great degree.
IT LIVES AGAIN also features mutant babies and microphone goofs .
Seriously I`m certain he has because the sound mix after this scene is all over the place , when someone speaks the volume of their voice increases/decreases from shot to shot and there`s also plenty of scenes with obvious overdubbing , and not to mention bizarre background noises .
He one day meets (by smell and touch) Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), daughter of a wealthy tycoon, and they fall for each other quite quickly, and she is quite a skilled fighter also, with her knives.
It also succeeds because the story is played completely straight without any sort of schlock regarding No Legs: If it had been a smarmy tongue in cheek parodic or satiric attempt to get laughs it would have fallen flat.
I also like the always adorable Annabel Schofield.
Matthew McConnaghey also did well and was just as excellent in The Wedding Planner (with Jennifer Lopez).
I also cant figure out where they came up with the music for this movie.
It was also nice to see Megan Mullally as the schools principal but she was totally wasted in this part.
It's also very funny at times.
He scours the student body for a very tall kid who is also clumsy in a humorous way.
He also recruits a large girl to the team, as she is Susie-Likes-to-Fight, and Roy thinks that if things get rough, he can always channel his inner John Chaney and send her out to pummel someone.
There's also the slapstick assistant coach (played by SNL cast member Horatio Sanz), who bumbles around hoping to provide supplemental humor when basketballs slip out of his grasp and fly in all directions; there's the overzealous opposing coach who thinks junior high school basketball is as important as college or NBA--but then again, can you really blame the guy?
Sean Connery is universally seen as the best looking older man and his Scottish charm is of course also one of his attractions.
"Entrapment" also exists as a catalyst to Hollywood's ongoing trend to have romantic encounters between young, extremely attractive women, and much older men.
Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I'm still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I'm in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?
And then later when they figure out that what the bomb is, and how it's detonated, they also figure out a very easy way to defuse it.
Not quite being able to adjust to modern society Gatanebo is also unable to keep his emotions and feeling to himself!
Gatanebo also does in one of the ships crew members by decapitating him who, were later told, was the person back in ancient Nigeria in another lifetime who decapitate his doomed lover Kenya!
It also connects him to the brutal murder of the crew member who's severed head was later found in Sylvia's bedroom.
Aldo Sambrell plays Gato Nebo,a thousand year old Haitan priest who is decapitated along with his lover Kenya for adultery and murder.Then the film takes place during 70's and is set on a cruise ship to Port-Au-Prince,Haiti.After being awakened Gato Nebo starts decapitating various ship passengers with a sword.Add also a romance between reincarnated Kenya and her mummified lover and an absurd climax set in an ancient cavern in Kenya.
I say "seems" because it also seems that it's hard to tell what race people are supposed to be in this because they keep changing.
Now, Sylvia is the secretary and love object of Dr. Kessling, who is the man who is responsible for transporting the sarcophagus to a museum, and he also seems to have discovered the secret of its occupant, who manages to change places with an incoming professor and take his place, that is, after that particular poor soul is run over by a steam roller, egad.
Here we have another so-called horror flick made only for tasteless teenagers or fans of modern teen flicks like "Urban Legend" or "Scream".No violence,no real thrills,only a lot of predictable cliches.Oh,and there's also incredibly dumb sequence when one girl is scared to death by strange masked figure(Ha!Ha!
The story (taken off the novel of Lois Duncan --- Gallows Hill --- who was also behind "Stranger in Our House" and "I know What You Did Last Summer") might consist of messy plot details (trying to be too clever at times, than letting it flow), an terribly incoherent staged climax (which is risible for all the wrong reasonsÂ and so are the flimsy attacks sequences) and bestowing a heavy-handed script, but in all it keeps you wrapped within the shallow mystery thanks to largely the agreeable performances (of mainly not particularly likable characters).
Sarah makes friends with a geeky outsider (Ben Foster) but also attracts the attention of teen members of the "Descendant's Club"-- obnoxious jocks (led by Christian Campbell, brother of Neve) and the high school bitch queens (led by Soleil Moon Frye) who think she's the reincarnation of the dead witch.
The plot becomes a lot more complicated when we realize there is also a lost admiral whom the mad doctor is trying to get information out of by hypnotizing him.
There is also a very lame comedy attempt thrown in with using a racist portrayal of a black man with big eyes providing the hucks, although they are obviously borrowed from other movies.
It is also curious why Victor was cast as the chief villain in a Bela Lugosi type role when Lugosi himself was probably available at the time.
As luck should have it, our heroes' plane also crashes and they are helped by a solicitous German whose wife is even more insane than he is.
In this role, he was often very funny but also the embodiment of what many Black Americans hated about Hollywood during the era.
The original "Pet Seamatary" of 1989 (also directed by Lambert) was certainly no Horror-highlight, and I personally found it to be overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans, but it was still an atmospheric and entertaining film that had many creepy moments.
things start to happen when a boy loses his dog "Zowie" to a gunshot would by his abusive step dad who is also a sheriff.
The last 10 minutes of the film was so unnecessary with the girl Lucy {baring in mind she hadnt actually killed anyone herself}being gruesomely hacked at so that she could be turned into a freak,i thought they were just going to cut her tongue out but oh no that was only the beginning,i couldn't believe how long this scene went on for or what they were going to stop at.It was also silly really as no one would survive all that blood loss.
"Freakshow" also wants the viewer to be amazed at the final denouement.
It also has no plot except to make you want to vomit.
There's one bit in this I don't get, Lucy refuses to drink out of a bowl that the freaks had just drank out of fearing drinking their spit, however it is also shown that Lucy has no problem having sex or giving a blow job to a man old enough to be her dad & literally covered in warts & boils!
This film has the most number of slow, boring & utterly pointless fades to black at the end of a scene I've ever seen in a single film, it also has some utterly awful gramophone style 20's & 30's music constantly playing on the soundtrack to maybe try & evoke an atmosphere like the original 1932 version?
The film is also shot in a sepia tone (again maybe to try & mimic the original black and white original) which gives everything a candle lit orange type hue, like yeah that's original isn't it?
It was also concerned not just with the schlemiel's wishes, but with what makes the Devil tick.
He also convinced me: you can believe Dudley Moore as an unnoticed little shnook.
Carol Lynley is also around as a college student-turned-amateur detective, Mildred Natwick is the housemother, and Robert Reed sniffs about sourly as a police lieutenant.
1969 was not a good year for Carol Lynley (she also starred in the clinker "Once You Kiss a Stranger..." around this time), but at least Reed had "The Brady Bunch" to fall back on!
Once King realises that the truce has been broken he & the rest of Vampire hunting mates gear up for action once more as they are the only ones who can stop Bathorly...  Edited, written & directed by Leigh Scott who also has a small role in the film under lots of make-up one has to say that The Asylum doesn't have a great track record in making good horror films & Dracula's Curse only goes to enhance that reputation rather than change it.
He is also really nice to look at.
The supporting cast was also excellent.
Now the rest of the characters, with the exception of his father (played by Lee J. Cobb), were also difficult to follow or understand and it was hard to care about them at all.
Jesse, another character, tormented the driver about his actions, until finally Danny, who was also in the car, had to tell him "what about MY responsibility?
It should also be noted with regards to the plot that never ever, not even for one single moment, does it become convincing in its portrayal of events.
Indeed, the gang is made up of members from nearly every different race (must not discriminate after all when it comes to male sleaze balls) and all the guys in the film who seem to be actually able to fight seem to also be totally ineffectual as males for the most part, wearing pink t-shirts or sweatshirts, doing aerobics and basically anything our leading lady Sandy asks them to do.
Maybe we're supposed to remember here that Liz Montgomery also played Lizzie Borden in a TV movie several years after Bewitched tanked and she was renovating her image as a Now woman.
Now, the "serious" side of this movie flounders like the fully dressed blacks diving into the pool--we're supposed to think here of baptism, even before we see the image of the little boy floating in the crucifixion pose--and we are also supposed to swallow yet another screenwriter's slam-dunk of a terribly complex and many-sided situation, that of racial injustices of sixties Alabama.
There are also the usual "all star cast" regulars, like Ernie Borgnine and Red Buttons, who only help make this a disaster film clichÃ©, as well as a disaster film disaster.
Not only does the title say it all, WHEN TIME RAN OUT also came out the same year as the disaster movie spoof AIRPLANE!, making this film more embarrassing than it is.
The film also feels more like a TV soap opera with elements taken directly from Allen's other disaster movies.
I liked his first two blockbusters, but I also liked his lesser efforts like THE SWARM (at least for camp value).
Irwin Allen ripped himself off also.
Somewhere in there, Burgess Meredith and Italian film veteran, Valentina Cortese also signed on.
It was also Irwin Allen's final film that he directed.
The suspense element of the film fails also, because it takes way too long to get going and is thoroughly predictable once it finally kicks into gear.
I also enjoyed seeing telephone poles fall over without anything hitting them, and as they fall over they don't looked cracked at all, just perfect horizontal bottoms that weren't really even in the ground.
The writing also has a contrived feel to it, relying so heavily on clichÃ©s that it becomes unintentionally comical.
I did find the charm in `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' but I also found that it lost its luster.
But programmers also have an obligation to their audience, and they ought to protect us from rubbish like this.
One of George's friends, psychiatrist Philip (Edward Judd), is also aboard the yacht enjoying a holiday.
Judd also is a very bland, laid-back leading man (he resembles Peter O'Toole, but with dark hair and about a tenth of Peter's acting ability).
But it also can't be enjoyed on the level of a likably oddball curiosity.
she also worked with Angelina Jolie on a number of films.
the director of this film, Reverge Anselm, also wrote and directed the execrable "Stateside".
Then again, it was also the director's decision to include the exposition filled voice-over.
There's also use of bad and crude language which I abhor in films generally, unless there is a very good reason for it.
which also goes by the name "Second Chance" is a blend of melodrama, mixed with clichÃ© and a touch of the occasional "HUH?!".
To compete with other time travel films, I believe the technology could also be stepped up a notch.
I also believe he was confused about who his character was even supposed to be.
These early episodes also had the panel making forced, out of context, sexual comments.
I also think sometimes the 'stars' don't guess so the contestant can win the $1,000 and the dinner, i.e.
I wish the GSN would also offer the original version for those of us that enjoyed it.
The characters were also realistic.
It also accuses policemen of starting a fight with gang members when both groups were attending functions at the same location.
She was engage in a War Against Rape to save innocent women and also joins an Urdu newspaper AMN with us.
Many of the fight scenes and effects are also far too digitized, making the film look about as real as a video game.
It is also odd to Asian audience that all the Chinese in this movie speak fluent English.
Of course along with these families there is also a family with an out of work dad and his wife and step child, why they are on this top secret base is beyond me, I highly doubt a woman would be working in such a facility in the 50's but then what do I know I think this movie sucks and that means I am an idiot.
He's the guy who directed some of the most memorable horror landmarks of the 1950's, like "Tarantula", "Creature from the Black Lagoon" and "The Incredible Shrinking Man", but he also directed Â THIS movie!
(Coventry): Yes, indeedÂ But there are also a lot of problems with the script.
He also gets good performances from his juvenile cast.
The nature of its connection with the children is also somewhat vague.
The business of the adults finding out what is going on, but being unable to tell anyone about it, is also redundant.
I could just see them in the offices now...  "Sir its about the game Manhunt" "Whats wrong with it" "Well, theenemies AI..." "Is that all" "No there's also the sluggish combat, poor graphics, repetitive game play, its boring and when you get into a fight you just end up taking turns hitting one another till someone drops, should we scrap it?"
I did like that the game have great voice acting from Brian Cox, who was not only menacing but also side-splitting funny in parts.
Errol Flynn plays a horse trader in this nonsense who also works for British intelligence.
One who has read and appreciated the book on all of its many levels will also miss its many memorable and important "minor" characters; its sensitive and sympathetic treatment of Buddhism and other non-Christian creeds; and will be left wondering whether it was the star, the writers, the producer, the director or some combination of the above who thought they could go Kipling one better by, among other things, replacing his almost-accidental crisis with a Flynn-caused avalanche, then neatly tying all his lifelike loose ends into a big Tinseltown bow.
Bram Stocker's famous vampire story has been filmed many times; the Coppola version (that this movie spoofs the most) was superb and the 1979 version with Klaus Kinski was also darn good.
"History of the World Part I" also has its moments but parts are greater then the whole.
He could have come up with an apt title that also descibes this film.
I would also liked to have seen a lot more detail on where the location is based on this film, it would make it a lot more interesting if the back story on the location was elaborated on then you could get a feel for the where and the why.
As an avid lover of Horror made in Bella Italia, who has seen hundreds of Italian Horror productions, I must say that "Paganini Horror" is arguably not only THE dumbest, but also the most boring and tiresome Italian Horror film ever brought to screen (I am not counting Claudio Fragasso's disastrous "Troll 2", which is, In my opinion, not Horror, and neither is it really Italian).
Apart from Donald Pleasence (one of my favorite actors) and Daria Nicolodi, the performances are also god-awful.
And also, this is basically dissing American basketball.
I also thought the movie was unrealistic come on who would let a dog play basketball even if the dog could.
I also fond out the star of the movie was born on my birthday.
That's why I think the comparisons between this one and "Chained Heat" (also starring Linda Blair) are completely unjust.
I also thought that the movie has it's own unique genre, of course I am a huge fan of horror but there are so many different ones out there... too bad this movie was low budget and didn't get a lot of credits...
The killings are also confusing Â sometimes a person killed is seen again later in the movie without explanation as to whether the killing was real or imagined.
What was with the blinding thing (also a ripoff of Un chien andalou (1929))?
Meanwhile, the also teenager Trina (Marianne Bennett) is drowned by a man dressing a monk cloak in a river in the woods.
The sets are also nice.
There is also music, of course at the ballet, where the scenes are photographed in a totally static, pedestrian, uncreative way.
His touching of DeHavilland's face at the ballet is not only unsporting, but also offensive.
This is a very childish film and also extraordinarily camp.
The music is also good fun especially the go-go title theme.
I suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive.
This is fine I suppose for the triplet "bimbos" that hang out with President Skroob, but they also draw the main female character (Princess Vespa) in the same way.
It also showed what families go threw when fighting for a child where a husband has killed his wife and tries to get custody after he has done a horrible crime.
It starts out somewhat promising with an young American man, Alex Walker (Kevin Anderson)coming into a Mexican bar where he encounters an overly friendly drunk named Felix Crawley (Robert Harper), also an American.
Phillip also pushes Missy and Alex together and then acts as if he is jealous when they act on it.
Completely boring, filled with scenes of people just walking or driving around, it also resorts to all the usual stereotypes about paranoid Vietnam vets and evil, witchcraft-practicing Indians, having as a villain a man who is both of the above!
He also has to make peace with the jealous husband (Robert Chimento) of his former lover (Karen Carlson).
And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb.
"Wizard" is also laced with running themes about Hollywood union lock-down.
The alt-metal music which accompanies the songs will also work for that target cult audience.
It's probably a bit unfair to compare this version of the Sweeney Todd story Â as well as any other film version ever made before Â with Tim Burton's film which came out in 2007, but at the same time also inevitable.
I have also gone back to watch several of the Roger Moore series recently.
As Diane is a hard, brassy, self-centred individual, I also wondered if the use of this particular Christian name was a spiteful dig at Diane Keaton, Farrow's predecessor as Woody's muse.
What makes the film even more disappointing is that it came out during a period, the late eighties, which also saw three of Woody's best films, "The Purple Rose of Cairo", "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Crimes and Misdemeanours".
I was also involved in the investigation of this crime.
Not only was Octavia, the one who was supposed to be plain, more attractive than her, but is also a better actor for the simple reason that I didn't have to listen to her for very long.
I've also read the reviews that praise the night photography.
The acting is also quite good.
Idea: this movie presents the story of a soon to be married couple during the days of the revolution and, also the story of a journalist who 15 years later comes in search of their baby....born in those dreadful days.
1st of all...the sailor returns from seas...goes to Timisoara to marry...get's drunk all the way there....get's drunk there...goes with his bride at the hospital...get's shot by the Communist forces...believed dead is transported to a crematory...lies like stupid and burns alive...STUPID (also very idiotic part where he dreams everything is OK and then we see him burning 5 min later ) bride and her friend - bride is very very stupid as her friends are...their roles r very poorly written and acted Comunist forces and patriotic people - OMG... they have like 300 men and they switch them around...no real drama... 1 other thing...where did they get the cat and the dog in the movie?
When i entered the cinema it was full,i thought it will be a good movie.I also saw the director Sergiu Nicolaescu(he used to be o good director)and i also thought that i will see a good movie.
He also learns that Curtis had an illegitimate son.
That's also when Elwood meets a young, sarcastic orphan named Buster.
He also asks to borrow $500 for a car.
Besides being moralizing garbage this also has some of the most unbelievably shallow characters i have ever seen.
The one who they took in their home because his father was a marine (Martin) came closest, but was also a disappointment in the end.
We have Eric, the dad and husband, he's also a minister at the local church.
Matt who is the oldest brother, he's also throughout most of the series in college studying to be a doctor.
It also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible.
Anyway, this movie also stars her son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (who I just found out is a New Orleans native from the state I live in, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as a malt shop proprietor and Huntz Hall, taking a break from the East Side Kids, as Peter's buddy.
I missed this movie when it appeared, and I saw it just lately, because I read some very enthusiastic reviews on it and, living in Germany, I think one has to cope also to the local cinematographic up-to-date situation.
But, of course, the wall is fallen and she cannot find herself anymore also in her dreamed on world.
DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.
The use of music is also atrocious, music library stuff plugged in randomly and starting and ending without any logic.
There's some sped-up footage of teeth-brushing, and a conversation is also fast-forwarded through.
The film is reminiscent of the "mondo" films of the era, and with the "strong" torture scenes, it also sorta reminded me of MEN BEHIND THE SUN - though not nearly as powerful or interesting.
Its an ultra "Z" film only for one propose, too shock, with ultra violent and grotesque scenes, with a non linear\sense story.The film focus the character Karl the Buchter (Andreas Schnaas, also the director) in a killing spree, walking around the woods killing people without a propose, every signle death is sadistic and brutal..(what they are thinking?)!
This film is also extremely low budget.
It also wipes out a bunch of "soldiers" who look like they trained for combat by playing war games with GI Joe dolls.
Not only is it a comically bad scene, but we also got to see Yancy Butler in her skivvies.
I also enjoyed seeing him take on something he is actually known for taking on in an earlier set of films.
This is also incorrectly classified as a Film-Noir.
It also seems strange that not a single couple (of course all "heterosexual") in this film has a child.
Through a series of brief vignettes in a surreal Australian landscape we are acquainted with Lola and her unfortunate daughter Alice both of whom are destined to be forever betrayed not only by the people they encounter but also by each other.
There's also a female sports player and a bored housewife married to a millionaire.
Van Peebles does a bang-up job as an auteur on a mission, his secretary and his producer friend Bill are played dead-on, and the kid in this movie is also really talented.
And of course there is also a chief inspector Dreyfuss (Sener Sen) present.
Aside from visiting villages, hospitals, schools, and factories, Fonda also posed for pictures in which she was shown applauding North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gunners, was photographed peering into the sights of an NVA anti-aircraft artillery launcher, and made ten propagandistic Tokyo Rose-like radio broadcasts in which she denounced American political and military leaders as "war criminals".
She also spoke with 8 American POWs at a carefully arranged "press conference," POWs who had been beaten by their North Vietnamese captors to force them to meet with Fonda, deny they had been tortured, and decry the American war effort.
The nuclear family also jellyfish father (Salem Ludwig) and blissed-out hippie brother, Herbie (David Arkin).
Sellers is also good at the end when he has burned out or is on a bad trip and is weary of all the freeloaders who have moved into his apartment (and started to share his flower-child free-spirited bedmate).
The stillness was also an attraction, never hurrying, like trees, still and composed.
She's also portrayed as the most human of the team, suggesting a heart for the robot that continuously beats Professor Orloff at chess.
If you also enjoyed movies such as Practical Magic, and The Craft I would highly recommend to see it.
They hated it also and are trying to find someone else to take it off their hands.
True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done.
When the second Blue's Brothers came out the Spice Girl's movie was also in theaters.
He also fell in love with female alien, Nscho-tschi, er... Neytiri.
I'm also ashamed that I went there and paid the money to see it.
I almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners.
The endless talk talk talk is alleviated occasionally as Marvin goes out to see the company's captain, who also lives in a wrecked basement.
This movie cements their reputations (and Demi Moore's also) as truly bad actors.
also, another important thing about a good horror: Agnes Bruckner and Rachel Nichols are not bad at all to look at!
-The fights are also incredibly stupid.
If you are looking for a compelling thriller, this isn't it also.
Kenny Wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him Bricks.
I also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out, the culprits are pulled aside, they don't say anything, and the guards or warden or sister Pete or whoever always says, "I hope you don't think I'm gonna let this go!!"
Not only prisoners, also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable, it's such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong testicular fortitude to keep watching.
This title is not originally meant to be a sequel.Not just because there is a 25 year gap, also there is no connectivity between two story lines.Only connection available is the former antagonist.
If they could just donate the entire money they spent on this film to a orphanage, not only they could have the blessing of many unfortunate kids but also save a million's hatred.
This movie is not only an unimaginably unsuccessful sequel to a movie that is unimaginably naive and problematic but also uses the very fundamental elements of GORA, like main actor starring both as the antagonist and the protagonist.
The original cult film "The man who saves the world" was also a bad movie but at least it was funny, not boring.
I also wondered why Ms. Allyson would marry a man she doesn't love, and why Mr. Lemmon had never thought about loving a woman.
I also wasn't compelled by much of the action and frankly there wasn't enough of it.
The finale is a bit of a let down, though, even if the involvement of the titular woods is fun to see (thanks also to some convincing CGI, not the second-rate crap that often destroys the atmosphere in these small-budgeted movies).
As I feel that society is becoming more and more immoral, not only through homosexuality but also through corruption, violence, paedophilia, lies, greed ....it is necessary to take stock of and protest against this every time it occurs - albeit in the course of a film.
It's been best done in movies as various Robin Hoods, Zorros, and Lone Rangers, but has also served uncounted zero-budget "B" westerns, costume actioners, serials and cop pics since fiction film first unspooled, particularly during the pre-WWII period.
"The Woods" is David Ross' debut as scriptwriter, and while of course it shows some of the common problems of a first time writer, it also shows that Ross knows his influences very well (in more than a way, the story is a homage to Argento's "Suspiria").
Through the story one can really get to know not only the main character, but also the many supporting characters no matter how small their role is.
It's also worth to point out that McKee makes the most of John R. Leonetti's wonderful cinematography and specially of the eerie score by John Frizzell and Jaye Barnes Luckett; creating a haunting horror film that like Ross' script, pays good homage to Argento's legendary masterpiece.
(4/10) (I must also admit the remake/tribute 2003 flick Italian job was not much better.
The movie also tends to remove nearly all of the biggest influences of Peekay's life and mostly include all of the less important things.
"The Woods" is loosely based on the tree-dwelling female Dryads of Greek mythology.It's also highly influenced by "Suspiria",Serrador's "La Residencia" and "The Evil Dead".In "The Woods" Lucky McKee of "May" fame has fun with some dynamic CGI effects for the tree limbs,roots and branches that keep sleeping teens in stasis until the latest teen offering has been snatched from her bed,but the effects seem out of place in a film that's kept fancy visuals to a minimum.Still this surprisingly subtle horror is worth a look.8 out of 10.
Boxing Day 1967 was when it all came together for the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band - not only did they enjoy a novelty hit with 'I'm the Urban Spaceman' and television exposure thanks to Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones's Pre-Python children's series DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET, they also had a cameo in a film that was premiered that day on BBC1.
Shiraishi Koji (who also wrote the screenplay) is no stranger to the genre having directed other cheap horror projects like "Noroi" and "Ju-Rei" but is unable to elicit the genuine shocks and thrills like his contemporaries Nakata Hideo (Ring) or Shimizu Takashi (Ju-on: The Grudge) did in their movies and what we get is just a tame ghost story with no bite.
There was also a subplot about one of the nurses trying to help a patient beat a charge of armed robbery.
Moving on, To add them to the story was also a mistake because you don't just add fairies to help some random reindeer go help find his girlfriend.
I can't understand how the producers managed to get such good high profile voice talent... but I also would be incredibly surprised to see if John Goodman thinks this is truly something he wants anybody to see.
If George Romero saw "Show Business" in his youth, I'm sure he also imagined that only four zombies chasing Ethel and her brains could nudge the dreck back toward reality.
That's what's good about the movie, it builds up quite slowly (also because actually there is not much story to build up) and when we are fully aware of the threats, the viewer is also aware of the fact that one cannot escape from a mysterious force that is everywhere around you.
that was also a bad movie.
There's also a reference to the altruism enigma.
They'll also be pleased to see that given a modest budget by today's shock-horror standards, he has exhibited new freedom of movement and imagery.
McKee is aiming at lyricism, and while we should expect that plot is also served, in this film it is secondary.
(Oh wait that is what Reeves calls 'acting')   Jennifer Connelly was terrible also.
I also love how Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son, is taking his daddy's footsteps in alien movies, does Will Smith come from another planet?
We are also presented with John Cleese as a Nobel Prize winner.
Well that's also ridiculous on the face of it - but I tell you something, if the end where nigh and you wanted someone leftfield to plead your seemingly intractable case, you'd do a lot worse than Cleese.
I also enjoyed seeing scenery in Denmark and Greenland, not the normal sites for crime film movies.
The underrated actress Patricia Clarkson is scary in the role of the evil dean of the school; the cult Bruce Campbell has a minor but important participation; and Agnes Bruckner is also good in her role.
"The Woods" is never better than "May", but it is also a good psychological horror movie.
I've also lived in Cali and NYC.
and i want me 91 minutes and 22 seconds back.but,we don't always get what we want do we?i guess this is supposed to be a horror comedy combination.well,if so,they left out the horror part.actually,they left out the comedy part too.mostly,this movie very slow and boring,but believe it or not,there are worse movies out there.Warwick Davis plays the Leprechaun,and it looks like has a blast in the role and is not taking it seriously at all,which is one good thing in the movie.Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie,which came out about a year before "Friends".anyway,this movie spawned 5 sequels so far,and to be perfectly honest,it doesn't merit any sequels.for me,"Leprechaun" is a 2.5/10
Not only is the movie not scary in the slightest sense, but also the bad parts of it that are often so funny in other horror movies are completely dull in this one.
Bottom line: compared to this film, "Top Gun" (which also starred Cruise and John Stockwell) is deserving of ten Academy awards.)
Jackson might very well be the weirdest performer on earth, he is also one of the most popular and famous ones, so I really thought this movie would get us to see objective aspects of the man's life.
Stacy Keach also turned in an excellent performance as the sad, deteriorating perpetually drunken Jake Blount.
Basically,this is a variation on the Patty Hearst story set in England.It even opens with a shot of a castle where the rich girl lives with her rich father.After around 20 minutes,the rich girl gets kidnapped by three bizarros in strange costumes,and is subjected to all kinds of mental and sexual torture in order to brainwash her.There's also an operatic score to liven things up.In my opinion,this is one of the stupidest movies Oliver Reed ever made.
There are also a few scenes that are not logical and film also contains a very obvious (and therefore disturbing) continuity error.
The plane also carries a torpedo-bomb thing.
The quality of the movie is also well below par.
Since a large proportion of the market for them is now the late night film showings provided in most hotels, they generally continue to incorporate some nudity to add eye candy to their appeal and also frequently include soft-porn sequences showing simulated sexual couplings, often with little or no relationship to the story line (which can sometimes be squeezed right out).
Nowadays most viewers expect eye candy in films of this genre, and also accept sequences showing sexual couplings that contribute to the story line.
I also read that there were some great "one-liners" in this movie, but I didn't hear any.
Oh, it's also a lot of fun when you can see the dead bodies breathing (I haven't seen that blunder in film in quite some time).
It also looks like none of these people have ever fired or held a gun before, for that matter.
He also befriends drifter Stacy Keach, whom he first meets while Keach is causing a drunken disturbance in a greasy spoon.
Barrett's fall from tired, hard working wife to slightly embittered mother who wants her daughter to drop out of school and work full time (while taking night classes), is also nicely subtle.
I also couldn't get a feel for what time they were in, it seemed simi future based on the police garb, but then the cars and everything else seemed modern...Weird.
I guess I shouldn't be too disappointed since the Greek contestant had the best legs and she won while Romania had the best cleavage and she came third with the Israeli motek also doing very well .
I was also not impressed with the majority of the cast.
I also found many supporting cast members, as well as a few of the main cast, were just reciting their lines to each other.
There is also no strong language.
(Predictably, "Katrina" is also shoehorned into the narrative for good measure.)
In addition, most of the material defies not only economic theory but also basic logic.
You see, when you lower the interest rate it doesn't just effect spending but it also effects saving.
I said that it also loves to blame government for being in bed with the credit companies.
It also unfairly portrays the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 as a move that would mostly punish those already down on their luck for no reason of their own as well as solely a back-room deal between the Bush administration and major lender (and Bush campaign donor) MNBA.
I also mentioned that the film is sluggish and haphazard.
That's also a major flaw of the film.
For the first time in her recent life Peggy is also, can you believe it, PETLESS.
(Its also a film that feels like its a glorified home movie with all the friends and family being brought in to be part of it).
There are also no facial expressions.
It also has its occasional 'Carry On' moments, yet, still, the bawdy pen of Talbot Rothwell would not have saved this effort.
It also seems like Ruzowitzky had no idea at all what he was doing, because the film changes from a pseudo realistic "bad times in world war II" drama to a silly, unintelligent, extremely stupid pseudo "comedy" all the time.
There are about, I think, three funny moments which made me LAUGH, but the rest of it was so SERIOUS - yes it's about war, but it's also about men dressing up as women!
I also bought The Avengers because he's in it but that's another tale of woe....
Returning to the car chase, Bullitt's car chase might be in some people's the best car chases list, but if you ask me, we have seen much better car chases and I want to give a few examples, also I am sure that there are more car chases that I can't remember or haven't seen yet.
But then, to make a number of idiocies just for the sake of disobeying the authorities, that was considered cool in the late 1960s (and also now, at least in the movies).
I can be fascinated by an unlikable character that I can't personally relate to when it's well written into a gripping character-study (as, say, Isabelle Huppert's complex Erica Kohut in "The Piano Teacher"), but that won't happen if they are also completely uninteresting and lack any sort of substance.
Sondra Locke's debut was marvellous and Chuck McCann was also brilliant.
The plot is also jumpy and I think it would take someone about 10 goes at watching it just to get the idea of what was going on.
It also cuts HUGE chunks of the plot out, including several key characters and then adds ones that don't even exist to begin with!
these points made the movie less intelligent and also more predictable.
the acting and direction of the movie was also poor.
Each person that has a book, also sees a God of death who kind of overseas them and is their companion.
Light is also working with the cops and a detective called "L" in this one, to find out who's making these deaths happen(although no-one knows he carries the book and is causing it).
Also, the morality question is lost and also the humor that was in the first movie.
and in being the best, it is also the saddest.
There are also some OK special effects, including several beheadings.
Other more satirical things like protesters congregating for the civil rights of zombies, and also a religious cult of fanatics which believe it is Gods' will that the un dead becomes the successors to the human race.
i know that the budget was modest but $80.000 is what it cost sam raimi to make the evil dead (though tatty - a real classic) and he rented proper equipment and had some decent actors, and also showed some directorial flair.
There's also a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but it doesn't enhance the experience.
The plans were just too big for the director J R Bookwalter to handle, he also covers most of the other production roles from cameo to credits designer, evidently everything he touches, he has no talent to back up whatsoever.
if you're not one for mediocre acting then i also don't recommend this movie.
She was also the film's "technical adviser".
The entire premise of the film is ridiculous, the story implausible and the directorship poor also.
There was also the cute kid angle, and the soldier who was tired of war and became a monk.
The Venona Papers (opened after the fall of the Soviet Union) have confirmed without a doubt that the Rosenbergs were not only traitors giving the Russians America's atomic secrets, they also showed that the Rosenbergs were hard-core ideologues who felt their mission was more important than theirs or other people's lives.
The ending was done alright but it was also kind of dumb.
They also tamed the film, giving it a PG-13 rating.
It's also just a bad Sci-Fi action flick in general and not worth watching.
You also get Judy Dench ("M" from the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies) as something called an air elemental who can turn into some sort of foggy stuff and can glide (but not fly!)
One of the first lessons of movie-watching; never waste time on a movie where the lead actor is also a producer.
Hard to find also.
Irving Jackelmann also proves to be pretty bad.
It's sort of funny, but also sort of mean.
Young Blair Slater also manages to be appealing despite the script.
Alan Arkin is memorable as the deaf mute and Sondra Locke, in her first screen role, also shines as the second lead.
Percy Rodriguez also is memorable here.
There are myriad plot holes and the acting is also some of the worst I've seen in a long time.
Anyway under the regime of Messiah Macaluso those who are not followers of his are deemed 'haters' and are rounded up and also disappear in more conventional ways.
I took a look on the actor, Darrel Hicks, who played the son and found he'd also later done work on Queer As Folks.
The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, also no real suspense.
You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea .
You can also forget all about the racist arresting officer investigating the murder case because he's a composite character that includes at least one black detective so racism wasn't at the heart of the case .
The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.
The scenes are, however, performed by the leads themselves, leading to the conclution, that this movie (like many Jess Franco movies that it resembles) also excists somewhere as a hardcore movie.
The movie also, unwisely, combines humour and torturescenes.
The final scene is also a display of bad filmmaking.
The beginning is quite clear and obvious the importance of the diary to the character of Thymian, but not only does it not sustain its direct duty to bring her some form of closure, revelation, or salvation, it also simply disappears after a certain point and is never heard of again.
Sometimes this film goes to lengths, also, to go further into depth about things that don't deserve such treatment.
It also looked like three different houses were used.
We were also the only people in the cinema.
I also heard that the audience is told beforehand to laugh, whether the jokes are funny or not.
It was also pretty creepy how they added the Christian memorabilia into the plot.
There's also a very Semonesque sequence featuring an enormous vase teetering on a too-small stand.
The novel on which it is based is, sadly perhaps, too complex and long to adapt to the screen without sacrificing some aspect of the many subplots it contains, and although I regret the loss of the radical political dimension, the subtle and heart-wrenching way loneliness, racism, impoverishment, snobbery, and disadvantage are conveyed are so powerfully treated that the end result is a film of almost unbearable sadness and melancholy... and yet... And yet there is an element of tremendous hope also at work; of the human spirit overcoming huge odds and learning life's lessons as the various characters go along and work out their individual destinies.
a better structured movie could also leave images with you AND entertain at the same time.
OK, number one, there were a lot of mistakes and goofs, such as the concrete floors in the sub others talk about, and also, the "villain", the terrorist plotting to destroy New York and Moscow, doesn't seem threatening at all and could almost be on a comedy show.
On board is Dolph's "ex-fiance", who aside from looking like a reject from a Ron Jeremy movie, is also possibly the worst actress to ever set foot on the planet.
It all in the end gets explained if we consider that probably the entire cast and crew was on drugs, and not only them, but the caterers and the cleaning guys also.
It's also the movie that's made me laugh the most (except maybe Sinbad and the Seven Seas), for hours on end.
It also makes me queasy.
But it was also the Decade of Floundering.
I'd say she is still young enough to make the jump to mainstream files but I'd also have to say give her 15 to 20 years to make that jump without the stigma of the past hanging on.
But not only because of her role - she also got to kick much more ass in that one, while the script of "Intent To Kill" is poorly written.
It has all sorts of separate threads that never really come together, and although the film opens with a bang (car chase, shootout, multiple explosions), then it slows to a crawl as we spent too much time with Traci's relationship problems with her unfaithful long-time (also cop) boyfriend.
As it turns out the attacker is also ostensibly rather thick as, after being given a quick pasting, he reveals that the reason for his decidedly anti-sociable behaviour was that he had in fact resorted to a spot of DIY justice in response to the rape of a number of women down the alley in question.
In addition, just for good measure the organisation also enlist the aid of four experts in various martial arts fields; a master swordsman who bears an uncanny likeness to the late, great Oliver Hardy (!
Just to confuse matters somewhat, there is a sub plot involving Lou's character having a love affair with the evil Japanese boss's sister who also happens to be a ninjaÂ..hmmmm what a tangled web eh?
I also refuse to believe anyone would knowingly make anything so bad.
I think I'm happy I didn't read it; I wish I could say I'd also missed the film.
Kira also has another important relationship with Saki, which again could have been really well-done if taken more seriously but instead just came off as random and weird.
We also get southern beauties who present themselves with three names like "Amanda Ray Ross" and "Becky Ann Culpepper" and you just know that the first thing Fletch does is make a rather suggestive remark that the women find irresistible and they immediately jump in the sack with him.
and we also meet a ranch hand who serves as Fletch's only friend among hostile citizens.
Christian Bale, a Harvard Medical School graduate, is bored having sex his fiancÃ©e, Kate Beckinsale, also a Medical School graduate working on another degree, in his mothers', Frances McDormand, glass and redwood mansion in the Hollywood Hills, which, instead of being vacated, is occupied by his record producer mother recording a British rock band while having sex with the very much younger lead singer.
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
As always in Chinese film, the Japanese are the bad guys, and in this movie, they are a clan of drug-dealing Shinobi who also run whorehouses and gambling centers.
I also like the actor playing the uncle as well, who would rather watch porn on TV than read to his nephew.
The first one, which introduces the monster species 'Shadmock', is amusing, in a way, but unfortunately also quite tedious.
The monster masks alone, fashioned by freelance designer Vic Door, who also worked at a milk processing plant, are laughable when compared with those from the Mos Eisley Cantina just three years before - lending understandable succour to the myth that they were made by producer Milton Subotsky's milkman.
As a screenwriter, Amicus co-founder Subotsky had also penned a number of culty items, including I, Monster and Dr Terror's House Of Horrors.
Price also inducts him into the arcane mysteries of monster genealogy, handily illustrated on a wall-chart (scroll away at leisure): "A vampire and a werewolf would produce a werevamp, but a werewolf and a ghoul would produce a weregoo.
Taylor also catches the eye of otherwise happily married Ruth Hussey (as Lorna Gary), wife of "Hell Cat" commander Walter Pidgeon (as William "Billy" Gray).
This plot leads to an odyssey through MÃ©xico City with Alicia and Ana, and it is also the perfect excuse to create a romantic comedy to be treated under the label of a buddy movie but with girls.
Because from what I know, also lots of Chinese who graduated from Chinese college also live a descent life in US, I am not sure if you guys have seen the movie "Push Hand" by directed by An Lee, that's something for real.
The people this story described, is someone who also live a poor life even in China, they struggled here in China and then with nothing to give up, they went to USA for a so called American Dream.
he also gets drunk and high a great deal.
There are also problems with accuracy of detail and chronology, which do not spoil the movie but they are errors.
He also had a volatile relationship with "Puchi," the Bronx girl who became his wife and who narrates "El Cantante," the glossy movie about his life.
He must also accept that he cannot act even if he was tortured.
Yes he did drugs, yes he had many trying times, but he also left a musical legacy that many of today's Salsa singers (Marc Anthony included) can't and never will achieve.
There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (plays Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performances that are okay.
The film also makes good comment on a Society so pill-laden, that the use of psycho-tropic drugs is common place and is used to deal with our day to day existence rather than with our real emotional selves.
Paul Kelly, Shepperd Strudwick and Red Skelton also make good appearances as some of the pilots.
They also point out that Quintis has become rather smug toward the end of the movie.
It also seemed to stump the devil as well.
She also encounters all six of the other Ren folk, including an old hag who's REALLY a witch; a beautiful young witch in service of the devil who can change her form and is out to steal the accused witch's boyfriend; an imp played with great joie de vivre by Billy Barty; said boyfriend, the dreary and uninteresting knight(what these two saw in him I don't know); and, of course, Satan.
The movie also apparently thinks we are all morons.
It's not just major flaws in the script which has the various characters expressing themselves in ways which would have been much more appropriate for a character of today but also the costumes are all wrong.
There also seems to be a large amount of indistinguishable dialogue in this film that was not intentional.
I think "Clueless" as a modern version of "Emma" (and which I also enjoyed) is more true to Austen than this let-down of a movie.  
I was also furious at Lady Bertram's opium addiction, at Mary Crawford's hints at lesbian tendencies, at Sir Thomas Bertram's motives and dealings in Antigua, and the complete unnecessary, though brief, nude scene with Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford.
And also true, it's played less like an Austenian social comedy than like a half-baked version of Tom Jones.
The architecture in the city is also pretty rad, looks a lot like the State University at Albany campus I used to study at, which lo and behold was built at about the same time that the actual location (some sort of aerospace company's campus center) was made.
The scene with Fanny playing Anhalt to help Mary Crawford rehearse is also completely wrong.
The newspaper item announcing Maria and Henry's behavior to the world is read by Fanny, and the culprits' full names are used, which is also not the way it happened in the book.
There also happens to be a killer roaming the country (called "The Monster") right near where the camp is.
Captain Kirk is directly affected by his family's involvement in all of this, and Shatner does a very nice job of portraying a captain whose professionalism and rational judgment are threatened, and whose usual rational support structure (Spock) is also imperiled and unavailable.
The episode also uses setting very nicely, with a very minimal use of backdrops and carefully chosen locations for rare open air shots.
The fact that none of the main characters are terribly memorable or endearing also doesn't help matters any.
The low budget was also unable to show thousands of these things flying around, but that's what must have happened on this colony of Deneva (an actual futuristic city on display here, not just a matte painting - zowie!).
I can also overcome this annoyance when the dramatic aspect of the film is worth expediting.
"A Night to Dismember" is her only full fledged horror film.It is also a big mess.The editing is beyond awful,the use of same location in several scenes is painfully obvious,the acting is amateurish and the story is illogical and confusing.Still the film is never boring and there are some fairly nasty scenes of gory carnage including ripped out hearts and chopped off fingers.Basically "A Night to Dismember" is about psychotic woman who gets out of an insane asylum and promptly starts butchering people around her.Give this low budget trash a look.4 out of 10.
"Purple Rose of Cairo" is a really nice change of pace for Allen, the type of film that will still challenge his audience but also give them the escapist romantic fantasy that we so yearn for when we go to the theater.
Her cameraman on the film, C. Davis Smith, is also featured on the commentary and asks Wishman if the lab lost the best parts or the worst parts.
Not only that it's a bad film, it's also a waste of money, time and talent: Lynn Redgrave was delightfully funny - let's make this peculiar -in "Gods and Monsters".
I just love "Dark Angel" - and not just because the spunky charm and great looks of Jessica Alba, but also because of Michael Weatherly, whose brilliant, low-key performance single-handedly provides a counter-balance to the series' outrageously futuristic plot.
Mia Farrow stars in Woody Allen's "The Purple Rose of Cairo," a 1985 film also starring Jeff Daniels, Danny Aiello, John Wood, Zoe Caldwell, Van Johnson, and Milo O'Shea.
I also liked the fact that the ticks became the way they were not because of government experiments or evil big companies dumping waste but because of weird growth agents being used by the Marihuana growers.
I also got some entrainment from seeing a young Seth Green on screen, before he developed much personality and Alfonso Ribiero AKA Carlton Banks from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
Years before he made Everyone Says I Love You, which was also a big 30's Hollywood homage, Purple Rose of Cairo was a nifty take on the separation between fantasy and reality (or as one of my friends calls 'magic realism') and how it relates to the depression and the escapism inherent in those fluffy romantic adventures.
But things are complicated by two things- Cecille's brutish, one-track-minded husband (Danny Aiello), and the actor who's really playing Tom, Gil, who also falls for Cecille when he comes to town to rectify the situation.
If anything else it also reminded me of was the recent Pan's Labyrinth, where a little girl left the dire problems of the real world, also with a brutish figure of ugly masculinity, and when in the fantasy world, even a flawed fantasy world, it's much more inviting than what the real world has to offer.
But Allen also has too much warmth going on, in humor as well as his affection for the up-front plastic appeal of 30s movie characters and atmosphere, to make things sour for too long.
Daniels is also excellent in one of his best turns as a figurehead of innocence (i.e.
It's a fable that's also rare for the filmmaker to take on, but as a sort of challenge he makes it one of his most charming and well-crafted films.
You will also want to check this one out if you're a fan of Seth Green.
It is also fun to watch Seth not take the whole thing too seriously.
Akshay Kumar and Ritesh Deshmukh sounds a good combination for a comedy movie and that is the reason I went for the movie (promos also looked promising).
Filthy McNasty (included on the double-feature DVD) is also pure crap.
While giving us food for thought, Mr. Allen also gives us a feast for the eyes with his conceptions of depression-era film making amidst the dreary backdrop of industrial New Jersey.
The movie also feels as if the people making this movie are faking it (never tried the product).
For a "stoner" she also manages to flush more product than she actually smokes.
The soundtrack accompanying the print I watched features a classical piece which was also used Â to much greater effect Â in Luis Bunuel's L'AGE D'OR (1930).
("The Purple Rose of Cairo" seems to have been an influence on a more recent comedy, "Pleasantville", which also featured the interaction between the real world and a fictional one with curiously naÃ¯ve inhabitants).
Tom is naÃ¯ve and innocent, but also gentlemanly, generous and sincere; Gil is more cynical, worldly-wise and self-centred.
He also uses it to skip past hard work periods or dinner with his parents (Winkler & Kavner), which leaves him as a near-zombie in autopilot.
He can also do drama really well, as the underrated "Punch Drunk Love" and "Spanglish" showed.
This film blurs those two elements to charming delight by playing not only on imaginative fictional dream material but also acting as a commentary satire on how how audiences (not just in America) react to film and the relationships and escapades they share as a result of its influence and their chimera or more derogatorily, the ignis fatuus effect on their very subsistence.
Moreover, one starts to realize that the technical splendor that emanated out of editing this film to ensure the figments came out all jazz and tangible also stand as an attestation to its quality even upon current viewing.
This movie also had very bad acting and non-realistic characters.
The plot is similar to Street Trash, as it follows the unoriginal idea (also seen in Larry Cohen's "The Stuff") of a new product disrupting people's bodily functions.
Upon one of Cecilia's numerous viewings of a new film, also titled The Purple Rose of Cairo, the main character, Tom Baxter, played by Jeff Daniels, walks right out of the big screen and into the real world.
Chaos ensues as the fictional world is irreversibly altered and the film's production team tries to save not only its reputation but also that of Gil Shepherd, the actor who played Tom Baxter, also played by Jeff Daniels.
As Allen's 13th directorial release, The Purple Rose of Cairo proves to be one of his greatest achievements, and also his self-proclaimed favorite film to date.
not just for defamation of character, but also for being associated with such a second rate piece of hackwork.
I also liked how deniro's character, a cop, let a stranger into his house, didn't search her, turned his back on her, and let her take a few bucks ("I only a couple dollars.
I also wish I had a woman as understanding as joey nova's girlfriend.
CITY BY THE SEA recalled me Verhoeven not only because of CatonÂJones' BI installment, but also because of Dzundza, much better as Douglas' sidekick; Verhoeven knows how to do exploitation, CatonÂJones doesn't.
This show is just not funny, and this is not just from the perspective of a straight male, but also from the perspective of someone who enjoys good humor, whether it be from a straight or gay person.
It's also one of very few that I actually walked out on before it ended.
I also laughed for about 3 years at this exchange between audience and screen: Man in audience to Old Dame on screen: Hey you can't talk to my wife like that!
I guess all the fans who enjoy watching this crap are also into snuff flicks and consider the complete collections of the Al Qaeda hostage beheadings in full length a must.
It's also one that can be enjoyed even by people who aren't fans of Woody Allen as he doesn't act in it, so if you caught it on TV you probably wouldn't even know it's one of his movies until the end credits rolled.
I also noticed that as the series progressed, it tried to get more kid-friendly.
Pretty pathetic to have her in the lead when you also have actors the caliber of Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall.
There was also an strange moment when Nino and Louise suddenly were great pals, walking down the street arm in arm, having only met vaguely before that.
Then along comes Gil Sheperd (also played by Daniels) the actor who portrays Tom Baxter who, flattered by Cecilia's admiration of his work, falls in love with her.
This is also a movie about the magic of Hollywood and the glamour and romanticism/escapism of it.
And again, Woody Allen's writing and direction is also superb.
Adding to the 'fun' are the problems, tantrums and behind-the-scenes squabbles of the play's cast, which seriously hinder the rehearsals (and also the film).
This I also found unnecisary in the movie.
The original was meant to shock and it did; but this film's neglect towards showing the violence means that it is not shocking, not true to the original and it also doesn't feature a plot strong enough to hold up a film like this without violence.
Of course there is also the actor who plays Tom Baxter who is named Gil Shepherd.
It is also the problem with the movie.
To shock you further, I'm also in my mid-twenties.
Add to that conversations that are supposed to be 'real' yet are clearly not a part of the 'internal documentary,' and some poorly acted and staged scenes that are meant to illuminate the tale of Wenders' trip to Ray's bedside, while also trying and failing to break down narrative conventions, and you have a genuine disasterÂ.
It was also an insult to portray the Apaches as "cold blooded killers" while they were fighting for their tradition, family and lives.
You have an iron clad stagecoach, reminiscent of John Wayne's "War Wagon," quotes from the Bible, reminiscent of Randolph Scott in "Ride the High Country," the psychological bantering between the Crowe and Christian Bale characters, reminiscent of not only "Ride the High Country" but also of "The Tall T", an Elmore Leonard story with Randolph Scott and Richard Boone, and Christian Bales's cursing teenage son, reminiscent of Ron Howard in John Wayne's "The Shootist."
One can easily see why up-and-coming star O'Neal signed on for this movie: he gets to be the sensitive good guy while also protecting his helpless wife from the scary villain.
The battle sequences are also very unexciting and dire, without cruel violence or harsh bloodshed.
The ending reminded me of "The Pink Panther" which also had a terrible ending.
At least I always do what I can to see films also from other point of views.
Actually the funniest thing was that the cover said that this film was released in 1994 and also that: After "Naked Guns" and "Spy Hard" Leslie Nielsen takes you to the funniest space trip you have ever experienced.
But it also has redeeming features.
found it boring and tedious from the get go,right to the final credits.Robert Guillaume is also in the movie and is good,as always,but he is wasted here.Garey Sherman directed the movie.he also directed Poltergeist III and wrote several episodes of the TV series Poltergeist:The Legacy and he co-wrote Wanted:dead or Alive with Michael Patrick Goodman.i wanted to like this movie,but it just doesn't have much going for it in the originality or action and excitement dept.the most i can give Wanted:Dead or Alive is a 4/10
Characters also appear out of nowhere with no explanation.... granted the audience is young, but they aren't stupid!
Further complications arrive when the character starts walking off the screen in other theaters around the country and the actor who played the character (also Daniels) arrives in town to try to convince his character to go back in the movie.
I'd also like to concur with regards to what others have said about how dirty the lovers get, the strangeness of the costumes, and a number of other points.
The costumes are also bad, as the female characters are in mini skirts most of the time.
I've seen several others copy this sort of thing, although it also was done in some silent comedies, too, if memory serves.
Harry Belafonte, as the ridiculously named "Seldom Seen", also tended to be annoying--and he probably has more lines than anyone else but Leigh.
The only one I really didn't mind was Miranda Richardson, despite the gibberish, and she's also gorgeous, so she's a treat to watch.
Perhaps those who admired "The Piano" (another film that frantically worried the view would not Get The Message, constantly harassed by garbage music) would also like this film.
Jeff Daniels is also good in his role as the movie character who comes into the real world, as well as the actor who plays that role.
John Goodman also has a hard time making the half-good jokes work.
Needless to say, realistic scenarios also went right out the window.
Ben Kingsley was also good as the planetary leader who ultimately becomes the villain.
The triumph is amazing, because, despite the depth of the symbolism, PURPLE ROSE can also be seen as sheer entertainment; on its surface, it is still one of the most entertaining pictures Woody has ever made.
let me down and also losing respect from me.
Hope the sequel takes another turn (also possibly another director) and gives the fans a movie that we deserve.
It also completely disregards the fact that in Alien 3, the man claimed he was the designer of the Bishop android...so...it just makes no sense, and it just kind of tries to spoon feed you that for some reason, this is the real creator, and not the guy in Alien 3, and doesn't ever even try to tell you why its right.
Hes also left room for a sequel by including a predalien birth at the end, further putting a big hole in future stories.
however the one "main" predator who is the biggest wuss ever to come from the predator home world because he has a soft spot for humans, well human, kills dozens with relative ease also, in aliens the acid burns through a lot of METAL floors, however this woman's face has developed the ability to with stand this potent acid?
A chained up Queen Alien that's also been frozen and imprisoned by some wimpy ass Mongoloid Predators that get schooled like little b*tches?
Face-huggers now fall off within minutes of attachment, the gestation period for the chest-bursters is now also a few minutesÂ.and, to top it all off their blood is only sporadically acidic.
AVP also marks the first Anderson film I have seen in which the shaky-cam technique is used.
The story also shows every conceivable sign of not being thought through.
I'm also guessing that Alien blood and armour made from Alien parts gives one special powers, such as the ability to stand below a spacecraft as it takes off without being burned by the thrust.
He also plays the lead with the charisma of a sullen rock.
I've seen this movie a few times and while it does have it's moments, it also has some really fundamental flaws.
The mixture of modern and old speech patterns is annoying and the cheesy extra bit at the end is also annoying but it'll kill a bit of time painlessly.
I also saw her in Terence Rattigan's In Praise of Love, co starring with Rex Harrison, in New York in 1974.
The plot also hovers between scientific miracle and occult fantasy, when perhaps one approach would have sufficed.
Despite it's attempts at high gloss, it's also remarkably drab.
She's also a very bad actress by the way, but nobody's perfect.
The direction also just plain sucks, you can barely make out what's going on.
It's almost impossible to fully understand what is going on due to the directors decision to flash back and forth constantly between the two storylines, and also showing images and visions that appear to have no place in the film at all.
The acting was also atrocious, even from more accomplished actors like Billy Dee Williams and Stacey Keach.
I also carry in my mind a (slight mis-)quote from the end of episode one which I am still waiting for Jack Bristow to say; it sort of sums up the experience so far in this show where nothing is as it seems yet everything is totally predictable - "Sydney, I'm not your father, I'm your mother".
The character development is also quite weak here, even for a slice-of-life movie.
They talk about terrorism of the Islamists, but that also does not develop into anything, even as a few scenes in the backdrop.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
The 'documentary' also doesn't play out like a normal documentary.
Despite an interesting concept (a documentary examining in great detail the evidence of a murder case in order to disprove a convicted man's innocence) and also an interesting embedded story (the search for a local legend in the woods), sitting through THE LAST BROADCAST is one massive endurance test.
The film also makes an attempt to become more philosophical towards the end, and there is an unexpected twist.
I was also confused how Fact or Fiction, which was otherwise so technically bare bones and incompetent, was able to manage an audio/video as well as an Internet satellite feed miles into the woods in 1995.
There is also an egg competition, an encounter with a native, a seductive English girl from the outside and a lascivious sailor.
I don't understand why if Brooke Shields, at the age of 16, wasn't allowed to bare her breasts or rear end in the first one, why Milla was allowed to, at 16 also, bare hers in the second film.
There is beautiful photography and music, composed by Basil Poledouris (also the first film's musical composer) of course!
It seems the filmmakers were also under the impression that just putting the beautiful Monica Bellucci on screen with a more neglected appearance than usual would turn an Oscar-worthy performance that would carry the film.
But, after being denied enrollment due to an admissions error, Shaun is forced to seek help from not only his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk), but also his hopelessly dysfunctional parents, stoner brother Lance (Jack Black), and a host of hilarious circumstances, to make his dream of escaping his hometown nightmare a reality," according to the DVD sleeve description.
But he also wrote _Dawson's Creek_ and the film _Dead Man on Campus_.
Bancroft is also terrific as the big lug who falls hard for Mae.
It follows the lives of 3 boys and 2 girls who spend their day off doing drugs, having sex, use sex as currency and commit crimes, whilst also getting chased by Sam.
Trife also finds a bit of time to visit his mentor: an uncle who (surprise) is a black, drug-dealing, murderous, violent, gun-running 'gangsta' who likes to carve his initials on people's faces with a Stanley knife.
Encouraged by the example of the males, the late Katie's female classmates also opt for a contemplation-free day.
I also wish Rhett Giles (Victor) could speak more naturally , less drama in his nonstop half whispering voice maybe.
Baba also has a younger brother in a police academy Avi( agnihotri = Hamster King ) who doesn't know about baba being in cahoots with the mafia so in the fashion of " A better tomorrow " he finds out eventually and a divide is formed between the brothers .
This motif also plays big in The Killer(1989) and Bullet in the Head(1990).
Leslie Cheung also performs well as the headstrong but naive and stubborn Kit Sung.
These two characters were also teamed with Jack Oakey--who was there solely for comic relief.
It's also on the bottom one hundred, but it's considerably better than this.
My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.
I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!!
We also get the clichÃ©' of the crowd cheering for "Hamlet" like he's some kind of Robin Hood folk hero!
So,we get the "you we're never there for me dad" plot,which has also been done in movies TV shows.
Mr Letondal would also stay far more colorless than the screenplay demands.
Please also don't go on the Good Comments here because i think it was created.
Mark Herman wrote the screenplay taken from a novel by John Byrne, he also directed this mess.
were terrible caricatures of characters in Twelve Angry Men, the plot is trite (they probably stole a good part of it from CSI or something), and the flashbacks of the murders are terribly shot and filtered with something yellow so they are also physically hard to watch.
There is also character actor Vincent Schiavelli, who died yesterday.
He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility.
(and surely this movie)  good examples of remaked movies are : the ring , the grudge , the seven samurai, Godzilla , (masked rider) and more (they planned also to make an American version of Battle royale)  Even if they remake it well they will never win my respect and i will consider it like fake.
So in spite of all the odd-crazy, there're also huge bald spots.
This film is one of my all time favourites , it reminds me a great deal of trading places, in as much as it has very funny,quotable scenes, but also a solid story that strings along the jokes.
It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).
The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously.
And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs.
The movie also tries way too hard to entertain.
The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating.
Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records?
Orlando, written and directed by Sally Potter, explores this theme, but then also weaves another few strands along the way.
There's also the small matter of her being almost the only male character in the Elizabethan scenes who isn't sporting a beard...
It is also incomprehensible, boring, and silly.
I was stone cold sober when I watched it on television this time also.
The writer/director seems to have also taken a note from X-Files(in addition to promoting The Cigarette Smoking Man to President), in leaving the ending open(to appease and appeal to both religious people and UFO enthusiasts... and here's hoping they'll all see right through it).
Is it also realistic that an all-powerful extraterrestrial force would only be able to shut down nuclear arms in sequence rather than all at once?
While there, Winkler meets a rambunctious, hyper active "idea man" played by a pre-Batman Michael Keaton in his first leading film role - also the one that made him famous to begin with.
I also agree that the positive comments could only be coming from people who made money on the movie, or who are friends.
The subplot of the couple in the next generation (Patricia Heaton and Vincent Spano) also seemed forced and not believable.
What with US army personnel parading around London in uniform before the US had entered the war; the stock footage of the 1970s era London Ambulance rushing the agent to the hospital; the "military" DC3 in civilian paint scheme; the Rolls driving around with headlights full on in the blackout; the "French Port" with lights blazing, also in the blackout; the "Social Club" in London that had both male and female members; the two "heroes" jumping out of the aircraft without a jump-master; and... Well, I could go on and on but I think you get the point.
It also must be the dullest movie ever made in celebration of fun.
It also takes away from the film when you know someone else is singing, not her!
I also really liked the soundtrack.
One could also say that about this movie, a confusing, pointless mess of stale, unfunny humor, overacted characters, and a load of Hollywood stars and filmmakers so prestigious that it makes us wonder why such people would involve themselves such an unentertaining flop.
If he loses, he also loses his pinkie finger.
Really bad in this movie is also the Tim Roth's Character, with that strange way to walk, to run , to talk or to make lots of thing!
the worst thing about that is that he's also the director, so he gives himself plenty of screen time.
Its also what happens when "hot"celebrities are allowed to make a joke thats nothing but a self serving in joke.
The able cast is also hampered by terrible pacing and what looks like last-minute editing and over-dubbing to avoid a lawsuit by General Motors.
Spy Hard wasnt funny,a very few scenes will make you laugh,i also recommend you avoid this.
this movie is billed as a spoof/comedy,but it's not really funny.there are 1 or 2 mildly amusing moments,but mostly it's just silly,without being funny.this movie would work as an actual spy movie,except that you have the expectation that you will laugh.it's gonna be hard to get the required 10 lines of text in here,but i'll try.i think the problem is the filmmakers tried too hard to get laughs.sometimes you can go too far with a joke and it ends up as flat as a pancake.so the movie isn't really funny,but it does have 1 redeeming feature.that is the casting of Andy Griffith(TV's Matlock and the Andy Griffith show) as a maniacal nut case who plans to either destroy the world or rule it.Griffith is great in this movie.he has so much fun in the role.Barry Bostwick is also good for some comic relief.but overall,the movie is not good.the most i can squeeze out for "Spy Hard" is a 4/10
The movie also tries to spoof way too many movies, just for the sake of spoofing.
It's of course also a very easy thing to spoof the spy-genre.
So no matter how bad this movie actually is, it's still a movie that can and most likely will make you laugh, with also some cameo's from people such as non other then Ray Charles and Hulk Hogan.
There is also a lot of adult-themed humour.
It will also take you right back to the early 1990s.
I also have to mention the ending which is one of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen, basically Laura is trapped in the house with the mad sisters & looks out the window as a angry mob of villagers approach & then it just finishes as if they ran out of film or someone forgot to include the last reel!
This was obviously a pretty cheap production & it shows, it's quite well made for what it is I supposed & at least it was shot on film & on location so that also gives it a cinematic look.
As you would expect, the acting also really isn't much special and the characters all remain terribly flat but it sort of all adds to the camp and status of the entire movie.
They also hilariously fail to subdue the killer despite being given half a dozen chances to do some serious damage.
Casting is below-par but, at least, Arthur Shields (who also appears in a silly book-end in full monster make-up - but, then, as Gloria Talbott's legal guardian spends the rest of the film trying to convince her that she is the werewolf!!)
I had been toying with the idea of purchasing the All Day DVD of this one ever since it was released; I'm glad I managed to catch up with it eventually without having to purchase the disc - being shown on late-night Italian TV, as part of a Jekyll & Hyde marathon which included snippets from a variety of films based on the venerable tale (I was especially gratified by the inclusion of a couple of scenes from Jean Renoir's THE TESTAMENT OF DR. CORDELIER [1959], which I've been yearning to see forever, and also ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE [1953], which I haven't watched in ages - I really ought to get down to purchasing either the R1 or R2 DVD releases of the films featuring the comic duo!
We also have John Agar as the Talbott's fiancÃ©e and Arthur Shields as the weirdo who is the executor of the late Dr. Jekyll's estate.
Shelly Long was also quite good in this movie, and a natural, as always.
The film is also quite slow.
There's also an unmistakable deep synthesiser fnaaaar-fnaaarp to indicate that we're watching the asteroid.
The '79 trend for big stars in bad films also extended to Sean Connery.
There's also Drax's space station that is invisible from radar (yes, but optical telescopes and the naked eye don't require radar).
The increasing globe trotting nature of the nutty Q (Desmond Llewellyn) is quite absurd also, remember way back in the early Bond's when he was just a common functionary in the bowels of the secret service building.
We also have the vampire-seduced kid plot line that seems to wind around and around before the ultimate non-climax.
This movie also features one of the worst battle sequences using swords, starting from the very first one on the bridge.
He also makes the acquaintance of Belinda Keaton (Shelley Long), a "nice girl" prostitute who's just moved into his building.
Possibly one of the better story lines of the genre; I loved the idea of the balance between light and dark/good and evil, the special effects at times where pretty cool, the twist was unexpected (to me at least) and the way it sets up the sequels is also commendable.
The movie also moves very slowly at times and the surreal action can be confusing.
The special effects also often seem to be on display rather than interwoven with plot.
In this episode we also follow Lisa Simpson who have found a liking for football (soccer for you Americans).
Then we have the typical opinions of the writers about various subjects like Christopher Colombus discovery being insignificant or football making whole continents insane, those are also quite annoying, specially because of the emphasis they are given.
The confrontation between O'Reilly and Jeremy Glick was also interesting, and I had not seen that before to the best of my recollection.
It succeeds in this, but also shows us an intense bias of its own.
I also think a documentary exposing Fox's hypocrisy is much needed, but this one is an extremely poor effort.
After have seen Tre Solar I have also come to the conclusion that she also had extremely bad taste.
It is also sad to see that splendid actors such as Rolf LassgÃ¥rd and Rikard Wolf chose to participate in this movie.
Gina Hecht is also magnificently memorable in her supporting role as Winkler's neurotic girlfriend, and Nita Talbot is a gem as the domineering mother.
I also found the subplot involving two child murderers and the glimpses of a child's bloodied, severed leg unspeakably depressing.
Thank you, Jaco - also for your second feature "Eight Day".
The movie also, for some reason, LOOKS cheap.
Sorry, either the time is changing all of us either there is something else... and also, some of the symbolic is so... well, political.
(And also some Sanja Ilic added for good ethno-mood measure.)
According to bloggers, obviously bored out of their skull, the character of Rade O. might've been inspired by Ratko Mladic who also served in Macedonia during the late 1980s and apparently also loved flowers - all of which I guess is the closest this unremarkable film will come to generating any kind of post-viewing discussion.)
The script is lame, and it also doesn't help that the two leads possess no chemistry whatsoever.
An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name.
In an interesting balancing act, Cosell also comes across as arrogant - disdainful of his "jock" broadcast colleagues, and even of "Monday Night Football" itself, believing himself really more suited to more serious news reporting.
I also recommend getting yourself a Charles Trenet cd who's song "Boum!"
If you like this film, you might also like The Hairdresser's Husband which came out around the same time.
We also get a cameo from Jay and Bob from the Kevin Smith movies which leaves a feeling of doubt that the producers we're getting a bit desperate in the gimmick department .
I fear a society where this is your standard drama, and I advise military leaders to also select their officers based on a psychological profile, and not only on the badass crazy percentage.
Salman's comedy films like HELLO BROTHER, MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA are terrible But this film is even worse A remake of BRUCE ALMIGHTY, but a bad one It's boring and keeps getting worse First few reels between Salman- Priyanka and Salman- Anupam are as boring as ever and Salman's shouting worsens And if this isn't worse Enters Sohail Khan trying to do a Akshay in MSK and the film gets even worse, unbearable their scenes together are so bad, that you will surely get a headache the twist in the tale too seems illogical and the second half gets even more childish The lie detector is okay but the way the film ends it's even more stupid  Rumi Jaffrey seems inspired by his mentor David Dhawan and follows his Style too much but sadly fails in handling the film Music is outdated SFX too is bad  Performances are mediocre Salman is unbearable in first half, he shouts too much and his dial delivery is also bad, in second half he is better but sadly nothing even good enough Sohail is even worse, he is bad Priyanka Chopra doesn't have anything to do Dalip Tahil, Anupam Kher are average Amitabh seems to have walked out of a Rein and Taylor ad and just moves around with a know it all smile but his presence does uplift some scenes
In this case, he also did the cinematography.
The film is very impressionistic and also very slow.
Scenery and cinematography are also nice.
Also, you might like "The Great Raid"... we loved that also... We are big fans of "The Princess Bride" and "Galaxy Quest" etc and didn't care for the constant conflict of "The Breakup".
The antics shown are also completely un-inspired.
I would also liked to have seen more of talented 'Arrested Development' star Bateman.
In part because of a fair amount of humor and whimsy but also because of the introduction of a third alternative to living.
The good news for rock group movie lovers is that "The Buddy Holly Story" (1978) is excellent, and "Cotton Candy" (also 1978) is so bad that it's good.
A portrait of a "regular" guy, who spends his days barely getting by in a series of dead-end jobs, and his nights perfecting his comedy routine in a series of sparsely-attended "open-mike" sessions at local comedy clubs, this film fails to deliver anything but a depressing series of vignettes centered around it's main character, played by Frank Whaley (who also wrote and directed).
There's also a really fine performance buried in the film by Cathy Lee Crosby (as the distraught wife of Matthau's first partner).
Although they have the usual virtues of good detective stories, they are also a commentary on modern life in Sweden.
If you liked the book, i wouldn't see this movie.. it was a waste of my time and will be of yours also.
Miss Morton also make some rather unusual facial expressions, she smiles when she hears she will meet the elusive Mr.
I also appreciate every telling of my favorite story.
The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester.
Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment.
I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of "Hollywood special effects" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films.
This movie also had the best portrayal of an overbearing Asian mom with a daughter "who like tell bed time story to you".
If it weren't for the fact that I had driven a friend to the theater and had met others there for the sneak preview also, I would have left in the middle of it.
And they are also made out of grass.
Quite a few were made, mostly comedies, but also two musicals - the Technicolored "Fiesta" with fiery Armida and this film that boasted of Frances Langford, one of the top popular singers of the day.
Chee in the books was a regular guy who also happened to be deeply involved in his people's culture, to the point of learning to be a "singer" or healer.
In Hillerman's books, Joe Leaphorn was a "legendary detective" who was also a highly educated scholar, at least as if not much more knowledgeable about Navajo and Native American culture and religion than Chee.
In a movie as deprived as "The Crew" an inquisitive audience member anxiously awaits the conclusion, not only because they are overcome with pleasure that the pitiful waste of time is finally over, but also because the ending usually brings a sense of accomplishment to a production, regardless of how horrible.
However, that sense of accomplishment is also absent from "The Crew."
The paper-thin plot of this movie is much more amusing -- or perhaps much closer to being amusing would be more accurate -- if you saw the original (also a "must-have"), but the plot is NOT the point.
And there is also a sub-plot with two police detectives (Carrie Anne Moss and Jeremy Piven) who are investigating the murder.
Burt Reynolds who is also good (look at BOOGIE NIGHTS) is a comic prop used in this film getting wacked on the head and having his head dunked in the toilet.
Besides Cassel, Miguel Sandoval has a few bits of good lines also (especially on his description on Seymor Cassel's appearance).
Jokes are awful and the plot is junk also... Avoid this movie at all costs.
Probably the creepiest aspect of all this was that Bruce's son, Brandon, also died prematurely while filming THE CROW and the studio did pretty much the same trick (though with modern computer techniques it did look better).
Speaking of that footage(in which Lee also takes on student/instructor/nunchaku expert Dan Inosanto and hapkido master Ji Han Jae), it was shot immediately before work on "Enter the Dragon" began and obviously was not intended to be used in the final "Game of Death" project.
Dan Inosanto also gives a Jeet Kune Do clinic.
There was also much more footage available that never made it into this film, just why I do now know (Check out the documentary called 'Bruce Lee: A Warriors Journey' and you will see more action that was meant for this film.)
This is especially evident when the interviewer tries to touch on the subject of David Hess' wife, Karoline Mardeck, also being in the film.
What I also got from the interview is that David Hess, although strange, is a pretty deep and real guy with some interesting insights into the characters he's played and the movies he's made.
Although it cost Â£18.99, I decided to buy it anyway because I heard it also featured Deodato's other film House On The Edge Of The Park, a film which I had heard quite a bit of hype about.
Apparently, the colossal loss of money that Papa sacrificed not only drove him out of his partnership with Lane but also out of the movie.
It may be filthy, but it's also extremely boring, which is especially disheartening considering the fact that at least two of Cronenberg's earlier films --- THE BROOD and THE FLY --- are masterpieces of modern horror.
The idea of people getting turned on by car crashes didn't just sound stupid and lame but also sick.
I don't know about other people but when I think of car crashes I think of destruction; I think of death; I think of loss; I think of the time and effort that it'll take to rectify not only the situation involving how the hell you're going to get around now the car's gone but also how you're supposed to recover from the shock of it.
Sometimes, hating characters is good and can be done cleverly: disliking an evil character or not liking the ways in which certain characters go about their business can also be good fun but when you see a film that is just a barrage of sex scenes, bizarre characters talking like they're in some sort of drug induced stupor and silly, unbelievable developments; it's very difficult to not only switch your mind off to what's going on but also be tempted to not switch the film off.
It is not only grotesque but also boring.
There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits.
The movie also shows black men in a very poor light as every single character is flawed beyond measure and not one of them has a single redeeming quality.
This tells me that not only was the budget really low, but the crew were also in a hell of a hurry and nobody could be arsed to tell the director he was really really bad.
I also liked the Reese's Pieces joke.
Finally I plodded back to my date (who was also hating it but was determined to use up the $7) and let myself be tortured for the remaining hour.
Mia Farrow's performance is also wooden and I have seen better acting in school plays by grammar school students.
The only good actor was Robert Forster and he also had the best script.
Everyone is there for the grand opening which also includes some ridiculous mini Winter-Olympics festivities which has several hundred people either cross-country skiing, down-hill skiing, ski-dooing or watching the skating events and of course, what better day would there be to have a disaster than on this particular day?
Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education!
The third season DVD set also includes the reunion, set in 1950.
Like that film, it was also made in colour (the first three were in black and white), but the end product shares very little else in common with any of it's four predecessors.
"Carry On... At Your Convienence" was a huge loss-maker at the time of its cinematic release for mocking the unions, and this factor probably also had some effect on the success - or lack thereof - of "Wildcats".
Elliott Gould is bemused and colorful as a Vietnam veteran back in college, stuck between a rock and a hard place; he's working semi-seriously towards getting his teaching credentials, and yet is stymied by his fellow classmates who want to protest the hypocrisies of the Establishment (with Gould's help), and also by his instructors, hypocrites with power who work by a double standard.
They also do not appear to have any talents other than acting goofy--not exactly a deep act!
The film also looked very nice.
It also shares its ability to bore me witless, with the quantity and quality of sex seriously waning after the first half an hour, and very little in the way of decent gore, despite featuring more of the undead.
There's also soft core sex scenes between Eastman and Gemser and between Cersosimo and Funari as well as the previously mentioned hard-core sex scene.
There's also a half-way decent electronic score by Marcello Giombini.
The book also describes many tribal customs and rituals that the movie glosses over, which makes it look like so much mumbo-jumbo, "oh, look, they're dancing around in a circle," without any understanding of the significance to the Lakota people of the Sun Dance and Ghost Dance, which are covered in detail in the book.
I am also a life-long Democrat.
There are also corporations, like mine, who have a corporate culture toward providing a service to customers.
It was also rather irritating (TOUCHY SUBJECT ALERT) that half of the plot was ignored.
I also recommend some Bulleit Bourbon with it, 5 shots-worth.
You also get to see the chief from Get Smart as the mastermind behind the heist.
However, you also get to see a chase scene at the end that is to long and rather anti-climatic and the other guys in the heist are rather bad in how they are presented.
The story also makes little sense and offers no or very little explanation.
He also has this bag of stuff which I presume is the killer bugs blood so they won't attack him but I'm only guessing because that's what happened in the first film.
The main character is too active to be the impotent character Stewart plays but he's also too feeble to be a real hero character.
Its also the story of a generational conflict between a father who wants his son to find security in the family business and his son who wants to be a musician.The young man's grandfather was a great swing musician who gave it up for a boring conventional life but the young man has an unusual muse who inspires him to have the courage be true to himself and his dream.
I also didn't like the fact that the scummy rapist judge didn't get shot at the end and was allowed to completely get away with forcing himself on another woman!
Its a winning combination that is definitely a chick movie and will also pull in the crowd hungry for nostalgia.
Now that also could of bin funny.
Then there was "The Astronaut Farmer," which was also mediocre.
This did not work even as well as that movie, which I also disliked.
The most unfortunate thing about this movie is the waste of, particularly, an excellent actress like Susan Sarandon but also for wasting Seann William Scott, who has been far better in other comedies (even the American Pie series had more humor and came across as more realistic than Mr. Woodcock) and has also done well in some dramatic/action movies, with comedic qualities in his performance, as in Bulletproof Monk and the Rundown.
They also show us film of some of the great cars of bygone days in action.
Her character was also masochistic.
but the seductress falls in love ("I'm mad about the boy") which is fine since the boy's also in love with her.
Mike Tyson also makes an appearance as himself and seems to have some acting talent.
Toback's use of celebrity here is also peculiar.
At times the acting seemed a little sluggish also.
The film also uses Morgan Fairchild as a star of this film...not!
But he also plays a real jerk.
I had great hopes for this movie, which I rented after reading other comments, and also based on my previous experience with some excellent Cuban movies.
At some points, there is also a "horror" film effect that has been tried.
Additionally, young Carson's family members, equally moronic fellow students, and school staff are seldom well-drawn, the only characters of abiding interest being Sharon (Tracey Mann), a new teacher at the high school and, in particular, "Redback" (Steve Bisley), owner of a junkyard for motorcycles, who gives Steve an opportunity to learn a trade (welding) and also to restore a wrecked motorcycle, thereby opening a way for the boy to flee from an uncivil environment.
Parents as these are not only looking out for their new grandchild, but they are also considering the long term effects their daughter may suffer.
is not true i actually enjoyed several episodes thru the years , among them the rescue scene where Dr Ross saves the boy, Dr Greene last episode,and this years the recurring dream,and yes i am a big fan of Dr. morris, ,but the thing i hate this show is it wears thin , one of my least favorite character is Dr carter , he is a rich ,preppy type doctor who had so little in common with the people this show is usually about , .i also hate the fact the writers etc preach to us in every show they said on the recap they never did well they are wrong watch the old shows and see if they are not pushing an agenda ,it always came with a point if you really looked closely, while some like that i don't like Hollywood telling me what to think.what to feel!!
I suppose maurice chevalier also lends some class to the film.
Also watching her vast array of facial expressions in this scene also brought a tear to my eye... from laughter.
My sister, who watched the movie then read the book also expressed displeasure at the plot changes in the movie.
Some of the dialog and accents were a little contrived, hokey and derivative, but were also vaguely amusing at times.
There's also something at the beginning of the film about a monk who documented the story of a nun possessed by what seems to be a fallen angel, back in the 1600's...more about that it a minute.
The characters also all speak in a modern dialect, with contractions and words that would have no place in 20,000 BC.
In this they follow in the footsteps of the TV shows, which also take bad teen melodrama dialogue into the sword and sorcery genre.
Kevin Sorbo plays Kull of Atlantis who joins a noble army and ends being King and also ends up being part of an intricate plot to revive some ancient demoness.
I think this is also a film that clearly had no art direction and it offends the chronological senses even worse than Hercules and Xena to the point at which you began to think the entire thing took place in a world of cheesey movie sets instead of some time in our distant past.
At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the "Hercules" TV show that starred the same "actor" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo.
Lancaster has an ace or two up his sleeve also.
this thrashy rip-off felt more like an pumped up version of xena or this absolute horrible new adventures of robin hood series which should also be forbidden.
The dubbed sound is also awfully bad.
Then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber, but that also failed.
There are also some creative "surrealist" moments in the film (particularly during the shrinking lover b/w portions), but I found them to be more flashy and "oohh look he's being different" than intelligent and thought provoking.
The film also contains an abundant amount of female nudity, which after a while became gratuitous.
This is the first movie I have not liked Dustin Hoffman in, and Natalie Portman's performance is also poor.
I've been a movie lover all of my life (which means almost sixty years of loving movies); saying that, I'm also one who tries to find something good to say about nearly every movie I've seen.
It's all fast paced, sometimes stupid, even a bit campy but also fairly entertaining.
The faux-funk music is by JJ Johnson, who also contributed to CLEOPATRA JONES & THE FUZZ BROTHERS.
He also wrote last year's corny Irish-American flick "In America".
Unfortunately, I felt the casting was also pretty misguided in The Jammed.
I'd also like to give some credit to the original tv show director Ed Bye, who was not involved here, that his direction with Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson was perhaps the key to the success of the series as with The Young Ones, Red Dwarf etc.
I also liked how the movie made the marines have a prayer after the insane slaughter of civilians who clearly had no weapons.
I also don't believe anyone involved with this film should make another dime from slandering our service men in this way.
Ultimately the morality of this film portrays the Americans not only as 'shoot first, ask questions later' types but also as plain bloodthirsty.
It is the Iraq War critic's dream film: where every preconceived notion of what is wrong with the American occupation is true, every injustice levied against our troops by their own government is true, and every hyper-violent, baby killer, traumatized stereotype of the American fighting man is also true.
The film also shows a man clown up by a UAV for simply walking down the street with a shovel.
This is also patently against US Rules of Engagement, and would never happen.
It also captures the true ugly, psychotic, non-glamorous side of being a gangster.
There's also a fun drinking song (newsmen of course).
It's fun brainless carnage packed with oddities and quirks used by directors whom while trying to score a buck or two also test the censorship boundaries to their limit and sometimes succeed in making something that really stands out.
It's also obvious that a lot of horror directors of the time wanted to make immature, cheesy, ridicules piecesÂSuspiria, The Omen, The Wizard of Gore.
I could also see that many see this movie just as misogynistic as it's a film showing contempt for women as you see them hacked to pieces.
This movie was also released under the title, "The Mad Magician".
I agree also with the comment about the crazy lawyer who tried to be a one-man tactical team.
Mafia hit men fighting the undead is an original idea, but the director who also starred spent too much time trying to make hisself look cool, but that is hard to do when you can't act.
And also, a psychic ability should have some sort of introduction (but don't worry, its only a 3 second thing that has no follow through, so no plot spoiler here)!
It really sounds terrible, and it also makes the rest of the world think that all swedes suck at English which really isn't the case.
Not only do they read their lines in the worst form of Swenglish, there's also an embarrassing lack of devotion and experience.
1', in which he also stars, is a peculiar hybrid of the two genres that is consistently unpleasant without offering any compensation in the way of insight or laughs.
Paul Bettaney looks quite like the younger MacDowell (whose younger self he plays), and the film also has the talented David Thewlis on its cast list, but the net result is tiresome and thin, while the potentially interesting plot ends without subtlety or satisfaction.
Some of the dialogue is also hilariously inept at best and the feature was in places poorly scripted.
This movie is perhaps even more campy than "Conan the Barbarian" but it's also a lot worse.
Besides Peter Cushing, the movie also features Sean Connery with glitters, Trevor Howard, Ronald Lacey and John Rhys-Davies.
The intro with the sword seems to be stolen by 'Conan the barbarian' (also 1982), but in quality not even close to it.
(eightx10)  Yes, that is also true.
He also gives O'Keefe a really boring riddle that if he solves in that year, his life will be spared.
Or like here, where he decided to say the heck with serious acting let me be in one of those horrible films with one of those guys who can not act a lick in this case Miles O'Keefe, also seen in the dreadful "Cave Dwellers", which was also a sequel to another one that I have heard is bad itself Ator.
Sushmita also did a good job.
!,i would also say that the story is bit like the the shining.i didn't like the ending and the twist ain't that good too if u see the movie then i am sure ur gonna realize the fault that the director made (u will have to pay attention to know more faults .....there are a lot of faults) .....the ghosts die becoz the tree burns down becoz they wre living there but at the final shot they show that kid has become a ghost........how the hell did he get away ???
The zombie children live on a Banyan Tree (don't know if Bargat ka pedh is Banyan) and there's a small shed in the backyard of the house also.
Also there is that funny short guy from Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon who features in all of Ramu's productions (He was also in Hungama).
Even the husband gets killed and the boy is also smacked by the zombie family (who are now joined by Radhika and Murali zombies).
Susmita comes to know about the tree through that mad guy (Small funny guy) and when she returns she sees her little boy lying on the floor and now her husband is also a zombie.
).Sush wakes up in the hospital and finds her son okay and then when she picks him up the last shot of the scene shows the boy (her son) is also a zombie i.e.
There are no songs in the film and they are not needed also.
It also goes on for too long and could've used a better editor at the helm.
Jane Wyman and Allen Jenkins team up as the reporter/detective pair in their first but also the series final episode.
this movie has elements of other movies,some better(Cujo,Man's Best friend)some not as good(Rottweiler).the idea of a group of people stranded on an island and fighting for their lives is nothing new,either.this particular movie doesn't really add anything new to the genre.it's also pretty slow,with not very much suspense or tension.yet i found it just interesting enough to be entertaining.by entertaining,i mean,i think's worth a cheap rental,and i wouldn't buy it unless you can get it cheap.for me,the movie held promise,but just didn't deliver.i wasn't overly interested in any of the characters.for me,The Breed is a 4/10
the man may throw out a lie here or there, but at least he gets his audience to think with a different view or mindstate- unlike this film, which has nothing to say other than: "we're as good as him"- which they also are not.
I was disappointed by the performance of Malcolm McDowell but on reflection it may be due to the script which seemed to loose direction at the end when Malcolm dominates the screen, and also due to my personal over expectation of Malcolm's return to the big screen.
I also agree with many, that Moore can be a little, to a lot overbearing at times.
Or better yet, watch a good documentary instead (like "Grey Gardens", which is also playing this month on Sundance).
I use the word "fan" loosely here really because while I've enjoyed his documentaries and come away from them believing I'd learned something, I've also had problems with them.
If you've seen Juon/The Grudge/The Ring you've seen it all before.The film also uses people with physical deformity for frightening effect for no good reason other than the film makers have broken through the bottom of the barrel.
The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.
It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.
It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes.
Marshal Stephen McNally is also on their trail, but he's slowed up by a gunshot wound that's left his trigger finger a might unsteady.
Kudos are also in order for the uniformly fine acting from a first-rate cast: Bettany is genuinely riveting and terrifying as the severely driven and psychotic main character, Thewlis likewise impresses as one smooth operator, McDowell makes the most out of one of his best more recent roles, the ravishing Saffron Burrows exudes pure class as Freddie's brassy singer moll Karen, plus there are nice supporting contributions by Kenneth Cranham as the wise Tommy, Jamie Foreman as hot-headed rival hoodlum Lennie Taylor, Eddie Marsan as sniveling toad Eddie Miller, Andrew Lincoln as vicious hit-man Maxie King, and Doug Allen as the brutish Mad John.
They also find out there are real aliens, Crystal and Amber!
I also recall King Ralph being a serious bowler.
And also, the horse is really stupid.
There are many flashbacks concerning the life of the young gangster and the older gangster played by Malcolm McDowell who managed to send Freddie Mays to prison and he also took over his entire business.
Several other silent features also eschewed captions -- 'The Last Laugh', "The Old Swimmin' Hole", 'The Last Moment' -- but those films had linear plots which the audience could easily follow.
I also disliked Ophuls La Ronde, made three years before this film.
You also get the impression it was written while the film was rolling; it's too fragmented and there isn't any character to identify with.
There is also a blatant lack of suspense and there's nothing really thrilling or frightening occurring on screen.
Even if it tries simply to be digital form of art and nothing else (I wouldn't call this a thriller or typical war movie of any kind), it fails also.
There's also heavily noticeable lack of realistic shadows.
Malcolm McDowell also gives a magnetic performance as the older version of Paul Bettany's character many years later.
The CGI shots are also no where near as good as the film makers think they are.
The filmmakers have also made no effort to research their period, without creating any spoilers there is some truly ludicrous almost James Bond like action set pieces that take away all sense that you are watching a realistic war film.
Soon, after he joins Mays' gang, Gangster 55 is also.
This film also has some flashy camera work, but on the whole is more straightforward than the earlier film.
It also doesn't help that the movie is very cheap looking, this lets the movie look all the more weak and ridicules.
The sound also got messed up pretty bad.
This is also variating and at times you can't even hear some of the characters, while the others are clearly understandable, even when they are in the same scene's at times.
The movie also doesn't exactly get scary due to the fact that the mummy is a beautiful, young, half-nude, Arabic girl.
What I remember most about GANGSTER NO 1 on its initial release was the critics mentioning the amount of violence shown ( Channel 4 also pointed out the "disturbing" content before the broadcast last night ) but I don`t really see what the problem is .
And the bare bones of the story seems to steal a massive amount from ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA though the screenplay does remain somewhat underdeveloped   As director Paul McGuigan can also be accussed of being heavily influenced by Scorsese but that can be forgiven as the direction is the best thing about the movie with nice little flourishes like the reflection of a man falling from a high rise block of flats in a car windscreen , and there`s the aforementioned scene of a torture victim .
The action sequences - which also take in several beatings, a rape (committed in front of the girl's ageing father) and car chases - are certainly capably staged which, propelled by a pounding score from Guido and Maurizio De Angelis (better known as "Oliver Onions"), give the film an unrelenting pace that ensures it never slips into boredom despite its being predictable at every turn!
I also felt the music was unnecessary.
She also feels the need to adopt a secret identity as a student at a local girls school and waste time going to classes.
She also wants to take over the world.
This rivalry remands me to contrast between Snow White and the wicked stepmother because also here the witch hates her arch-nemesis because she's more young and more pretty.
Director Jeannot Szworc gives a decent job: the rhythm of the action is not particularly raging but he is able to render the mood, the atmosphere of comic-book perhaps also helped by the photography and the scenography that gives the right color to the images.
She bears the palm of the worst actress in the movie but especially this time she wins also the award as the most ugly woman in the screen although the presence of the fat Vaccaro.
Ergo, gangsters are fascists, and, double ergo, films which portray gangsters without a wagging finger are also fascist.
Who says that aliens can't also have a good-natured sense of humor?
He is also a doctor working with dying people.
I suppose you could also see inspector Jansen as a parody, which might make it a bit more bearable, but the storyline is still too thin to make it worth while.
The film also comments on the social avarice that penetrates our society, wealth, power and fame, I think the points it makes are truly justified.
Of course you've also got your most recent up to date humor that won't last even five years.
So then wait, Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a " double take" on the real bad guys, only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad, but the undercover cops are good, but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad, and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good, but only until he is bad again.
Bianca Ryan went on to win Season One, which was fantastic, and last year, the person who deserved to win also took it, ventriloquist Terry Fater.
also, people who get voted out are often brought back, and sometimes displace people who really are talented.
also, a few of the bigger acts coordinate their performances with the producers, using props and gags that they otherwise wouldn't have access to, and that somewhat helps them "outshine" the other performers.
I must say I don't like this version, just as the original version also seems a bit lame to me.
Shrooms also has to make do with the self-same camera tricks to replicate the audio-visual apparitions, and to similarly lackluster effect, while its monotonous over-reliance on sudden, deafening chords pastes over the lack of genuine shocks.
There are also some really creepy woodsmen, Ernie (Don Wycherley) and Bernie (Sean McGinley) don't help the panicking teens.
If anything this film did two things make me laugh at the poor acting, particularly Haun's wooden acting & it also made me slightly angry at the representation of Ireland.
It's also a future that will hold boredom, and a wasted hour and a half for those who choose to watch this uninvolving, predictable, agonizingly slow horror flick.
I am quite certain also that the good money thrown after bad towards salaries, production and marketing on this one, could have funded 5 superior new hopefuls with the aim of in fact igniting a revival in the 'Industry' and saving the rest of us from the embarrassing drivel we got.
I'm aware they also have a history of attacking reviewers.. have at it, guys.. it won't change how simply awful this is.
this movie was the first ever i saw at the drive-in and even if i was 7 years old , it was an exceptionable film.even if it is an 80's,you have to look further than special effects to like or love this movie.the acting is simple , so is the storyline , if you saw the first one , and the fight scenes are human.it's the best of the film of the duo,and no one should destroy them before seeing the rest.you have to accept the fact of the budget they had and also the music in wave at the time.the in sync of the fight was a choreography to make ballet cheap.and do not forget that it was shot in Italian first,they had to transcript all of the scenario.i just think it was a gem.
All in all, a little gem of a film displaying plenty of brooding style but also surprising warmth (not a feeling one usually associates with ghost stories).
This movie also shows that the truth is always better and friendship is really important!
It also brought out old bad memories from middle school.
There were also some parts of the movie that weren't explained clearly enough (such as Gabby's admirer and apparently hard-to-get reputation).
During or after "Popular", she's been in twenty projects, including hit movies like Pearl Harbor, The Ring and a regular cast-member status in two series, while also guest starring in others.
I also believe that 60s was the best dressed decade for women (don't like pirate shirts for men, though :)) and I enjoyed the beauty of the film.
It also marks the auspicious directorial debut of Paul Mazursky, a former actor who ended up making two decades' worth of insightful films focused on personal foibles and sympathetic satire ("An Unmarried Woman", "Down and Out in Beverly Hills").
I also loved the beginning of the movie with the encounter session which was absolutely hilarious.
Persons with a special interest in the careers of one of the four actors might also find it somewhat interesting, although this movie was a best a footnote on any of their careers.
The movie also does a great job of balancing drama with farce, superficiality with intimacy.
So that also explains Elwood's ability to smuggle himself in the dash of the car in this one, and the car being able to crash land from a fiery loop-de-loop at the fairgrounds.
In a way, it's also a love story, but don't expect to get a Hollywood-standard happy end here.
The second half of the film is a violent "tour de force", and as bodies are piling up during the action-packed climax, this film also becomes one of the goriest Hongkong films aside the great "The Untold Story" and the viciously funny "The Ebola Syndrome".
This also turns out to be a set-up - and the ending is not happy for the two luckless lovers...
They also put a lot of thoughts in the various shooting locations, such as the decorations of the various homes etc.
The movie sports a "Who's Who" of modern-day blues musicians and singers and also is directed by John Landis, who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years.
The music, editing and special effects also add to the momentum!
OK it's about relationships and it's not a character sketch, but it's also a well done movie with some very strong moments and some fine details.
Like all Almodovar's movies, this one also features desperate characters who cope with loneliness.
Victor also becomes involved with the other cop's (Sancho) wife and she (Clara) starts to fall in love with him.
This film also allows us to look inside the male psyche, without the cliches and judgements that spoil so many other attempts.
In some single scenes it also shows other genres.
Besides this it is also a very well-acted film, especially by the very dependable Bardem.
Alfonso Beato provides the film with a gorgeous cinematography and Alberto Iglesias, like always, comes with a score that is beautiful on its own, but also fitting the film in a perfect way.
Pino was a congressman also, the only one who dared to report the abuses during the Menem era.
Great images can also be seen throughout the movie.
The movie will also change the way you watch movies.
I not only own the video but I also watch it on television whenever it airs.
Columbia also has an annoying habit for not including extras, except for some theatrical trailers; a few classic films (Gilda, The Lady From Shanghai, etc) are lucky to have a featurette or a commentary.
Rescued by a boy named Moondoggie (James Darren who was never much of an actor but would also develop into quite a teen idol), Francis is introduced to the surf culture (watch for "Billy Jack's" Tom Laughlin).
I also loved how they showed the film clips and pointed out where the stars of the documentary were.
Jacob Wade (Jack Palance) used to be a celebrated shootist just stepping into middle age and mortally weary of having to be asked to leave every town he rides intoÂ To make matters worse, a few notorious outlaws, led by the vile King (Neville Brand), are also out to take him downÂ   Now he tries to do something for his boy Riley (Anthony Perkins) by catching and breaking mustangs in Echo Canyon, the best wild horse country in the territoryÂ   Complicating the situations further is Jacob's bad relationship with a kid who hates him, and Ada Marshall (Elaine Aiken), a young woman whom Jacob met in a gambling hall, and shot a man on account of herÂ  Here is a thinking person's Western that deals with one ex-gunman who also is unable to shake his past and whose ultimate goal for taking root again is by lynchingÂ   Levin shows a dark, depressing, and sadly realistic face of the west...
She looks amazing and also has loads of confidence.
Manmohan Desai was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films AAA is one of them   The film marked one of Bachchan- MD most famous films and also a blockbuster  The plot is the similar long lost brothers theme but it's well handled and entertaining  The plot is revealed in the initial 20 mins itself which is damn serious but then the film gets funny and entertaining Amitabh's character is one of the best parts, Anthony Gonsalves became a big rage and is remembered even today The scenes between Amitabh- Vinod, the fight and the jail scenes are well handled(in PARVARISH surprisingly both played opposite roles of cop and thief) though the long lost theme isn't taken much further like other films(meaning the searching of the siblings.etc) but the film is more on entertainment then story  The film then focuses on love stories between Amitabh- Parveen, Rishi- Neetu.etc There are several entertaining scenes like Bachchan carrying Mukri to the hospital, Amitabh's long drunken monologue, Amitabh- Pran scene and many more There are too many songs though, like after the famous MY NAME IS ANTHONY GONSALVES in few minutes there is HUMKO TUMSE HO GAYA and PYAAR KE DUSHMAN   The film ends too in a slapstick manner with the disguises which also got famous and the long fight scene  Direction by MD is fabulous Music is good too  Amongst actors Though an esemble cast Amitabh towers above all and no doubt his character of Anthony became a rage and won him best actor award too He excelled in his character which is completely different from what Bachchan did mostly Vinod Khanna plays the cop role with elan and his last funny act is hilarious Rishi is a natural in his role and he is at his best towards the end Amongst the girls Neetu is alright, Shabana irritates, Parveen is very good Pran excels, Jeevan is as usual Hercules is okay
Coincidentally he is also bringing up Jenny, Robert's daughter who he stole from him.
The songs also deserves a special mention, all of them are perfect.
Anthony also calls Akbar & Amar as his brothers but let's get back to there real dad it seems his the evil guy now LMFAO!
There's also the songs of course, though not too many - especially in the first half of the film.
So Jeremy locks his Uncle's wheelchair next to an open window allowing the draft to kill him(..while also letting his Uncle peer at the family graveyard as a reminder of where the old man is about be heading).
This also has the "coming out" stylistics of a future filmmaker.
He is also the host introducing us to each macabre tale.
The second story is also the second best.
There were later episodes that also had great suspense, and terror that modern gore films can only fantasize about producing.
If you like classic shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Nightstalker, and others, and classic Horror, Crime, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to go over to Amazon.com and buy this film that is also included with the complete first season on DVD today!
This film is very funny but also shows the harder side of life for these background actors.
Steven Spielberg's first professional directing job was segment two of this anthology, which also proved to be one of Joan Crawford's last acting efforts, certainly her last worth noting.
Ossie Davis also stars in this episode, and he's wonderful.
I love this movie; and I also loved Night Gallery, but this film has 3 different viewpoints and would appeal to a large audience.
And there are also the throw-away lines in the bar: Waitress to Bartender: "Two Old Fashions- no ice, no water, no sugar, no grenadine".
He does not realize that Talman is also working in cahoots with Arnold's trophy wife (Marie Windsor) to get the upper hand over the lawyer.
See also the sequence where Young chases Talman along a deserted set of elevated train tracks through Chicago.
Then Young heads to the precinct for the graveyard shift, riding in a prowl car with a new partner he's never met before (Chill Wills, who also plays the unseen `Voice of the City').
There are many scenes of the real life carnival customers gawking at the camera from a few feet away and some also appear to have been roped in as extras where crowd scenes are needed.
There are endless scenes of ad-libbed dialogue complete with microphones in plain view and also scenes using dubbed in dialogue which bear no relation to what's happening on screen.
While you hear the sound of a heartbeat, those black screens with red lettering also has a woman's face moving her mouth and not voicing out a single word!
That's it for the threadbare plot -- and said skimpy story is related by cinematic blunder wonder triple threat would-be producer/ director/writer auteur Leonard Kitman (who also puked forth "The Curse of the Headless Horseman" and later did a few scuzzy porno movies under the alias Leon Gucci) with a staggering all-out incompetence that's genuinely breathtaking to behold.
like i said its funny but its pretty darn good too.......................  the film is about people being filmed without knowing it and getting their reactions to unusual encounters mainly with nudity, like a naked lady asking for directions, one asks some ppl to kiss her, and a naked girl in an elevator, and then has video of ppl discussing the film after they watched it...........  so if you haven't seen this and you like stuff like candid camera and things like that you'll like this, but this is also more than that, so ya i recommend it, if you can ever find it
There's also some interviews with underage kids who seem to think they know all but don't really.
I also loved seeing that scene with that red-haired woman when she faked an orgasm after getting spray-painted!
They also managed to fit a love-interest into a prison movie (hard to do and not particularly convincing but fun to watch nonetheless).
In my opinion, this was a great movie in a comedy aspect, but it also touches on your emotions as parts of the movie are, or can be, very sad.
Coincidentally Dick Foran also appears in that film although as a character similar to Dick Powell's, the phony cowboy.
The musical score is also awesome, and fits the movie very well.
Life is about love and life is also about pain.
And it's also a slow movie, just a warning, but I loved it.
For all those who just want 2 C something fun new movies Sex Drive and The Hangover are very nice, also Yes-Man is a good one if you want to have a good laugh.
How Brolly dies is also gross as Goku blows him up into shreds rather graphically and Paragus is crushed to death, though we are fortunately spared the gory details.
Paragas also tells of the Legendary Super Saiyan, who threatens to destroy the Universe, and that only Vegeta can stop him.
I think she could really do more of these "serious" parts and John Heard is also quite convincing.
John Heard is an underrated actor who adds a somewhat mischievous, ominous and sometimes comical overtone to his roles (You may want to watch him in the earlier 1970's film "Chilly Scenes of Winter", and there was also a film short wherein he portrayed Fortunato, in Edgar Allen Poe's "Cask of Amontillado".
There was also a very unusual but effective music score and a few nice jolts in the movie too.
Macross itself doesn't just look like a huge intergalactic space station, it also *feels* like one.
Unbeknownst to them, other people are also interested in the cannon because it contains the crown jewels of England: a history professor and Abner's boss, who moonlights as a crime boss, and an British secret agent who wants to recover the jewels for England.
The two nerdy salesmen in here are also funny.
(Actually the numbers aren't bad they just belong in a different film) I know that the numbers are the result of this being one of those "studio" films where everyone in the studio appears partly as part of the story, but also as an advertisement for themselves and what ever movie they are currently promoting.
Thora Birch is also noteworthy although her British accent is inconsistent at the best of times.
It has a solid cast, from the ever reliable David Warner to the up and coming Freddie Prinze Jr, also including many British TV regulars (that obviously add a touch of class :), not forgetting the superb Tcheky Karyo.
Anyone who watches bbc's Holby city may recognise a few members of the crew also.
Saffron Burrows also does well as the commander of the fighters.
I also like the fact that the movie is interpreted more like today's naval battleships and uses torpedos and gun fire as opposed to Lasers of most sci-fi movies.
The 'Tigerclaw' also appears more like reality as a naval ship with the submarine 'look' of today's standards too.
The Rashomon type plot is a little too simple, we know that the other three are dead and we also know that when four people go somewhere enclosed and one comes out alive, that they had something to do with it.
He also manages to seduce the loving Agnes, who, having acquiesced is now of course unworthy of a man of his stature.
He also finds out that for him, the best way is to put hand over hand along the rope that leads upwards while kicking the ones who are coming below him.
The result is, however, that he blunders not only in public but often also in his private life.
Sharply satirical, hilariously funny, intelligent, but also in terms terribly dated comedy about the stupidity, lack of heroism and relentless worship of the German emperor united in the title character, a lazy student.
also, it is not so much of a horror than a thriller with teens in the main roles.
Coming,in Sirk's career ,just after "All that Heaven allows" ,it looks like its twin movie.Unlike "Written on the wind" or "Imitation of life" or "Magnificent obsession" ,it's not melodrama.It's closer to realistic psychological drama.More than the lingering charm of a romantic past (Blue Moon/You saw me standing alone/Without a love of my own),Sirk focuses on the selfishness of the children.Remember in "All that Heaven..." how the son and the daughter could not admit that their mother (of the upper class) should fall in love with a gardener and how they bought her a TV set where she only could see the reflection of her loneliness.Here the boy's attitude is not far from that: a spoiled child -as his sisters are- ,only concerned by his studies and his love affair,he does not care if his papa has become a nine-to-five man ,useful only for the dough he brings home,a life no more exciting than that of the toy robot he sells.Barbara Stanwyck 's role recalls the 1953 effort "all I desire" : the return of the woman,be she legitimate or a former flame.But in "there's always tomorrow",one can notice one of the permanent features of melodrama though: the woman who turns her back on love and becomes a successful businesswoman (or star) (see also the end of "written on the wind" "imitation of life" or Stahl's "only yesterday")
It's also nice to see that here in Britain we can produce something other than Romantic Comedies and cheap gangster films.
Instead, they discover that the tent belongs to a beautiful girl, Mahla (Jody Lawrance of "Mask of the Avenger"), who is not only about to marry Khalif Hussein (Gerald Mohr of "Invasion, U.S.A.") but also unite two tribes intent on running the French out of Morocco.
I am also very proud that it is a British film as it is far better than any "teen horror" films i have seen recently!
Really you're every bit as out of touch with that class as are the poor old writers of Eastenders,who also seem to think that all their working class characters are fit for is barneying and throwing themselves at every passing bit of skirt 5 minutes after the wedding ceremony!
Without sharing too much, the closing scene is also very well directed to further underscore the storyline and theme.
"All or Nothing" similar cinematic touch is also seen in "Secrets and Lies".
the film also has a clever twist which is deliciously nasty.
When the movie was finished at around two o'clock my eyes were also red and swollen from crying - and yet I was completely sober and so unprepared for this absolutely gripping film experience with the most wonderful actors.
It also had many moments of humour that made watching more of a delight than a hardship.
There is also some fantastic actressing around the edges here: Marion Bailey gives probably the most realistic portrayal of an alcoholic that I have ever seen on film, Alison Garland underplays perfectly in the aching role of the quiet sibling (that seems to have become a staple of Mike Leigh's dramas), and the wonderful Ruth Sheen gifts us a counterbalance in an optimistic role as the neighbour who refuses the be pummelled into submission by her daughter's foul mouth, responding with a smile and humour.
Sally Hawkins also impresses as Bailey's gum chewing daughter, and makes for interesting viewing if you have already seen 'Happy-go-Lucky'.
There are also some wonderful little comedy moments that punctuate this film if you can get your head round the bleakness.
Of course Leigh being Leigh also extends his portrayal to take in other dysfunctional characters living in the same demoralising high-rise housing flats.
**SPOILER** When the son suffers a heart attack, it transforms the relationship within the family unit and also tightens the bond with the neighbours/friends.
When you take the time to dig deeper, you'll not only see the misery, but also a beautiful thing called love.
This movie is very realistic, hard and dark, but in the same time it is also very heart-warming.
This is the first movie, I can recall being about the French resistance also.
The color and the lighting and the overall cinematography in this movie was especially pleasing, also.
If you liked the movie, SHINING THROUGH and MAX, you will like this movie, also.
)I also think that the actors, the screenplays and the plot in each episode became worse and worse, the longer we got towards the ending of the show.
She also had blood on her blouse.
The also had pirates going after a treasure chest I don't remember any treasure chest in the book.
The 1961 version has well known British and American actors,good special effects that were outstanding for that year,even today they stand out,this film also has a Bernard Herrmann music score.
also why were the pirates right off the set of 'Prates of the Caribbean??
He's also visibly embarrassed and stiff wearing it, and the result is not very convincing.
He's also inexplicably hostile towards Nemo without any good reason.
And I also think that the quality of the acting is not as satisfactory as I would have expected it to be.
Mark Snow's score for this stands out beautifully and Scully's last words are also worth the time (and money) spent watching every episode from the season one to this instant from start to finish.
I also was very glad to see Marita Covarubias and Alex Krycek again.
There's also a joke where two characters are discussing the robbery they're going to pull when one exclaims " Let's get out of here , it's like a public park " The camera then pulls away to indeed show the conversation was taking place in a public park .
I did find myself laughing quite a few times, and am sure you will find some reasons to enjoy this, also.
Not only does he star in one of my favourite productions, he is also an all round, really nice guy!
The character of Morgan Pym, it's one of my favorite characters ever, close to solid snake, because he's tough but out of clichÃ©s, the guy also have feelings inside, which is actually good.
This may have been Angie Dickinson's best performance, although she was also terrific in in "Dressed to Kill."
Bree Walker also succeeds in blending her journalistic talent with drama.
It also showed man's darker side, and gave many lessons for the future.
I had also taken some cold medication and hadn't actually taken any notice of the title as I was watching movies back to back just trying to get over the cold.
I gotta say, Im also laughing as I write this as I am usually the sciatic.
I looked the jackass, its also something I doubt I will ever experience again.
The editing is horrible also, and you have the feel that some scenes (including the ending) needed more extensions onto them to help tell the story, but I have a feeling this would just prolong the pain of viewing it even more.
Joaquim de Almeida also shows up in the movie.
It also showed some of the male's perspectives of the business and their involvement.
They also don't want to get out of the trip by just returning home over the school break.
Most characters undergo subtle alterations for the different instantiations of the story, and the four principals--Birch, Harrington, Fox and Knightley--adeptly transform themselves, aided also by their clothing, hair and makeup.
It keeps you on your toes as to just who the perpetrator was, but also enables a surprising and in-depth exploration of the psychotic personality and motivation behind the "lock-in"--whoever the perpetrator was (and I certainly won't reveal the film's answer here), they were clearly somewhat insane.
We're also led to be skeptical about the material that's relayed from an ostensibly third-person point of view.
The Hole is also a bit of an exploration of spoiled kids.
We can see them also gradually losing hope that they'll be able to properly sort the events out and reveal the truth.
It's also an exploration of what makes some go as far as they do and what makes conspirators play along.
Oh, there is also Denise Richards in this movie.
Scott also has the movie go "low tech" with practically no computer generated effects (like what was used in King of the Lost World) or actors running around in creature suits (like Beast of Bray Road or Frankenstein Reborn).
The various priests as well as the psychiatrist also do a good acting job.
The story, which is also entitled 'Bugcrush', originally appeared in the horror anthology 'QUEER FEAR 2', edited by horror writer/essayist Michael Rowe, and was published by Arsenal Pulp Press (2003).
Although he's mostly known as a visual artist, Treleaven also wrote, and directed, the cult films QUEERCORE (1996), and THE SALIVATION ARMY (2002), as well as a number of other scripts and stories.
BTW: I also know the heavy metal scene in Madrid and death metal concerts never looked like this!
If you like this kind of nonsensical black humour, I suggest you give `Airbag' (1997) (qv) by the also Basque director Juanma Bajo Ulloa a try.
this movies interpretation of the devil is that of baphomet, a god the templar knights worshipped that priests accused of being the devil, though adapted by satanists to be used as the devil (search on the internet for baphomet and you can find a picture) throughout the movie alot of cult sybols are shown such as the pentagram and the eye of horus, showing that the director did at least a bit of research, they also mention a few bands at the beginning, one of them being iron maiden, and they play with the belief that a record played backwards can contain secret messages, but kind of mock it.anyway i would recommend this film to anyone interested in horror/mock horror/ or movies about the apocalypse/satan.
There was also a death scene that came right out of nowhere and kind of reminded me of something out of a Dario Argento film.
The opening sequence is pure slapstick you might expect from someone like Benny Hill, but it sets the tone perfectly for what follows, a comedy masterpiece, that also delivers on suspense and horror
Now, Father Angel is sincere in his quest but he also seems a bit naive and sees signs that are perhaps other than he thinks they are, but somehow, with his partners along, despite all the bumbling, it certainly does seem like he's on to something.
A summoning is done, using available things like white bread instead of hosts and LSD instead of the preferred mushrooms, and a rather hurried search for virgin's blood also ensues.
Meanwhile there's also a gang of creeps out to "Clean Up Madrid" by burning bums and all kinds of other festive goings-on.
Alex Angulo stars as father Angel, a priest who is also a scholar of theology, and that has discovered that John's revelation contains encoded the date and place for the birth of the Antichrist: Christmas Eve of 1995 in Madrid.
It's time dear Americans see it takes not only expensive FX but also and more importantly soul to make a good film.
I have to say there's some good music in the film also :) I don't care if it's associated with satan, it's still good to hear metal in films like this one.
Aside from a great sense of humour and an interesting storyline, Day of the Beast also benefits from a plethora of great performances from a talented cast of Spanish actors.
I was also quite taken by Joan Lorring's touchingly vulnerable performance as a girl in with the wrong crowd.
It's not really a film-noir, although the movie certainly shows similarities to the atmosphere and the story also shows noir tendencies.
The movie in the end is perhaps a bit too 'light' to consider it a real film-noir, also because it features quite an amount of subtle black comedy.
I was especially impressed by Sydney Greenstreet, which also might due to the fact that he had the best- or at least most credible plot line.
Peter Lorre also played a great role and gave a fine performance.
But overall her role was also really a solid one and it says something about the quality of the acting from Lorre and Greenstreet to say that Fitzgerald gave the lesser performance of the movie.
Alan Napier also plays a small role.
The editing of the movie was also surprisingly good and fast.
It's rare that a film leaves such a long impression on me, and for all those out there who also were touched by this film, I'd recommend it in a double billing with Martin Rosen's *Watership Down*, a similarly lovely and chilling animation.
There are also several local Latin-Americans assisting the US, one is accident-prone Santos who acts as a plot device to attract the monsters.
I also enjoyed the other actors as well.
I can only assume the viewers do not know what a farce comedy should be like & also the fact that France invented farce comedy hundreds of years ago.
The hues of red, yellow, and orange perfectly decorated not just the surroundings, but also the characters as well.
The colors brightened the sets, but also this film.
When she is unable to solve neither conundrum, she decides to take on "The Skulls" a society at her school (also one that her brother had been trying to get in to) and challenge their prejudices.
It's also weird watching Victor Jory play the hero, after seeing him play the bad guy in many Hopalong Cassidy movies; he's somewhat more convincing as a bad guy than as a good guy.
There's also some tacky special effects.
(and is still more inspiring than anything produced today)..the character of Stash also amazing....but Burnadette Peters with Ashtray Lopsided Hat is beyond PERFECT...this is perhaps MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME...PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE RELEASE ON DVD...Merchant/Ivory has never produced anything less than a first rate film!!!!
!..that should also make it a sure bett for those concerned more with financial risk of releasing this CLASSIC!!!
The characters play well off each other, and also gives that feeling of six degrees of separation.
There is also too much use of an unnecessary voiceover narration that hurts more than enhances the story.
I would also note that the performance of Bourvil as Thenardier is the best I've seen (even better than Ian Holm's in the 1978 version).
build a huge circle of fire wood surrounding your camp, keep the fire burning that way you will not only deter the diabolical doggies but also provide smoke for rescuers to see.
Its also the sort of film that you've seen variations on before.
This is also a film thats going to be better on DVD rather than in the theaters where one is a bit more forgiving of the flaws.
I'd longed for a show that had not only a love interest for the hero who *stayed* on the series (and wasn't booted off simply because fangirls didn't like her), but also had a truly likable relationship happening between the hero and the love interest.
There's also the awesomely weird spawn of Satan, Cady (Jessica Stroup).
I would love to see a new series and i'm sure many people would agree that they would also love to see a new series.
While Missy Peregrym is adorable and hot at the same time as Sam's crush Andi who works with him and is also a good friend.
Tyler Labine is also great fun as Sam's bestfriend, co-woker and sidekick Bert and he gets to show his comedy talents more than he did in abc's Invasion.
Rick Gonzalez is also funny as Sam's other co-worker and friend who also helps him catch demons.
I also love the fact that all his friends want to help him (Sock and Ben), and do so.- when ever the boss (*The devil contacts - SAM)  He (SAM) has a love interest as well, who is incredible beautiful.(Andy).
He likes her, she likes him, and yest not one of them have gone any further about it; and I also love the love/hate relationship between Sock and his old girlfriend - Josie.
Big Wednesday does this in a very elaborate way, since it not only portrays the external behaviour of such generation (hair-style, surfing, music and so forth), but it also displays the internal values of such generation.
no one has come close with such an in depth surfing movie covering so many other aspects of that generation it is also interesting to spot actors who started their careers in this movie.
Gary Busey also to great things.Can tou spot charlene Tilton of Dallas fame and her screen consort Steve kanaly.
We also see a velvet covered frame on the wall that contains a Bronze Star; presumably, The Bear was part of the generation that was taken from the beaches to serve in Korea.
He also actually does a lot of his own surfing in the film, as did Busey and Katt.
Crazy Gary Busey also stars in this Milius film (Milius would go onto wide spread acclaim and fame with Knightriders, having already made a name writing The Godfather), and Vincent would go off to become TV's biggest star in Airwoof.
As it approaches the end, the movie gains rhythm; the final, in every sense, encounter with the big wave is rendered greatly, surfing action is truly gripping, we perceive the strong emotion when facing and struggling against this force of nature, and we also get more intimate with the characters's inner emotional world, probably because the confrontation between man and nature, with the undeniable sense of human finiteness as compared to the greatness of nature, always reveals the real quality of human life.
It is also in the end that we sense the strong friendship of these boys having now turned men, and we understand how real friendship surpasses the years and the comradeship of youth.
There is also a sense of nostalgia for the past years, but with the perception that what we experienced will always remain in our future lives as a precious treasure.
Undeniable that the movie delivers also funny moments, mainly when we see these guys pretending every kind of physical and mental distress, in order to avoid the spectre of Vietnam: really amusing.
The martial soundtrack, which tries to give the movie weight it otherwise lacks, is also unintentionally funny (I dare you not to laugh at the end when our three buddy-boy surfers march into the waves as to war, drums and trumpets blaring all up and down the beach).
Oh yeah before I forget the film also can 'boast' (and I use the term loosely) a forgettable cameo by Mr. Super-Size Me Morgan Spurlock, in a role so atrociously acted that one of the people from the group of individuals that he made fun of during a college lecture can act circles act circles around (no I'm not going to use the term he did, you have the internet, look it up)   My Grade: D
This is also a film about Friendship.
It is also home to one of the funniest scenes of all time from a movie - the draft/registration for vietnam.
Jill Clayurgh (who played Carole) didn't even look like Lombard, but I also suppose she did mediocre acting-wise.
Her only film at MGM also came that year, but it wasn't with Gable; it was a gangster comedy called "The Gay Bride," sort of a thirties "Married To The Mob" (in fact, that phrase is actually used in the film).
(There's also been conjecture that Gable and Lana Turner, who were making "Somewhere I'll Find You," were having an affair at the time of Carole's death, and that Lombard decided to fly home because of her suspicions.
It was also great to see the implications of not being a "moral" and "upstanding" actor in the film industry during its early years.
It was also fascinating to see if Clark Gable really had a softer side in him, since he was probably the greatest leading man in the history of Hollywood and a symbol of American manhood during his time.
Oh, and he also loves monster movies.
"I wanted to make a film where Hardy Boys meet the Wuthering Heights, and I hope that's what I did," explained Tinnell (who also concocted the film's story line).
It also cost the lives of seven people including two members of the Mafia Gennaro family.
Mattelli also learns only to late that once your in the pay of the mob the only way you can get out, or retire, of that squalid arraignment is in a pine box.
I also found the killer clown's remarks entertaining, even though none of them really had much to do with the story.
Personally, I love blaxploitation movies for their brazen, unsubtle approach and mostly poor production values, but I can also understand why they do not interest a lot of people.
There is a very precise and cynical sense of reality, which not only makes the film totally engrossing and believable but also makes it all the more moving as a consequence.
Not only are they in a race to get their hands on the three men before the mafia does, but also confronting their own personal plight.
Providing much of grunt and rattle also was the saucy, upbeat music score and crackerjack soundtrack that complemented the visuals superbly.
Anthony Franciosa is an inept low-level mafiosi also hunting for the culprits.
Antonio Fargas also appears in a brief, and of course, flamboyant role.
It is also a crime movie with some social commentary.
The theatrical trailer, also in fair shape, is offered as an extra.
Anthony Quinn is also excellent as a corrupt police captain who has deluded himself into believing that he still has some ethics.
Yet, she also still makes a couple of stupid decisions and all of her friends, including her horny boyfriend, are more than dim-witted enough to compensate for her cleverness.
Yaphet Kotto also delivers an outstanding performance in his role as the progressive Lieutenant Pope.
One can also learn what it meant to be an oppressed black man, a junior mobster or a tired NYC detective in that late sixties era.
Not perfect, mind you, I also thought Franciosa's character was a little over the top, but good.
Yaphett Koto also appears the same year in "Live and Let Die.
Not just the visuals of a time filled with racial disgust, but also the fact that the racial divide wasn't in just black and white.
The two blended perfectly together, giving us not just a taste of an explosive Harlem, but also the sounds that may have accompanied it.
It's a gritty look at the seamy side of law enforcement and its also gangsters without the Godfather glamor.
This film is pretty close to Don Siegel's masterpiece, Dirty Harry (1971) which also showed very gritty urban setting without any bit of humor or something to ease the realistic and merciless atmosphere.
The photography is also very great and technically there are no worth mentioning flaws in this film.
The end scene is very powerful and memorable mostly because it is so tragic and sad and also intelligent and thought-provoking.
The violence despite being brutal in mental way, is very strong physically, too, as the mafia tortures people without remorse in order to reach its target, but also they should have finished before it became too late.
Eisenstein in particular is good for this approach because one thing that ties music and imagery together well is rhythmic editing, something he is famous for in the first place and also something that he had previously successfully used to create sound-like impressions in completely silent films (like, for instance, quick cutting between a machine gun and its firer to represent the sound of the machine gun unloading).
This movie also ties in the similarities between music and statue (some theorists consider music "sound sculpture"), nature, domestic life, art, and emotions, which of course all all present in this film.
Over the course of four days, these characters will meet and affect each others'lives in unexpected, amusing, but also very touching ways.
I also remember that during a commercial break they showed a 7-UP commercial starring Jeffrey Holder.
In addition, most of the kills take place off-screen, and at first glance the story is also highly unimaginative - a teenage girl called Mackenzie Carpenter ('Mac' to her friends) discovers that pupils at her high school are being killed by a maniac who's dressed as Horny the Clown, the mascot of the Hellaburger fast-food restaurant chain (he looks like the secret love child of Ronald McDonald and Satan).
The movie also skilfully satirizes current American youth culture: in addition to Mac's emo friends, Horny also takes his machete to handgun-flaunting wiggas, right-wing WASP preppies, goth wiccans, and stoner drop-outs.
There's also a surprisingly political edge that's rare in the genre: Mac is described as a vegetarian left-wing liberal, and the dialogue contains quite a few barbs aimed at the Bush administration and Republicans in general.
Mac also regards the police as incompetent fascists, and doesn't tell them anything she's discovered about the murders because she believes she's got a better chance of uncovering who the killer is.
There's also a funny cameo from Supersize Me writer/director Morgan Spurlock as a Hellaburger manager.
At the very least, "The Hoaxters" is worth watching as a lesson in history, and also as a textbook example of propaganda techniques which are still widely used and very effective today.
It also demonstrated fear; the fear of Communism was real; people felt that World War III would break out at any moment; the fear was valid; the fear was reflective in our leaders as well as the common man.
The Hoaxters didn't just reflect the mentality of the times, but it also permitted those in Hollywood to pledge their allegiance (to a lesser degree compared to World War II) against a foe.
With narratives also by Walter Pigeon (interestingly he deals with American foreign policy - under General George Marshall (sort of anathema to McCarthyites in 1952) - and quite favorably), Barry Sullivan, Dore Schare, Howard Keel, and James Whitmore.
Arnold has his secrets also, his daughter Maureen O'Sullivan and her ditzy friend Jane Wyman think Arnold is a stockbroker, as if that wasn't also gambling.
Finding out about Cain's scheme and him having a daughter who's in love with Tommy the mobsters also kidnap Sheila.
Out the second egg comes a very good violin playing owl chick, whom his parents also adore.
I was also surprised to find that one of the voices is done by a former child star who was part of the "Our Gang/Li'l Rascals" films.
It's also a nice tribute to the famous entertaining of yesteryear.
The gorilla also is heard speaking throughout the movie ,without the slightest hint of a gorilla accent, on the radio giving instructions to those trapped, because of a violent thunderstorm, in Uncle Stevens' mansion.
There's also this other weirdo A.P Conway, Paul Harvey, claiming to be one of Uncle Stevens clients whom he embezzled some $250,000.00 out of.
Bela Lugosi is also great as the ever suspicious butler.
It will also help if you like movies featuring men in gorilla suits.
I had gotten the impression from a fellow Marx Brothers fan that the Ritz Brothers also were funny, that "if like like the Marx Brothers, you'll like these guys, too."
it had a good blend of horror and comedy and it also had a nice little twist at the end that i didn't see coming.
A young Patsy Kelly is also on hand.
The ability to watch it in the original Japanese without subtitles covering the picture is nice, also.
Most of the one-shot characters that only appear in one or two episodes are also handled with style and become very vivid.
The four heroines are also entertaining enough, despite not being all that full of surprises.
The storyline also manages to present some interesting themes.
There's also a very intriguing triangle between Sylia, minor nasty Mason and more impressive nasty Largo.
There are also hints that Sylia might be more than meets the eye.
I really liked the movie because it stayed true to the TV show ( mostly ) and also because it finally touched on a subject that many whom are familiar with the TV series had been wondering about: the estranged fathers of the boys.
Wilfrid Hyde-White is also in it.
It is also a sequel of sorts to the earlier "City of God," an award-winning movie directed by Fernando Meirelles.
It's unfortunately also true that in the ghettos of Rio as of other places such as the USA, young gun-toting drug dealers are the sexy local pop stars.
Paradoxically, it also has a more positive arc than 'City of Men,' because its hero works his way out of the slums and into mainstream Rio de Janeiro to become a photojournalist.
They face difficulties even showing up, and only one of them, Ace (Silva) really hits the books (he's also fascinated by guns of all kinds).
He also turns some flashy cartwheels and shows off his spectacular pecs.
But he also carries the weight of suffering and gratitude.
While the forefront of "City of Men" is the young protagonists' quest to find their unknown fathers with all the aforementioned also incorporated as background themes.
In the slum in Morro da Sinuca, a couple of days before turning eighteen year-old, Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) tells his best friend and also orphan Acerola (Douglas Silva) that he misses his unknown father.
When the owner of the hill and Laranjinha's cousin MadrugadÃ£o (Jonathan Haagensen) is betrayed by his right-hand Nefasto (Eduardo BR), he is expelled from the slum and Laranjinha and Acerola have also to leave the hill.
The cinematography is also top-notch, with landscapes from the hill and well-choreographed and impressive action scenes in the slum.
The TV series also adds more depth to the characters that add to the overall enjoyment of the film.
The film also has similar cinematography.
Normally I disgust pulp movies.. so I also was thinking of this movie the first minute.
We also see the heart wrenching effect it had on one of the fishermen and his family, and once again can sense the effect that it had on the whole community.
There is also the over use of multiple images which give us too much to look at, frankly its too much to take in.
It is also fascinating when they shoot the real Titanic on the see bottom.
It's a real slow moving movie, in which the killer himself also isn't known to the viewers this time, until of course the very ending.
The actual movie itself also really feels like it goes into a trance though.
It's not like the story is anything too bad, or the approach of not revealing who the killer is, or how the murder was committed, until the very end, is a bad one but it just doesn't work out with this type of directing approach as got picked by Patrick McGoohan, who is probably also better known and respected as an actor than a director really.
He deserved better, also since he seems really like an actor who is the right guy for playing these type of roles in these types of movies.
The dialogue is also not that great nor is it into going into things explaining things for an exception of a few secs here or there.
I always thought Lucy & Desi were like a puzzle that did not fit, and they also thought so too; as they had a terrible divorce and then miserable lives afterwards.
Far from being a third-rate performer, Desi Arnaz discovered innovative techniques still used in television and film production today; he also invented different types of cameras that led to great improvements in the television and motion picture industries.
The film also is one I treasure and would love to have on DVD.
It's also another spin for Hill on the dying embers of the West, with a motorbike gang (I sense this was first drafted in the 70s) proclaiming themselves the last true outlaws and bastions of freedom before offing some random cops and entangling themselves with Nick Nolte and his amazing never-ending revolver (I count 11 shots in the final barrage of bullets into the bad guy alone).
It also looks like a Tony Scott film with it's earthy tones and blazing suns.
Of course Eddie Murphy also reprises his role as Reggie Hammond.
There are also lighter, funnier moments as well.
"Double Shock" also withholds important information during the murder sceneÂin order to surprise us later.
"A Friend in Deed" also has one person covering up the murder for someone else.
The only parallel I can make is an odd one: Chuck Jones's "Road Runner" series also works because of its formula.
There were also some good comedy scenes between Murphy and Nolte.
Ed O'Ross is also good with his limited screen time.
Vicky does meet a handsome young man in her life who is a neighbor and is also an Air Raid Warden, which was needed during World War II.
The heavenly body refers to Lamarr, of course, who is absolutely gorgeous in this movie as usual, if not much of an actress, also as usual.
The heavenly body also refers to Whitley's comet, a comet to be named after her husband.
And just because Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors in the world does not mean he is also going to be a great director and screenplay writer.
It's also probably the best religious film ever made due to it's generally pro-Christianity atmosphere but also it's unwillingness to shirk from the fact that we are all, at the end of the day, merely human.
I only gave it a ten because Robert Duvall was in it, and also June Carter Cash.
In the film Duval's character is deeply flawed but also deeply faithful.
The central idea of the movie is also very strong: preacher seeks redemption from past deeds by once more bringing the power of the Word to a small community.
He also proves himself to be a competent director, even though that hasn't been a calling he's pursued subsequently.
It functions to assist the viewer in truly understanding not only the culture pervading the southern United States, but also compels the self exploration necessary for achieving an awareness of one's inner personality.
The Ice Harvest strangely enough also has Billy Bob Thornton along with John Cusack as some of the most profane and greedy but not nearly the most messed up characters in a rural Kansas town.
The Apostle often delivers a brand of Southern comfort, simplicity and humanity that's quite refreshing without being naive: I thought it was an important and sobering note that the old man who gives Duvall a tent also sleeps with his rifle on his chest watching him.
Duvall's film also deals greatly with the humanity of Christians.
However, it also presents someone who simply wants to serve the Lord and help people, whether they are poor, black or prisoners.
The other 'actors' in the film also contribute to give "The Apostle" a realistic warmth rarely achieved in mainstream films.
The story of Ong-bak isn't also that great.
Not only does the monkey take a shower, but he also brushes his teeth, shave with a razor, plays the drums, plays video games, drinks a frozen drink and gets brain freeze, and oh yeah he snowboards too.
This movie also shows what a great actor Richard Pryor really could have been if he was cast in more serious rolls, instead of just comedies.
Supporting him extremely well are Beau Bridges, as a former competitor turned ally, Pam Grier, as his loving and supportive wife, Cleavon Little as lifelong crony Peewee, Vincent Gardenia as blustery redneck sheriff Cotton, Richie Havens as mechanic Woodrow (Mr. Havens also sings the catchy songs very well), Earl Hindman as arrogant star racer Beau Welles, and Noble Willingham as slick Billy Joe Byrnes, the man who gets Wendell into racing in the first place.
I will give it 8 of 10 because it's a very nice in it's class... And I grade it also as really worth viewing 2 or 3 times in 10 years and a good buy, if it's hopefully get on DVD and you like this type of hilarious adventure films...
This not only gives us the feeling of being there, it is also incredibly vivid and dynamic.
Bird of Paradise also includes a couple of "before they were famous" curios.
Importantly he is also a generous player, who never attempts to steal the scene.
But that's also one of the downfalls.
Also gone is the fact that Henry witnesses his own death and also speaks with Claire's father and brother at the time, and Claire having arrived shortly afterwards having just missed the death too (actually to be honest, the way his death happens in the movie feels entirely avoidable).
Featuring a mixed cast of British and American actors, the result is mainly predictable but some surprises and disappointments also feature.
Then there's two of him or two of the daughter who also has the 'gift'.
If Pitt wants to buy the rights to a good movie with a no kidding, monumentally interesting and original story that also includes an amazing love story: Purchase the rights to "Sariah's Secret!"
I would suggest one from more than sixty years ago, entitle A Matter of Life and Death (also released as Stairway to Heaven) by The Archers, and starring David Niven and Kim Hunter: a great sense of play, and a careful adherence to the premises.
Directed with imagination and professionalism by Stuart Burge and well produced by Peter Snell who followed with a sequel also little known 'Marco Antonio and Cleopatra' starred and directed by Charlton Heston.This gripping flick will like to Shakespeare devotees but its spirit is intact in spite of are taken some liberties.
The acting was also poor, but given the quality of material there was to work with I doubt anyone could have made it better.
Not only do we see young Henry's first travel through time, but we also witness the regular occasion of him meeting another version of himself at a different stage of life, as well as the incident that shapes his life foreverÂthe passing of his mother in front of his eyes.
Instead, the film is pretty much a linear telling of the life of Clare, probably the best entry point in being that the title does reference her; she is the one who must cope with this man that she cannot live without yet can also never truly have to herself.
You also never understand the sense of danger in what happens to Henry.
But the movie worked on a number of different levels based on the screenplay, directing, beautiful cinematography, and acting, not just of the always captivating Rachel McAdams, but also the much underrated Eric Bana as the co-lead, and the rest of the supporting cast.
Rachel McAdams also shines but not as brightly as she has in previous roles.
Special mention also to Arliss Howard as Henry's dad, and Stephen Tobolowsky as Kendrick, who both go to demonstrate how scenes can be stolen with very limited screen time.
Heydon Prowse also gives a great performance as Colin Craven, the young boy who is so extraordinarily spoiled that he has become literally incapable of caring for himself or even standing up.
The story itself is also hugely simplified, but if you take into consideration a film adaptation of something like Frankenstein, you can see that this could have been a lot worse.
In this case, this version of The Secret Garden could have been a lot worse, but on the other hand, it could also have been a lot better, hence my conflict.
The ham-handed delivery of the moral at the beginning of Chapter 17 is also left out with good reason, but then there are little things changed as well, such as the simplification of the plot which takes away from the magic of the story as a whole, and even smaller things, like the fact that the command that Mary teaches Colin to tell her servants that he is done with them is changed from `You have my permission to go,' in the novel, to `I have spoken, all depart,' in the book.
Maggie Smith who was also in the film, of course brings a dramatic performance.
The adults are also fantastic - especially Maggie Smith, she never disappoints me, and I think this is one of her best performances yet.
I also noticed how Mary's dresses changed along with how she progressed with her attitude.
I also really LOVED the music, Zbignew Preisner's music fit the movie SO well, and I LOVED IT!!!
She also was able to recognize and appreciate offers of friendship and love from whatever source.
Who knew that she was also pretty as a blonde!
(2) Immediately after the assassination, a promise by Brutus to Antony's servant of safe conduct for Antony, who thus knows when he comes to the Capitol and weeps over Caesar's body, challenging the conspirators to kill him also, that there is no danger of their doing so.
There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh?
I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality.
Newbiez...  Moving on the plot and story of this movie is also great, i think that it's cool, good and original.
Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is "You're all going to die down here" from the Red Queen, she is one of the best characters along with Alice, Matt & Rain.
There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened.
The woman, Alice, turns into the leader and must find out why this happened and also how they can get out alive without contaminating the world.
Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in "The fifth element" and also the character in the later "Ultraviolet" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character.
Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie.
I also like this one's visual style.
I also like the inventiveness shown at the end when the film takes a number of unexpected twists and turns I never saw coming on first viewing.
Robert Quarry stars as Khorda, a guru-like character, who happens to also be a Vampire.
Back in the '70s, when cable TV first came to Northeastern Pennsylvania, subscribing meant the addition of three channels: WPHL 17, out of Philly, WPIX 11, out of New York, and WORTV 9, also out of New York.
The beach is a stunning location as is the cool tunnel underneath the hippie commune house where Khorda keeps his resting place(..it also leads to the beach and has a submarine door!).
It's also a real hoot to see Bobby "Boris" Pickett of "Monster Mash" fame as one of the hippies.
There is also a touching scene involving the main boy and a girl.
There is also a reporter who is more important during the first stretch.
The director was also willing to experiment with different artistic filming styles.
Polish teenage society is cruel, so I also MUST know few lines from such films as "Killer" or "Poranek Kojota" to survive.
This is really great movie, but to get every single joke one must not only remember "Pulp Fiction" well (and other classic movies), but also be a Pole, or at least live in Poland for a few years :-).
She also dies in the end, although she commits suicide if I remember correctly.
He doesn't only focus on female genitalia, he's also a voyeur of the beauty of the ordinary world.
This can be traced back to Murnau's Nosferatu, but it is also a recurring storyline in Franco's movies.
I also love when the Stooges are in the French Foreign Legion.
Unfortunately, it also results in the movie's weakest point--the ending (or lack of one).
In this case the wife remarries - not only after six months but also to her "dead" husband's business partner!
When I first heard the premise;a spouse declared dead comes back home after months alone on an island , only to find his beloved wife has re-entered marital bliss with his best friend, I thought 'it'll be interesting to see if they come anywhere near the brilliance of "My Favorite Wife"' And I also presumed this had to be a rather blatant rip-off of the Cary Grant-Irene Dunne classic released ,incidentally, in the same year.
Turner also did a good job digitizing this, as the film quality is still high.
Along with "Two Arabian Nights", also produced by Howard Hughes.
This film was pretty sensitive to the Indians' cause, and also showed that the white man could also get along with the Indians when they showed true Christian character towards them.
She also includes her trip on a USO tour to the middle east.
This is also the perfect DVD to show to somebody who has never seen Kathy before!
In all I believe some people may be frustrated because there are many things and processes to memorize (jump that, don't jump that; use that weapon with that enemy, learn the AI patron of that other one)and also some good reflexes are needed of course.
While it's difficult to argue with that film's unabashed advocacy of the KKK, it's also interesting to observe a few of Griffith's other films, in which he displays an undeniable sensitivity towards other cultures.
I'm also sitting here and asking myself why did they show a scene with Madsen hitting a guy and assuming his identity, then donig nothing with it.
It also spoofs The Grudge, Saw and Saw II, and The Village.
They also draw on some great comedic acting talents, which always strikes me as a bit bizarre, but then maybe someone on the producer's team is a great salesman.
I just got this DVD set and also read the liner notes and the status of the unknown actress.
The Saw scenes were also quite enjoyable.
Brokeback Mountain is also parodied (though I do not understand why this was considered a scary movie).
I am not intellectual, I love cinema as culture, but also as entertainment, so I like this genre.
I found this "Scary Movie 4" also very funny.
It also satirizes "Saw" and "Saw 2", "Brokeback Mountain" and "Million Dollar Baby".
There are also references to the American pop culture that I unfortunately have not understood, like for example Dr. Phil, the Oprah talk show in the end (see Obs.)
I also admire Sammi because of her determination, meaning she is not one to give up even if she may hurt someone else.
There is also something in there making a bit of fun of a movie pretty much you don't need to have seen are know all that much about...you will get it as long as you watch a bit of television.
The second Scary Movie, also from the brothers Wayan, riffed on The Exorcist, The Legend of Hell House, Poltergeist, Little Shop of Horrors, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shining, and Hannibal.
Returnees from Scary Movie 3 include Charlie Sheen (spoofing Bill Pullman The Grudge; turnabout is fair play, so Bill Pullman is also in Scary Movie 4), Simon Rex, Leslie Neilsen as our Commander in Chief, and Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart who've changed their Eight Mile tune to the Brokeback Mountain hoe-down/get down.
(It might be helpful to know that it doesn't show intense violence but does suggest it; it also makes clear that gladiators, like modern-day athletes and rock stars, had their share of groupies.)
It also blends fact and fabrication in a way that seems fair and reasonable so that the viewer has been well served when the credits roll.
But, he's also looking for a "him" also living there.
I also enjoyed the days when Eric (Jensen Ackles) was on the show.
The supporting cast, which also includes Treat Williams and Robert Loggia, is great with Gary Cole giving a really good performance.
This is a fascinating, intriguing telling of a rather bizarre murder case with not only Coyote on top form, but also matched by Robert Loggia as his exceedingly odd, certainly unhinged partner-in-crime.
There are also some very fine supporting performances, not least Peter Boyle's turn as one of the investigating detectives.
Now I understand why she was in love with him in Four Weddings and a Funeral in which she also played Fiona :-), but Polanski created a film for Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner (The Ninth Gate).
It is this premise that is actually used as a platform of greater things, something that allows a certain fascination in third parties initially unaware, but also gets across a certain sense of well-being.
It also looks at the notion of temptation, and a notion that one can become more and more intrigued about something as they spend time away from it, but hear, by way of word of mouth, as much as possible about said item.
His wife, Seigner, is also sometimes a revelation in a role that should- and is- a possible one-note trap.
This story is being told to a couple who have also been together for 7 years and are off to reignite their marriage.
The film also touches strongly the theme of hipocrisie (probably wrong spelled, this word.)
Apart from this questions this film makes me also think about the relationships between men and women... Is there an everlasting love?
Suddendly I recalled Schopenhauer who claimed that no man could be happy with only one woman... maybe this film is showing that he was right... the pace of the relationship between Mimi and the writer was so high that they just emptied all there possibilities very soon, but if we put that at the scale of a normal marriage, aren't all the possibilities also tried at the end of 10 20 or 30 years?
Besides this few topics of discussion (to which I could add some more if I just remembered them right now) I found this film very well directed with some beautiful scenes... also some strongs scenes that stay with us... Excelent performances for the three leading roles... Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn't allow her to show more than she did.
Filmmakers made an engaging, dramatic and compelling film while also staying sensitive to the subjects.
The rest of the picture is told in three individual flashbacks as it is explained just how and why Sheilds deserves such animosity, with Pebbels also explaining just what they all went on to achieve because of him and in spite of him.
The dependable supporting cast also includes Barry Sullivan and Walter Pidgeon.
and Ace in the Hole, ironically the latter being a film in which Douglas also starred in and playing the same type of character.
Of course we're steered in the former direction not only by Douglas's terrific performance but also by the clever concluding scene when Sullivan, Turner and Powell, all with ample reason to have nothing do with him, still find themselves effortlessly drawn into his comeback plans.
Novelist James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell, in another great dramatic role) already had some acclaim, but also the hindrance of distracting Southern belle wife Rosemary (Gloria Grahame).
He is presented as a flawed genius, whose personal shortcomings stem from the same artistic vein as that which fuels his cinematic intuition (a Graham Greene quote clarifies my meaning: he once described himself as having "a character profoundly antagonistic to ordinary domestic life," and that "unfortunately, the disease is also one's material").
Indeed, Shields was modelled on several filmmakers, most noticeably Val Lewton (whose 'Cat People (1942)' gets an indirect reference), Orson Welles, and David O. Selznick, whose box-office flop 'Duel in the Sun (1946)' also exhausted considerable funding and several directors.
He also found a parallel between the multiple flashbacks and the most famous film he worked on, CITIZEN KANE.
(p.s.- I also liked the way they did the end credits with clips from the movie for each of the primary characters along with their real name, so you could SEE who's who.
Their careers have profited from working with him, but each of them also undergo an intimate expense.
This Minnelli endeavor also sees making B-Movie Westerns as among the least notable enterprises in Hollywood.
I also always enjoy Barry Sullivan's performance.
Jonathan's father was also a big shot until he too was thrown out by his rivals.
That one line summary makes me sound like I'm calling the Bad and the Beautiful a case in 'tough love', where director Vincente Minnelli wags his finger at what happens to some people (cough, David O. Selznick, cough), while also showing too the joys of working in the business.
Soon he rises the ranks and becomes big enough to really call the shots all he wants, but it also gets in the way of personal relationships, severs ties, and sometimes even makes him out to be monstrous (there's one shot I remember all the time where Douglas, in a big fit of anger against Lana Turner's character, seems like he's a whole foot taller with the ego almost manifested).
But more than Douglas, it's also tremendous, memorable screen time for Lana Turner, perhaps in her most successful performance in just sheer acting terms (not necessarily just in presence or style like in other pictures), and for Dick Powell, who with this and Murder My Sweet has two defining roles outside of his usual niche.
Douglas was also up for an Oscar, but it went that year to laconic Gary Cooper in High Noon.
We'd also like to take this opportunity to clear up some rumors.
Drake is also quoted in Soap Opera Digest and Soap Opera Weekly as saying that he learned of his character's demise from Executive Producer Ken Corday.
Drake also talks about sleep deprivation since he found out that he is being forced to leave the show and how "It has been an incredibly difficult several weeks due to the disbelief, shock and then final acceptance and closure which is inevitable in any creative endeavor."
Please feel free to also sign in any of your family or friends who are also Drake fans (or who love you and want what YOU want!
I was so excited when I received my package that I thought I'd have a Thundercats marathon with my older sister (who also loved it) about halfway through the first disc (there's about 14 discs all up) I couldn't remember why I loved this cartoon so much?
Thundercats did just that and of course other great cartoons from the 1980's such as He-Man & The Masters Of The Universe,She-Ra and Transformers which all spawned toy lines and comic books like Thundercats did also.
The dialogue was at times a little corny to say the least but the show also had episodes where basic morals, values and ethics were highlighted and addressed within the series.
Kids also related well to Wilykit and Wilykat, two kids on the team who had to deal with adults telling them what to do.
There is also a rather pointless scene where Hercules must fight some guy who always gets back up and laughs annoyingly.
It's also unusual to see Jim Backus in a rather unlikable role.
After Annie's husband John (John Alderton) dies of leukemia, Chris comes up with an idea that also relates to John's love of sunflowers, and expressing yourself (or whatever), to pose for a nude calendar.
Chris and Annie weren't expecting the calendars to sell out so quickly, but they also weren't expecting to go to Hollywood!
The scenes in which the women reveal all are hilarious but also tasteful.
I also quite enjoyed CiarÃ¡n Hinds in a role you won't often see him in, that of a perfectly normal sweet guy.
The beauty of this masterpiece is that it's not only the simple, delightful and true story of middle aged women showing that they have the courage to step out and do something remarkable and ground-breaking, but also they could make it into a huge success.
The movie is also accurate in the kind of sentiments it expresses about cancer.
His role as Oscar Romero really gave light to the film, and also impressed many of my students.
The working people of El Salvador were also forced to endure the hardships of poverty and economic instability.
As Romero increasingly identified with the suffering and persecuted people of El Salvador, his relationship with the ruling elites also began to suffer.
While it is a moving film, it is also very disturbing because of the graphic nature of some of the abuse suffered by characters in the film.
"Romero" is also about class differences and the intolerance of the powerful towards social change.
Raul Julia's finest moment as an actor was also one of the finest Latin American-themed films of all time.
I also liked some of the references to other movies like 2001: A Space Odessey.
There were also some comedic scenes, such as in the bar, and the cocky behavior of Alex, (one of the medical students), as well as the conversations among the bar patrons, that will make you chuckle.
Most of the other people in the movie I have not heard of but also impressed me throughout.
I also liked how the Angel character was not afraid to cross the line and go back to his roots.
But I also was acutely aware of some of the film's shortcomings as I watched.
It should have also been in the film.
There is also a difference with the book : in the book we do not know for sure that Micol and Malnate were lovers, it is an assumption whereas it is an evidence in the film...
This episode also proved what a strong character Rose really is, and how far she has come from being just an ordinary young girl to being the doctor's side kick.
The plot is good, the acting is good, and it also has a rather sinister part - a half-living drawing of Chloe's dead father is lurking in her wardrobe and says "I'm coming to hurt you".
You also can't help notice that because the plot was one of those written on the back of a cigarette packet efforts then there's so much padding centered around on dysfunctional family issues , in this case single parenthood .
Such films should have a sufficiently dramatic story to retain the viewers interest throughout, but they also have a very important role to play in conveying to the general public in dramatic terms the actual impact of the event in question on the lives of the ordinary people who were affected.
I would rate this as a very good film - I also have an 'official' full documentary account of this eruption on videotape, it provides many interesting facts about the scientific impact on the area; but this dramatised semi-documentary with its human interest stories is the one which will bear watching repeatedly, and it is commendably careful not to seriously distort any of the facts in the interests of artistic licence.
I am also a USM grad in Maine and I am proud to call Shaloub a fellow graduate.
I also thought that the cinematography was a work that I would rate very high.
But with the disinterment of the Mary there also come alive insect larvae inside her, corroding her from within.
The three key actors of the film, Andersson, Von Sydow, and Gould, seem to live in these characters, and especially Gould (for whom this would be his only role with the director) conveys a sort of double nature that is also within Karin.
But it is here where not only does he and Bergman go with their touches of light and dark, they also go for a documentary feel in the production.
The film also needs to be seen by more people of today, as it is virtually impossible to buy on video or DVD.
"Invention" in this film is a pretty loose term - you see strange contraptions, and you also see people doing amazing (and odd) things with their bodies.
It also contains many physical experiments as well, such as a woman swinging through New York by gripping a rope with her teeth.
she also possesses one of the best faces of any actress in hollywood.
It also really adds to scenes that would be kind of boring otherwise.
It also has a slick directing job by Bryan Gordon and a fun cameo by John Candy.
During his first night in the store, he meets a beautiful woman who also has some boredom issues coupled with anger at her father.
The little kids who had been following Frank character around, also say "WOW" when they see her.
A conceptually and literally dark and pensive, quasi-thriller, which unselfishly and also uncompromisingly dives head first into moral debates on life, human nature, free will and religion.
Rather than risk going so far into how impressed I was with Thomas Ikimi's "FIRST" cinematic effort and end up looking like a groupie ... all I will say is I am counting the days until the release of his next feature and with Ikimi's discovery of a rare diamond in Joe Holt, the wait for his next offering also seems endless.
Thematically strong with its anti-racist core, and really tightly written by Goldsmith, it's also notable for containing a wonderful performance from McCrea.
The film also looks terrific.
Travis (John Russel) is a man totally undecided about what to do with his life and also how to judge Vinson, but he is aware of his shortcomings and we identify with him.
); last, not least but decidedly the shortest is Angelo Rossitto, Hollywoodâs perennial âlittle manâ of Horror, whoâs also on hand as a carnival-barker for Naishâs âCreature Emporiumâ.
Regina Carrol is sexy as Judith, and a strong lineup of familiar faces also make appearances: Anthony Eisley as love interest Mike, future director Greydon Clark as a man named "Strange", Angelo Rossitto as the barker Grazbo, Russ Tamblyn as biker Rico, Jim Davis as police sergeant Martin, John Goff as another biker, Gary Kent as a lover on a beach, Albert Cole as an unlucky cop, and Forrest J. Ackerman as the ill-fated Dr. Beaumont.
It's also certainly a film of its time, with its portrayal of the hippie culture and psychedelic sequences.
There's also a Frankenstein that looks more like a mushroom man from ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE and his face is just,....well,...impossible to describe, though comparing it to Frankenstein is NOT possible!
FYI--Angelo Rossitto is also in the film.
I also had to laugh when Naish describes the obvious lunatic Chaney as harmless to some guests, then sends him to chop people up in the next scene...but we knew that.
Tamblyn pops up briefly (also from "Satan's Sadists") as another lowlife biker.
Aside from those already mentioned, Russ Tamblyn, Jim Davis, Forry Ackerman, Angelo Rossitto, Gary Kent and other swell folks appear and future director Greydon Clark (of SATAN'S CHERRLEADERS fame) also has a small role.
The script is all over the place, the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like "your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood", or a cop that says "if you've got a fireplace burn some wood in it, it'll be a lot better than running around on the streets" to a bemused Judith, Mike & the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue & lets not forget Dr. Frankenstein's mumbo jumbo "we are not butchers... we are scientists", almost every line is an absolute classic laugh-out-loud moment & I loved all of it!
There is also one brief shot of female nudity.
Dracula verses Frankenstein is one of those so bad its good movies, a drive in movie.with a great cast;Lon Chaney Jr as a puppy loving murderer,j Carroll Nash as Dr Frankenstein.and Regina Carroll as the busty blonde heroine.and then there's a great extended cameo by Forrest j Ackerman(Dr. acula and to us horror fans uncle forry)OK i know a lot of critics hated this but its really an entertaining tribute to the universal Frankenstein movies,the monster looks like a brute with a face that resembles a raw steak,and Dracula looks like a hippie with fangs.also starring the great Russ tamblyn and Anthony eisley.with music from the universal monster films.troma picked up the DVD rights to this.it really is a scream.notably this was Lon Chaney Jr's last film as well as j Carroll Nash(both were in house of Frankenstein 1945) also in the cast is Jim Davis who later played jock Ewing on TVs Dallas.
Lana Turner is a "Dancing Co-Ed" in this 1939 film also starring Ann Rutherford, Richard Carlson, Arte Shaw and his Orchestra and Monte Woolley.
You can also spot Mary Beth Hughes and June Preisser, who was in a couple of the Mickey/Judy films as the rich society girl.
It showcases her unbelievable beauty and vitality, and it also spotlights her generally undiscovered comedic talents.
I would also like to see the movie again?
It also could have been a much different flick if she had appeared to the Sands (her biological parents) after having been married and expecting.
I found the writing to be witty (Andy Breckman who wrote script for the movie "Rat Race", also hilarious).
As a true film buff, I can accept the fact that some of the greatest movies ever made can also be extremely difficult to watch -- whether from its content and/or the emotional response it generates.
And you also get to know what happens in the final chapter!
A Clockwork Orange also shows the government's role to come in the rescue of outcast youngsters and bring them back into mainstream society.
Its both very moving and also extremely entertaining.
Kubrick's's best film ever.absolutely mind-blowing.quite disturbing though but that's what moves us.he has amazingly blended the disturbing scenes with the lovely music of Beethoven.a riveting journey of a vicious young hoodlum in modern England who is caught due to the betrayal of his friends and his journey through aversion therapy that drives him to try and do himself in and his cure at last.i never thought i would understand and really appreciate this film but i did and i say that it is one of the best films of the century.Kubrick has excelled himself and i truly feel it is his best film ever.it also has an absolutely mind-blowing performance by young Malcolm Mcdowell as Alex,the best acting performance i have seen.
It is a film described often as the sociological masterpiece of the decade and, often as dangerously viciousÂ a film with more violent sex and dangerous thugs than any other I can remember, a film which daringly brought to larger-than-life those areas of the unconscious mind which some people felt were best left hiddenÂ  It is also highly dramatic, extremely graphic, compelling and provoking...
For the better part of the 1970's it was also banned furthering my desire to see it.
You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies.
A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie.
The film's soundtrack is also quite great; I recommend that everyone should at least listen to it.
A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by "Cat Lady," one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder.
Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.
As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to "A Clockwork Orange" also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes.
Hank, a former MP, had also a methodical, insightful investigator in his own right, and his analysis of the developing case allows him to hold out hope that his son's legacy, if not his life, will be kept intact.
The film pulls no punches, yet it also refrains from sensationalizing events - as though Haggis realized that the truth was viciously cruel enough without embellishment.
I also have to giggle at the lame Biblical allegory from which the film gets its title (Elah was the valley in which David fought Goliath), which, try as I might, I cannot get to fit any possible scenario in the film's story.
Theron is also very good.
Like her role in North Country, her Detective Emily Sanders also has to do battle with prejudice, discrimination and the glass ceiling, all these while being a single parent, and assisting Hank in cutting through layers of cover ups, and the determination of red herrings as the cop who requested to be assigned the case.
Realizing Crash's multi-story structure was a strength but also a weakness, Haggis goes for a more linear narrative this time, and chooses a rather controversial subject for it: the Iraq war.
The final plight of Angie is also worthy of remembering.
That being said I believe the performances also strengthen this story.
He also makes us aware of the growing struggles of our soldiers and what is going on as a result of this war in Iraq.
The notion that war _necessarily_ results in moral breakdown is, while hardly novel, also not true.
Through the pain and guilt that creep over his lined features, you also feel his suffering, his loss, and understand his bitterness.
Mr. Deerfield seeing his mutilated son for the first time, also towards the end when he realizes that his own rigid personality alienated his son from himself and Cpl.
I also thought the movie was unique in the angle it took on war: its psychological impact.
Enter Detective Emily Sanders (played by a very strong Charlize Theron), who at first just wants to get through her job for the day, but soon gets wrapped up in also discovering what really happened to Deerfield's son.
One of the many aspects I appreciated was that director Haggis did not turn this into a typical Hollywood crime thriller and also not turn it into a political propaganda piece against the war and President Bush.
I also love mind numbing endless action movies like the ones played by Mel Gibson, Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Damme.
He is also an ordinary person living and wonderding every aspects of life he is dragged.
All of this almost camoflages the fact that this movie is also full of subtle but brilliant humor.
Set in the Japanese gangster underworld, Sonatine gives insight into not just Kitanos Murakawa character, but also Japanese culture and behavior, which is quite different from the Scorsese school of western films.
Takeshis stand up history also comes across in Sonatines several humorous moments, such as the William Tell sequence on the beach.
The cinematography is also absolutely beautiful, nice and simple static shots plus some pretty locations, such as the beach.
You want to identify with the protagonist and his henchmen, and they can often be amusingly human, but they are also so emotionless and cold-blooded, even concerning their own, that it gives you the chills.
He has been through so much in his life that he is indeed "burnt out," but there is also a good sense to this term.
Interesting element in the film also is the love interest provided to Takeshi and how this flirtation with a possible normal life is simply that..a flirtation.
The score is beautifully composed by Joe Hisaishi, who also gave you the music for Spirited Away.
Sonatine is, in a way, a combination of these two films, and it is the greatest in this outstanding trilogy, and Sonatine ranks also to the top in Kitano's filmography with Hana-Bi.
Similarly beautiful film is his Hana-Bi and Boiling Point has also these elements.
The director and the cast show that those gangsters are also human, with their likes and dislikes, their games and pranks, their love and loyalty.It's a very Japanese film showing the beauty of the fleeting moments of life, fragility of life, beauty of nature and of human soul which is capable of self-sacrifice and devotion.
It is also interesting that these gangsters think nothing of their own lives or safety: they accept their fate as a death-wish.
I believe there was also a scene where they drove from NYC to Manalapan, Florida (The wealthiest city, near Palm Beach ).
This part of the story of Sante Kimes focuses on the disappearance of a wealthy New York socialite woman Irene Silverman, also played well by Jean Stapleton.
You also see early on that Sante needed a man, some kind of man in her life to use as her foundation for whatever she did.
I enjoyed him as "Antonio" on WINGS, he was so funny in Galaxy Quest, and in his more dramatic roles, he also shines.
This movie also gives the lie to those modern cynics who say that spiritual or religious themes in movies are passe' or "old hat."
He also did his assault on Babe Ruth by breaking his pitching record of 29 2/3 scoreless innings in the World Series against Cincinnati that year.
He was also very conscious of the fact that Mantle was there in New York first and fans wanted him to be the record breaker.
Billy Crystal (who also produced) showed a surprisingly deft touch as a director, giving viewers a very realistic glimpse of life inside the pressure cooker of Yankee Stadium and major league baseball in general.
It's also an interesting look at how the media creates and destroys heroes.
Monk (played by Tony Shalhoub) suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive Behavior and is also an extreme germaphobic.
It also would have been dishonest and Crystal is to be applauded for showing it how it really was.
Maris's problems with the press are also portrayed sympathetically, and yet so are members of the press, who are personalized and humanized and have their side also fairly presented.
And the regular season increased in length from 154 games - which had also been the season length in 1927 - to 162, as it remains today.
He had a difficult time dealing with negativity from the media and fans and also missed the birth of a son during the season.
Crystal even managed to find actors to play not only most of the significant Yankees of the season but also many of their opponents.
CD is also worth every cent of your money with great songs, few sung by Simbu himself.
My son's mother-in-law who lives out in Oergon also watches every Monk episode.
It's also one of all time Charlie Brown specials-I'd say in the top 5 somewhere.
The strip itself was also going South.
The final scene also doesn't explain itself.
I was also embarrassed for the movie Vertical Limit, which, though it is also a terrible movie in it's own right, actually made an effort, and has some entertainment value including a couple of Point Break-esquire one-liners.
I also like the way they have "fine tuned" the characters and their interactions in the ensuing years, and while enjoying Bitty Schram, I personally prefer Traylor Howard.
I'm also sure we'll see the well playing young actors again soon in another movie.
This is also a movie about friendship, false friends, and how friendship and trust are sacrificed to money and addiction.
I also love "mathematic tricks" and "mathematic obsessions", just like Karl Koch.
If the Americans would have made this film there would have been a love story and maybe also a happy-end.
This is a film where Hitchcock not only makes fun of himself but he also goes directly away from every other previous movie he ever directed.
Having also seen Rear Window, I'm wondering if that reputation is deserved at all.
First the feeling by Edmund Gwen and John Forsythe characters animosity to the police, and also the sexual innuendo's in the film.
Another writer has also mentioned how their are other references to a sexual act with Natwick's character, and I do believe that Natwick and Gwen are the real stars of the film.
They also decide to involve their son in this charade.
One could also look at Trouble With Harry as a agreement with High Noon.
The other characters of the store owner, and Deputy are also interesting as well.
Arnie's mother Jennifer Rogers sees the body, and the young widow twice over also recognizes Harry and also thinks he killed him but with a bottle.
With a perceptive screenplay by John Michael Hayes ("Rear Window") based on a popular post-WWII British novel by Jack Trevor Story, the quaintly whimsical tone is what surprises most Hitchcock aficionados here, but the dialogue is also laced with not-so-subtle sexual innuendo.
Along with the original theatrical trailer, there is also a 38-still production gallery as well as about five pages of production notes.
There's also a cast of characters who are more wrapped up in their romantic entanglements than in the body of Harry, who should be the focal point of the story.
A plain, simple, black comedy that probably ends up flying under the radar of people used to watching Marx Bros. films, who I also like.
It also marks the first collaboration between Hitchcock and Herrmann who brings a light, airy, and playful score that helps make the concern of the story less of 'how' Harry died, but what exactly to do with him.
The rest of the cast is also excellent, with the actor who plays the captain deserving special recognition for his calm and cool demeanor throughout.
John Forsythe gives a brilliant, perfectly cool and laid back performance as the hugely likable Sam Marlowe, and his exchanges with Arnie, played by Jerry Mathers in his pre-Beaver days, are some of the best moments in the film, and this is also the first of a great many tremendously successful collaborations between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrman.
"); Arnie's dead rabbit and live frog; the constantly shifting implications of guilt in the death of "Harry" up there on the hill; the characters' struggles to regain innocence by "doing the right thing"; the closet door that swings open for no apparent reason (never explained); the characters' revelations of the truths about themselves; their wishes granted through Sam's "negotiations" with the millionaire art collector from the "city" -- ALL portrayed within the conservative but ultimately flexible confines of their New England repression and stoicism (yes, the film is also a satiric comment on '50s morality) -- these details and more finally yield a rich tapestry of our common humanity, observed at a particular time and place, through specific people caught in an absurd yet utterly plausible circumstance.
It's also painfully obviously that the movie just didn't had the most talented people involved in the creation process.
Besides the fact the story is hardly anything original and is something that has been done a lot better in earlier genre movies, the movie also has some real problems with its build up and logic.
The movie just never becomes tense, also since you just simply couldn't care less for any of the characters, which is mostly due to the acting performances from its actors.
He plays his role in this movie far to over-the-top, which just doesn't make his character really believable and therefore the movie as a whole also just doesn't quite work out as intended.
The movie also just didn't always made quite sense to me.
Some things within this movie just didn't made much sense, which also made this movie quite ridicules in parts.
It's also of course a fairly predictable movie, also since it just isn't the most renewing or original one around.
He is also able to draw you into the plot with ease - like an old friend who brings you into his trust you wait on every word.
Beyond the technical-medical-moral issue of abortion itself, the movie also shows very well how, basically, the main problem of a women living an unexpected pregnancy, be it in 1952, 1974 or 1996, is often that she is downright alone and must face the indifference and despise of society at large and of most people around her - including the father of the baby.
Cher also appears as the abortion doctor, as well as directs this part.
Cher (who also co-produced this film) is wonderful as well in a small supporting role as an abortion doctor who in my humble opinion has the most clear-headed view on the troubling matter of almost any other character in the entire movie.
In this story I truly appreciated the message that choosing to have a child is also pro-choice.
There's also a load of notable B actors that you can recognize from other films.
The supporting cast are all good, also.
(also starring Weaver), and, arguably, "Tour of Duty" (not to mention the champ of them all, "China Beach").
The film also gets wrong the exact time the first wave broke off its attack and also shows torpedo planes in the second wave, when only the first wave had such.
The North family also gets a great scenery-chomping scene between Commander North, Ellie, and their daughter Patricia at their hotel early in the attack amid rumors that President Roosevelt has surrendered Oahu to the enemy; Patricia and Ellie are hysterical as Michael struggles to keep them calm, and when Patricia asks her mother if she's ever been raped (wanting to know whether to resist should the Japanese invade the island) the stunned silence by Ellie and Commander North is strikingly effective.
One thing that really gnawed at me were Paige's parents, also new actors.
The ball scene was also unbelievable.
they didn't make her as "normal" (maybe common) as in the first film, they also made her completely dependent on the prince- having no hobbies other than him.
And also, speeding around the streets of Denmark like the prince (or king as they called him) was, he would have probably hit one of the hundreds or thousands of bicyclists that ride in Copopenhagen everyday.
beside watching lovely, also a little bit uncomfortable looking Luke Mably.
She's also studying still to become a doctor.
The only thing that i will watched this movie is Luke Mably who seems not happy also doing this.Why are they turning this movie into a joke.
De Villa and co-writer Nat Moss take three interconnecting ones, and the result is an amazing film that not only provides an ideal showcase for the actors involved, but also serves notice to the film-making community that a talented director has arrived.
Tommaso is also in danger of losing his job in the mail room in that he can't see the letters and packages in order to correctly distribute them.
Isabel also falls in love with the some 75 year old bachelor who for the first time in years feel that he's wanted for himself not his talents; in his music and his art.
The other characters in the movie add some color and background, and do well also.
Oh, this movie also has a VERY STEAMY SEX SCENE!
I also like the pacing of the film.
Surprisingly, there are also a few touches of humour (two incidents in particular involving passengers in cars), which serve to break up some a monotony which could develop around what is a very bleak picture.
Also the Mexican Culture and ways of life in the Mexican city also adds to the supposed plot.Some of the scenes was not needed (atleast to me) because they really dint add any value to the movie other than extending by a few minutes.Mascos looked good,Ana looked hot,Marcos's wife looked seriously obese and the marching soldiers looked fit and trimmed.
I also saw a interview of Carlos and Ana which was taken after the Cannes shock treatment.He said he wanted to show real images and thats the reason he prefers dÃ©butantes in every movie.Also Marcos is supposedly a driver for his dad at the History of Cultural museum (that obviously explains his inclusion).
I m so sad to see film footage waist in a horrible movie like batalla en el cielo I don't understand how people can see what this movie is about , is racism, and is also very poor make.
But that "effort" is also what bothers me: Too many pretensions for so miserable result: 1)Its pretension of veracity like a documented reality or more likely a "cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ©" work, using real people and non-actors, impostors of emotional states for a very diluted script fails resoundingly: A script exists.
Let me get this straight - the film is not about sex primarily - it also is *supposed* to be about human dilemmas of morality, class divides etc.
They are also quite justified in being disappointed.
The use of music is also powerful and moving.
There is also a sense of raw sexual abandonment despite the lack of eroticism.
You will also be awed by the bravery of the actors and moved by the raw and close-to-real sex acts.
There was also a good match of Hack as a college student (another actress) while in some films it is not believable at all.
You also get an inside view of the music jingle industry and that is a riot.
I also loved how the movie just went smoothly, never contradicting itself like many movies do.
If you remember hearing the lyrics "You light up my life," then you should also enjoy the soaring lyrics "If ever I see you again" by the same composer.
The movie also encourages you to fly coast to coast without fear.
Presumably, he also cast Shelley Hack, whose last name pretty much sums up the state of her acting ability, in the lead female role.
They are also highly cultured productsÂthe same vacuum pomp found at Godard as well (with an entire different function in Truffaut's cinema, etc.).
it also opened my mind to the intelligence of the uneducated among us--i loved that guilia was so real and right-n and so full of peasant superstition that in no way interfered with her ability to "get it."
We watch as Dr. Levi arrives at the Eboli station, where he must change to a local train and a taxi in order to reach the hill town, which was also the home of other political prisoners.
Carlo Levi also painted the people of the region.
The Christ Stopped at Eboli also pushes the audience to ponder on the philosophical meaning of history, its relevance nature and meaning.
Yaban is also the story of a Turkish intellectual war veteran who abandons amenities of Istanbul for the Central Anatolian village with the hope of finding his roots and alleviating the torments of his memoirs.
There are also a lot of little things going on that only occur to you after a few viewings.
The cast is a great ensemble, including, the aforementioned Liotta who parodies both himself and his career, Rene Zegweller, Matthew Broderick and of course Jerry Seinfeld who also co-wrote this.
It also has Rip Torn who I cannot watch now without hearing "if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball."
I am also a fan of Jerry Seinfeld, so I really had some expectations good expectations for this movie.
), but he's also been good in things, so I'll give it a go'.
Having a Spanish director also sounded good, given that it was set in Spain...
I also have a new respect for the little buggers (bees)!
He claimed to have hunted them down as a wolf (werewolf) and had hunted many times with a man called Anonia who was also a werewolf.
However, the lead actor Mike Binder (also the writer and director) put in a spirited performance.
Sands is cleverly cast, his lupine looks adding to the myth, Pataky also provides some nice eye candy.
My wife also hated the way Rachael McAdams character was written.
I also bet there were tremendous moments left on the cutting room floor.
He was also wounded, but in an embarrassing place, his male private parts.
It also illustrates that in the military we learn to work with both men and women and all colors.
It's perfectly cast, and I also liked the directing and attention to detail.
Rachel McAdams gives Colee a likable innocence but also reveals some darker layers of her character.
We also see how three soldiers band together, and become in a sense a family taking care of one another.
For the most part, the film is serious to a point, yet it is also a comedy.
also a censor from both NBC & CBS as it was syndicated and would be on each network around the country .. Don & I traveled around the country to promote the show .
It also had the most gruesome scene ever!
But it was also an intelligent and original movie with a story that kept me interested until the end.
Hong Kong is also mentioned by Norris as "The Place" in this movie.
This time, he's in Hong Kong and single-handedly (of course) eliminating the forces that conspire against his adopted family who also happens to run a prosperous casino that evil types would rather see under their control or (better yet) destroyed.
It's also one of the few Chuck Norris titles not yet on DVD and I can't understand why!
Miss PIckford also plays the lads mother incorporating techniques quite clever for its day.
John Sharian is also very good as the misguided, haunted 'partner' of Romasanta, and both Gary Piquer and David Gant are memorable in supporting roles as those who finally bring the murderer to justice.
It also features Elsa Pataky as the leading heroine, who has become a huge sex symbol in Spain and it isn't hard to see why -- think along the lines of a Spanish Keira Knightley.
Pickford also plays Cedric's mother (on 6-inch stilts) and is charming as the adult.
We are also confronted with the fact that Pickford as Fauntleroy seems to be about four and a half feet tall.
Plus our heroine's sister is little more than the Grinch in human form...  All of which could, in better hands, have proven to be a decent little seasonal movie; it certainly has good intentions on its side, and isn't too shameless in its pitch for the "Touched By An Angel" audience (I knew John Dye had been on it, and I bet myself that Kathy had also been alongside Roma Downey at one point.
The Four Lads were also outstanding.
The story was narrated by the Four Lads as a group of carolers with the excellent song, "Stingest Man In Town".I am lucky to have the cast recording on an LP and also the stage script with the music.
The way adultery, homosexuality and eroticism but also greed, cowardice and deceit are depicted leaves one speechless at times, and certainly wondering how political correctness and all sorts of profit policies and conservatisms have infested modern-day cinema to a point it would no longer dare think to produce anything like this.
Apart from the latent debauchery creeping out into the open from the cozy interiors of a model town, the film also has multiple strings of side puns that keep its pace up at all times Â from spot-on character studies (the mayor, the artist, the butcher...) to hysterical history sidekicks (using a fork for the first time, Spaniards wondering what "beer" is, impious remarks on Dutch painting...).
Released in 1935, it is also a cruel reminder of how conservative the world Â and its cultural output Â has become as of late.
Everything is anglicized, and I bet you there is also stuff missing.
That also leads me to think about the 20 person protest against the President of the United States.
The DVD box cover shows a black and white photograph of the Whitehouse, which is also the title screen of the DVD itself.
The box also lists its Special Features as Scene selection and Trailer.
There is also some FBI guy who leads some "special agents" and "tries to rescue the president".
And what's also really funny is the part where the bad guy falls off the roof.
It also has a cast of famous names, Eric Roberts, Ice-T, and Michael Madsen.
And also, the horse is really stupid.
i got it and when i put it in and it was beautiful the graphics were amazing and searching for the colossus was awesome also the environment was really interactive which was cool the game play was unique and fun and the battles and how you had to find out how to kill them were awesome also the story was the best each colossi was unique and different to kill and the story was a shocker (if you have played Ico then you might have guessed that this game is Ico prequel) this game really pushed the play stations limits though the game is short but it is unforgettable if you have never played this get it and if you have any doubts don't classic 10/10
I know that if you hold the right stick in the same position the camera will remain fixed, but try doing that while also holding on to the triangle button, it's nearly impossible!
I also love the idea of insignias and the way they look, and how you have to spend breath-taking hours trying to find them, and the colossi acting like a complete idiot trying to shake you off.
It is also a great date movie because it is not long and gives you plenty to talk about after.
Celebreties from all walks of life also help diversify, demystify, and clarify why this underrated tradition will continue to be the true coffee for the soul.
They are also a warm and loving community, even in competition, that support, nurture and celebrate each other.
I also loved the preposterous, but ingenious, way one escapes the swinging razor-sharp pendulum which closes in to his body thanks to rats.
That pit of spikes, underneath a trap door where the poor victim lies as the pendulum swings, is also put to good use.And, I think that Gordon utilizes Rona De Ricci's beauty and innocence quite well..she's certainly a sympathetic figure we root for as it seems her fate is doomed because of the trap Torquemada has placed her in.
It also shows how there are often puzzles within the puzzle.
There is also a short film about a group of people in a small Wisconsin town who read The New York Times every Sunday.
The DVD also includes an amiable and insightful commentary track by Creadon, Shortz and Reagle, as well as a bevy of deleted scenes, including extended versions of the celebrity interviews.
As words are all that we have to work with in communication and just everyday discourse, it's also attached here to the idea of testing, of competition, and how different and varying crosswords can get.
Like the documentary Spellbound from a few years back, the director is also after the kind of irony of making such an isolated experience of finishing a puzzle into an event with hundreds of players once a year with friendships and acquaintances- a social event as much as a match-up.
Jon Stewart is also funny in the way he deals with clues and how he blames Will Shortz when he doesn't get them.
Mike Mussina, The Indigo Girls, Bob Dole, and other celebrities also are seen.
Dorien Wilson ("The Parkers"), Cory Parravano, Pete Antico, David Leisure and Todd Bridges also stars!
It also looks to be SOV, and given a "film look".
"Dreamaniac" is a typical 80's horror/adult movie trash full of sex and mindless teenagers.Atrocious acting,plenty of fake blood and stupid disco music.Some gore effects are interesting(for example drill through the throat at the end),but also very cheesy.Complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.So if you find this movie skip it.
Besides, its political and societal significance, Flying: Confessions of a Free Women, is also a compelling and soap opera like film that, despite its length, flies by in a whirlwind of emotional drama and hilarity.
It also seemed to me that Jennifer was very genuine in documenting her own life, including her own lapses of judgement from time to time (i.e.
unprotected sex in an HIV infected country), and also her most dark moments and her happiest moments.
It also made the stories of the women around the world come to life more.
I also thought it was very interesting to see Jennifer's mother, aunt, father and grandmother and hear their perspectives on motherhood, marriage, sexuality etc.
I'm also really curious to know how Jennifer's life developed, and also how all the other women are doing now.
She's also doing long-term deep 'n' meaningful with a married guy.
Reediting might also be to blame for the movie's structure.
There are some stock footage clips of Vietnam, and we also see them there.
The ending might also have suffered as a result of reediting.
The film's structure is also totally inept.
There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together.
It's a painful movie to watch at times but well done, very much so, on the character study and the cinematography and atmosphere were also perfect.
There's also the change of attitude toward the little girl.
For me a 6 is about average or slightly above and is also reserved for those "guilty pleasure" type movies.
She seems to adore him, but then it becomes clear that she also is using him.
All praise to his son Nick though, for he is also a capable director, yet there can never be another John Cassavetes again.
If you do like this film, you may also enjoy Hurlyburly.
Film also memorable for performances of actors like James Gandolfini, Debi Mazar and Harry Dean Stanton.
The script also failed to explain why Joey(John Travolta) was so enraged he was swearing every other word he spoke.
I also thought the way Eddie was getting edgier and edgier as the film went on and finally broke was played well, and the fact that he had no clue he was gone so long...he seemed like he really didn't have ONE CLUE about what was going on.
The characters are all more honest with themselves and each other than anyone you'll meet in the world, and they're also more tolerant of other people's honesty than real people are.
It also saddened me that any one those quality actors, involved in this film, actually allowed it to be released.
Jeff Morrow as Hack was also great casting.
Strorther Martin also added a bit of humor.
There is an erotic tension between Coleen Gray's character and Jeff Morrow's which also is unusual in a film like this.
The killing of an Indian in the film is very different also.
Barry Bostwick was also one of the best actors in the movie!
There's also subtle references to "The Premature Burial" and probably more I missed.
That's also a sign of being a witch.
He also gets the some of the best and funniest lines ("How can they confess if they DON'T HAVE TONGUES??
Highly recommended, and if you see this and DO like it, you will want to see "City of Lost Children" and "Amelie", which are both by the same people, also containing some of the same actors.
Get this for a weird plot: Set in a run-down apartment building sometime in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future, the landlord, who is also a butcher, keeps the neighbourhood supplied with meat by slicing up applicants for the job of assistant in his shop.
Jeunet wrote and directed (in the American English titles) "A Very Long Engagement," "Amelie," and "The City of Lost Children," all of which I've seen, and "Alien 4" (also known as "Alien: Resurrection"), which I've seen parts of as I've surfed the channels.
If you really liked Amelie then you might also like this.
Written by Gilles Adrien (who also wrote many of the previous Jeunet & Caro shorts) as well as Jeunet & Caro themselves, "Delicatessen" is a wonderfully imaginative tale of sweet romance and hilarious black comedy that gives an unexpected light-hearted twist to a plot that most writers would treat as a serious subject matter.
Like Brazil, most of the production design--the costumes, music, television programming, etc.--suggests an historic setting, say about the 1940s, but it also seems to be set in the future, or at least an alternate present.
'Delicatessen' is a very original comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also directed the great 'AmÃ©lie'.
Joe Viterelli is quite enjoyable and the actor who plays Crystals son is also funny.
I also found that the film's language was a lot stronger than I thought it would be and the sex scenes were quite...detailed.
Dominique Pinon (who also featured in Jeunet's Amelie, Alien 4 and City of Lost Children) takes the lead role of the clown turned handyman.
The way that the film looks is also wonderfully different; Delicatessen has a yellow hue, which lends it a style that is very dull and dreary; and that does the film no end of favours when you consider it's core subject material.
The yellow hue also makes the film almost feel like a moving comic book, which is one of the things that gives the film it's surreal and absurd edge.
I'm a big fan of atmospheric films, which is one of the main reasons why I like horror so much; and this film also has an atmosphere like no other.
The effects were well done also, without looking too cheap (remember - "B" movie).
I thought the acting was also better than that in several of the most recent H-Wood releases, and a big BOO' shout out to Chuckie Williams - one of the nicest guys in the industry, and not a bad actor as the Dark Walker monster himself.
They also try to add the victorian element, so well done and fitting in the earlier Dracula movies, yet with poor results here.
I remember as a 10 year old (1987) writing a letter to Doug McClure asking what new monster films he would be starring in but sadly he never did and you also had to appreciate Kevin Connor was the guy behind them as Doug was the Main Actor.
I also liked Harryhausens stop motion movies too and both have more character than cgi has today.
The cast also contains John Ratzenberger, who would go on to be a household name playing Cliff Clavin in the long running show, Cheers.
Both Charles & Greg dive deep under the Ocean's surface & encounter an aquatic dinosaur that tries to eat them, they also discover a solid gold ancient relic which the crew above manage to get aboard.
The highly entertaining script by Brian Hayles moves along like a rocket & is never neither dull or boring which always helps & it also manages to combine the swashbuckling adventure, fantasy & Sci-Fi elements that make these types of films so much fun to good effect throughout.
Lisa Kudrow, Joe Viterelli, and Chazz Palminterri also give very solid supporting performances in this movie.
The cover also declares "Say no to drugs!".
Credit must also be given to the writer, George Chung (not to be confused with the famous 70s cocaine smuggler).
However, the final redemption went also to the Isabellas as well, when the father killed his son-in-law.
We also have to realize that this is early in the career of some of the performers.
You also had the loyalty/friendship theme.
Ben Stiller's brief role is also quite good as the smarter villain but he doesn't last long.
This is also a early starring role for Ben Stiller, who's gone on to make a string of forgettable formula comedies.
The film also features, in minor roles, Bill Paxton as the ill fated Gates brother, Michael J. Pollard, and ANdres Katsulas as the mafia family head.
The film also used its Chicago locations very well, which is something I like in movies.
They also throw in way too much martial arts just for the sake of showing action.
You've also got a whole other aspect of monsters in Asia that Americans are not familiar with from your own mythology.
But in fact, the action from the first sequence was not only as thrilling as the rest that followed, but it was also far superior to the anti-climactic final showdown.
Director, Wellson Chin, also does a good job of putting over the human characters after the initial opening battle.
There are some really disturbing sences in this film where his son beats up his mom, who is also a prostitute and also a heroin addict, and has to inject herself everyday.
And also there's sort of a cycle of violence; the bullies beat the son, so the son beats his mom.
I also felt sadness for the mom in "Visitor Q".
It's shocking and sick, but also entertaining and smart.
Sometimes Robert DeNiro has stretched himself too thin and hasn't come off well in comedies such as WE'RE NO ANGELS and MAD DOG GLORY, but here his timing is virtually flawless, and his comic rapport with Billy Crystal (also excellent, as he avoids making his hapless but still dignified shrink a buffoon) is wonderful.
She's also into heroin, but then later when something happens particular-like with Q, another unnerving revelation is revealed, one without really any explanation for being there.
Kazushi Watanabe, who plays the visitor, is also great in his mostly quiet role.
It depicts acts that are not only illegal and to most (I sincerely hope) immoral, but that are also very passionate and intimately link to who we are.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it's also pointless and boring and I didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it.
Another noteworthy member in the cast is Joe Viterelli, who's also a riot as DeNiro's henchman Jelly.
I also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time, in Crystal's office.
One moment--and this will be the last one I'll mention--that also made me roll with laughter was the funeral sequence in which a family member got a little over-affectionate with Crystal.
The mother (Shungiku Uchida) is beaten and bullied by her son (Jun Muto) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers.
But I could also talk about how he doesn't just shock for the sake of shocking.
And I think it actually captures something truthful not only about the decay of Japanese culture, but also the rest of the world.
It also shows Robert De Niro's by far funniest performance, as well as Billy Crystal.
And also De Niro' first visit to Crystal's has me rolling on the floor in laughter.
This film also touched on one of Judy Garland's greatest joys: motherhood.
The eponymous Dekko, with a bullet reposing in his skull, and with a proclivity for extreme self-abuse, ostensibly has also an iron constitution, as he struts along his path of vengeance with unalloyed intensity.
I would also like to comment on the cinematographer's lighting (though ultimately the director has to o.k.
One really can't fairly comment on good lighting or bad lighting because of this (this cheap approach also heavily impacts sound transfer).
For indeed I believe in the introductory comment by Goran Paskaljevic, the director of this beautiful film, whose presence together with that of the wonderfully acting Colm Meany was of course also part of an utmost enjoyable cinematographic evening.
Unlike the relentlessly depressing "The Field", this is a drama of real tragedies - the small, silly tragedies that we create and that are created for us- and also, of real hope.
Since last year, he was not only producing "Rest Stop" (which I kind of liked) but also directed another three feature length movies ("The Objective", "Solstice" and "The Strand").
Thus, it also confirms my impression upon viewing the "The Blair Witch Project", namely, that its strength comes from its fraudulent direction, since, there was no direction at all.
You also wonder why he doesn't use the cistern lid.
I also thought emergency vehicles had tracers.
I think, the viewers will find themselves intrigue by the premise and they also will be modestly entertained by the picture.
The Quanta Group's second in command, who appears at the start in the TV interview, and whose name eludes me, is also superb.
The movie also contains one of the more chilling torture scenes in recent memory, in the shape of the electro-shock 'purging' of the hero.
"Believers" is an above average B-movie with a very intriguing story, but also flawed since there are some points that are not well-explained or developed.
There's a great thematic consistency to all of Potter's writings, and it's easy in retrospect to see everything he wrote prior to 'The Singing Detective' as leading up to that masterpiece (he was shameless about self-plagiarism), a view which also explains the relative vacuity of his later work; and this means that watching 'Blue Remembered Hills' today, it doesn't quite have the impact that it may first have done, before elements present in it were reworked (together with elements from all his other dramas) in his landmark achievement.
Directed by Nick Quested who also has a role in the film as Deputy Carry I thought Seven Mummies was yet another below average, nothing special, utterly forgettable & stupid low budget shot on digital horror film that steal most of it's ideas from better films such as From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) amongst others.
He's also called upon to do illogical and stupid things (what a surprise, in this film).
Not just for the eyes, because there's plenty there to see; but, she also builds the suspense incredibly well as Jill Michaelson.
I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home  this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
however i do remember that this little boy who found a cat in the alley and nursed him back to health,the boy use to feed the cat and himself tuna straight from the same can also every year around Christmas i believe it came on TV.and me and my sisters and brothers use to watch it.i was about 10 years old or younger.i have a pretty good memory and its now around Christmas i guess this is why this movie came to mind.not only that i have a cat whom i adore.
My wife says that she remembered most of the movie as she watched it last night, but was also surprised that the cat was not hanged.
I also remember how devastating it was to see the poor creature lose it's life by getting hit by a car.
They should show it more often, also you can read the book.
I also remember later that same day my father (may he rest in peace) took us to a Christmas tree lot in Port Huron, Michigan, where we cut a live tree and took it home to where we lived in Warren.
I also found that the film's language was a lot stronger than I thought it would be and the sex scenes were quite...detailed.
Ja'Net Dubois is also great as his worried, exhausted mother, who is firmly mired in poverty, despite working many hours at a store day after day.
This is also a story of a mother's struggle to be independent and support herself and her son, and how such a life can blind her to the suffering her own child is enduring.
It's also one of the best vehicles for Joe Pesci that was ever made (even if it didn't technically originate with him), and will probably make for part of his great standing as an actor years later through all the other Scorsese movies.
the suit Vinny wears to Court following no choice, always brilliant- but it's also got a sincerity to it that works.
That it also sometimes leaves it onto Pesci's shoulders to keep up entertainment wise is not altogether unexpected.
Marisa Tomei is flat out FANTASTIC as Mona Lisa Vito--the wise cracking, marriage wanting, car fixing, pizza chick who accompanies Vinny (Joe Pesci--also brilliant) to Alabama in order to get his cousin (Ralph Macchio) and his friend (Mitchell Whitfield) off from murder charges when their car matches the suspect's car in a Sac-o-Suds homicide involving the clerk.
Joe Pesci has always been extremely serious when he needed to be, and also very funny when he needed to be and by God in this movie he is one of the funniest actors in one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
For once, you want to sympathise with him but also, you want him to succeed in the end and Pesci has given this character a lot of credibility and scope to work with.
And this was also a career capping role for Fred Gwynne.
They also have in common a flawless, witty script with all pieces falling into right place, all guns firing, all characters developed and interesting.
Vinny has also brought along his Brooklyn talking fiancÃ©e, Mona Lisa Vito.
With little experience and getting into a web of lies, Vinny must learn that good arguing is not just what will help, but he also has to learn how to be a lawyer.
He also has to convince his cousin, the cousin's friend and the judge that he knows what he is doing.
Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on .
And more than comedy -- there's also a lot of genuine pathos and real tension and drama, especially in the final courtroom scene.
You also have a great supporting cast that features Lane Smith as a very animated D.A.
It also has to said that Marisa Tomei is brilliant in this film.
Regardless of Joe Pesci's latent starpower, this cast of players as assembled possessed remarkable chemistry in the performances they gave, not only in their interactions with one another, but also in the creation of a final product that excels way beyond the sum of its parts, beyond any of their individual levels of genius, certainly beyond anything that could ever have been reasonably expected of them.
This was also the movie that made Marisa a star, and a performance I commend to this day.
What this film does is to try to illustrate that the draft was fair and equitable, and that the rich were also being called to serve.
It makes the movie flow well and also is the reason why this movie is such a perfectly entertaining one.
It is also remarkable because while most French movies let you know what characters think simply by having them talk endlessly, Anna keeps her words short and to the point and the adults around her never seem to explain things as much as they ought to.
In addition to directing, Julie Gavras also collaborated with Arnaud Cathrine on the script which they adapted from a novel by Italian novelist Domitilla Calamai.
It is impossible not to identify with little Anna, partially because she herself is so fair, and partially because it is such a thrill to see the psychology of the socialization process displayed so well and true in a movie, but also because Nina Kervel-Bey is such a powerful little actress who was so wondrously directed by Julie Gavras.
she also says that all radicals have beards, which, when repeated later by Anna, is met with an inquiry as to whether Santa clause is a radical by her kid-brother Francois (played by Benjamin feuillet).
The witty sessions Sobol and Vitti consummate are also very imaginative and smart.
The scenes also have the intelligence to take Vitti's emotional problems seriously.
The audience can also relate to Billy Crystal's character, who is an average Joe with a typical American family in a complicated situation in which he is not entirely sure how to handle.
Vitti's family is also irresolute.
I also get the impression that there are too many ideas in the screenplay, good ideas though but i think they overdid it near the end.
The movie not only showed good character development, but also had an interesting plot.
The cons also added to the interest of the plot.
Johnson also omitted a scene because he felt it changed the mood of the film so dramatically that it didn't fit.
Our heroine is also very beautiful, incredibly rich, and lonely.
With its intricate plot replete with classic Hollywood and also literary overtones, Brothers Bloom might profit from re-watchings, if you'd care to sit through the movie again.
Rian Johnson created a great modern day noir film (which was also his debut as a director) with Brick that was really enjoyable.
The film also has a Kiss Kiss Bang Bang feel to it with how colorful every shot is.
The dialogue is also top notch.
Films such as Confidence starring Ed Burns (and also Rachel Weisz) and Matchstick Men with Nicolas Cage and Sam Rockwell never fail to entertain me each time I watch them, and I'd want to add The Brothers Bloom to that list as well.
In Stephen he has crated the mastermind, the brains behind the multi-step con game each so succinctly written as one-liners that they are also used as inter-titles to logically slice the film into chapters.
The excellent character pieces also extend to the main wildcard in the story, that of Rachel Weisz's Penelope, a rich heiress stuck in her own four walls, spending time collecting hobbies and an innate array of skills, with no plans for the future and just living for the moment.
This story is also of their tale of growing up together and finding common connection, between themselves and the world.
It also becomes a romantic movie for a little while, with Penelope's infectious enthusiasm being rubbed off and onto Bloom, that bit of optimism dousing out the negativity constantly felt by the latter, and get you in the mood to cheer both of them on as well.
He assumes it is fake also.
There are four lead characters, apart from Stephen and Bloom also Bang Bang, a Japanese explosive experts that help them and Penelope, their mark.
But also Rinko Kikuchi acts very well as the explosive expert that seem to have taken a vow of silence (except while singing karaoke of course).
Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo throw themselves full-on into the story, Rachel Weisz is again at the top of the form as the dreamlike, beautiful and haunting Penelope; and the supporting cast from Rinko Kikuchi to Robbie Coltrane are also having lots of fun along the ride.
I would also like to comment that the DVD has the best behind- the-scenes featurette of any DVD I've seen; instead of a hodgepodge of scenes from the movie you just watched, it's sincere, fun fly-on-the- wall hand-held footage of the actors and crew hard at work.
Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody are also great as the brothers who try to con her and Rinko Kikuchi is great as our generations Harpo Marx's and her performance is great as well.
Sure, the movie is named for the Brothers, but not only was the script originally titled Penelope, Penelope's quirky character also still brims with so much mystery and potential for surprise in the finished film that one can't help but wonder if the resolution of her character's journey won't place the spotlight firmly on her.
From the age of 10, the brothers are con-artists, always spinning yarns and creating characters, inventing new and increasingly elaborate ways of separating their mark from his money while also giving him exactly what he wants in life.
This also appears to be how the rest of the story will pan out, this distinctive, acute and stylish endeavor of film-making, as the brothers, grown up (Adrien Brody as Bloom, Mark Ruffalo as Stephen) are continuing with their cons until Bloom wants out, leading up to the typical "one-last-con" deal where-in they'll con a reclusive New Jersey heiress Penelope (Rachel Weisz) who has way too much time on her hands as well as money for the taking.
Depending on the viewer, and how much they'll want to believe or, frankly, how many movies they've seen of this type (one could see this as being a slick parody of a film like 2003's Confidence, also co-starring Rachel Weisz if memory serves), it's like following magicians doing work, not believing a thing or believing everything.
The other way it's also European is that it's meant to be, and is, a director's tour-de-force.
As the sophomore effort of Rian Johnson, after his first very impressive debut Brick (which, I should note, also tooled playfully with conventions of a genre as he attempts here), he's aiming quite high.
It isn't just the nature of the characters, but also how they talk.
On the commentary track Spelson also tells how he begged, borrowed and sometimes appropriated with out proper authorization what he needed to complete his opus.
The Characters fits the story and I also like the energy between the characters.
It also deals very funnily with the stress of working on the line (in this case at a beer-bottling plant), of the difficulty of dealing with assembly line production that just keeps on coming.
He also drives a cab at night, where he picks up a fare who will change his life - Robbie Coltrane as Alonzo Turner.
Eugene Lipinski, who also wrote the original story and co-wrote the screenplay, gives a hilarious performance as the jealous, slightly-psycho 'Hopeless.'
I also remember reading an article about Jennie Garth where she stated that she didnt like Shannon.
I was also surprised that Tori Spelling and Brian Austin Green didnt appear on the show, especially Tori seeing as her father did the show and she stayed on it right to the end.
The imagery is once again luscious with Buddhism and nature with beautiful Korean traditional wedding costumes also.
I found it to be a tad creepy at times but I also felt deep sorrow for the old man, as the introduction of the young boy to the boat pushes the two-who were once so close-apart.
The aforementioned WARM WATER UNDER A RED BRIDGE is likewise down-to-earth realistic for the most part, but it also includes clearly fantastic elements that make it more akin to the live-action fantasy born of anime than "straight" drama.
He is famous as a kind of art film director, and his films are also not that failed but still his name is popular but his films are not that much, I think.
There is also the age aspect.
Its also a film that doesn't play to expectations, so much so that I really will have to sit down and watch the film again, there are a couple of things that happen that seem odd or out of place on first viewing that may not be that way once you reach the end.
The director, Kim Ki-duk, has also done a good job in creating unbearable suspense on what the old man whispered to the 'fortune seeking' people.
The old man, to protect the girl, wards the men off with his bow, a weapon that is also used as a kind of hypnotic musical instrument (based on the Er-hu) many times throughout the film.
That also means, of course, its also a little slow.
Ki-Duk is against early age sex but he is also against the taboo of virginity.
The two make their living by hosting fishermen aboard the boat, and also tell fortunes in a rather bizarre and dangerous fashion, by shooting arrows whizzing past the girl's head into a Buddhist painting on the side of the boat.
The film is also slow and uneventful.
The ending is a bit confusing and the theme of possessive love and the setting of a floating home are also explored in the superior Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom (2003).
This is by no means a bad thing as these are also great films in their own right.
The dual functions of the bow - as a weapon that has an overwhelming power yet it is also an instrument of art and beauty - represent the two aspects of the consciousness - Cit and Ananda, Cit = consciousness (arrow) and Ananda = beatitude (music).
I also love the filming locations: those places are fascinating!
I also appreciated very much the music.
I would have also liked to see more about the neighborhood, the places and people living around the castle, which is something that would have allowed the viewer to get a better feel of the time (pre WW1).
Last, but not least: some viewers have a problem with Sergiu Nicolaescu having been a well-connected individual for a long time, and also with his currently being a Senator in the Romanian Parliament.
It was also an independent feature film, made entirely outside any of the existing studio systems.
Marthe Keller is also a stand out.
Overall this movie is a great blend of drama and awesome action scenes while also having a fair bit of humor, and I would heartily recommend it to any movie-goer.
It's also nice to see Guy Lecluyse getting some scenes for those who've heard about him, I thought he was great in that role.
This game could have won me over also with multiple endings, but it doesn't go the only route that could have saved it.
He is the ultimate anti-hero and villain, slave of his own contradictions, master in dupe business, putting up with his proper suffering, rejected by the woman of his partner(probably Sara is also the woman of his dreams)in this game of personality mirrors which deserves a warm and cautious approaching as well as passionate comprehension.
But he was trying to demonstrate that he was also a great magazine editor.
But while noting Louisa's trysts with Harthouse, Mrs.Sparskit also notes a mysterious elderly woman who is constantly coming to see Josiah.
However, the characters quickly drew me into their lives and the storyline touched not only my adult mentality but also took me back to my childhood sense of wonder.
The script also natural and witty.
The whole cast is great, Tom Sizemore and Stephen Baldwin are great together, and the side characters are also very impressive.
There were also some very exhilarating moments throughout, even a simple scene involving kids being chased by a bully was made into a thrilling moments.
Gianna was also Marco's lover, and the two scheme to murder Nancy because when she "comes of age", the inheritance is hers.
But, instead Nancy begins to seduce them, while also turning Gianna and Marco against each other through cunning manipulation..but, while quite drawn to Nancy, neither actually ever trusts her.
The new kid in town Kyle saves Jason from a bunch of bullies in a very believable but also funny and exciting way.
His observation reminds Angelo of all the good times he had with his kid brother (an also great Stephen Baldwin) - not knowing that Baldwin has betrayed him for money.
Another movie we liked by this producer was Princess of Thieves (starring Kiera Knightley), which you may want to watch also.
It's also funny, when he and Pak become scared from Zangiya, The blue alien they meet in the dark forest.
He also tells him not to give up.
Goku also tells him that he needs to collect seven dragon balls before he can make his wish for his grandmother's health to be better.
In fact, it's a miracle that Amandio has managed to keep his script from becoming a complete mess; as aside from this new flair for murders, and the central situation; Smile Before Death is also a twisty little thriller, which manages to pull several things out of the hat before boiling down to a superb and unexpected conclusion.
comes this stylish thriller that involves not only a confusing web of love affairs and relationships, but also - towards the climax - a bundle of twists that are guaranteed to surprise every viewer without becoming implausible at any moment.
The acting is also thoroughly convincing, which is especially important once the film is finished and the viewer gets the whole story.
It is also definitely the best Hulk Hogan movie (I say this after watching the horrible Mr. Nanny).
What I also like is that the struggle of good and evil is going on more realistic sci-fi level than usual (no mystically flying superheroes and other such things).
Christopher Lloyd also performed great (as usual), and the acting of many supporting characters was solid good and fit the plot precisely.
It's obvious what would attract former teen idol Hunter to this kind of role - THE AROUSERS was an opportunity to branch out, possibly open up new opportunities for himself as an older actor, and also a chance to prove he could handle heavier drama.
The lesser-known cast members also did a fairly good job in my opinion.
I also thought this was quite early for Scully to get her evidence from the monkey pee about finding alien DNA.
Steven also his hearing his fan base and decided to do his own fights scenes, also at the end he gets back to his 'movie' roots when he goes after the man who set him up in the beginning.
Steven Seagal might be getting old and he also might not have the same shape he had 20 years ago but he certainly still can make a movie great just by being in it.
Just like romantic comedies and politic thrillers all follow some basic rules, action movies are also lead by a set of pre-requisites that you just expect to be there.
That is not actually a rhetorical question because what he is like is clearly Stephen Fry on steroids - physically rather than intellectually you understand.Now I am old and flabby,but my excuse is that I'm also poor and anonymous,I don't go to the gym(I wouldn't know what to do if I ever got there)and I don't have a personal trainer,a life coach or any other of those completely essential adjuncts to showbiz fame.Mr Seagal has no such cop outs.He is an "Action Movie" star,not a bleeding couch potato yet his spare tyre is bigger than the one on David Beckham's Hummer.
Wow.. what a great movie,, the best Seagal DVD in years,, even better than the new Pistol Whipped, this one has everything,, an opening Army battle scene,, everything blowing up,, good fight scenes for Seagal that we haven't really seen in years, a decent plot line,, also lacking for many of those DVD's of his in recent years, and this one even has a sexy as heck girl for Seagal to be with,, i liked the many different characters in this one,, Chappel for one was pretty good,, i don't touch guns... that's you're job,,, moron.. what a line.
His leathery skin clearly makes him invulnerable to conventional weapons, and while he does his usual twist/lock work, he's also forced to do some strikes that are simply pathetic.
This Arubian, American & South African co-production was directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy who is also credited as cinematographer Mercenary for Justice was the second of three awful straight-to-video/DVD action flicks he made with Seagal (the other's being Today You Die (2005) & Urban Justice (2007) which are just as bad) & at this stage I seriously doubt whether Seagal will ever make a decent action film again, entertaining action fare such as Hard to Kill (1990), Marked for Death (1990), Out for Justice (1991) & the two Under Siege (1992, 1995) films seem a distant memory from a very long time ago.
Steven Seagal might be getting old and he also might not have the same shape he had 20 years ago but he certainly still can make a movie great just by being in it.
Just like romantic comedies and politic thrillers all follow some basic rules, action movies are also lead by a set of pre-requisites that you just expect to be there.
Seeger's agenda also includes rescuing a little boy and his mother after being kidnapped by the same villain that used Seeger.
There were also moments where you think to yourself "Are you freaking kidding me?"
Mercenary For Justice is on one hand the usually bog standard he's been doing lately, but on a slightly more positive not he does most of his ADR looping and also all his own fights.
Ms. Holm was also an athlete; and, although she swims and cavorts wonderfully, she can't lift herself out of a shallow pool!
"Beneath" is a horror flick released straight to video and marks the directorial debut of Dagen Merrill, co-written with Kevin Burke (who also wrote 2003's "Tahiti", an indie drama that earned some critical praise).Christy Wescot (Nora Zehetner, "Brick") is a 20-year-old pre-med student who cannot fully live her own life since her older sister Vanessa (Carly Pope, "Sandra Goes to Whistler") was killed in a car accident six years earlier, in which Christy was driving.
could have been the last words she remembers from her sister, who was also a young mother and the wife of John Locke (Matthew Settle), a local doctor in the town of Edgemont.
Christy must not only hide the pain of her lonely existence and the hallucinations that plague her, she also has to face the humiliation of condescending treatment from the neighbours, nurses, and cops around her; though one of them, Jeff Burdan (Warren Christie), is pretty kind to her, his cop pal Randy (Patrick Gilmore) makes a cruel remark before being introduced to Christy.
Christy also investigates the details about Vanessa's burial, as well as her medical files (which are now in private access for John Locke), all the while succumbing to near psychotic states when she suffers random seizures that lead her to draw darkly artistic portraits of people and threatening symbols.
i had really low expectation going in.mainly because of the words MTV films appearing on the screen was surprised at how well done this psychological suspense thriller was.i found it very atmospheric,and suspenseful.there weren't a lot of cheap scares.it was intelligent,and well written,in my opinion.the ending was unexpected.i was also very impressed with the acting.Nora Zehetner as Christy was very good,but Matthew Settle as John really impressed.basically,my opinion of MTV films went up several notches after this film was over.i don't get the low rating(5.3/10).but that's just my opinion.for me,Beneath is a well deserved 8/10
Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music.
But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.
This is also one of my favorite movies, along with Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans.
The erotica is also very beguiling
It also fills in the artistic surroundings, with for instance some of Brassai's photographs as well as using him as a minor character, and a clip from Le Chien Andalou.
This would have worked also for Moulin Rouge, better than the gratuitous and grating special effects.
Uma Thurman is also quite sexy, and also gives a fine performance.
Kevin Spacey is also good in a small supporting performance.
Anais is also known and praised as one of the first and the finest female writers of erotica.
This rate is in relation with the discharge of 300 000 tons waste of the aforementioned company of exploitation  25 > > average Percentage of the growth of deforestation in Amazonia each year  1/3 > > Representativeness with it only of the Amazonian forest on the remainder of the tropical forests  30 000 > > a Number of species already identified in Amazonian forest  1 000 > > a Number of species of birds which were counted  30 > > a Number of species of monkeys counted  3 000 > > a Number of fish species listed, also 2 single species of fresh water dolphins  3,7 million > > Surface in kmÂ² of the Brazilian Amazonian forest.
This film is about a married female writer who is sexually drawn to a mysterious couple who are also writers.
The film is worth seeing for Thurman's performance alone, but also for the cinematograhy and the fine work of other cast members.
To see a piece f some of the greatest writers in American erotica, even fictionalized, was also great.
Not only does she look remarkably like the young Anais, but she also seems to radiate the writer's deep erotic mystique.
Thurman's performance is also quite good, her NYC accent believable and her dirty-girl role works well in contrast to Anais' bourgeois exterior.
The music is also well placed and adds to this mood.
Brougher has courage to address an issue most people wish to submerge - that of unwanted teenage pregnancies and their consequences - and she does it in the form of a story that is so well woven and presented with such fine actors that she not only succeeds in bringing attention to her main topic, she also introduces us to two women whose lives, though separated by years of age, are significantly parallel.
Tilda Swinton is also very good as the detective investigating Daley's case, and both Melissa Leo and Timothy Hutton give solid backup.
Such are the elements of a good mystery; and in the case of Stephanie Daley they are also the subject matter.
Swinton's character also happens to be pregnant - 29 weeks.
Without proselytising for one side or the other, it also puts issues such as sex education and the laws regarding sex and minors into stark perspective.
The two key lovemaking scenes also seem linked by the way the colours are distorted by near darkness.
Only Raab was not in it - ironically his role of Boris Kolenkhov the Russian dance master is played by George Rose, who I also saw on stage in other plays.
Matt Newton also does very well as the main character who's life bears the brunt of the bet that is referred to in the title.
I also enjoyed Roy Billing as George, Will's father, the Aussie Battler personified (though Roy is actually from New Zealand).
For a director's first feature, I take my hat off to Mark Lee and also to the writer/producer who for reasons previously stated in another post did an amazing job getting this movie to our screens.
The film also does an excellent of giving the audience a sense of place, without ever turning into a travelogue.
Daniel Sauli is also good as Michael, the son who has left, only to come back and finds out things are not good at home.
It is nice to escape when you are the movies, but it also nice to believe what you are escaping to can happen.
Nothing more but also nothing less.
The implication that he's also the supreme evil force in the universe adds a neat mythic touch.
This film also challenges the typical stereotypes of what a hero is.
This film is also a wonderful aesthetic journey full of vibrant colours and characters.
Besides his personal charisma and cuteness he also happens to be a real natural, effortlessly performing in from of a camera.
Edward Everett Horton plays a boring advertising Exec who has been the mentor of Hopkins and who is also in love with her, in his way.
What is does however is that it render the movie tones of reality, tiny pieces of documentary that somehow also makes it a powerful statement without indulging in pointers.
I also didn't like multiple nationalist statements which have nothing to do with the plot.
Hopkins also strikes "attitudes" and she often poses dramatically as she stares off into the distance and speaks rather ponderous and unfunny speeches.
Edward Everett Horton plays the more down-to-Earth man who also vies for Hopkin's attention.
It's funny and charming, but it's also quite a bit darker and more serious than the American films he had made before it in the sound era.
It also means this is a beautiful film, sure with a few minor faults mainly associated with a few stodgy stagey scenes, but well worth the watch at least for being out of the ordinary.
This sequel could also show us Tomme and Kachiri and their family.
Also props go out to Everett Van Horten (also from Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise) as the straight man who just can't understand this gang.
On a train trip they share a compartment with Gilda (Miriam Hopkins), also an artist - but one who works for an advertising firm run by Max Plunkett (Edward Everett Horton).
She will also continue working for Max.
Eaglebauer also makes for some fine humour in some scenes near the end, but we never get to see the man.
As Cooper's friend and rival for the affection of Hopkins, March is also very funny, which comes as no surprise after his brilliant parody of John Barrymore in The Royal Family of Broadway (1930).
(This is also one of the few Lubitsch films where the lead characters are American rather than European.)
On the one hand it's a good looking and also clearly professionally made movie with lots of talent involved but it just makes some wrong choices in its storytelling.
But in this case the approach doesn't really work out, since it also obviously is a movie that wants to be taken seriously and has a clear message in it.
It also uses lots of technology vs. nature elements.
The natives scenes also aren't always among the best or most interesting one's out of the movie.
Sure the nature environments are beautiful looking but it slows the movie a bit down in the middle, which also is in big contrast with the serious and dramatic first part of the movie and the action filled final part.
It nevertheless it is a rather good- and also entertaining enough movie to watch, despite its obvious flaws and bad choices in the storytelling.
The score is also far too fluffy, or at least it is for my liking; and the screenplay, while subtle, seemingly jumps from one scenario to another, ultimately leaving me almost baffled.
I didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend (who also has red hair!)
We also see how the ugliness of prostitution has became a stigma to tribes as The Fierce Ones trade women from The Invisible Ones tribe for machine guns.
Again, through that we see how progress can also destroy a civilization..The Fierce Ones can wipe out who they deem a threat and/or nuisance with advanced weaponry.
The mythological aspects were also diverting from the realism of the film(if a wee bit silly).
The arrested are students, activists, syndicalists, but also people who ''look'' strange, are at the wrong place at the wrong time and really don't have anything to do with the situation.....
It takes the unusual but also effective step of having the actors discuss the people they play within the body of the film.
It also should be shown in schools as a fundamental example and a discussion starter on the importance of civil rights and the fragility of freedom.
There were also different objectives for different characters in the action stages, which made it that much more interesting.
This guy has one of the coolest careers in cinema ever, seeing he also appeared in milestone titles like Fulci's `City of the Living Dead', `Cannibal Ferox' and Rugero Deodato's `House on the Edge of the Park'.
They are both extremely exploitive and violent and also both written by Dardano Sacchetti who wrote most of the Fulci masterpieces like Zombie (1979), The Gates of Hell (aka: City of the Living Dead, 1980), The Beyond (1981) among films for other directors like Lamberto Bava and his Demoni (1985) and Demoni 2 (1986).
He has acted in Fulci's Gates of Hell and even more notably in Umberto Lenzi's sicko cannibal flick Cannibal Ferox (1982) that he also hates the most nowadays!
Saxon and Radice (the latter known also as John Morghen) are Vietnam veterans that suffer from a strange virus originating from the war field: cannibalism and the need for human flesh and some gut munching.
It is interesting to hear the makers' own opinions on these (low) films nowadays, now that most of the directors have retired and are old men, and the actors also aging but still possibly in the business.
Margheriti himself was very proud of this film and also mentioned plenty of times that Quentin Tarantino himself has liked Cannibal Apocalypse (same kind of comment about Q has been said by Lenzi, too!).
Cannibal Apocalypse is also a little too long running 96 minutes in NTSC speed.
Plus, the DVD also has plenty of interview extras and film clips that wind up almost being as long as the film itself.
It also seems that this "virus" can be transmitted by the bite of an "infected" person.
Unfortunately, years before, the commanding officer was also bitten while trying to rescue these poor soldiers, but has been pretty good at keeping his "sickness" at bay.
but truthfully I don't think they'll really believe you unless you were actually in Vietnam also.
This movie, while having rich and deep cheese deposits, also actually has some quality to it.
And then there's just the story, which covers the first days of a viral outbreak as it begins to spread and people begin to wake up to what is going on, which is also pretty fascinating.
There's also an additional layer of tension to the movie (compared to a traditional zombie movie) in that after someone's been bitten, you aren't sure WHEN they will start turning into a crazed flesh-eater.
With such a great cast (that also includes Honor Blackman), and Wheatley's well researched black magic mumbo jumbo forming the basis of the script, To The Devil A Daughter trundles along quite nicely for the majority of its running time, offering audiences plenty of fun devilish goings-on, including the nasty birth of a demon child (which exits via the abdomen), Blackman being stabbed in the neck with a metal comb, one poor character going up in flames, Lee terrorising a trembling Elliot over the phone, and the lovely Nastassja giving viewers an eyeful of her hot bod.
Unfortunately, the messy finalÃ© (which sees Lee's character disappear mysteriously after receiving a bump on the head) does mean that the film closes on something of a bum note and admittedly cannot hold a (black) candle to the real Satanic hit of '76, The Omen, but it's also nowhere near as bad as some Hammer fans would have you believe.
A few statistics are also thrown around in the movie concerning the role the Amazon plays in the world and how the white man is destroying it all by bringing industry to the area.
This movie also reflects acting in its most simple and effect tone.
Anne's song, "One Starry Night," dubbed by vocalist Martha Tilton, is also a very good tune.
The acting is also unforgivably poor, given the talent involved.
Raft is also totally unbelievable and totally out of place.
Since it also is about theater people, Black Widow features some stylish dialogue, some clever performances and some back-biting relationships.
Nanny has also captivated the 21-year-old son of a rich Boston family.
Then we learn Detective Bruce is also figuring things out, and we may be in for a surprise.
They also wrote under several other pseudonyms.
This is a tense and ingeniously plotted noir film, based on a clever novel by Hugh Wheeler (writing as Patrick Quentin), and excellently scripted by Nunnally Johnson, who also directed.
This is coincidentally also one of the last roles of Gene Tierney, one of the most luminous of actresses because of her classic beauty.
Directed by Nunnally Johnson who also adapted it from a story by Hugh Wheeler, it tells the tale of a young girl, excellently played by the famous child star, Peggy Ann Garner, all grown up, who attempts to make it big in NYC.
Ginger Rogers plays a bitchy stage diva who is married to a mousy man (Reginald Gardiner) and lives in the same apartment building as her producer (Van Heflin) who is also married to an actress (Gene Tierney).
She also befriends a young brother and sister from Boston (Virginia Leith & Skip Homeier) who are doing the Greenwicj Village beatnik thing.
Then also the idea that sickness (in the films case, a severe fever from enemy tribal poison), can be sucked out of someone in it's elemental energetic form- this is also ancient practise which traditionally one is merging with a helpful spirit to gain powerful protection beforehand - as is demonstrated in the film.
there he meets a girl (girija) who is naughty and teaser.later, he finds the girl is also suffering from a rare disease where her days are numbered too.
I was also filled with the emotion to go to Brazil and blow away anyone with a chainsaw...
This movie also shows that life should be lived to the extent possible and love between a mother and a son is very well shown.
The movie is also one of the longest Columbo movies made, with its 98 minutes.
It also isn't the most clever Columbo movie in terms of the killer his plot and it isn't a Columbo movie with many twists to the story but it simply is a well written solid story that remains interesting throughout its characters and settings.
It provides the movie with some tense sequences between the killer and Lt. Columbo, since Columbo is obviously somewhat reluctant at first of making accusations against such an highly respected man, that also above all things is his wives favorite candidate.
The movie also features all of the other usual Columbo movie ingredients, including some good relieving humor.
The movie is also made great to watch thanks to its fine performances.
Anyways, if you haven't already figured it out, Jake is the young man re-incarnated, and he's also the stranger with the car.
Of course it was some typical '80's cheese but I also have the feeling that the makers really didn't thought that they were making something classic.
The movie and its story is kept fairly simple and because of that the movie also feels very straight-forward, which definitely is a plus for these type of movies.
It's a cheesy silly B-movie, that because of that also at the same time becomes very entertaining to watch.
Further more, Randy Quaid also plays a role in the movie as the sheriff.
He's good in his role but he's not really supported by most of the other actors in this movie, which also makes his performance look bad at times.
When Jake begins hitting on Keri(Sherilyn Fenn), who also happens to be Packard's girlfriend.
If you think The Wraith is a silly concept for a film you would be right, it's also a crap concept for a film.
The acting isn't great & Clint Howard's hair deserves a credit all of it's own, Sheen & Cassavetes also have bad 80's hair-dos.
This is one of my personal favorites not just because it has a truly awesome car,The Tubo Interseptor,but it also has a cool almost Western like plot.The story starts with a bizarre spirit forming in the middle of a vacant Arizona road,he apparantly comes from outter space,along with his super-flashy car.This spirit or Wraith as he is referred to in the title is actually the avenging spirit of a murdered local kid back to take on the gang who killed him and that has been terrorizing the roads of Arizona.Charlie Sheen plays the Wraith and Sheryle Fenn plays his girl-friend who is being practically held captive by the leader of the same motor gang that killed Sheen's characterfrom the beginning.Naturally,The Wraith,or Jake as he is called when in human form,takes on these motor thugs one-on-one in some very cool and dizzying death races.In my humble opinion,the best part of this film is the soundtrack.With awesome hard rock from Ozzy,Billy Idol,Robert Palmer,Lion,Honey-moon suite and my personal fav Motley Crue.
Director John Boorman also directed Beyond Rangoon, and some other films that are amazingly good.
He also has a love interest Keri (Played by Sherilyn Fenn) who was once his girlfriend when he had a different face.On to more things the soundtrack is Fantastic.
I also liked the old SFX.
I also have to comment on the fantastic soundtrack, great wardrobe, and great opening sequence.
I'm also aware that Charlie Sheen hates this movie and he must have good reason.
It also launched the careers of Charlie Sheen and Sherilyn Fenn (Fenn's fans will be happy to see "more" of her in this one).
the soundtrack to this movie was one of the best i've eve heard and to me a great soundtrack can also make a great movie.
I also spent time in many of the Indian tribes in the area, including being "adopted" into one at the age of five.
The script begins to tighten its focus and, while much of the film owes its existence to Romero's "Dead" trilogy, it also throws in a couple of unexpected twists of its own.
this zombie movie was just corny,and made no sense.It was also so slow the jokes were just hours long and the dialogue was cut and so slow this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen by far.Mostly I never read ratings and decide if the movie is bad or not on my own but this was one of those cases when you should.There's bad and there's horribly stupid disgusting waist of time and this is past that.The makeup was horrible and was more of a porno then a zombie movie,The acting was the worst i have ever seen, a 5 year old could do better.Wow I'm still disgusted on how horribly bad this movie is blah!blah!blah!
This short film is one of the most god damned hilarious pieces of cinematic literature I've ever seen and it is also just enjoyable to watch as well.
Another reviewer said it wasn't funny at all but then he made a comment about how Kung Pow also tried to use bad dubbing to a humorous effect and critics didn't like.
The men are also physically and mentally highly idealized.
Jimmy Lydon also passes muster, and his career was such that he took whatever was offered after a good run in the Henry Aldrich series.
Gamera also is looking bad in this film.
Paul confides in an old friend of the family, Dr. Martin Vincent (Regis Toomey), who tries to calm Paul but who also respects Paul's intelligence.
Paul also has a grudging feeling that Brett is the man in the shadows in his dream who was responsible for his fathers death and also wants to keep his mother from marrying him.
Paul also feels that Barrington faked his own death and is now back to eliminate those who may be able to expose him as still being alive by being in the position of finding Judge Cartwright secret files; the Judge's family.
It also stands in stark contrast to the "gee whiz" scenes (as mentioned in a previous comment), which seem like they were lifted straight out of "Leave It to Beaver."
I also loved both the band music and the opera scene music.
Robert Young is also in it as Bob Stuart, her boss at the department store and the only one who knows her secret.
Robert Young was also an actor that was effective in all the comedies he played, as he shows here with his take of Bob.
Ray Collins of "Perry Mason" fame also makes an appearance, as does Eugene Palette as the newspaper editor who prints the amnesiac's story.
The name of the movie also liked me, Appeared Vs.
However, they're really disgusting also, and the final scene; even though the 'monster' is a doll, really is nightmarish.
This lavish television production also stars Natassja Kinski and the french actor Gerard Depardieu.
ALSO, when Terrence Stamp summoned Satan up from hell (I think that's who it was, it was a demon or devil made of fire), that part was also scary somewhat.
I thought Terrence Stamp was good as a really creepy butler, and sorta scary also.
The ghosts looked good also.
The ghost were filmed very good also, but they should have watched Tower of Terror beforehand, and maybe they would have had a better idea about it.
Terence Stamp's broad range of acting talent was also a total waste in this movie and a few times judging by the expressions on his face, he may have thought so too.
This is not the comedy that the trailer portrayed but is more of a light humored Poltergiest (which was also rated PG).
He also did pretty well in 'The Golden Child' and the first couple of 'Beverly Hills Cop' movies.
While watching this movie you just have to think and feel like a child again, since this is also the target group the movie got aimed towards.
The movie is great looking, with also especially its special effects.
The movie also features some or the recently deceased Rick Baker make-up effects, which is always something great to look at.
I also can't say if I'm too sure about Eddie Murphy casting as the main lead.
Besides the well known Eddie Murphy, the movie also features well known and respected actors such as Terence Stamp, Nathaniel Parker and Jennifer Tilly.
On top of that the movie also features the wonderful Deep Roy, in a really small role though.
The movie its musical score by Mark Mancina also really deserves recognition.
Rick Baker "Monster Maker" is so talented and has done an impressive (as always) job creating a vision from the Haunted Mansion ride that he also admired.
As i said the sets are also some of the best i've seen the mansion is absolutely breathtaking.
It's also not as good as Daddy Day Care which was a lot more enjoyable to watch.
If you cannot see the movie then I recommend reading the book and if you have seen the movie then you should read the book also if you've read the book then you should see the movie.
Griffith's shot composition was also becoming increasingly refined.
It's also great how the even the set design matches the pace of each scene Â the home is bare and Spartan, the workshop, courtroom and prison cell are full and layered.
Nichols, as the judge, also does well, playing the sort of sympathetic authority-figure role that Frank Capra might later have set aside for Harry Carey or Harry Davenport.
Edie Falco was also enchanting as Judy, the only upbeat character in all of Babylon (and she was leaving).
Judy Berlin also features great performances by Barbara Barrie (who I personally loved in Breaking Away) and Bob Dishy.
It is also the perfect role for Madeline Kahn, who the world lost too soon shortly before the film's release.
But the director, Eric Mendelson, making his first film, captures all these people in the same way Allen does in all their humour- but also suggests a level of sadness that Woody hardly ever did.
There is also perhaps one of the biggest rip-off scenes from Jaws ever done, so blatantly.
There is also a "space sex" scene which they use "Love Gas" to achieve.
There is also a scene where a guy is speaking German to a Gaijin guy who speaks Japanese back at him.
Judy Berlin is a unique independent film and stands out also because it was the final film of the late and great Madeline Kahn.
The other 3 main players are also wonderful, Bob Dishy, Madeline Kahn, and Bette Henritze.
Lord Keily is also a great character.
Also making Sharpe's life a misery is the inexperienced and arrogant Lord Keily himself, who's attitude towards Sharpe and his own men, plus his open affair with a sensual female guerrilla fighter by the name of Juanita, pushes Sharpe to the brink of his patience especially as this affair is embarrassing, and emotionally crippling the beautiful and busty Lady Keily who is also in camp.
You also have the Royal guard themselves, men of pride who have to come to terms with the knowledge that they are the laughing stock of the army and as they grow in the art of war, it's hard not to cheer for them.
There's also some really gritty fighting, particularly in the town towards the end.
I really enjoyed seeing this movie.It's more enjoyable to watch a movie when it has a good cast.The cast consists of actors like:Olivier Gruner,Rebecca Staab,Judson Mills,Randy Travis,and more.It's a good super action movie.I also recommend you see Militia,& Missing In Action.
but also a damn good plot that anyone who has ever held a chisel tip can fully appreciate.
In this case, there's an extra cause for humor: to enhance the local flavor and also satisfy modern correctness, we have extended additions involving the local people: an aunt and a patronizing voodoo bit.
The adaptation also is rather lengthy, and there is some sluggish pacing in the middle half.
On the plus side though, asides from how it was filmed and the good plot and script, we are also treated to a first-rate cast.
It would be really interesting to see if ITV can produce something as good as this when it comes around to it, will also be interesting to see who will be starring as Miss Marple.
This also helped spark the economic opportunities in the European and North American market if not the global market.
But what I was saying music wise, these 16 episodes had stock music that was also heard on Challenge of the SuperFriends, both the Challenge and Non Challenge episodes of 1978.
Bottom line, I feel the best Scooby Doo shows were the original Where Are You series and these 1976-1978 episodes and also, the Scooby Movies of the early 70's.
DYNOMUTT: DOG WONDER: This was not only a spin off to me from Scooby Doo, but also a parody of Batman and Robin, only in this case, the sidekick (a mechanical one) is the actual star while the hero is actually the costar.
I also enjoyed the few episodes where Scooby Doo and the gang of Mystery Inc. guest appeared.
He also develops a strange, suggestively homosexual friendship with a nearby dog-walker and bumps uglies with the saucy waitress of the local diner...
"Cannibal Man" is a slow-paced Spanish shocker that contains some graphic gore.The film is also extremely stylish and the atmosphere of decay and frustration is simply overwhelming.It certainly gained some notoriety as a former video nasty in the UK,but it's nowhere nearly as explicit as for example Lucio Fulci's gorefests.However the most interesting fact is that Eloy de la Iglesia was one of the major directors to push Spanish censorship boundaries with this film and a number of powerful gay-oriented films like "El Diputado" or "Los Placeres Ocultos".So if you are a fan of Spanish horror give it a try.8 out of 10.
There are also some truly surreal scenes, such as the swimming pool sequence and the tense denouement.
His brother rolls into town, Marcos confesses to the murder and his brother also tries to talk him into turning himself in and is immediately clubbed over the head with a wrench.
Director De La Iglesia also made several other horror films, including GLASS CEILING (1971).
Eloy de la Iglesia's "Cannibal Man" is an exceptional study of sociopathic isolation that also comments on the gulf between how the rich and poor were treated by the authorities in Spain in '72.
Racked with guilt Marcos confesses all to his Brother Steve who also says he must tell the police, in no time whatsoever Marcos beats Steve to death with a wrench.
Director Iglesia also manages to throw in a bit of satire amongst the blood, of which there is a fair amount but the title Cannibal Man is so misleading it's untrue.
It's also great how throughout the film, we wonder if he really knows more about what Marcos is doing than we can guess, with lines like "You better bury them," is he talking about Marcos' memories or the bodies starting to add up in Marcos' bedroom?
It also makes me chuckle at the sound clips from the movie.
In the end it's not just a great comedy, it actually manages to deliver something that can be called "a message", when, after main character Dante has survived possibly the worst day in his life, he has to admit that it wasn't all just bad luck but also a broad hint that he could/should change his life as a clerk.
I also heard they're making a part 2.
The film's looks is also something to be admired.
The hostage scenes were also superbly done, the hostages all did their part.
and the scenes between Mulder and Duane were also superbly done.
I thought that was an interesting and funny take on the movie, but I also think that-that could have been done in a short film.
It's also that fact that makes this movie so good, every aspiring director (including myself) sees this movie and if it weren't there before, now there is hope, hope that someday i will make it big time to.
), and also try to find ways of not working, or at least make the day less boring (as Randal puts it:"This job would be great if it wasn't for the f**king customers").
Between these discussions, they also interact with Dante's present girlfriend Veronica (whose sex life causes heated debates) and ex Caitlin, who's apparently engaged to some Asian design major.
They're also the two crudest, and the first and last in the series, respectively.
is genius on celluloid despite little change of scenery, wooden acting (none of the actors are professionals), and a shoe-string budget; it's also pretty damn funny.
"Just because they serve you, doesn't me they like you" became an immortal tagline for one of the best independent comedies of all time, which also launched the career of its director.
also contains many Smith trademarks including "Star Wars" talk, references to Spielberg movies, comic books and hockey, all qualities of which would do Smith good in his so-called "New Jersey Trilogy."
Something that was also annoying was the blinking lights in the alien-scenes.
I was also surprised to see "The Patty Hearst".
In addition I also liked the way it was shot it felt very homey and was not overwhelming which allowed the flavor of the story to shine through.
As an indie film maker (Currently shooting "Bank+Shot" in New Orleans Louisiana and surrounding areas I also recommend "Peices of April" with Katie Holmes.
Not long after, I saw Sideways, which also deals with the friendship of two off-beat males.
It spends 10 minutes alone on a golf game to underscore the life-long jealousy between Boyd Gaines and Joe Pantoliano (who also served as this film's producer).
Enter a 'conflict' point in the film, and also enter a very big 'clunk' of disbelief for me: why would such an upwardly mobile, very ambitious guy, who escaped the tedious, dead-end life of a suburban Jerseyite, still consider the pathetic, terminally whiny Elliot his very best friend after all these years?
It also shows us that no one can be a "loser" when they have good friends, people they love and care about and can have fun with.
That more depressing side of aging baby boomers was left out of "Sideways," though this film also has plenty of funny one-liners, sometimes with easy targets like Hollywood and books, to compensate.
Boyd Gaines was also great as the friend/nemesis.
She also say, "So whatever crap you got to make up about space men or UFOs, just keep him on the phone."
All the other performances are also quite strong, especially Boyd Gaines.
Beyond being bitter sweet, this film is also very funny.
As a woman, I also found this movie enlightening.
Every shot is also fascinatingly choreographed and photographed, which makes the audience feel like they are watching a painting come to life.
He also recalls his early years on Broadway (only after he was rejected by the President of NBC for being gay),and his eventual rise as a television celebrity, makes this for a film to be taken upon.
I also found that this is a great movie to play with the volume turned down, at a party...your guests will thank you.
It was good; I also remember the 1995 TV remake that I watched on ABC as were we moving here to Texas!
But it's also witty, well-written and not overly sentimental.
There could also be a college level version of the course also, the controversy generated would be just as educational as the content....as, no doubt, there are still many American's who still don't "get" what the organized labor movement was/is all about.
It also reveals the internal strife that is the labor movement and the beauty and weakness of the democratic process.
Dr. Benson also finds a book about Satan & suddenly he sees Susan but she is dressed differently, uninjured & seems to answer to the name Evelyn.
Meanwhile the next morning Susan regains consciousness & also heads for the Gothic looking castle.
There she meets a guy in a cape & ask's if he knows who helped her, she also meets someone who looks like Dr. Benson but goes by the name of Peter.
The final nail in Nuda per Satana's coffin is that it is also very boring & just doesn't engage the viewer.
A similar movie, 'Bloodsucker leads the dance' is far superior in comparison (by the way, if you've seen "Bloodsucker Leads The Dance", you'll have noticed that the very same sets used in "Nude For Satan" also appear in that film).
It does however remind me of the movie "Carnival of Souls" in a way that the driver of the vehicle was not supposed to have dies in a crash when he had almost hit a silhouette figure in a white nightgown off the road and soon after a lady had also had an unfortunate accident with a far lesser fate than his.
Apart from this fusion of past and present Â not to mention, leading lady Rita Calderoni Â the two also share the doppelganger motif and, as I said earlier, an absolute (deliberate?)
Â throughout most of this (beginning with the very opening sequence)Âthough she also suffers the ignominy of having to scream her head off, ostensibly in abject terror, during an attack by a hilariously fake arachnid (albeit inside a reasonably atmospheric spider-pit)!
It also has a spider attack, which has to be the most laughably fake monster I've seen in a film since possibly "Horrors of Spider Island".
4.Its a Cult flick(Enjoyed by some and despised by most)  The reason i didn't give it full marks is that it doesn't have as much nudity as i wished for,but still pretty good.It has very good atmosphere which i totally love about these movies and the wooden acting also makes me happy.If i want to see great acting i would watch a Mira Nair film.
And also leave comments :d But all in French !
An anarchistic exclamation also.
However, the sad truth is, Claude Lelouch, the director, explained that the car he was driving was actually a Mercedes, with the Ferrari exhaust note added to give the viewer a greater sense of speed, he also confirmed that he drove the car himself.
On the surface, Rendezvous is one of the greatest car movies ever made, yet under the surface, it is also one of the most intriguing.
And if this individual also is a teacher doing so with a student, salt and iodine should be added liberally to the resulting wounds.
Nicole Tom gives a great performance, and GARY Cole does great also.
I also love her brother and Older sister(the young and the restless).
Then, Martha will know in a park to Frank (Rufus Sewell), an actor with bad luck in the love, that also will fall in love of her.
Lawrence, a young man serious but a little clumsy, will also fall in love with her.
I also find it hard to believe that so many good actors would have an off day every day of filming and at the same time.
Tom Hollander is also very versatile.
Interestingly, Joseph Finnes is also outstanding in one of the films that I believe is among the best of the decade: "Shakespeare in Love."
Christine Kavanagh, Blair Brown and Jamie Glover also shine.
It is also interesting to note that many of the scenes were filmed on location in Liverpool, so you get to see the actual quarry, Strawberry Fields, etc.
I'll probably never be able to understand how terrible it must have been for him to lose his mother so young (Paul also lost his mother young, and Ringo knew only his mother; George was the only Beatle who spent his whole childhood with both parents).
For that matter, it was also the worst written piece of trash I've seen in a long time.
It is also a good way to keep from getting into a coma or deriving some enjoyment from a really bad movie.
They also wear these adorable rabbit slippers throughout the movie.
He also knows his business thoroughly as the head of a mercenary team for hire.
The action also seems more realistic than most films, a no point do our heroes go in all guns blazing instead they negotiate with the criminals until they are ready to go in stealthily.
The great James Mason also appears as one of the top admirals of the British navy.
Then when I married I discovered to my horror that my wife also had five sisters, all unmarried and all expecting my support.
The film on the whole is tailor made for Roger Moore and he fits into the quirky character like a glove and it is also very ironic that he buddies up with the American "Mr. King" who plays the production platform offshore installation manager as Moore also stars with the same actor in many of his James Bond movies.
Anthony Perkins also gives an excellent performance as the head of a group of terrorist who forcibly takes control of a supply ship and threaten to blow up some oil platforms in the North Sea.
He's an eccentric tough guy, who loves cats and a good shot of whiskey, he's also highly opinionated.
There is also a veiled suggestion of homosexuality between the two boss hijackers whom ffolkes is called upon to dispatch, which makes you wonder if Anthony Perkins, who plays one of them, had anything to do with working that into the script.
Anthony Perkins is convincing as the hijack leader and also fittingly comical.
Rufus also dislikes Women, is crazy for Cats and has a lot of money.
Kramer's second-in-command sets explosives throughout the ship and connects them to a detonator box that can signal the destruction of not only Esther but also the charges set on Ruth and Jennifer.
The plot is influenced by the rise of modern terrorism and the energy crisis in the seventies, but also by the Bond films and the fashionable disaster movies of its time.
I also saw this film at The Los Angeles Film Festival, and what a joy!
Ironically this film also delivers a very real emotional punch.
This movie also gives you an idea on what life was like during the 1950's including a village fete which were popular at the time and still are today.
As well as Jimmy Hanley, it also stars Lionel Jefferies (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and Carry On star Kenneth Conner.
As an added plus the disc I got also showed the original commercials and opening promo.
The script is also very good and it is not just the fear of the antagonist that creates tension, as the social tension and atmosphere between the two main characters also at times has you cringing.
So is it not a good thing that 'Disturbia' has been made as whenever the film is mentioned, 'Rear Window' also gets mentioned so it sheds light on a great film that modern audiences may not have looked up otherwise..?
The biggest rip off hear was of course "REAR WINDOW" it also took some plot points from "WHEN A STRANGER CALLS"-which if you ask me is a lot better than this film- and also "SAW".
Humor was also added into the mix which is very nice except the comic relief, Shia's best friend Ronny is a bit annoying at times.
So, I watched the "making of featurette" on the DVD and one of the main characters confided that she read the script and she was also confused and it made no sense.
Many of Chabrol's films (even his bad ones) are also often compared to Hitchcock's and I'm getting sick of this disingenuous advertising.
The three teenagers use cell phones and the internet as well as video cameras in the investigation, and DJ Caruso shows some of his sly wit by using these same devices in the film to not only investigate the spooky neighbor, but also to create some humor to go along with everything else.
Disturbia also once again proves that you don't need a bunch of gore to make an effective horror thriller.
This movie also launched the career of Jason Lee who played the comic loving, video game playing, mallrat of a crazy fool Brodie Bruce.
I also like the fact that it takes place in a mall, considering I am a shopaholic and go to the mall every week.Good job Kevin.
He also had the best performance in the film.
If "Mallrats" had gone had tried to be serious while trying to also be slapstick, it was have fallen even further away from critics and the masses alike.
It is all right to keep your brain on here and it is also all right to turn your brain off as well because this is entertainment as it's finest.
It's also so very hilarious.
Ben Affleck also makes a great villain - partly because I hate his other movies so much.
And to everybody who has also failed in seeing a sailboat in those dumb 3-D-pictures, this movie provides some comfort...
Not only has it been his means of escape throughout his life, a bizarre sort of self therapy, but it has also served as a magnet drawing in people who through their influence and belief in his music have gone out of their way to be helpful to him.
There's an exceptional animated segment produced by Pat Moriarity that was also memorable.
Sad also because here is a man who obviously craves attention and love and yet his paranoia constantly rears its ugly head and destroys important relationships needlessly.
There are also moments where the background music buries the interview dialogue so you can hardly make out what's being said.
But like I said it`s only a minor flaw   A good TVM and it`s interesting to note the director was John MacKenzie the same man who brought us the Brit gangster classic THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY and who also directed DEADLY VOYAGE one of the greatest made for television films ever .   
However, Lake Mungo does not just focus on the horror, but also how the family deals with the grief, and what they are willing to believe and do to help each other and themselves.
oddly - it's also something one should do to enjoy this film (judging from the comments.)
This one little event throws off the natural order in the animal kingdom to the extent that a cat and a dog also long for death by the cartoons end.
Just witnessing how disturbed each animal is by the twisted turn of events is enough to equally disturb the viewer while also provoking plenty of laughter.
We also get a dog involved.
There was also his performance as "Von Zeppel" the fanatical aviation pioneer on "F-Troop", who gets Corporal Agarn to wear a Prussian military outfit complete with pointed helmet.
Korman, trying to follow the instructions of his employer (who was also his would-be girlfriend - something Korman is constantly trying to avoid).
But Korman is also aware of pressures on himself because he is the manager that are beginning to make him doubt his abilities or his courage.
The character's are also very good with each member of the gang having a distinct personality & getting at least a few minutes screen time to develop it although McClain is hard to like as the lead character since he only seems interested in serving himself.
There's also a neat car chase here as well.
Her getup and behaviour of a fallen woman was amusing also when you think of all the dear ladies who have appeared in MTV videos and all that "breakthrough" business Madonna pulled back in the eighties and nineties.
And it's also hard not to see this film as a direct protest against the code that there was talk about during these years.
However, they are also the extreme, and both obnoxious.
The difference in the case of "La Moustache" is that while this film also happens to lack nice tidy plot lines, the film-makers seemed to think that that, all by itself, makes this film brilliant too.
RAIN is also based not directly on the Maugham prose, but on a stage version.
Directed by Lewis Milestone and also starring: Guy Kirbee, Ben Hendirk's Jr and William Gargan.
Besides the two leads, there's also good performances by Guy Kibbee as the hotel owner that houses Crawford and Huston, Beulah Bondi as Huston's wife, and William Gargan as Crawford's Navy protector.
Crawford's face is also a focus: from her initial "good-time gal" flirting with the sailors to the incredible sequence where she (apparently) converts, she leers, pouts, weeps, and more importantly, knows when to stop, in the three scenes she appears (seemingly) without makeup.
We also believe Huston's face a moment later, as he prays alone, grimaces unreadably, and suddenly resolves into a look of predatory lust just before slipping into her room, the drums implacably beating in the background.
There is also a soldier who loves Sadie and who wants to marry her.
I've also tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain Julian Gloag's book, but it appears to be out of print.
An intriguing story about the dark side of the childhood, but also a poetic look to a group of boys and girls who decided to continue his life as usual, as if his mother were among them and not dead.
Brooks is very good also, watch for the death-bed scene at the start of the film.
Bogarde's performance is also top notch, convincingly playing against type as a fast-talking working class grifter.
You can also ask them to show it on television.
You can also vote for The Third Secret or other movies to be released.
The movie is also greatly carried by its cast, both the adult as the children's.
But the movie also has a good adult cast that unfortunately is perhaps a bit underused at times.
It was also great to see Yootha Joyce in the movie, who I only knew from the British comedy series "George and Mildred".
And yes, I also consider it's a gem waiting to be discovered and release in a excellent DVD Special edition.
After the meal, he wanders back to the hotel where he finds (and, as the viewer, we also find) Agnes packing their bags to return to Paris.
She tells him to shave off his growing beard and suggests he also remove his moustache.
It also led me to learn that the Brits were years ahead of Hollywood in the treatment of gay characters in movies, and I now count "Who Killed Sister George?"
He has also planted actors in the house to pose as mental patients so to increase Trevor's mental collapse.
We also get a peek inside the madness within Trevor's mind where we see weird, often homicidal, images.
Seth Green is also great, as he is in every movie he has been in.
Kasten plays not only with the character's minds, but also with ours.
I also like the use of the unreliable narrator...the last 20 minutes is a roller-coaster ride!
It's also about the search of our identity, and how our identity becomes the one of the other in a relashionship with a lover.
A historic view of Washington buildings is also interesting.
I also enjoy the way the story deals with the aspects of the British courier/ secret agent, Alfred Pettibone, of Parlow, Nash, Parlow.
We also saw Hamer play the postman in "Sherlock Holmes and The Scarlet Claw"; and other characters in "Sherlock Holmes Faces Death" ; in "Pursuit to Algiers," and in; "Terror by Night").
The facial expressions also keep you laughing and laughing.
scene was also cut.
i really liked this spoof of Sherlock Holmes,starring Don Knotts and Tim Conway.Knotts is Inpector Winship and Conway is Dr.Tart.Winship is a variation of the Holmes character,but dumber.tart is a variation of Watson,but also dumber.the story is that Winship and Tart are dispatched by Scotland yard to investigate the death of a British aristocrat and his wife.the kicker is,both are American.it's funny seeing two Americans detectives working for Scotland Yard.Winship dresses just like Holmes and Tart dresses just like Watson.both are inept and clueless,and have caused no shortage of chaos and trouble in the states.apparently they are put on the case as punishment or to keep them from trouble,as they are an embarrassment to their superiors.as part of their investigation,they end up at the huge mansion of the aristocrat,questioning the large staff contingent (who are also very quirky),and bumbling from one false clue to the next.from the opening scene slapstick is the order of the day,and there is a lot of it.the characters are so dimwitted and the situations so absurd,it's hard not to laugh out loud frequently.i really had a blast.it's not high art,but it is entertaining.
It also was actually a good whodunit movie even though that was exactly what this movie was trying to spoof to a certain degree.
There are also multiple attempts to use pigeons to send word back to the yard.
Classic slap-stick for those of us who miss the days of real comedic screenplay, and also zero special affects on a mediocre budget makes it all the more real.
I also love Sherlock Holmes so this made this movie a must see for me.
The comedy is also good, clean humor that the entire family can laugh at.
Another great thing is that the movie also is very suspenseful, as you the viewer don't know everything until the private eyes find it out.
There are also two pretty good action sequences that were actually originally filmed for this movie, so it's worth watching even if you have seen all the source material.
Hello,I just wanted to say that I loved the movie,the ending with the duet song was just great,I cried.I love movies like that.I have been trying to find the movie to buy ever since I seen it,please tell me how I can order it.Thank you so much,God Bless.Naomi was just great in the movie and the young lady that sang with her has a great voice,I am surprised that I haven't seen a album out of her.It was as if it could be real life.All the actors and actress were just great.I have also seen Naomi in Touched by an Angel she does so good in movies like this.I cant wait to see more movies like this,thats what we need on TV more family stuff.
Samuel Shephard is also fabulous in his role, and fits the part perfectly.
This is also one of Spacek's best performances.
Sissy Spacek is also perfect as Lorena some years on.
Samuel Shephard is also fabulous in his role, and fits the part perfectly.
And i would also recommend it seeing on a big screen TV.
It also shows its more violent parts in history.
The photography is also excellent, showing some of the wonderful architectural achievements of the early Muslims.
It is also well crafted, with a beautiful cinematography, an excellent narration and a stunning display of art and architecture.
The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians.
Sisko must also decide whether to stay as Commander of Deep Space Nine.
The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians.
Sisko must also decide whether to stay as Commander of Deep Space Nine.
Besides the romance that is brewing between McRaney and Judd, the film also conveys the importance of music in our lives, and does a proper job in expressing its virtues.
The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians.
Sisko must also decide whether to stay as Commander of Deep Space Nine.
Sisko is also - possibly - a prophesied messiah of the people of Bejor: The Emissary.
Almost all of the main characters are also introduced, and at least hints to the most important relationships (Sisko-Kira; Sisko-Odo; Sisko-Kira; Sisko-Quark; Sisko-Jake; Kira-Odo; Odo-Quark and Sisko-Dax) are dropped.
Unlike all of his predecessors, Sisko also has a goofy and even downright awkward side, which is very refreshing after years of the stodgily military Picard and the space cowboy man-ho Kirk.
Not that those things are that radical but the the tri-wheel system did spin and also functioned as paddles int the water.
One of the cool things is to watch two actors Jan-Michael Vincent who of course did Airwolf and George Peppard who was also on TV about the time doing The A-Team both in the movie is awesome.
It also has some needlessly giant scorpions what are spliced into the film in the most obvious possible way.
He also has left 3 women at the altar.
It's also fun to see Jan Michael 'AIRWOLF' with George Peppard "A TEAM" together.
The tornado scene is also cool.
The posse quickly loses a member but also pick up a woman and a kid during, and each time they make a stop there's a different menace to face.
As others have also alluded to, one of the most anticlimactic endings ever.
Speaking of the sky, the film also does a commendable job of recreating the bizarre, scary, and vengeful weather depicted in the book.
The truck is also pretty cool, though the stretchy material connecting the two halves looks comically flimsy in the harsh environments the truck rides through.
The movie also has that post-war wholesomeness that's hard to describe.
I would have liked to see more interaction between Peter Pan and Captain Hook, and also more screen time for the Captain Hook character generally.
The direction is fantastic, classic Spielberg, it also brings in his taste in comedy and juvenile essence.
But my children also really enjoyed this movie-they found it funny and never found it boring.
Spielberg got some great performances out of his cast which also includes Julia Roberts as the elfin Tinkerbell and Maggie Smith as the aged Wendy.
There have also been many complaints about the scene where Tink becomes human-size and expresses some kind of love for Peter.
One thing that confused me was how this movie was overlooked because it's such a terrific movie, the only thing I could assume is that during this time Batman Forever was also being released and this was animated so just disregarded sadly.
It was also great to have our beloved Joker in the mix of the story, how could we not include him?
The villain is known as the Phantasm in which he makes his appearance in a gray cloak, a blade for a hand, and a silver mask (almost identical to Doctor Doom) in which his weapon is not only hand-to-hand combat, but also uses smoke as a weapon as well for distraction, and that's what he uses to kill off the first two victims in the story; by leading one to crash his car on the street from a garage to crushing a mobster with a headstone at a graveyard (this might not be suitable for young viewers); and yet, both the gangsters and the cops work together to kill Batman and the only person who believes that the caped crusader isn't a murderer is Commissioner Gordon.
The flashback also shows how Bruce Wayne started out as the caped crusader by going through different fights with criminals disturbing the peace.
An unfairly forgotten film, "Mask of the Phantasm" is not only a great animated film Â it is also the best of all the Batman films after Burton's original.
Bruce Wayne is a man who finds himself torn in two: as Batman, he's a fearsome avenger of the night who is always alone and as Bruce Wayne, he's a rich fop and a womanizer who is also always alone.
The story is excellent keeping up with the mystery surrounding the phantasm and also telling Bruce Wayne's back-story, how he discovered the bat cave, bat car and what drove on his hunger for revenge.
This was the first Batman cartoon I have seen I first seen it when i was about 5 years old and this is how i got the cartoon batman also staring Kevin Conroy as batman and mark hamill as The Joker.
It also didn't seem like a very big challenge for batman either.
Joker was also the only villain we know in this movie.
Unfortunately, he also finds out that she is this mysterious dark man, The Phantasm.
Here the Joker has also an important place on the flashbacks, he is one of those that the Phantasm is looking for.
He is also another aspect to think by watching this, "this one is actually something very special".
It is also very mature and very graphic at times, plus twisted as heck.
The voice acting is also fantastic.
Oddly enough it was intended as the series finale, but thankfully it wasn't as later on in that decade we were treated to another series which was also great.
This is also one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.
Meanwhile the love of Batman's alter ego comes back in his life and the two rekindle their broken romance so the dark knight has to balance his love life and also find out who's responsible for all the murders and clear his name, because when you walk around in a cape and mask you need all the good PR that you can get.
And then there's also Andrea's father, who... OK, not much to try and spoil here, lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved, and everything jets into a 'laughing matter'.
But also, aside from the slightly darker impulses, Mask of the Phantasm is a lot of fun, even up to a point if you didn't watch the series much.
The Joker is also involved in this movie and is very entertaining to watch.
A dark story, darker than in Batman Returns, but also an excellent portrayal of Batman.
The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.
The bickering between agencies all point to missing out on the bigger picture on one hand, while on the other the need for confidentiality also brings up operational sensitivity in order not to jeopardize any current missions, and this need to know service also stems from being overly cautious of any internal moles that would betray efforts in progress.
The screenplay from this movie has unsuspected levels of intellectual and emotional provocation.Screenwriters Jeffrey Nachmanoff (who is also the director from this movie) and Steve Martin (the famous comedian) refuse to bring us easy answers about the ideological conflicts, and they portrait a discouraging vision of international politic, where concepts like "loyalty" and "treason" are neither good or bad, but only useful tools for manipulating opinions, public perception or legislation.
But, besides of all the ideological background from this film, Traitor work perfectly as an ambiguous and incredibly tense thriller, which has perfectly developed characters who occupy their ambiguous positions without revealing their clear porpoises, provoking a delicious suspense on the spectator, at the same time it is difficult to know where the story will take us.Nachmanoff's direction is sober, something which works very well on the context from this movie.The performances are excellent, not only the one from the great Don Cheadle, but also the ones from the supporting cast, where the members who mostly stand out are SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui as a terrorist and Jeff Daniels as a security contractor, which is a role where this underrated actor shows his wide range, which goes more far away than the family films where we usually see him.The only fail I found on this movie is that the ending could have been a little more polished.But, in spite of that, I recommend Traitor with a lot of enthusiasm, because it is an excellent movie which does not only entertain very much, but which also leaves the spectator thinking.
When she recalls an old sweetheart from childhood days, Johnny, who is now a fireman (also played by Cornel Wilde), she realizes he's the one for her but there are many tangled threads to set aright.
Since it is pretty much the truth, but the film shows that not every people that believe in Allah are bad people and even the revealing of Samir's past shows this, who is also a firm believer in Allah.
The greatest line of the film, perhaps the morale of the story, I think, comes at the very end: "The Qur'an says that if you kill an innocent person it's as if you've killed all mankind", but "it also says that if you save a life it's like you've saved all mankind".
Cheadle has infiltrated these terrorists, lead by SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui, who also played a terrorist earlier in 2008 in Vantage Point, so deeply he's afraid that he'll have carried out attacks against the U.S. before Daniels gets what he wants.
SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui as Omar was also excellent, as was Pearce.
Did you also know America is a racist country?
Overall, I recommend the movie, but also feel there are a lot of other films in the theater now that should be seen first.
There is also a rewarding understated performance by Neal McDonough as the assistant FBI agent.
Then he also manages to shoot the two terrorist masterminds without any bodyguards being present (Note that the main boss, Nathir, again is no scary Mohammed Atta-typeÂbut rather an ordinary businessman).
The beautiful Archie Panjabi shows up all too briefly as the girlfriend of Cheadle's character and is provided with little back story, as is also the case with most of the other players.
To sum up traitor is 2 hours of fast flowing predictable fair that is hard to criticise but is also difficult heap praise on.
The direction and photography also is top-notch.
The limited information presented about Cheadle's past also leaves just enough for the imagination to wonder.
It was also refreshing to see Hollywood recognizing the breadth of Muslim philosophy for once!
(This may be also partly due to his paranoia of being followed by spooks)
It also showed that French winemakers may have been resting on their laurels, and had not reevaluated how they had been producing wine.
This disc, due to the negligence of a law clerk, then falls into the hands of two fitness trainers (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of whom is also sleeping with the adulterous federal agent.
Actually this shouldn't come as a great surprise since he was equally hilarious as Mickey in Snatch and also as Jeffrey in Twelve Monkeys but this time he's funny in a completely different way.
In the end, I was also not happy about how the actual competition was portrayed.
I have never felt healthier than after 96 minutes of explosive and grateful laughter at the "Burn" screening, also marveling at the array of British-stage caliber acting from "Fargo"-invoking Frances McDormand, witchy-icy Tilda Swinton, a more-manic-than-ever John Malkovich, and a dozen major players, such as J.K. Simmons as the deadpan CIA boss and Richard Jenkins as the former Greek Orthodox priest, now running an upscale gym.
George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance.
The writers of Fax Bahr and Adam Small besides doing this movie and Jamie Kennedy's show, have also done "Mad TV", a comedy show.
I also liked some of the familiar faces I saw, like Anthony Anderson who plays an actor in this film and Kal Penn(the arab guy from National Lampoon's Van Wilder) as another homie g... they really helped make this movie worth watching.
To shock you further, I'm also in my mid-twenties.
One aspect of this movie that I found brilliant was the way the writers also incorporated the opposite situation of blacks "acting white."
kal pen also pops up in the film as a crazy arab American student.
ryan oneil also features as b-rads father and i was shocked at how this normally serious dude takes to the comedy.
In fact, so close is the analogy to "Terminator", that the "Annihilator" also stars Earl Boen (whom played Dr Silberman in both movies!)
he also terminated the other android by shooting her in the face with a shotgun and knocking some 10 feet to the floor and in the process knocking one of her red eyes right out of her head.
We also have Doug McClure trying to get back into Tina Louise's pants, Billy Crystal playing a rather fey steward, John Delancie in training for his future role as Q, and Peter Graves as one half of a former May-December romance.
Did I mention that there also happens to be a plot line about the airplane carrying the Senegal flu, which is now spreading among the crew?
She is also unaware the plane was "delayed and missing".
It should also be noted that leading man Mark Lindsay Chapman, then going under the name Mark Lindsay, was given this role as compensation after being cast as John Lennon in a TV biopic, only to be removed when his real name was discovered to be the same as Lennon's killer.
A great sci-fi film and a good cast and music from David Bowie excellent special effects make this film a must to view and have myself seen over 50 times at least surely this must be released on DVD likewise night of the comet also starring catherine mary stewart and is equally a great film.it seems that the best cult classics are always the last to appear on DVD.
An excellent soundtrack also help this movie along even though its not needed.
There is also a scene where the entire family must defend there lives in an exaggerated smoothie malfunction scene.
I also found out that LaVar Burton directed this film.
Yet one of her sisters also turns good.
It has great animation and music and also I thought the voice casting was very good; Tress McNeille was great as Anastasia and Jennifer Hale as Cinderella.
The plot is interesting, and it's also very funny, I was laughing really hard on some of the scenes.
There was also entirely too much time dedicated to the prince and his father who are both, frankly, completely uninteresting characters.
The movie also creates an entire subplot about another character that was left completely unresovled save for a brief glimpse of a picture of what may happen to her, and the end credits put over snapshots of the happy couple seemed entirely too smarmy for a movie that's supposed to be "Happily Ever After THE END".
My only disappointment is that they axed the other mouse characters besides Jaq and Gus an Bruno is also missing.
After the success of the hilarious Lion King 1 1/2, the third Little Mermaid (Ariel's Beginning) definitely made par - Cinderella III: A Twist in Time also lives up to the standard set by both it's predecessor and what we've come to expect from Disney sequels.
Cinderella III: A Twist in Time recaptures not only the drama of the Grimm fairytale, but also the magic of Disney hand-drawn animation, an art form that has been lost in the flashiness of CGI.
Cindy also ends up having to be kind of tough, escape danger, protect Anastasia from a spell aimed at her by her own mother, and foil the diabolical plans of Lady Tremaine involving Anastasia as a 'Twinderella.'
Both the original storyline and all the cool action scenes fell into some of the movie's gaping plot holes somewhere in the process of production, and Clancy's interesting and intelligent characters were also conspicuously missing.
Though watching and dealing with Cinderella's newest problem, you also watch, laugh, and cry with Anastasia.
I loved the twist at the almost end made it more dark.I also love the fact that Cinderella Got the princes love more harder then before not just cause of her looks and everything but cause of more she had to fight for love it was more realistic then a girl going to the ball and thats it.They showed more of the prince too we didn't really know him before and he talked a lot more which made it better.The 2nd movie was horrible made no sense and was not interesting to watch and way off story line.
although when you kids see this and also the first sequel (cinderlla 2 dreams come true) they will learn that something might happen to their magical person and that when you sit around doing nothing you wont get anything near of what you want (ofcoarse friends would also be helpful) also in both sequels Cinderella is much more independent and you learn a lot more about the other characters like the princes mother and the kings past and the stepmother is countless times more evil.
and you also learn that one of the stepsisters want what Cinderella also wants.
also you get a lot more information about the prince except for his name.
Cinderella III also gives the character of the Prince a chance to develop (even though they still don't give him a name!)
One may recall that the step-sisters feet were too big, but also remember that in the Grimm tale the step-sisters cut off their heels and toes to make the slipper fit.
Cinderella also has a pretty stiff design, but under senior animator Ian Harrowell's supervision she is allowed to be expressive and give a performance that can match with Jennifer Hale's vocals.
meryl streep does her 'bad girl' thing here, the character you can also spot from 'marvin's daughters' and shows once again that her character definitions are well crafted and practiced but unimaginative.
It's a fascinating case about the ethics of corporate power, and also about one person's noble attempt to expose and improve a corrupt system.
The script was also very straight forward, carrying the viewer from one situation to the next without having to work out where things were at that point in time.
Fred Ward and Craig T Nelson also lend some good support to the leads.
It works as a small town drama, a character study, and also has elements of suspense.
She also has good scenes with Kurt Russell (as her boyfriend) and Cher (as her lesbian housemate).
Along with the obligatory Streep nomination (she lost to Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment), Cher also received her first nomination.
The story of Karen Silkwood, who found herself investigating alleged wrongdoing at the plutonium plant where she worked, is dramatized very sensitively, and also very objectively.
Streep managed to show us the witty side of Karen, but also managed to show us her strong and kind side as well.
The research pulled off, and they managed to make us believe Kurt, Meryl and Cher are also Drew, Karen and Dolly.
When I first saw the film, I was very upset but also intrigued.
Although Karen's safety campaign has the support of her trade union's national leadership, she antagonises not only the management of the plant but also many of her fellow-workers, who value job security more than personal safety.
'Erin Brockovich', with its upbeat ending, is more optimistic; it is also, in my view, the better film as its director Steven Soderbergh is able to hold our interest throughout, whereas 'Silkwood' can drag at times.
There are also excellent contributions from Kurt Russell as Karen's boyfriend Drew and from Cher, cast against type as Dolly, the dowdy lesbian who befriends Karen.
It just cuts to this scene, and we the viewer learn along with Kurt that she's been unfaithful - which also reveals a little more about this person Karen Silkwood.
This is not only my favorite game for the SNES, but is also my favorite video game of all time.
Aside from the perfect graphics, music (despite low-quality samples), gameplay, controls and the terrific, gigantic and ingenious level layouts, Super Metroid was also a thrilling video game experience like very few others.
The music is also excellent (who can forget the chilling voices in the second, final section of Norfair?).
Not only does this game mix great gaming with great music, it also adds in puzzles, freaky enemies, and unique sound effects that all add to the gameplay, allowing you to immerse yourself in the world of planet Zebes.
It was also about an empire which ran over indigenous people, a practice which continues into the present time.
I also thought that Scott Bakula did a really wonderful job, as always.
Paul Sand is also quite good as Fred Dutcher, Dick Butkus' sidekick.
What Hammer didn't know at the time is that not only Holloway was interested in finding the long lost, or hidden, Venacci Jewels but a gang of murderous jewels thieves lead by Frenchman LaRoche, Peter Mamakos, were also looking for them!
I liked how the movie wove together the tarot readings and the different owners of the red violin and I also liked how it was all again brought together at the auction.
A very good film- I also enjoyed the directors other work abou Gould- he has a knack for typing music and stories together.
The present day story allows us to look back on it's life, but also gives us an opportunity to realize it's value, from the eyes of expert 'Charles Morritz', played by Samuel L. Jackson.
An appreciation of violin music also developed in me as the movie continued, as well as that of violin players and the history of the instrument.
As some of the viewers have commented, I also am appalled that "The Red Violin" did not receive an Oscar nomination for best picture/best producer/best director.
I could still use my computer as a word processor or play computer games etc the world wouldn't suddenly revert to the stone age because the internet failed   There's also several other blunders which led me to believe that the writers are nowhere near as being smart as their audience .
We're also told to believe that some real hot internet systems can't be traced because they don't use cookies !
There's also a ridiculous aspect to the team known as " Netforce " .
But instead of staying with the auction all the time, we flash back to the creation of the violin in 17th century Italy and then follow it as it makes its way through an 18th century Austrian monastery/orphanage, a violinist in 19th century Oxford and China during Mao's Cultural Revolution... Each time it brings the person who owns it a lot of fame, but also bad luck and despair, often resulting in the death of the owner or someone the owner really loves...  What I appreciated in this movie is that it wasn't just an ordinary drama or thriller.
Another thing that I also really liked was the fact that not every detail of the movie was clear until the end (for instance why the fortune teller's predictions come true, but not for the woman, but for the violin instead.).
In 1982 they also had an investment in the movie Buddies.
My parents also have paper write ups about the movie.I wish that it could be played on TV again because it was such a great film.
For me, the attraction of the film was two-fold; primarily for the adventure, fun and humour, but also for the factual elements surrounding the sometimes profitable art of fossicking.
It is tragic, but also sweet and so well put together that it is absorbing and eminently watchable.
The main character often talks directly to the audience, which gets sort of irritating and there's also this villain that runs around, who also becomes annoying.
"The Movie Hero" is hilarious, for one, and also really makes you think about your laughter.
Blake also discovers the lovely, perfectly imperfect woman who must surely be his "love interest" -- and who is, naturally, already attached.
He also has chemistry galore with Dina Meyer, who's pretty and smart and whom we want to be happy, just like our hero.
The rest of the cast is also terrific.
The always-interesting Peter Stormare is creepy, yes, but it's also apparent he's having a great time, so he's never really threatening.
Blake, THE MAIN CHARACTER/HERO shimmers with an aura of innocence and sweetness, yet also comes across as extremely intelligent, eloquent, clever.
Peter Stormare is very funny but also menacing, so he makes a perfect Suspicious Character.
An added bonus...The Movie Hero is also a unique lesson in film-making.
I also loved Brian White as "The Side Kick."
There is also an extra movie about the Jimi Hendrix performance which I haven't seen yet,but surely will in the future.
Although the music is the best part of the movie,the scenes between the songs and sometimes during the songs(brilliantly done)are also of very high and entertaining quality.The "port-o-san-man" scene is quite hilarious and the "rain" scenes show the interaction between the visitors.Not to mention the shots of the village people,the people who live in the village close to the festival.Some are delighted by the festival and some are really p***ed off,watch the sceneof the old "conservative" man working on his car and the debate between the villagers on whether the festival is good or not good for America,this also shows you the big split of views of the american people in those days which now also reflects on the present debate of a war.
Not every artist or legendary event is shown in this documentary,artists like Joni Mitchell and the Band are not included which I personaly would have enjoyed.And the forgotten "Abbie Hoffman incident" is also not included.I have this incident on CD,the Who box set,but I would have liked it when I had on DVD also.But then,You can't have everything!Also some songs and artists are kind of misplaced.Best example for me is the performance of Sha-Na-Na doing "At the Hop".This Rock 'n Roll song doesn't quite belong on this festival,but still it is a funny sort of intermezzo.
Woodstock is to me the best music/documentary and maybe even best movie ever made.It not only shows great music of great artists but it also shows a generation of Americans who did not want to go with the flow of the American government,especially in their war in Vietnam.Sadly enough,Woodstock 1969 was also the beginning of the end for the hippy-culture which is also beautifully put on film in the other 1969 classic:"Easy Rider".
To be honest, I was really "watching" it, mainly just listening to it while working, because of the good music shows, but also because I did not realise the original cut was only 3 hours and four minutes, this director's cut version I saw was an extra 48 minutes of footage.
Crosby stills and Nash were also great, along with canned heat.
This film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound and should have won that too.
i wanted to like this movie,and i really tied.but in the end,i just couldn't justify it.it's billed as a comedy,except it's not funny.or even amusing.i will say that the two lead actors,Daryl Hannah and Dudley Moore are appealing,as are their characters.but the movie is just too slow and talky for my tastes.and there's also too much swearing for no good reason.it doesn't add anything to the movie,and it doesn't really have any relevance.the movie has an ensemble cast of well knowns from the time period(in this case,1990),but they can't save this movie.it's not quite horrible,but it certainly isn't very good,either.for me,Crazy people is a 3.5/10
Mind you, I also play on-line with friends every Monday night.
I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long.
The soundtrack is also amazing and a must-buy.
also tried to keep the fight scenes realistic, often doing the fight choreography as well.
He also wrote, directed, and produced it, so all the blame falls squarely on his shoulders.
Jane Hall also gave a very good performance.
It is also here that things go awry.
Like him; she has also been committed for some reason.
He was also a yank.
But somehow they managed to deliver laughs throughout AND also develop some very interesting characters and an engaging story with some super cool dance moves & super cute girls (not to mention 1 boy who's such an amazing dancer it'll make you want to try a backflip or two).
There was also quite a bit of ad-libbing.
The characters of Mr Jonothan and Miss Elizabeth are also complete contrasts - one is nurturing, the other a harsh task master.
Miss Elizabeth also has the best cat's bum face I've ever seen.
His boss does this also, once.
The atmosphere created is great, the building that the plot is set in is pretty creepy, the actors do a great job and the back story of the main character coming out of jail also gave it a different and dramatic edge.
However, the cast of characters in this movie also aid in helping with the laugh's.
I'm also really enjoying Andrew McCarthy's character, Joe!
He's a billionaire that can be very romantic, but he also has issues.
I also liked season 1 but it wasn't as good as sex and the city.
Really funny, but also real problems en great lovestories....just GREAT!
Oh Lindseys man, he is also in this difficult situation.
the casting Couldn't be better..... (again except Brookes husband which every time i see him somehow, i feel he is overacting the role.. but it might also be that i hate whiny men/roles and this is maybe the point in his role)  so many feelings... it would be TOTALLY be a shame to cut the show.
I also love Brooke Sheilds.
I really enjoyed watching Sex in the City and I also like Desperate Housewives from time to time.
But I also like the glamour-factor, which Desperate Housewives lacks completely and in Sex and the City Miranda wasn't very glamorous and Samantha.. well, was unique, but no one I would see as a role model in certain ways.
I also absolutely adore the jewellery they're wearing.
The supporting cast are also very engaging, being far more than just a backdrop to Moore and Hannah.
And while I'm at it- My Own Worst Enemy is also VERY worth saving- already great and with lots of potential for future story line twists...
I also noticed that several times they left a door open at night and a light was seen, Other than these two items, I must praise all involved with Foyle's for making not only a first class murder mystery but such interesting background into the war.I read somewhere that they hopes the show would go on till at V Day.
I love this show, not only for it's good and cozy criminal stories, but also for the new perspective of a criminal story; during war and is actually being affected by it.
But, it also usually involves either the aristocracy or military or both, as the ultimate culprit.
The main advantage of this series is that it not only gives us a vivid description of life in Britain during World War 2 but also adds all the ingredients that are inherent to good detective stories.
The film itself is also a little more exciting because it deals not just with a family of fishermen like the other film, but a family that illegally uses homemade dynamite to fish!!
No, I actually love movies such as UMBERTO D, MIRACLE IN MILAN and THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US (all by Vittorio De Sica)--it's just that there are also a couple truly awful and amateurishly made Neo-realist films as well that I really hate--and apart from STOMBOLI, LA TERRA TREMA is probably the most boring and unwatchable Neo-realist film I have seen.
Then my wife latched onto "Foyle's War" and we've become big, big fans of this series also.
Foyle also recruits a disabled war veteran and former police detective Paul Milner from his hospital bed as his Sergeant.
The series puts considerable emphasis on a number of social issues of the time and also paints a very evocative portrait of England during the war.
The stories are also often good.
I also like the characters' personalities.
He is a father not only to his son, Andrew, an RAF pilot, but also to Sam and Milner and to any number of characters in the various episodes, including his goddaughter in the last (final?)
Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!
James Bell underplays his pivotal role as the museum curator/animal expert (which is similar to the brief doctor part he essayed in I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE [1943]); also fine is Abner Biberman as the owner of the escaped leopard, who blacks out during his frequent drinking binges and thinks he may be the murderer.
If not for the men behind the scenes the film would have been lost in the abyss of B films gone and also forgotten.
These delightful economies, however, may have more to do with RKO than Mr. Lewton, since Julia Dean's Victorian chairs may also be spotted in the non Lewton productions, "Beware My Lovely" and "Experiment Perilous."
Lewton aficianados may also be interested in a minor blooper from the "Seventh Victim."
That there's a sensible-sized body count also works, making it seem a lot more fast-paced despite all the talking in-between.
They're also hard to sit through for the fact that nothing interesting goes on in them.
Another creepy scene takes place in a graveyard, and it also climaxes with the young girl's death.
The remaining cast's story is also carried out to the end.
What horror there is comes more from a sense of dread than anything that actually happens; also from the eerie feeling that certain places are unlucky, that some people are bound to die simply because of where they are.
The second involves a young girl who has gone to the graveyard to put flowers on her mother's grave, and also to meet with her lover.
The screenplay this time round makes far better use of the animal at the centre of the film, which allows the impressive creature to make a much bigger impression on the movie, and it also gives the film a unique edge over other horror movies, as there aren't a great deal that can build around a leopard.
It reveals little about the industry itself and yet it also fails to deliver anything more than a superficial glimpse into the world of Anabel Chong.
Of course, stepping in the Guinness book of world records is not exactly enough to create a memorable destiny, and choosing the pornographic field attracts heaps of hungry viewers that cannot exactly be called reputable admirers, and yet...I think movie managed to show us in Annabella a pretty unique and sympathetic character, at the same time excessive, provocative but also sincere and fragile.
This is a well-done documentary, but it is also very disturbing.
Aside from the fact that this documentary displays little technical skill, it also seems to possess no real artistic or narrative INTENT.
The fact that she doesn't care about never having been paid a cent also compounds this.
Aren't you also intrigued ?
The cast is very good in "Prison" and it includes Roy Cheung as the violent warden "Scarface" and Roy can also be found as a triad leader in "School" and a cop in "City on Fire."
"Prison" is composed by Lowell Lo, who has also made the soundtrack for films like "Naked Killer" (Clarence Fok, 1992), "The Killer" (John Woo, 1989) and Ringo's "School on Fire" but the usage of music is never as near as strong in "Prison" as it is in "School" and that is also among the elements that make "School" such a strong experience.
"Prison" has also some very atmospheric photography inside the prison and there are some nice neon lights and almost mysterious lights coming through the windows at some points.
There's also some very bright photography in the interiors and that creates almost a dream like feel to the film, and also depicts the state of mind of the inmates and how things vary from pure danger and alarm to peace and quiet inside the prison.
"Prison" is among the reasons why Hong Kong cinema is so powerful and unique and it is also among the reasons that make Ringo among the most talented directors in the field.
You also meet these two old guys and another guy who is a friend of the father and returning girl.
You also meet a mother and her son.
There was also a bit more street action than I was thinking there would be as I was thinking it would be the tenants holding up in their apartment complex more.
I wouldn't say its any better than say 28 days (or even weeks) later, but its also certainly not worse.
Characters like Clutch(Nick Damici), a former boxer seen often jogging on the streets(also the one his fellow neighbors in the Mulberry St apartment put their trust in), his daughter Casey(Kim Blair), recently returning from a tour in Iraq carrying a facial scar she's self-conscious about, Kay(Bo Corre), a Polish-American single mother who works at a local pub nearby, are just a few the film isolates as the outbreak takes shape.
Clutch is a former boxer who lives in an apartment on Mulberry Street in New York.With his friend Coco they eagerly await for Clutch's daughter Casey to return home from Iraq.We also meet the other tenants in this dilapidated complex Charlie and Frank who are a couple of old timers and a bartender Kay and her teenage son.Unfortunately their place of living becomes hell,when New Yorkers mysteriously turn into bloodthirsty rat creatures.
That's what I also loved about this movie was it had real people who acted like real people in such situations and with outstanding performances by Nick Damici, Kim Blair, Ron Brice, Antone Pagan and Lou Torres.
Great humor portrayed by one of the more flamboyant tenants who also found a great way for defense involving a lighter and an aerosol can.
The fact that a large part of the film follows the tenants of a NY building surrounded by these "rat-beings" makes it also quite claustrophobic.
Despite of budgetary restrictions, "Mulberry Street" also features a satisfying amount of blood and gruesome images.
I also think they could have chosen better music than Crosby, Stills and Nash.
It's also fascinating to see how Jones (what a great actor he is) is also almost consumed by racism in a totally different way, as his persecution starts to make him bitter and angry to all whites (even his young friend) and even to his own family.
The piece is also beautifully photographed, written and directed.
The attention to detail in minor points was also evident.
Groucho Marx and William Bendix play two navy buddies, Benny Linn and Tim Dunnovan, who get a race horse that turns out to have a twin.They try to make a little money with the help of the twin horses.Chester Erskine's comedy A Girl In Every Port from 1952 isn't all that bad of comedy, if you ask me.It has got Groucho Marx in it, who can safe any movie.If course this doesn't reach near the classic stuff he did with his brothers Harpo and Chico, but he still gets to deliver some witty lines that safe a lot of this movie.William Bendix doesn't stay too much behind.He and Groucho make a great team.Marie Wilson plays Jane Sweet, a dumb blonde and isn't at all dumb in her role.Don DeFore does also good job as Bert Sedgwick.This movie may not be a masterpiece, but pretty good anyway.It made my Sunday afternoon a little better.
And like Spike Lee's films, it also has several points to make.
it will also find an audience with people who would rather savage than understand other people, pre-judging them to something like Sartre's No Exit or a Neil Labutte (sp?)
Storytelling is an indictment of repressive suburbia, but it is also an indictment of the postmodern, ironic, and politically correct intellectuals, and how both parts of society control and restrict people from being truly who they are.
It is also about, well, storytelling and how easily stories and plots are manipulated for effect.
It tells the story of a listless and intelligent teenager who lives with an angry and sad family in suburban New Jersey, and also about the documentary that is being made about them.
What is also funny about "Nonfiction," which is supposed to be "real," is that it contains completely fictional and even forced plot points: someone is injured and slips into a coma, someone else is hypnotized and told what to do, and even the final, terrible act seems more to come out of a bad TV movie than real life.
(I also especially enjoyed the not-so-subtle digs at American Beauty and American Movie.)
And when his little brother(highly annoying and egotistic but also very intelligent)hypnotize his father to..love him!
I actually thought it added to the message of the first story, and the uncensored version is also on the DVD anyway.
Not just physically, but also in the way he was criticized for making fun of the characters in his documentary just as Solondz has been criticized for doing the same in "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Happiness."
They say satire is dead if the audience cannot be shocked, but it's also dead if the audience cannot be shamed, in the days where South Park and Family Guy, are on non cable TV any afternoon (l love both shows), shock and shame are concepts so familiar they've lost some of their power.
The professor may be a monster, but he is also very frank.
The second part Nonfiction is also highly self-aware.
While very much spoiled and sheltered, he is also alienated from, and resentful of, his elders.
Nothing is sacred: Jews and the Holocaust also come in for merciless examination.
He also has considerable chemistry with Ronan, who delivers an equally as impressive performance.
Finally Mackenzie Cook also is pretty damned brilliant, once again putting on an American accent that sounds very legitimate.
They leave also instructions for the future generations to return to the surface of the planet in a steel box that should be kept by the mayors through the generations.
SPOILERS AHEAD....I've had this movie for quite some time under the title WhoDunIt and found it under Scarred Alive recently and is also known as Island Of Blood?
The soundtrack is also rousing and fun, the story is intriguing, the script is decent and the acting is very well done.
you have a real gem of a movie here and you are wasting it Âthere may be 'more to a bottle cap than keeping liquid escaping' Âhowever there is also more than selling a movie than the odd random TV spot!
There is much about it to like, for sure, but there are also some flaws that cant be overlooked.
They leave also instructions for the future generations to return the surface of the planet in a steel box that should be kept by the mayors through the generations.
I also love how the filmmakers created an entirely plausible distant future where beauty still thrived despite crumbling infrastructure.
The CG elements are also top-notch, but the practical effects flawlessly immerse the audience in the fantasy world of pipeworks and generators.
But not only the style of acting, also the cutting.
It also proves that the nature of the beast hasn't changed and that HIV/AIDs still isn't really a priority of the U.S. government...at least, not in any beneficial way to those afflicted.
This animated short can be seen on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and also features an optional commentary by Daniel Goldmark.
This also explains why the scenario for Bugs was so odd - to be the tormented instead of the tormentor.
(Actually the numbers aren't bad they just belong in a different film) I know that the numbers are the result of this being one of those "studio" films where everyone in the studio appears partly as part of the story, but also as an advertisement for themselves and what ever movie they are currently promoting.
Cordellini is also very convincing as Hunter's detached and confused daughter, while the rest of the cast remains on a generally satisfactory level.
As a director (and, unfortunately, also as an author) Crichton puts much effort into some details and none at all into others.
An intelligent assassin also wouldn't use a submachine gun in a doctor's office, the Looker weapon wouldn't fit in a standard pistol holster, a sink won't spray water out of the drain when hit by an errant bullet, yada-yada....
on of the things i also read was that people knew the ending to soon.
Tommy also murdered a young girl Chole, Kim Schraner, earlier that evening when she aggressively come on to him by the deserted railroad cars not knowing what kind of monster the shy sweet and good looking Tommy really is.
A couple of months ago, I watched `The Man from Elysian Fields', also a low-budget good movie produced by him.
Andy Garcia is selecting good screenplays for producing and revealing also an excellent producer.
Accompanying the DVD (already in excess of 157 minutes) is a 'making of' feature and a discussion period with not only Ang Lee but also with the stars and production people that is very solid commentary and for once seems pertinent to enhance the enjoyment of the film.
The laser technology to fit clothing is also just starting to be used.
While the Japanese had no problem slaughtering those that opposed them, however they were also human and scared as hell.
Wong Chai Chi also known as Mai Tai Tai begins to develop a relationship with a leading member of the group Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang) but flees the group to Shanghai after she witnesses the group actually murder a Traitor to the nationalistic movement after she was goaded into luring him into a house.
She also continued because her involvement became pivotal to the success of the operation and I believe that she enjoyed her status within the "cell."
I did not like the chronological disruptions also.
I also felt that Ang Lee selected the right actress.
While watching the film I was also drawn into the wonderful world that Lee created.
From a purely artistic standpoint, I thought the photography was also beautiful and the images of the time and place were as good as any I have ever seen.
* These reviewers might also observe a natural disaster and comment on how the buildings were all poorly constructed and the victims too weak to provide sufficient excitement and entertainment.
While mainstream cinema should be, you know, self-sustaining or whatever you want to call it, there's really a lot to this movie that gets lost in subtitling to an extent, but also just in context and culture.
Bravo, Ang Lee, for bringing to the screen such a lustrous tale of Chinese history in which you have also thrown in love scenes which bring to the film an element of cruelty and harshness which are reminiscent of the sexual pleasures of BASIC INSTINCT, but perfectly display the brutal character of Mr. Yee.
I was also moved by those young patriotic students.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not only an idiom, but also meant for the characters and more; Brokeback Mountain is a lost paradise as well; and Lust Caution, for that foreign audience would miss it again, by its Chinese title è²æ we realize æ is also a pun.
It was certainly captivating to watch how this film celebrates Hong Kong's urban identity while also mediating its historical relationship with Shanghai.
Director Ang has also amusingly mixed Chinese sensibilities and Hollywood influences to give Shanghai that dangerously cool, and seductively sexy appeal that does help to raise question of the stake this city faces with the presence of Mr. Yee and Jiazi.
It was also not nearly as slow as some other films (i.e.
The violence in the rape scene should also be addressed.
There were also some lighthearted moments sprinkled throughout the film, which had an excellent score to accompany it.
Though it's also postmodern and the same kind of costumes, the effect is totally different from the images in Wong Kar Wai movies.
While showing the conflict of sense and sensibility, it also pays tribute to a bunch of classics and the master creators which reflect the mind of the roles and are inherited such as "Casablanca," "The Godfather," "Suspicion," "Penny Serenade," "Last Tango in Paris" and "In the Realm of the Senses."
This is not only the best screen adaptation of Chang to date but also a must-see of all time.
They also provide the humor.
Odd-couple Lumiere and Cogsworth make good comic relief, as their rapport is rarely too immature; matronly Mrs. Potts and son Chip are also decently crafted objects (once human, of course).
It is also a dawning, as this is the only villain in any film that I have fallen in love with.
Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip.
The movie also contains lot of humour, mainly thanks to Gaston (the rude, nasty man who wants to marry Belle) and Lefou (Gaston's silly assistant), as well as Lumiere and Cogsworth (two of the Beast's servants, one a candle and the other a clock due to the spell, who often get into fights with each other).
Of course, the animation in the film is also something that deserves praise.
The supporting characters in there also include Philippe the Horse (also voiced by Hal Smith), Gaston's goofy looking sidekick, Lefou (voiced by Jesse Corti), a Wardrobe (voiced by Jo Anne Worley), and Monsieur D'Arque (voiced by Tony Jay).
Beauty and the Beast also features excellent executed animation.
For example: LumiÃ¨re (the candelabra), Cogsworth (a clock), Mrs. Potts (a teapot), Chip (the cute little teacup), Belle, Maurice (Belle's father, who is also an inventor) and Philippe (the horse).
Belle is also classy, charming, carefree, nonconformist, conservative and nice.
All of this makes her an interesting character and, above all, different from the rest of her village's population, who see her as a strange girl because she likes to read and also because she can't stand Gaston (unlike the rest of women) neither the idea of being his "little wife".
The best part of the whole film is the famous ballroom dance sequence, which is wonderful, brilliant and very artistic (the graphics also make it look incredibly close to a live-action ballroom).
I always identified myself with Belle, the girl who does not belong the place where she is lives and also with a big taste of reading lots of books.
(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belle's father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner.
Secondly, it's a classic fairytale that is also quite dark.
This movie also has a bit of nudity in it, funny considering this movie was rated pg.
You also have a cool flash gun that stuns a person for a good while when used.
It also has its rather funny scenes as a couple of those deaths that happen when they are filming those bad commercials are just great.
James Coburn is also very good and they have a nice assortment of attractive girls too.
I was also moved by Belle's strength of self worth and generosity.
She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.
Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken.
The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant?
I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one "Beauty and the Beast" is worth a thousand "Akira"s. And "Shrek"s. And, I'm willing to bet, "Treasure Planet"s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family.
His childhood friend is Frey, who also happens to be his first real love, although she doesn't know exactly how much he loves her--at least not at first.
It's a Colombian movie, and one of the main lines is: It's better to born in Colombia than be dead....Great, it's also very patriot.
It's really a sitcom-structure that turns out pathetic for a two hour fifteen minutes movie, while it also transforms characters in nothing but cartoon like clichÃ©s.
This country sucks in many ways Â that's a fact, just as every country in the world sucks in one or another way (but to be truthful, this country also many great things Â just as every other country) but is it fair to blame it on the country for the fact that a silly immature cartoon like character ends up in jail?
This movie is far apart of the way other directors tell a story about drugs and social problems that are part of the costumbrism and black movie style made in Colombia's cinematography but which is also part of Colombia's reality.
Even though the young leading actors still have a lot to learn the movie has extraordinary supporting actors and also very good film editing and sound editing.
That's a classic and is also very, very good.
We also see several arguments between John, Paul & George.
The interviews are also revealing 'we grew up with them, they belong to us' etc, plus the hilarious 'you don't get much for free these days' makes you realise just how human this band actually was.
This can also be seen in movies like Cream's "Farewell Concert."
It's interesting but it's also boring and pointless.
Of course, I'm sure most Beatles fans are well aware of what went on whilst making this album (Lennon's minimal involvement due to his addictions to heroin and Yoko Ono; McCartney's domination, not only in the songwriting department but also in regards to group leadership; Harrison's disenchantment and Ringo's melancholy boredom) so when watching the film you will not see The Beatles at their best.
Ringo Starr is silent for most of the time, John Lennon is also quiet and George Harrison seems to fuss with Paul when he speaks.
There is also constant, subtle bickering between Paul and George, and at times John.
You can also see others aiding the Beatles with a few songs such as the the anvil clang on Maxwells Silver Hammer.
There are lots of off-key rehearsals in the film, but also a few finished set-pieces, mainly of McCartney songs like 'Two Of Us' and the title track, which is a wonderfully subdued performance by the four.
The last,and best sequence of the film finds them playing what would be the final public performance of the Beatles,live on the roof of Apple Records for the famous (infamous)free,lunch time concert,which would eventually be shut down by the local Police (also featuring Billy Preston on electric piano).
Maybe we should also bear in mind that the film was to be called Get Back as a return to simplicity for the band, and that McCartney originally penned racist lyrics for this sublime song which thankfully weren't incorporated into any of the final versions.
Overall: to a fan, a beautiful and sad account of a unique group of individuals struggling and failing against disintegration; this should also be essential viewing to fans of intelligent pop/rock music who might have sometimes wondered where U2, Bon Jovi, Kings Of Leon et al came from Â so far though, this was the artistic pinnacle.
We see the Beatles do what they do best, be Beatles, play and work out the kinks in classic songs, and also the camaraderie that shows what underneath the image given by the other goofier movies that they were simply incredibly talented musicians.
Of course there's a sadness and elegiac sensation for fans in watching this "posthumous" film and it's also fair to say the music isn't always top-drawer Beatles - only McCartney brings his best work to the party, although John and especially George would recover their chops in time for "Abbey Road".
It was also inspired of Lindsay-Hogg to intersperse the general public's comments before the group brings the "audition" to a close.
The movie will also show you how they were playing some of their oldies as a warm up songs before starting with another take of their newer songs.
There also is an element of the renegade in this coming out party, with John at last showing the liveliness for which he was famous as the group rather audaciously decides to wake the old town up.
They acted also as avant-gardÃ¨ multi-media artists.
Not only they helped improving the pop music marketing with their innovative LP packages and stuff but also created new kind of media that would become a mania in the XXI century: the reality show.
Although John Lennon seems to be distracted by his future wife presence, Yoko Ono, he also looks to be happy playing and having fun - even dancing around to the sound of I Me Mine, sung by George.
By the way, George Harrison the most "unhappy" character also appears on the film having a ball singing rock and roll tunes.
Well I liked this picture and the three others that were with me also liked it too.
Puck not only didn't agree with this method, but it also opened his eyes to the truth of Anarchy, and thats why in the end Puck just left the scene.
(Yes, I still have a copy of it on beta format) It is also kind of prophetic since the advancements in computer animation.
There is also a "looker" gun that sends out a light pulse that causes the victim to "freeze" and loose chunks of time.
Besides being really funny, it also has its sobering and touching moments.
i think that this movie should be shown at schools but of course an edited version this movie showed me that you must help out friends and that you should be careful on who you let in to your life also you should also keep your eyes open on problems to stop them before they become worse.
this movie also gave a good idea for and hitchhikers./////.
But it also makes fun of Republicans and cops and everyone else who comes onto the screem.
it also tells a unlikely story of how a peaceful group turned rouge.
I also felt a familiarity with 25th Hour and this film.
The cast also includes the great John Saxon, and Barry Sullivan in the role of a Mafia-boss called "Comandante".
The score by Franco Micalizzi, who also delivered the score to "Roma A Mano Armata", is once again very good, and the camera work is fast-paced and great.
John Saxon gets to join in the fun also, and there's also a place for fellow American actor Barry Sullivan, in the role of the villain.
But he's also a man of conscience, and he'll reveal himself as having more lucid thoughts on a subject than one would ever expect of a Tucker or even Anderson Cooper or other.
I liked it post 9-11 when he "took on" the charities for their failure to give much of the donations to the needy in a timely manner; I am disgusted that he hasn't lived up to his promise to denounce this administration when weapons of mass destruction have not been found in Iraq; and also find it revolting and channel changing that he repeats and glorifies distortion and other fascist propaganda.
Their powerful acting not only supports the screenplay, also strengthens the acting of the amateur players.
The courtroom ending scene also establishes the formula for a bunch of "mistaken identity" plot movies that follow.
Watching this sequel of THE SHEIK I keep seeing everything that had already been recycled in the Broadway operetta DESERT SONG - also filmed as an early talkie, shortly after SONG OF THE SHEIK.
Valentino's characterizations are startlingly well-crafted; no doubt, many original film goers missed the nuances present in the younger Ahmed, and would not have even guessed, unless alerted, Valentino was also portraying the older Sheik.
In this case, the male lead is actually the son of the original sheik, but Valentino also plays, just as engagingly, the father who is now middle aged, wiser (this is essentially the adviser role Adolphe Menjou had in the original movie) but still commanding and able to wield a sword.
The film also departs from the original in the frank comic relief it provides in the form of a nasty but amusing little mountebank who seems to get on the good and bad characters' nerves in equal measure.
The film also has plenty of the rougher, even perverse sexuality that in one form or another is present in nearly all of Valentino's films (even "The Eagle," the closest to a family picture Valentino ever made, has that brief scene with the hero flourishing a whip before the frightened female lead).
The beautiful Vilma Banky dances magnificently well, shows a great chemistry with Rudolph Valentino and has also a great interpretation.
There was this film and also an album to fill in with cards related to the film.
What also is a mystery is why a Viking would go to the UK and serve Arthur.
Oh well, it's no worse than a film I saw years ago where a Saracen (who were from the Middle East) was also in Arthur's court!
Here, he plays a Viking and in "Broken Lance" (also 1954), they cast him as a macho cattle rancher!!
I am a big fan of the fifties, because it is the decade in which I started watching movies, but I am also aware that relatively low budgets and heavy handed censorship made even the best fifties films somewhat dubious -- e.g.
PRINCE VALIANT, which also has had the subtitle, "In The Days of King Arthur", prospered from the very start.
He also had done illustration for the Black & White Daily Newspaper comic strip adventures of Edgar Rice Borroughs' TARZAN OF THE APES.
But it is also slick and polished at the same time and nothing sort of fall into your eyes as irregular, it's just the feeling that this isn't how it would be looking in real life.
You get a few thrills from the action scenes and after watching it I felt like I hadn't wasted a good hour and a half, but then again I could have found something else to do also without loosing a good nights sleep over missing this film.
The editing is also terrible, with places where you feel like saying yourself "ok, you can cut now, the moment is over, cut already."
It is no wonder this is as cheesy as it gets, but the Academy of Cinema also has its bad students.
You'll also notice that his company does the digital effects.
y'know with your basic skinny dippers, shark eats through boat and swallows men, and also eventually gets blown up.
Everything in this movie is fake, from the oil rig, to the snow, to the helicopter and and even the boat at the end (which does look like the kind of boats kids push in the city lake near where I live) and also obviously the shark using the worst possible computer generated effects.
There is also one of the scariest, meanest mobsters ever portrayed.
Someone who has majored in American dramaturgy, or at least has read or seen over the years a large number of American plays, will correct me on this, but I believe that Saroyan's dramaturgy, like O'Neill's, switches on atmosphere and melody, beyond words, on an inner pace accessible to the intuition; with O'Neill there is, of course, so much more, he was ampler, more ambitious (--like, in Europe, in the same epoch, in cinema, the French poetic realism, which had this side of atmosphere and melody but also the cinematographic brio, etc.--), but Saroyan develops one side of this American theater.
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE stylizes the conventions of popular realism, moreover, being a play, its realism can not but be that of a play, that of a theater, which is, a highly artificial product; a likable and interesting movie, atmospheric, with an inner melody and pace, often comic, also of a certain sentimentality and selfÂawareness, its unsubtle style has charm and appeal.
Artistically, J. Cagney was only the tip of the clan iceberg; he had a brother and a cute sister also in the movies.
I also watched this film because I'm fascinated with Jeanne Cagney and how much she looked like her brother.
As was pointed out in another comment on this board, O'Neill's THE ICEMAN COMETH also is set in a bar.
The central figure in the play, Joe (or Joseph T.) is also colorful - he seems to be a former newspaperman who was successful, but began to regret getting involved in the awful world of the news - he has retreated to the bar where he'll hopefully find more gentle people.
There is also an interesting change in the conclusion (as in Saroyan's play itself) as to what happens to Blick.
There is also a sense of abruptness to the film; the abrupt ending reflects how quickly the fly's genes fused with Brundle's body.
It might also be leftfield, allegorical support for euthanasia, but I'm more inclined to believe that the ending resulted from the necessity of a tidy narrative than it did from Cronenberg's desire to include an encrypted message.
The Fly works on the level of symbolism, but it's also an enjoyable and frightening horror film.
It's got the gore and the scares, but it's also intelligent.
The Fly is a brilliant commercial horror movie inasmuch as it manages to stay true to the director's vision, while also delivering what audiences expect from a scary movie.
It's also wonderfully shot and acted (Jeff Goldblum already looked like an insect; Cronenberg got him to act like one as well).
With The Fly Cronenberg also achieved something few directors could--he made a remake better than the original.
But I believe that Jeff Goldblum deserved one also.
The unique way of storytelling is probably also the reason why this movie feels so realistic to watch.
Of course the dialog is also perfectly delivered by the fine cast.
Geena Davis in this movie also shows that she is a very talented actress.
John Getz also plays a great role.
It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time, even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion.
Cronenberg had already before this film succeeded in combining creepy biological horror with various social and/or political commentary, but here he also gives us the added aspect of a tragic love story.
Les Carlson, previously seen in "Videodrome" as that movie's villain, has a small role, and Cronenberg himself also appears briefly as a gynecologist.
In addition to losing his looks, bits of his body, his ability to digest, and eventually his mind, Brundle also has to cope with the possibility of losing girlfriend Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who is pregnant with his child.
The film also benefits immensely from stunning creature and gore effects courtesy of make-up artist Chris Walas (who created the memorable creatures from Gremlins); these ensure that The Fly is as nauseating as it is heart-breakingly tragic.
We also get to see undoubtedly Jeff Goldblum's best performance playing Seth Brundle in not a too dissimilar way that Tom Baker played The Doctor in DOCTOR WHO though it's fairly obvious that when Brundle does gymnastics it's a body double since the camera never focuses on Brundle's face .
The supporting cast also play their parts as if they're in a serious film , especially Geena Davis which makes THE FLY an even more involving experience .
We notice also that his face is starting too look a little bit more rough, he's only eating sweets, and now has amazing strength.
John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, "Stathis Borans."
Flynn also turns out, not surprisingly when one thinks about it, to be a physical comedian on par with (I sh*t you not) Cary Grant.
It also led to Lee's interesting suggestion to turn the elderly Rockefeller into a "lovable old codger" by giving dimes away as gifts or tips to strangers.
He also uses Knowles' newspaper to print anti-Connolly articles (which threatens Knowels' romance with de Haviland.
A rare gem also, in that the film is practically unmentioned now.
And is there an evil spirit at work also?
She also uttered my favourite line from all of the Falcon films Â "My father lived at this inn while he was alive" Â wonderful stuff!
Horror movies from the '40's were often movies that were slow in its build up and also most often picked a realistic approach, with its unlikely subjects.
It also often implied more than it actually showed on the screen.
Of course the movie is also being uplifted by the fact that it has Boris Karloff in the main lead.
Who knows, maybe otherwise he would had been respected more for his talents, had he starred also in some acclaimed drama's and such.
Also there is a plague that causes a quarantine of the house the General and Davis are staying in which also houses a man named Albrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), an army physician named Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch), a married couple (Alan Napier and Katherine Emery), a superstitious woman named Madame Kyra (Helene Thimig), and a beautiful young woman named Thea (Ellen Drew) who takes care of the invalid named Mary St. Aubyn played by Ms. Emery.
Everyone else here also provide their own moments.
He also shows himself to be very superstitious, believing in some old Greek werewolf stories.
It also has more on screen violence than most Lewton films but it still manages to play with the audience's emotions and imagination.
The film also takes care to throw in a favorite Poe element - premature burial - for good measure; of course, this added flourish pays off in spades in the form of a terrific - and quite unsettling - finale.
Besides, the deliberate pace does allow for well-rounded characterizations (in all the major parts): especially interesting is the relationship between the Greeks (Karloff and the sinister Helene Thimig allowing superstition to get the better of them, thus distrusting and ultimately threatening innocent Ellen Drew), and also that between paganism (as represented by Jason Robards Sr., who lights a pyre to appease the old gods so that they ward off the plague) vs. science (as represented by Ernst Deutsch, who eventually succumbs to the disease himself).
After the army doctor dies, he becomes superstitious along the lines of an old woman who is also on the island.
Because of its literate script and interesting character development, Isle of the Dead may also appeal to others who don't usually like horror.
He's also very protective in his nature -- especially of the men who he commands.
This somewhat sinister painting was also the inspiration for Sergey Rachmaninoff's celebrated symphonic poem, ÂThe Isle of the Dead' (1909).
The most stupid scene is the romantic one, the girl go for some insulin and brings also the cello, the score for piano and cello and also the music stand!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The supporting cast did well, also.
You know she's bad but she's also irresistible.
As a kept girl with ten percent rebate on pedicure expense, though she is cunning in some scenes , but she is also deadly frightened.
I also liked how it shows the increasing interest in girls' sports.
The movie was a feel-good movie that could be used to motivate young girls to pursue their talents in competitive sports; it could also be used to teach young boys that girls too work hard and long to achieve their dreams and need recognition too.
It also teaches how important it is to get over jealousy and to make sacrifices.
And i liked it even more, because i had meet up with the same type of girls when i was in the basketball team, and i also got my ankle injured because of the same reason, trying so hard to be in the front, but thats what happens when you get that attitude.
But this film proves that you can get away with anything if you have lovable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (see also Ocean's 11).
Gable's behaviour before his execution is so over-the-top Subiraxian that it easily matches and rivals Cagney's behaviour in the similarly-premised "Angels With Dirty Faces" where Cagney also acts as if the electric chair is just a harmless Toys'R'Us plaything!
The movie also suffers from having Clark Gable, Merna Loy and William Powell in a romantic triangle.
This predictability and consistency make this a very, very good film but also, unfortunately, keep it from getting a really high score because there isn't a whole lot new about the film as well.
All others will still probably enjoy it, but might also find the plot elements a bit hard to believe.
Clark Gable and William Powell are boyhood friends who end up on opposite sides of the law in "Manhattan Melodrama," also starring Myrna Loy.
The floating head is the funniest thing I've ever seen, also how the kid holds from the beard and then flies to far away in the floating head... the cheap steroids are amazing, i definitely recommend this part if you want to laugh really really hard, if you smoke weed, you must watch this with all your friends and have an amazing time.

These are thoughts I also remember having in 1987.
Reading here in IMDb I discovered that it was based in a book, but sadly I never read it, and I also discovered that the famous music played in the movie that get stuck in your head ,is called "Mio, Min Mio".
I loved the music also.
The production values were excellent, also.
It is an examination of the psychology of obsessive love, and also fate, or at least, of fateful decisions.
Not only people appreciate his films but are also able to associate themselves with them.
I watch "Fire Sale" at least 3-4 times a year and each time it gets better, very similar to "Where's Poppa", which also demands multiple viewings.
I also felt the ending was a bit anti-climactic, and certain parts of the film felt kind of dull and redundant.
The movie also highlights a key fact about female psychology: nice guys come in last.
All the preoccupations that manifest in his other work are here: The mute, inexpressive protagonist, the seeming obsession with prostitution and the degradation of women in general, and also the director's tendency to eventually lead his characters into an incomprehensible fantasy world.
This is also about a generally violent man who's attention is captured by a beautiful girl and he also wants access to her soul, rather than her body.
There is also a supernatural element in the film that suggests that the story is part wish-fulfillment fantasy by Han-ki.
That title is ironic in the sense that his anti-heroic protagonist really is, whatever we may say or think, or however bestial his behavior, a child of God, while Ki-duk Kim's title "Bad Guy" ("Nabbeun namja") is also ironic in the sense that Han-ki is by societal standards certainly a bad guy, but by naturalistic (or cosmic) standards no better or worse than the pretty college girl.
There's the exploited lake girl (also a whore) who tends the pontoon huts in The Isle, miles from civilisation, and the murderer who seeks his hideout on the water.
I liked the book, and the screenplay was also a very fine job.
There are some classics(as "God Father"),excellent postmodern variations(as "Pulp fiction")and also good Russian films in this genre("Assa" and "Brother").
Vyacheslav Razbegayev is also very good as Metis.
Not to mention,CBS also gave Charlie Brown and his faithful dog Snoopy their own Saturday Morning cartoon show as well which lasted for five years running and they would put out new specials based on this series.
Marcie apologizes on her friend's behalf before Patty also says she's sorry.
She also invites Marcie and Franklin.
She was also flirtatious toward Charlie Brown.
There were also outstanding sight gags involving Snoopy and Woodstock and the scene where they get the food ready for the feast that's set to "Linus and Lucy."
I also liked the scene near the end when the kids are in the car and they sing "Over the River and Through the Woods" en route to the Brown's Grandma's condo for a real Thanksgiving dinner.
Side note: If you enjoyed this film, then I suggest that you also watch Mind Game.
Here we also have the sweet dose of violence.
This story takes little of the film's length and it is also the most disconnected one, but adds a funky "sexuality" note.
Music was also perfectly used; a 100% match with the art style (something like Rock/Pop ...(?)..
well, you'll get it when you see it) Even the slower and moderate background music (simple piano chords), which was used in the middle of the film for quite a long time, was also a consummate choice.
This incident also illustrates the inevitability of consequences from our actions: the man had hired a hit-man to kill his wife, and it comes back to haunt him.
It also leaves the impression that the mastermind actually spent serious time after coming up with such issues fertile for reflection.
The set is also a big plus.
I'd also like to point out Dink's friend Jonah, a black kid whose character is handled rather tastefully: "That's Jonah.
Vidor also gives the picture bite with some neat tracking shots.
The Champ also sees Roscoe Ates in one of his largest roles, and for once getting to appear as a normal person rather than the stuttering fool he was usually required to play.
And this was perhaps also the only time in which a child actor like Cooper could become a personality in his own right.
It's nice to see that both the mother and stepfather are portrayed as sympathetic people.Beery's portrayal manages also to convey the flaws in the character of The Champ,which is why we understand how his wife could leave him.But as an ex-boxing champ he's not very believable.
Instead of splitting the Academy Award with Fredric March who was also awarded The Best Actor for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, possibly Beery should have given half of his half to Cooper.
I also found out why Bob Hope and Jack Benny used to make a lot of sarcastic lines about "being about as pretty as Wallace Beery."
The atmosphere is also fantastic.
with watching the film numerous times i have now picked up on the camera work and the magnificent colours, with noticing in the first time i watch Amelie the fantastic camera work and special effect which bring the film to life and help tell the story with out the translation, the camera work has defiantly made up for the storyline in Amelie and you notice something every time you watch the film.the colours also help the film and always give your eyes something to notice.
The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade.
Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex.
She convinces her father to travel abroad using his garden gnome; she helps her neighbor that is an outcast and lonely painter and the super that misses her unfaithful husband; she also helps her hypochondriac colleague that works in the tobacco shop and the man that stalks the other waitress acting like cupid; she plays pranks to an employer that mistreats his employee with abusive relationship.
it also one of the best cinematography ever to be committed on film.
the beautiful Audrey Tatou plays the title character and the supporting cast also do an amazing job.
I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself.
It's a nice film, and has some very funny scenes, but it's also a very light one, and doesn't require too much attention.
Desny's performance is also subtle, but not so subtle that you can't see that his character is more in love with the idea of becoming a moneyed gentleman again than he ever could be with Madeleine herself.
Elizabeth Sellars is also memorable as Todd's maid.
The film also features Norman Wooland, Ivan Desny, Andre Morrell and Elizabeth Sellars.
(One of the greatest scriptwriters of all time, George S Kaufman, also directed only one film ... but Kaufman was a brilliant stage director.)
The film is also marred by far too many piecing musical numbers that seem to exist only to pad out the film's runtime and serve as a defacto showcase for Moore's shrill voice (even "Minnie the Moocher," which is often referred to as the film's highpoint, is virtually unlistenable).
There are also two sequences, one a chorus singing a title song, the other an elaborate (overlong and rather boring as well) presentation of native Javanese dancers, complete with a chorus, claps, calls, stomps etc.
She was also a very disciplined actress who used her tightly controlled body to convey emotional depths and subtle nuances.
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
something made them reach out to each other to have their needs met.It was ironic and comical how they ended up meeting.There were so many comical moments in this movie and played so genuinely funny I laughed hard.The reunion and the bullshitting was a riot and the look on Dave's face was priceless the more he learned about his new buddy.It also had it's serious side and was very realistic and this type of thing does happen.I know people who are living this.
He also is the umpire for the local baseball team, the pitcher for whom is a teenage lad Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), a boy whose mother deserted her family leaving Dave and his younger sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson) in the care of functionless distant father (Timothy Hutton), a man who would rather avoid any conversation or emotional support with his confused kids.
It's in fact closer to the way action pictures are made today -- I would question whether the critics and fans who see this as a "parody" also think that Schwartzenegger's "Commando" and "The Running Man" are also parodies?
The guy who plays Peter, David Morwick is also great.
There is also a group of talented young actors.
This movie may also be about the strength of the repressed.
It also builds and builds and as time goes on the audience gradually gets a closer look at the villainess in a frightening immobilized doll's mask.
Morwick who plays the role of Peter (also screenwriter and director) does a wonderful job of portraying a vulnerable character with a little boy quality that the audience comes to care about.

"You may also bring an abusive post to the attention of our moderators).
I also liked how they filmed everything with the color red.
It also deserves more recognition than.
After all, they point out, Peter also believes in Bigfoot and claimed one of his professors was a werewolf.
Morwick Â who also directed the film and wrote its screenplay Â is charming and determined, brave enough to take on the killer in a spooky school library, yet vulnerable enough to shyly squirm and stammer during a coffee date.
The subtitles were also very confusing.
Roselyn Sanchez and Jaci Velasquez were also great and they really worked well together and with Eduardo.
I must admit though I also watched it with commentary on and its even, their super funny and you can tell they really enjoyed each other.
But if you like Spanish culture, or pretty latina women, you should not be bored with it, also it is kid friendly.
Well , After i watch this movie i have many things to say about it , 1st of all the drama line is so flat , some of the characters if we remove it from the script they will not affect the drama like Ahmed Rateb , Tamer Abdul Moneam (son of Nour Al Sheriff ), and Yosra (her role is sooo boring), also the homosexuality takes too much from the duration of the film , it's not my business to see the gay sleeping on his face more than one time , they could make his role shorter , and also there's no connection or relations between the people who living in the building , they could even meet each other even one time to believe that they live at the same building , what will happen if Nour Al Sheriff Meet Adel Emam once ?
it's not hard , and also why they focused on the sex relationship between the Islamic boy (Mohamed Imam ) and his wife at the training place , we saw them sleeping naked two times , why ??
3- The streets also show the prepaid card telephones in street known as (Menatel) which didn't exist either .
A triumph You have to do the Hat trick For the three Actors Adel Imam The one and only who remain on the top for years And the outstanding performance by the superb actor Khaled El Sawy You can add also Ahmad Bedeir for his excellent role But Writer-producer Waheed Hamed (who also is the director's father) treats the novel with too much reverence.
I liked the homosexual part as it was really good played by Kaled Elsawy and it's really the 1st time in Egyptian movies to show a true human analyses for this strange character, also the dialogue contained many expressive words.
I also feel that this daring story has opened the way or paved it for more creativity without the need to worry about censorship or limiting expressions.
Therefore, to share the problems of the Egyptians with the public through movies is also another challenge that the movie industry has to work on.
No on-stage-like acting in real-life situations (you'll only know what i mean if you've seen enough).The screen writer who is also the director is brilliant.
Action scenes are also very well done.
Khaled Saleh (Kamal el Fouli) and Khaled el Sawy (Hatem Rashid) were also great.
It's also full of heavy-handed emotional manipulation, cliff-hangers, and so on.
There is also a music score by Heinz Roemheld that, strangely, seems to recall Tchaikovsky's "Romeo & Juliet".
This movie is also another great example of the value of location photography.
I also didn't get the feeling that this film was, in reality, WHITE HEAT 2, as some have said but it was a nifty follow up to that classic JC film.
Direction is robust and swiftly paced by Gordon Douglas and in the end, makes this film fun, breezy, yet violent, but also a very good watch.
There's also classic support from Ward Bond, in this movie he always looks like he's gonna screw you up and toss you away.
The direction is quirky, but makes no new ground, and also fits the script to a tee.
The sex is gritty just like the atmosphere though it well filmed and largely very erotic also.
The bizarro ending is also worth noting in a weird and pretty much unexplained PSYCHO-ish turn of events (but with hardcore sex added in...).
Frost's blunt, no-nonsense direction, the eerie, ethereal score set to a pounding pseudo-disco beat (said score also boasts a haunting recurrent whistled theme), the flat, unpolished cinematography which adroitly captures the plain, plodding rhythms of mundane everyday life, the authentically lurid L.A. locations, several jarring visualizations of Carns' savage power trip fantasies, the mean, hard-hitting dialogue, the frequently quite startling all-out nasty rough sex tableaux, and the unusually strong and credible acting from a mostly no-name cast (the sole familiar faces are skinflick starlets Rene Bond and Uschi Digard as massage parlor girls, plus longtime Frost collaborator Wes Bishop as a detective and legendary exploitation producer Bob Cresse as the massage parlor owner) are all uniformly tops.
It also plays like a real movie, with a plot, characters and believable acting.
I also found the story to be well done and an interesting take on the older Blind Dead series.
Franco also has some interesting things to say in the commentary on the Severin Films version, relating the dead monks in the film to his view of the Spanish Catholic church -- an insightful view, in fact, reflecting popular attitudes in Spanish Catholicism that define monks and priests as theoretically saintly figures that are also motivated by the needs and failings that drive ordinary men.
I also agreed with Franco's commentaries on George Romero and his zombies (unlike a previous reviewer).
He also has a loony gardener, Marleno(Albino Graziani)who likes to pester the girls, when he's not whistling or singing to his beautiful flowers outside the hotel.
He is able to display this by showing the wind as it generates a type of rage, also arranging the furious sound of wind on the soundtrack.
After one hour of walking around naked and making out with each other, one of them disappears when going out to take photos... People who are not in favor of Jess Franco's cinema will probably think of this as the worst film ever made; however, the film's incredible weirdness and lack of any logic whatsoever are also the elements that make it fun (in addition to its primary quality, the constant sleaze and female nudity).
The original blind dead also drank their victims' blood in order to gain eternal life, whereas these guys are fans of gang-rape instead.
Directed by Leslie Howard(who also played Mitchell)The First Of The Few tells his story from an idea he had one day watching the birds to the planes flying in the war.Made in 1942 a year after the Spifires helped win The Battle of Britain this is an uplifting film made I imagine for the sole purpose of building troop morale.
As a swansong, the role is poignant but also appropriate.
William Walton's music also makes a great contribution to the film, and is now rightly (popular as the 'Spitfire Prelude and Fugue')in the concert hall.
Summers became the chief test pilot for Vickers and was also the man who dropped the very first life size prototype of the bouncing bomb over Chesil Beach, Weymouth in 1943.
To me ,this film represents the very best of British cinematography of its day and genre.I have some "stills " of the film and also quite a few w action shots (no pun intended !
I believe the interesting plot is the main reason I kept from nodding off (also, the humour was nice.
Although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being, there is also some room for hope, in the shiny singing scenes.
there's also a kinda zombie-virus-sub-plot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doo-wop sequences.
There's an utter, nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters, sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers (which does amplify the isolation of the characters), making THE HOLE - and his other films - rather disorienting, but also always fascinating and insightful.
Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one, at that.
A little more light on the flyers activities would in other ways also have been nice.
Although the focus of the movie itself is on Lara, the audience is also able to get to know each character's personality (e.g.
It's a very touching story about a girl growing up with deaf parents and coming to terms with her feeling of guilt and anger and also love for them.
I also really enjoyed the main characters' totally inane conversations.
So many of my friends I went to high school with also loved this show.
They also say that the plane "barely hit" tower 2.
I also watched the debates on TV featuring the producers of Loose Change and various skeptics.
Why would the US government crash 2 passenger planes into the WTC, and also blow up the buildings with bombs planted at various floors?
That being said, all I can remember is laying on the floor watching the television and beating the carpet I was laughing so hard, and my best friend called screaming through the phone, wheezing like he was going to die--he was watching it also.
The filmmakers also take every news report as gospel truth with a report of the blowing up of one of the towers roofs being portrayed as true when the footage shows its not There is no room for any error in any news footage, its not an error but signs of the conspiracy.
(also the phone report of one eyewitness that is contradicted by photographic evidence is given a great deal of weight) And at times the film throws things out-like the off loading of passengers, but gives no evidence as to why this may have happened or what happened to the people.
And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts).
Also different people have different way of speaking, not only accents and voice, but also how they react, humor, way of talking and so on, which technology cant imitate.
And also many of the people that where on the plane didn't even decide to board the plane until few days before.
But we also think.
They also fail to mention that not a single structural engineer supports the idea that there were bombs in the buildings.
All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man.
It has not occurred for the director, Dylan Avery, that signals also can work vertical, not only horizontally.
That can also be said about this "documentary" and most conspiracy theories.
In all honesty this is similar to most religions that also require blind obedience.
Movies like these should really be offered also in unrated editions, so there's more nudity and sexual situations, given the theme of this movie.
Unfortunately, it is also a tricky act to pull off thanks in no small part to the delicate balance between the two disparate elements.
Aside from the addition of better cast members, better humour, and a more developed story, Decoys 2 also delivers a bit of mild suspense.
Remember also this is 1865 as Yul Brynner identifies the year and the Panama Canal had not been built.
There are also some pretty good comedic lines and situations too, however, for my taste it just wasn't there and it did not hit me right.
I also felt there just wasn't that much to the film, it's fairly slow, not that much happens, there's nothing in the way of mystery or surprises & there's a pointless twist ending that paves way for a sequel tacked onto the end.
She gets quite a bit of screen time while not actually being the lead, you might also recognize her from the Dawn of the Dead remake, she's got quite a memorable scene in that one!
This movie also mixes in a bit of cop drama with the good cop bad cop showdown, although unnecessary it still seems to work in the entire B-Movie atmosphere of the rest of the movie.
"Decoys" is loaded with fake scares and plenty of bad CGI imagery.The almost complete lack of gore and violence is also hard to forgive.There are some mildly humorous moments,but the pace is rather slow and the acting is weak.So if you want a proper and intelligent Canadian horror watch again "Ginger Snaps" or check out late 70's slasher classic "Rituals".
The actors gave a decent performance and the supporting cast also made their presence felt.
Of course, like the plot implies, the movie displays its fair share of nudity; not only of Poirier, but also of the beautiful Stefanie Von Pfetten.
I also thought Jessica and Gwenyth did a good job.
Paltrow and Foch also were effective in their roles.
Then my sis also told me she thought this movie was awful, but I decided to rent it anyway.
We find out that the the son also owns the ranch mommy lives on and runs.
But regardless, here appears a 12 year-old boy who often sounds quite German (he uses German and English interchangeably) but his accent also wavers a bit--almost sounding Swedish or Polish from time to time.
The two of them invade Douglas's three ring circus of relatives and get put through their paces also.
The friend who told me not to watch it was also hooked.
Very inspiring for its central moral drama, it is also full of great incidental historical and cultural information.
The picture quality is also better.
:)  With so many TV programs trying to "buy" an audience with "sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect)" screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence!
The Sleeping City affects a pseudo-documentary style that also came into vogue as a complement to the new cinema-veritÃ© look (a chase through the bowels of the massive institution stays particularly sinister).
Neither do I, and I also don't think it is okay for them to make a movie where the killer does this to women.
Agnes Moorehead, is also good as Aunt Jessie, who is charmed by the rotten Emil.
It also has similarities with films like Eraserhead - NOT the dreadfully slow pacing, but the way in which it takes an absolutely pedestrian look at a life filled with increasingly bizarre occurrences.
You have all seen the lead, Michael Emanuel; he is perhaps most recognisable as the guy who "lowered his cholesterol" in those ubiquitous TV commercials (and was also the husband in the McDonald's commercial in which the son gets the mother and father to believe each wants to take the other out to dinner by way of apology).
It also suggests that it's fairly easy to deprogram these little monsters; all it takes is a bit of lovingkindness and a birthday present.
Not only poetry and literature but also epic movies attempted to promote the virtues and depict humanity in the spirit of reason and heart.
The extraordinary locations and interesting shots make the film not only a historical work but also a rousing adventure.
A great plot, characters you fall in love with, evil bad guys etc But the film has aged well as a drama also, I reckon now way later...
Playing a hero, especially a naÃ¯ve goody-two-shoes one, is probably the most difficult job in show business (just ask anyone who's played Batman) but he solves it very well, and sometimes annoyingly so (when he remains faithful to the beautiful, but dull, Rowena (also well-payed by Anthony, who does the best she can with Rowena).
We also watched Spartacus.
A gripping performance was delivered also by Kathleen Robertson (Ali), who played Joey's wife giving us insight on what it is like being in love with someone who has a self-destructive addiction.
And, one would also think that those who gamble and do not win as often as they would like would get the message that things are really not going to get better, and in fact they can get a lot worse.
It also features the evil library clerk, CEO dressed J.K. Robertson.
Oh yeah, it also has a guy wearing a pink shirt found at the day of the shoot cause he forgot his outfit.
It also tries to be "comedic", with such witty commentary as "What would MacGuyver do?"
Oh yea, and I also want to burn Lady in Plaid's wardrobe.
It is also disturbingly prophetic in its vision of a future populated by kids who go everywhere with a cell-phone glued to their heads, oblivious to their surroundings.
He takes a reporter (Pritchard) back and forth in time, then also a swarmy businessman.
He also gave us Moving Targets, a film that combines the talents of Burt Ward, Miles O'Keefe, and Linnea Quigley.
There's also some kind of lovestory too and our butt chinned hero takes his plaid clashing girlfriend to shopping malls of the future and to the fifties!
