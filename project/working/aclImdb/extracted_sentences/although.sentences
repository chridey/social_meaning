Having seen this film, I don't think it's hyperbole to talk about her as being the equal of Judy Garland as an actress, if maybe not quite as a singer (although her expressive, surprisingly sensual voice makes all her other peers look suitably weak - particularly as most of them were being dubbed anyway).
Her singing too is terrific and almost all the songs are great, although a little artistic control might have seen fit to drop "Sam the Accordion Man".
The AI in combat is adequate(compare it with the AI from Mark of Chaos, which is two years younger and performs worse) although it is unable to learn from failures, so once you find the key to defeat a specific army composition(horse archers vs infantry) then the AI will not adapt his army to the new challenge.
The film isn't particularly frightening, although it has a couple of jumpy moments.
The technical aspects of the film are all sound (although I noticed a couple of background gaffs, but I think you'd have to look for them), with clear direction, capable lensing and design.
Sound and music work very well too, and the film succeeds in working many small elements together (such as a playground hiding game and some very clever revelations towards the end), so all in all, the film is an accomplished piece of cinema and well worth seeing, although don't expect too much real terror as most of the chills in this film are poetic rather than gruesome.
Anarchic, briskly staged and with some genuinely funny moments, it is a film which could be remade to good effect in the West (I can see Kevin Spacey as the beleagued station owner, for instance) although I doubt that all of the verve could be recaptured, for this is a young man's film, angry and alert to wider issues.
And although "The Fast and the Furious" may never make IMDb's top 250 list, it was a good enough film for the producers to make two sequels.
Never was a motorcycle guy, although I did own a Navajo for a year or so.
I truly loved "Endgame," fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier.
And although she clearly expresses denial, her denial is not shrouded in isolation.
I've seen "8 Femmes" as well and this is also a very good movie, although it's something completely different.
Overall I liked this movie although it did leave me worried about the cheapness of freedom.
The dialogue was awful although the performances of all the actors, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal was exceptional.
This isn't a kids show (although it is safe).
This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer .
Beautifully understated, funny, very sad, nicely paced and Buscemi very wisely NOT trying to dominate every scene, although he certainly dominates the movie.
The violence, although frighteningly real, exists in the film as both the problem and solution for the main character.
The videos(sadly, sans subtitles, although mostly, you can tell what's said) become available upon completion, all but one are the ones you watched along the way in this, and that one is an absolutely hilarious, if criminally brief, gag reel.
its a wonderful continuation of the pop series and presents a befitting end to the series.The prince looks great as ever and the various new features which are present in this game add an extra spice to it.The speed kill system is wonderful and makes the job quite easy for the prince,also in this game i cant recall a single instant where the game presented bad camera angles as are present in the previous two games.The game play is although pretty much similar to the previous two games but the platforming in this one is really great.There is one more added attraction in this game that is chariot racing which is quite nail biting stuff.Also in this game there aren't any monotonous boss fights as were in the pop warrior within.All in all a wonderful gaming experience,a must play for everyone and i give it a well deserved 9.5/10.
The show follows Tim, who is frequently caught in admittedly outlandish situations, although they always seem to spiral out of control so realistically.
Second time it is instead Hallman that is fatally wounded, and this time Winston steals the time machine, although he doesn't know what it is.
In my opinion it really improves on the original and beats Frankenhooker in entertainment value although some of the ideas in Frankenhooker were possibly more interesting.
When summoned to the boy's bedside, Martin believes his son has tried to commit suicide, although the facts are unclear.
While not a superior actress, she performs adequately, although her talents are more suited to television, as it appears this movie was.
This is much more than just a camp movie and great songs and production numbers, although it is all that.
...although that may not be saying much, it truly loves these kids that it portrays and is clearly made for such kids.
The program does not include interviews with Germans who were involved in the war and occupation in Russia, although this is to be expected because of the focus of the documentary.
The aliens are suitably creepy as my wife will agree, as she still refuses to watch it again, and it manages without the gore of many similar movies, although it is rather violent.
While not a superior actress, she performs adequately, although her talents are more suited to television, as it appears this movie was.
The character's aren't great & include a pointless group of students who have no purpose other than to get killed at the end although I did quite like Sam as her character had some attitude & was pretty spunky & there is no explanation given as to why or how Mitch became a Werewolf.
The film does try to have a bit more of a plot than just a standard teens trapped by a monster opus and it kinda comes off although it makes the film uneven in tone.
"The Fury" finds DePalma working with mostly new collaborators, although a few (editor Paul Hirsch and some of the actors)are DePalma veterans.
John Cassavetes makes a memorable villain and although this job was most likely for the money (he acted to finance his own films; this job probably financed "Gloria"), he doesn't sleepwalk through his role unlike some actors.
The script by John Farris based on his own 1976 novel of the same name, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two although it's said that the film is considerably condensed, plays more like a thriller than horror for the first half, it sets up it's secret Government agency, the bad guy, the good guy, it has a few chases & even a bit of comedy relief in the shape of two bumbling cops & a new car.
I enjoyed the movie for the most part although the overuse of sped-up footage towards the end is a let-down.
-"Moment I regret now"- Christopher Penn's dance sequence to "Let's Hear It For The Boy" (although it's a great sequence in the movie) -Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history.
The quasi-documentary style is effective most of the time, but we do get way too much Stanley Tucci, although his role plays right into his difficult to like persona.
Her character makes a painful and necessary decision, although, perhaps, we are not prepared for it, when she breaks away from a situation that will only bring her unhappiness, in the long run.
although i appreciated a lot about it including great performances by silverstone (ah, those brits ...) and charlotte brittain (who as linda has the most hilarious and poignant mini-soliloquy from the point of view of a "fat girl" i have ever heard) and most of its realism including a great ending, i thought there were several elements which were rather contrived, including a "coming out to the entire school" scene which veered dangerously towards cheesiness.
although it was an enjoyable movie, i don't rank it among the classics such as -beautiful thing- or john greyson's -lilies-, although they too had similar failings with regard to underdeveloping the nature of the relationship of the protagonists.
I just turned 43 although it doesn't seem like it.
Johnny (as Steven likes to call him) travels a thornier road, and although Brad Gorton doesn't quite seem up to the challenge, his self-conscious jock does not seem so much a coward in the end as someone saddled with all the trappings of his gentrified upbringing who doesn't want to let go of them.
I mean, this movie also includes an award winning number of melon heavy breasts...although many of these chicks are bald...but hey, they got large knockers!
Oh and there are subhumanoids who are created and melt down with little of explanation, although the professor(Lisa Gaye) who sports a Marge Simpson haircut has a cure and being that Bronsky's girlfriend is a subhumanoid, he wants the cure.
I love Linda Howard's books, (although I found 'Loving Evangeline' less likeable than any of her others, and the lead character Robert Cannon an unredeemable rake) but as the previous reviewer said, this movie is crap.
James Spader's acting ability is marginal at best, but here, he does a very effective and surprisingly understated job and he and Sarandon do make sparks (although Sarandon could make sparks all alone in a full-force hurricane!)
I'm amazed this pic isn't better known, I agree very much with Ebert's review particularly(SPOILER)  The last scene that kind of does take credibility away fro the rest of the pic but then again-it maybe a little to Hollywood but the movie did (somewhat) follow the book's ending which was also positive although nowhere near the film's last scene.
The script at it's most basic is pretty gripping & absorbing as time runs out for Frances while Harry the kidnapper toys with the police & FBI, although I have to say once Harry is arrested & stuck in that room the pace slackens considerably.
Technically Oxygen is OK, it's competently made, there are a few nice New York shots & a couple of minor car chases although there isn't much action as it's a dialogue & storyline driven film.
He and Maura Tierney both did excellent jobs in this film, although Maura Tierney's character was slightly less developed.
Although Richard Shepard's basic plot line isn't at all original, (although, what plot is?)
However, although he was distinctly good at being an obnoxious sociopath (the terms do not always go in tandem, the seemingly affable Ted Bundy is a one example), he DID become far more interesting than I imagined -- much smarter than one would have suspected.
I think the fart scenes could have been left out, although the first is an almost a deserved scene to accentuate the burned out bad boy and over the top good boy irony; and the cavity search seemed totally unnecessary and basically out of character for the movie or at least out of place except the director felt uncomfortable with any "aww"s certain scenes might have evoked.
Asoka took on similar romantic proportions, in that at its core it has a love story to tell, rather than one focused on waging war throughout the lands, although this was touched upon in the latter half of the film, stemming from a death of his heart, and the embracing of a rage against the known world.
Santosh Sivan's overall direction is good, although his work in the Terrorist is easily superior than Asoka in the direction department.
Both films are sumptuous recreations of history, although this film is based on an actual historical figure and CTHD is based on a novel.
Unfortunately, I believe that the song sequences are being cut severely for international release, although I was lucky enough to see them in full DTS digital sound.
It's a short film, but although the initial premise is gripping, it eventually suffers from the absence of wider context - "girl goes home" is a less powerful ending to a story if we have no idea of why she went away.
Baadshah is a wonderful mix of comedy and drama, and is good for lighthearted fun, although the plot becomes rather fast-paced nearing the end of the movie and some may find it hard to keep up (although I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I had to read the subtitles, and I followed it fine, so.......) The songs are pretty good, one of my favorites being "Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se", the scene in which Raj- "Baadshah" (Shah Rukh Khan) first starts his job to con Seema (Twinkle Khanna).
The P-40s are attractive airplanes, with clean lines, although they appear to be Model Es rather than the Cs the AVG used.
At least it got some well-deserved recognition outside the Netherlands, although I'm not sure how the movie performed across the pond- but I guess it stirred things up quite a bit in the US because of its daring content.
They can be convinced to agree to the evacuation of the stones that are invaluable to the armament industry, although it is made perfectly clear that the day trippers can take no refugees with them.
There are no deathbed scenes, although there are trips to the hospitals, and the film doesn't try to flood you with tearjerking scenes.
Eun-ha is a complex woman with a shady past, but although we were not told exactly what, from Do-yeon's portrayal, it doesn't take a genius to warrant an accurate guess.
Damn power, and really heart-wrenching, although it sort of looked comedic at the start.
The leader is completely bland, although his love Melora was the high point of the film (and, predictably, the most tormented).
The villain was utterly forgettable unfortunately, although the monster effects were quite memorable indeed.
The good guys, although certain area's with the characters were a bit plastic, they did have character which was lacking in the first.
In this movie at least the monsters, although there aren't too many of them, act like they are meant to.
The heroes are also a lot more natural and likable, although still a bit two-dimensional, and the plot is still a bit weak compared to a decently written adventure for D&D, but in comparison with the first film this one is an Oscar nominee.
Overall, one of the best D&D movies yet, although Serenity is pretty close (and it's sci-fi!)
Rathern than introducing the problem through the story, the bad guy tells you about himself and his plans, although not in enough specifics for it to make sense.
This movie falls into similar areas, although it's clearly not a children's movie.
Overall, I have loved this movie every time I've seen it (although the sequel isn't quite the classic), and I would rate it as a fall - out - of - my - seat - and - wet - myself type of comedy.
Unfortunately the Western countries did not give any help to overcome the Soviet aggressors, although in their feeling they sympathized with our revolution.
Arctic climes didn't do Sean Connery's initially troubled post-Bond career any favours, although his top billing in The Red Tent is highly misleading, since his supporting role is not much more than a cameo.
Clint Eastwood is as ever, although he seems rather restrained.
And 'Tightrope' is exactly that kind of movie, although atmosphere is a bit darker than usual in Clint Eastwood's detective movies, which is a very good thing because the more darker the atmosphere in these kind of crime-mystery-thriller movies gets they get more exciting to watch.
Also appearing in a supporting role is Dan Hedaya as a fellow detective, although he's a little under-utilized.
Tuggle does a generally excellent job of keeping the material visually interesting, although he pays less attention to the minor characters, wasting a great character actor like Dan Hedaya for the role of Block's sidekick on the investigation.
I did not have a problem with the film's slowness, although it is slow.
The almost three hours, although slow, were needed so that one could immerse in those French Alps with those faithful Monks.
At the cinema everybody were staying till the very end, although I have to say that someone was sleeping behind me ;-)
Another thing you may soon notice is that although this film managed to get an R-rating, it is incredibly explicit--yet somehow this got the R and FRITZ THE CAT got an X.
(although it is better wasted!)
They are so assured and confident here that they appear to be making up their routines as they go along, although in reality they had polished them to near perfection during their years in vaudeville, burlesque and on the Broadway stage.
It really recreates the mood and the theme of the book in my opinion, although as usual some details had to be omitted.
The only other cast member whom I recognized was Mickey Rooney, playing a trigger-happy hit-man named Trigger (although apparently, Peter Cook also starred).
The music has a pulsating beat although I do admit some songs on the film's soundtrack are better than others but the music does seem to carry this film along.
=) My favorite character in the whole series - and the heroine I root for - is Elisabeth (played by Helle Virkner), although her neurotic/hysteric/weepy sister Maud (Malene Schwarz) is kind of priceless too!
The voice-over sets that tone well, although i did wonder if it could be shorter - i have no idea.
The lack of academic rigour in his film allowed it to be dismissed as disingenuous, although it created plenty of waves in the minds of the anti-Bush camp, at least.
Overall this movie was fun and entertaining, although I personally think that the movie's success was rather exaggerated, because the story itself isn't all that great.
The reconciliation is at the end, although it seems hinted that Dunne comes out a little ahead of Grant in looking less absurd at the conclusion.
The Awful Truth is tagged as part of the wonderful genre that encompasses the screwball comedy, and although to a degree that genre placement is true, I do believe that those not particularly fond of the high octane scattergun comedies from the genre, will certainly find this offering far more appealing with its pacing and lighthearted production values.
That film was a little overestimated, but it put some humour into the immigration questions in Sweden, although still being serious.
Moe is the funniest and chaikowski is the cutest (although they all are cute)
I approached this movie with some skepticism: although France is to be commended for being pretty much the only country in the world right now that still produces films based on the works of Agatha Christie and releases them theatrically (the British Poirot and Miss Marple series are still running, of course, but they're made for TV), "Towards Zero" is directed by Pascal Thomas, whose previous Christie adaptation, the 2005 "By The Pricking Of My Thumbs", was about as dull as a film can possibly be.
This is a film that uses a montage of images, voice overs, songs and music to create an understanding, it isn't a linear narrative throughout although it does explore his life in a linear representation of his movements and works.
But leaving aside the practicalities, I enjoyed it immensely, although I'm not sure I can define why.
And although some may find the constant 'rewinding' to be annoying, I just found that it made it that much more awesome.
Our hero re-animates the inventor who one by one kills them all, although he does get the honor of offing the leader of the gang himself.
I am quite a fan of unusual films like this, although unlike the works of David Lynch or Alejandro Jodorowsky, the weirdness of this film comes naturally from the storyline and not from any intentional strangeness just for the sake of strangeness.
Anyway, he does an OK job & he integrates Harryhausen's effects & monsters into the action quite well although no one set piece really stands out as being brilliant, they're all very good but not as memorable as some of the other monsters & fights Harryhausen created for some of his earlier films.
The attractive cast performs listlessly and the villain is campy rather than truly menacing, although former "Doctor Who" Patrick Troughton is delightful as a befuddled wizard.
Largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (although he is really sending up his performance in Fawlty Towers).
And it doesn't take too many sides either, although the ending does seem to show that action, and sacrifice, even unintended, is what's necessary to keep yourself from being beaten down by reality.
Species is one of those franchises that has gone down the toilet very steeply as of recently and I am happy to say that although #4 is nowhere near as good as the first film was it is night and day better then Species 3.
The kicking, although not as fancy as some other movies, is still impressive.
Kung Fu Hustle, for the most part, is unlike Chow's previous, award-winning action-comedy, Shaolin Soccer, although he has obviously continued the martial arts theme and expanded (massively) his repertoire of sfx.
And the beginning, although the best part of the film with loads of good looking babes, is exceptionally pointless.
The devil worshippers are a joke compared to the satanic cults in other horror films (and, although they clearly outnumber the heroes, they persist in attacking them one by one), and I hope Patrick Bergin knows that, after a role like this, his career has little hope of reviving.
However, it's Alfred Marks in the showy role of Wilfred Shadbolt, the assistant torturer, who walks away with both acting and singing honors, although Elizabeth Gale as the newlywed Elsie and Claire Powell as the passionate "sister" Phoebe, are not far behind.
I was'nt even that lucky...a spoof is always more entertaining....Ramu's factory is stagnating...he should try to become creative for a change...all the characters were so stereotype...the lead Randeep Hooda tried to force himself into the shoes of the silent cold angry young man from the slums with an underworld acumen that was played so brilliantly by chkraverthy in Satya ...although this character can be traced back to Amitabh in films like Mukaddar ka Sikandar, Trishul etc but chakraverthy was its RGV version and so a relevant example to quote here....needless to say, Hooda failed miserably.....he would have done well if he had just played himself......Chunkey Pandey was expecting to redo "tezaab" but those days are long over....his character was damn clichÃ©d just like all others in the movie...this is an era of "Hazaro Khwahishein Aisi" when every thing has to be brilliantly and refreshingly "original"...  ..Ramu should have stopped dabbling with underworld themes immediately after "company" which was his last watchable movie and was good off course...its time he realises that movie-making is an art and you have to "think" and "create" the design every time you make a product, instead of doing it once and then letting the assembly line take care for the rest.....probably his engineering background has to do with it..
His previous outing with "Satya" and "Company" were equally amazing although none can match the raw power Manoj Bajpai brought to Bhikoo Mhatre(in Satya) or Ajay brought to Mallik(in Company).
Good music too although the editing and directing is not up to the mark.
In choosing to accept the reallity of Hidalgo, I am accepting although temporarily that myth has power and meaning.  
We were interested in the story and did a little research - the basic facts appear true (he did indeed take part in this race) although there is a liberal amount of poetic license, of course.
One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that it is a movie by grownups for grownups, although it carries enough action and suspense that kids will probably like it to.
Viggo Mortensen of Lord of the Rings plays Frank Hopkins, a real-life cowboy, although probably much fictionalized in this movie.
Fortunately this film managed to achieve the so bad it's good category, one reserved for films which are enjoyable solely through the realisation that although you yourself may not be able to do better, you certainly would bury any attempt this bad deep underground to prevent the embarrassment of having the general public see it.
The film seems to have been made in Rome for United Artists and although the plot is somewhat bizarre it is strangely watchable.
I was also impressed by the quality of the production considering it wasn't a Hollywood studio production (although it was released by United Artists).
I was all sorts of happy when I realized it was based in NYC, although in reality, it wasn't :-( I was wondering what messed up signals I was sending to my child.
He seems more upbeat for the encounter, although the voice-over still has him thinking about practical matters at the end.
We all have our preferences, of course, and I wouldn't expect mine to match anyone else's (although the film sold well enough to justify sequels), but for those of you with tastes like mine this is a Don't Miss It Under Any Circumstances opportunity.
I especially liked her firm, well rounded derriere, although her breasts were too over-sized for my taste.
However, although the picture is big on atmosphere, despite its obviously limited budget, it is somewhat deficient in characterization and motivation.
On the one hand, it's fairly ambitious genre-crossing, on the other the political aspects of it (although relevant) feel outdated.
First of all, for the past five years I have worked closely with mentally disabled individuals, and although some of them are very kind, and have a loving nature, I've yet to come across one that would be capable of taking on the responsibility of raising a child.
I expected to hate it, although I needed to see it.
The really sad thing about this film (although all intentions was good but so naive) was that the girl of course was perceived as "hanging" out with a rich white guy who paid for her services, as girls do in the red light zone.
I watched it, and although the film by itself was only mediocre, there was one aspect, one historic performance that made the movie worth watching, my life worth living.
Multi-player is magnificent and doesn't actually necessitate an internet connection or LAN, although it can be done on them, so it's wide open.
It is interesting that Sjostrom himself plays the lead and his real life wife, the love interest (although having two characters refer to her as exceptionally beautiful when she's as homely as a pig with one ear - is a bit hard to swallow).
Freddy is still a good character, although more laughable than Scary in this outing, he was humorous in the first movie, but not at the expense of the Horror.
Freddy is not quite the One Liner comedian yet (although he is funny), he cracks a few jokes here and there, but mostly he still lurks in this shadows, he's still creepy, and we still take him quite seriously, he still means business!
You can't deny that Wes Craven's original "Nightmare on Elm Street" was horror of great significance and, although dreadfully overrated, it was a pretty clever and spooky film that introduced the legendary icon of Freddy Krueger.
(although i am not her undermining the movie in any form , who can ever forget the narration by morgan freeman in that movie).
In addition to its being entertaining, enjoyed seeing Kirk Douglas, who although in his mid-60's, still looked vigorous and hale.
The dog fight scenes between tomcats and zeros was excellent, although if I remember right the Zero's were actually dressed up T-6's LOL!
I felt sorry for his character as, again, we see the reality that young African-American men, although urged to grow up real fast in the face of taking the big responsibility of heading the household (forgive the run-ons), still have this little kid inside of them who thirsts/screams to be a young child, held and loved.
The scripts are well written, although the episode endings are occasionally unfinished or hard to understand.
"Bustin' loose" is a good comedy, although it would have been even better if the script had relied more on Pryor's relationship with the children than on the physical comedy parts.
This gets us as far as Wonderful Copenhagen -- The official slogan of the Danish capital city -- as one could come: Dogma stands for a dark realism, although the critique is more individual than social.
That's how I feel about "Lost Things", although it's not a film everyone would get into.
Out of the four central characters, the two girls are unconventionally pretty and wonderfully full-figured, and the two boys are fairly likable (although, as someone else already mentioned, casting two young blond actors who look so much alike was perhaps a mistake).
Grieco although aging was really fantastic and we all know how well a certain topless actress in this film, Maggie Q, has done since.
I enjoy People's Court, although I prefer Judge Judy's no-nonsense approach to the foolishness of so many of the litigants.
She doesn't love her kids, although she doesn't realize this herself.But the movie reveals this in a dramatic way.
Yes, it was an "animal" movie--I wasn't as interested in the humans at all--& their acting wasn't great (although I did like Sophie the Maid for some reason).
It's a funny story, although it displays the typical whacked-out father, which is another political correctness feminist agenda (mother = good; father = bad).
The aging Flynn's other trysts are romantic and humorous like Cary Grant (although Grant's were cosmopolitan not swashbuckling)in his last pictures.
I think this is an often overlooked part of Errol Flynn's charm and why many of his films, although light in subject, make for truly timeless pieces, just like The Adventures of Don Juan.
And although it was said at the time that he was slowing down and that he hit the booze while filming there is no evidence of it on screen.
They could have handled them the flash backs in a different way although not sure what.
If only the director had refrained himself from letting us know what he REALLY felt about Global Warning, the movie could have had a chance, although it would not have added anything new to the genre of isolation thrillers.
I feel compelled to add that warning although there's not much doubt that the seasoned viewer will be able to see the ending coming.
There are a lot of mixed feelings throughout the film and it is very much clear, although not many words are said.
In the novel, he is *younger* (probably mid-20s) and legitimate, although by a morganatic marriage; he is popular with the common people (not much in evidence in the film), and the sequel confirms one's suspicions that he could not have been any worse a King than Rudolf.
Roan Inish has none of these elements although the brief nudity of one child actor could offend some who would find offense in any presentation of the human form in any context.
My younger sons were swept into it, although it is quite unlike any film they had seen before.
One hesitates to call it a children's movie or a family movie because those are generally awful, but it is very much the sort of movie that is perfect to take the family too (although it is unaccountably rated PG).
However, the rest of the cast is as uneven, although Jack is handsome and there is a lovely lady in the film, too.
And for all the murders he commits, the usually tough Neville Brand is surprisingly innocuous, although it doesn't help that he's forced to play a Vietnamese leader.
I think it is save to say that although this docu isn't that good as "Truth or Dare" you won't be disappointed by this one.
I think there was an ambition to show these different themes - although the director accomplished none of the above.
The experience eventually ends, rather solemnly I must say, although after at least 20 minutes of non-stop psychotropic hallucinogenia, it acts as a welcome buffer zone as you gravitate back into reality.
Not all episodes are equally good and some can be downright boring although the 2nd season/GIG does add more interesting stuff.
Marguerite Moreau , although a talented actress , falls short in this faux pas , with a weak supporting cast.
It proved popular enough to run for an extended 26-part season and, although no further series were made, a comic-strip in the newly-launched 'Look-In' magazine provided fans with further adventures of the intrepid youngsters.
A couple of minor quibbles - not sure why it was necessary to bring in the trio from Ruddigore - it seems fashionable these days to "cross-dress" so to speak and although this actually worked quite well it wasn't really necessary.
Poor Frederic is the slave of duty and although he has lived 21 years is in fact a little boy of 5.
The show is very camp and the gags are hilarious, although some of them are very topical.
I've read that he had a hand in doing the special effects for the 1933 horror classic "The Invisible Man," although he is not credited with that in his profile.
I really enjoyed "Uncle Silas", although it's called "The Inheritance" on the VHS copy that I own and there are seemingly five minutes of footage missing.
set in a captivating palace of Rajasthan, it traces the emotional roller coaster ride of the royal palace guard Eklavya ( amitabh bachchan in a memorable performance ) who is put to the cruelest of altars in the end when he is faced with a choice between his loyalty and his son...  Saif ali khan as the son, Vidya balan and Sanjay Dutt all give beautiful performances, although the focus never really manages to shift out of the magnetic persona of Amitabh, who plays the role with such rigorous conviction that every crease in his face or every hint of a tear in his eyes more than makes up for the lack of dialogs in the movie..Eklavya is a movie of personal choices and the overly challenging task of choosing the lesser of the two wrongs, or for that matter, the better of the two rights...  barring the tortoise pace, which is not quite so bothersome as the screens blank under a couple of hours, the movie is quite worth watching for the sheer gravity of performances.
John Wayne is not the central figure of this film, although considered the star nowadays.
There is a surpising twist at the end which is a nice change from other bachelor party films (although the original "Bachelor Party" always will be king).
Candyman gets a lot of bad reviews although it is one of the best in the genre.
It is also quite good although not as scary.
So although in the end we see him as crucified (and more or less resurected through his blood) he is more like Virgil who lead Dante to the gates of paradise but was not allowed to enter himself.
The music is good, although it gets a bit monotonous at times and at other times seems oddly absent.
There's quite a bit of gore, although certainly not nearly as much as Dead Men Walking, another Asylum film which was clearly shot at the same location as Shapeshifter.
I didn't get enough background on this relationship between the couples, and although they talk quite a bit about all their "vacations and years together" we only witness one occasion in a 1988 flashback.
It helps that Mr. Margulies did his own adaptation, although, it appears to this viewer, the stage version was more satisfying.
Director Blasetti would go on to make another celebrated milestone of Italian cinema, the even more elaborate FABIOLA (1949) and, unfortunately, given their considerable reputation, both of these marvelous films are as yet unavailable on DVD even in Italy - although, the same can be said of several other little-seen but equally outstanding Italian epics including LA NAVE DELLE DONNE MALEDETTE (1953) and VIVA L'ITALIA!
Behind the cold and uncharacteristic crispiness it is obvious that Errol Flynn, although visibly aged, is still the gorgeous sexual animal that made him an exhilarating screen presence, but he is given nothing to work with here.
Nevertheless, although Tekkonkinkreet is rated R and very violent, it's still a great movie that I truly believe any anime fan will come to love.
I loved it, although there were a few flaws.
The only thing that I can possibly think that would detract from all the praise I have for this film would be the over showing of Lucy Brown's bosom which, although perfectly lovely and appreciated, was overall probably a tad unnecessary.
Although I'll admit that even though I was worried that this would be the case, it didn't bother me all that much, because the story had good forward propulsion and a resolution that was emotionally satisfying although not intellectually so.
Nonetheless, Tekkonkinkreet lived up to its hype, although I found the story to be a little too perplexing for my liking.
obviously Elisabeth Shue is a very good actress, Kris Kristofferson is a legend as always (Loved him in Hulk) and Oded Fehr was good although in it quite briefly (Much better acting than in the awful Resident Evil series) and Dakota Fanning was yet again outstanding.
Chris Christopherson, although shockingly older than he was with Barbara Streisand plays a role untouchable by other actors.
Â although I must say I prefer the much cheesier video title "Carquake" Â is brought to us by the same team that made the brilliant and unequaled "Death Race 2000" one year earlier, and it many ways it feels as if writer/director Paul Bartel injected all the silly comedy that he couldn't put in "Death Race" into this film instead.
Crazy Love does not have a particularly good reputation these days, although it apparently caused quite a stir upon its release and that isn't all that surprising considering the subject matter; although to be honest, nothing in this film particularly shocked or offended me.
The same about the third part, although this story is something completely different from the second.
As for martial arts credits; although this film has a brilliant choreographers' portfolio, the empty hand scenes are very very average, Sun Chien being even well below it.
I quickly grew bored at the beginning of the film when it seemed as if it was going to be nothing more than one blood bath after the other, although I did think some of Izo's enemies were quite creative.
From an instant when people heard that some people sing in it they left it behind and didn't wanted too see it although it was directed by Lars Von Trier.
And I suppose that's true, although horror fans are going to get more than their share of blood and questionable perversity (incest, anyone?).
I laughed so hard I cried and I think I even heard my husband snort, although he denies it.
That served as no impediment to the success of "Dona Flor and her Husbands", although in that case Sonya Braga's beauty was a big help.
Likewise to accept the plot, you must suspend disbelief in phantom lovers, duels for honor, and happy-ever-after endings -- although be forwarned that the ending of this Bewitched Love (a better translation than the usual "Love, the Magician", altho' there are at least three other ways to interpret the ambiguous Spanish title words) can be understood only as a comedy, or comedie noire.
i envy such deep love between he and his lover...  although mixed with pain and doubt, and beginning with a forced wedding, their love is warm and deep and pure.
FYI--parents should know that although this is an older film, there is some nudity.
She eventually meets and seduces Steve St. John (Bill McKinney) and marries him, although it's made very plain that she's a bit on the easy side, as prior to the marriage she has a little bedroom bam-bam with Blackie Fleming (Lee Raymond), a man egotistical enough to decorate the walls of trailer with his own name in spray paint.
The story, although in a Mormon setting, was a very human story with several surprises, moments of courage, demonstrations of testing personal commitment against temptation, and an endearing love story.
I really did enjoy this film, although it is certainly no cinematic masterpiece, however I do think it would be of fairly limited appeal to a non-Mormon audience.
My Vote 7/10 (although I unashamedly admit my own bias)
This short is pretty darn funny all on its own when viewed today, although the MST3k treatment definitely bumps it to a 10.
The acting is good although Pamela Anderson can get a bit over the top!
It is the story of gays and although briefly, lesbians, during the early Pre-WWII years and also during the war.
I have mentioned cannibals a few times already, but there is no actual cannibalism in this film(people are speared and taken by crocodiles), although it is mentioned by some characters in the film, it is however in the same vein as the Italian cannibal films.
The version that I saw looked like it was cut, although I would not think that an uncut version would be all that gory anyway as there doesn't seem to be that much opportunity for extreme violence with the situations that are created.
Rita and Bobby's guide is killed in the usual bad spike trap, and they're then captured by the same cannibal tribe they were looking for and face various "tortures," including the most pathetic attempted rape ever committed to film (although there was one noteworthy scene of a cannibal gets his testicles smashed with a mallet).
No voodoo to be seen, although the eponymous natives were reasonably uncivilised.
Tom Hanks is absolutely adorable (moreso than in Big, in my opinion), and although I almost always have more respect for the male than the female character in movie relationships, Daryl Hannah manages to be whimsically charming and a perfect match for Hanks.
The boy never forgets about what happened that day, although everyone insists he was hallucinating.
I would recommend this film to everyone (although maybe the romantics out there would probably appreciate it the most!!).
Paris, Australia, of course, not France although the enigmatic finale will have you guessing.
Weir is just as concerned with (and just as good at) imbibing in quirkiness for its own sake (although even that stuff we could read as a critique on social conventions if we wanted to) and see-sawing between a kind of community existentialist nightmare and an Our Town-like small village drama.
So take this advice (although it might already be too late if you're reading this) and go see it for yourself, before exposing yourself to anything that could disenchant you!
His family Being loving and caring although one daughter thought otherwise,gave the audience heart,devotion,and a push towards one doing better,or at least becoming the best a person can be.
The splendor and special effects was top rate although done not too complicated,which gave a crystal clear view of the surroundings.
Throughout the film I felt (although the critics certainly didn't and many here probably don't) all these things and became closer and closer to him as he constantly never gives up hope on becoming a human.
The film is not really in my opinion a family comedy although it unfortunately has been marketed that way.
However, although I can see that the filmmakers had no other reliable option, I disliked the jumps in time the it takes.
"Companeros", on the other hand, is an entertaining piece chock full of humor and action (although, like the two protagonists, the alliance between humor and action is not always a smooth one).
Fortunately he didn't because although the story is "soggy and 99.44% pure soap opera", using his own words, it still retains powerful moments and excellent interpretations from its main actors: Barbara Stanwyck and Adolphe Menjou.
This Edison short is hilarious, although you have to be very tired when watching it.
The connection (involving the "Mumblin' Jack Malt Liquor) turned out to be very weak (although I would like one of the 64 oz bottles used as props for my collection).
I expected an over- sentimental, although well-made, movie.
The characters' motivations are weak: an entire village falls in love with the hero, although he hardly says two words the entire film.
I am of the opinion that Hoess was probably an insomniac, although I can't say for certain.
We, and Stingo, learn from Nathan's brother that he is in fact suffering from mental illness and that he is only employed by the pharmaceutical company in a lowly clerical position, not as a research scientist, although Sophie remains unaware of these facts.
The original street kid is the quintessential animal; and although we are shown what instigates her partial transformation, her support system is never quite as convincingly 'solid' as that provided by Leon and Tony...
He goes along with the wager, and although not as active a character as Chad, is every bit the misogynist Chad is.
In all, although this was a thoroughly nasty movie, it was still quality.
The same can be said for "Take Me With You", although they worked that one up really well.
The movie itself was pretty good, although I would have preferred if the movie was entirely serious instead of putting comic relief in the middle.
Shot with black and white stock, appropriate for its mise-en-scÃ¨ne, the picture was slated by its distributor, Trimark, for colourization to make it palatable for movie theatre audiences, but Corrente did not back away from his chiaroscuro vision and it remained as his perception dictated, although he permitted colour processing (under his oversight) for its video release, it therefore owning an odd distinction of being the only modern U.S. black and white film that had colour added for home consumption.
Pieced together in 1972, THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE (although most prints exclude THE at the beginning of the title) is the worst movie I have ever viewed.
The truth is that although Hollywood has handled nazism well, it has never come to grips with the phenomenon of Stalinism -- its enormous death camps, its man-made famines, its surreal rendering of reality to a captive population.
Li'l Abner is steeped in Cold War thinking and regarded as dated although it does turn up on the stage from time to time.
Caught this one by accident on the TV here ; although the ending was about as satisfying as could be, it was difficult to feel any real emotion.
Most of the current direct-to-video sequels by Disney have distinguish themselves for a considerably lower quality in the art department, but "Bambi II" is truly an exception, as it seems that the animators really tried to stay true to the first film's style (although of course, there were some modernizations), as even some backgrounds were reused to keep the same art direction.
However, although "Bambi 2" is quite better and more "logical" than most Disney sequels, it suffers from the same "syndrome" of the rest of Disney sequels: it doesn't fit well on the first one's story.
It is not a horror film, although I do happen to have a horror of things going wrong with water supplies, so I could have well been made to feel petrified under different circumstances.
British Naval Intelligence meanwhile spread rumours of an advancing fleet awaiting the German ship as soon as it leaves port, although only the still damaged Ajax and Achilles are within striking distance.
The three shortly gather for a night of drinking, although ultimately, the film doesn't show any emotional culmination or yet still arrive at an apparent close.
I always found the movie vague, as you can read in an earlier comment on the movie, although this has changed recently because I decided to watch it again for a report I had to make for religion class (I recommend you to also watch this movie if you need to make a similar report).
It's not really funny, although there are some very good comical scenes.
The problem is that although Ladd is a hothead with a checkered past, he's too decent to keep up the ruse--though Keith is now angry enough to eat hornets because he was counting on this big payoff.
A fine western that was better than I expected It to be.Alan Ladd, although sometimes wooden puts In a good performance here.
The violence is never graphic although it can still be fairly hard hitting such as when Tommy goes into the stable of the horse which had killed Nails and two shots ring out and the films most famous scene where he pushes half a grapefruit into his girl friend's face.
Also, the weak comic relief provided by two quarrelsome policemen is brittle at best (although it's interesting to hear Lugosi speak in his native Hungarian in the scene), but both elements were, no doubt, concessions to the taste of 1930's audiences.
Cagney is a great actor, although this is not his pivotal work.
Tom then meets Jean Harlow and she seems to fall for him, although his interest in her is rather more glandular than anything else.
My first surprise came when the audience was addressed by a festival employee who told us that although the movie was German, the dialogue was English.
The interest I have in abnormal psychology (particularly sexual) is deep and passionate, and although I am pretty well adjusted, my curiosity borders on the creepy-even to those that know me well.
The grad student that Russell played was (although annoying in the beginning) the one saving grace in this movie, because the character acted as a device that separated the viewer from the actions taking place.
The vices on display run the entire alphabetic gamut from adultery to zoocide, by way of satanism, although if I was Satan, I'd ask to have my name removed from the credits, if only to preserve my highbrow image...  And it all fits neatly in 65 little compact minutes.
Add to that a sterling score by Cipriani that is equal parts suspenseful and subtle and some well handled action scenes and car chases in the poliziottescho mold (although it lacks the rampant energy of one, so I wouldn't classify it as such) and here you have a movie that is definitely worth the time of ANY fan of 70's Italian crime cinema.
These are not the "Happy Days", although there are fun bits by Erin "Joanie Cunningham" Moran and Penny Marshall.
Lots of familiar faces too (Marion Ross, William Schallert)although at the time it wasn't exactly a big-name cast.
although I do prefer seeing the gore, but the insinuation of it works very well.
Night of the Living Dead starts as brother & sister Barbara (Patricia Tallman) & Johnnie (Bill Mosley) visit their recently deceased mother's grave, there they are attacked by one of the living dead & Johnnie is killed although Barbara manages to escape on foot to a nearby farmhouse.
The script stays pretty faithful to the original which to be fair I haven't seen in a number of years so the exact details of it are a little hazy, it starts out almost scene-for-scene although it changes things at the end.
However, although the film will undoubtedly feel extremely familiar to fans of the 'Dead' series, there is still much to enjoy about Savini's effort, and it is highly recommended viewing nonetheless.
This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected).
There were three layers to this portrayal: The first layer of course was the murder itself, and one of the things that makes this interesting is that although we don't know the identity of the killer, we know he is a German general.
The action scenes are all very stylishly executed and the acting seemed good, although not speaking French I had to rely on the subtitles to understand what was being said.
And (although the audience does know who did it long before the conclusion) the end of the film shows that the sometimes a sense of disgrace can be brought about by the type of killing one gets tangled with.
The special effects (although, I didn't understand, what were these falls from the suddenly appeared mountains in the beginning)...
The action (although sometimes the camera moves way too fast, like in "Antikiller 2")...
I saw the film when it was first released, and although I was rather young at the time, the story stayed with me for decades.
The title is very apt, however, as Preminger spins a web of intrigue around the central character, and although the film never really gives you the impression that it's created a whirlpool - it often tries to.
If you have a 100min or so to kill, and want to watch a low budget Italian/Spanish anti-war(Vietnam)movie that is poorly written not very well acted, somewhat funny(although it was not filmed for any laughs), and has a better version of Tara Reid then Tara Reid herself in it...then this movie is for you...Andrew Wolf(II)
I see a simple and effective noirish drama that although the ending is never really in doubt, the film has enough mystery about it to keep the viewer hanging in there for the final reel.
Her divine beauty shines through the film, although it somewhat makes Dr. Sutton seem even more stupid.
And I like some of the Warner Oland entries, although they included a bit too much humor at times for my taste in mysteries.
(although the dinosaurs depicted didn't exist all at once).
But the plot although interesting and immersive does seem quite weak and overall degrades the rating for this movie.
They also use good dinosaurs for the film and stick to the right era (unlike in the "Land Before Time" films, although they're good as well).
The characters are quite all right too (especially Aladar, Zini and Eema), although the film focuses more to move the plot forward.
But the real problem with this film is that it seems like the directors and screenwriters disagreed for which audience this movie would fit too (although it was rated PG).
I was also very touched by Aladar's attempts to save the old dinos, and although I'm a grown-up, I jumped in my seat when the carnotaurs emerged.
Bogie is fabulous as always (although he does hold his arms a bit like a primate when he walks), Leslie Howard is playing the watery romantic that Leslie Howard does best, Bette Davis's face actually doesn't frighten me for once (no offense Bette Davis fans, she's a great actress, but I first saw her in "The Nanny" and that is how I will always remember her).
The acting is good all around, although I don't think the football player was that good.
The film is also a great early showcase for future talent, and although he's not really the star of the film; it isn't surprising that it's Humphrey Bogart's face that adorns the front cover.
Davis would become famous for strong performances in films such as All About Eve and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, and although her part here doesn't give her that opportunity; she fits into her role well.
Bogart's and Davis' performances are just average in this film - although at the time of the release, this was Bogart's best film.
She shares Squier's love of beauty and poetry and dreams of fleeing her repressing entrapment at the restaurant and traveling to FranceÂ   Into their world of fanciful idealism enters Humphrey BogartÂthe reality, the brute force which threatens not only the dreamers but all of societyÂ It is a finely truthful portrait of ultimate evil, magnificently played by Bogart with all the uncompromising ferocity the role demandedÂ It was one of Bogart's finest portrayals and it was the model, although considerably restrained, he would follow for the next years of his careerÂ  Final note: Duke Mantee was a killer on the runÂ He was not a big-shot businessmanÂ The assumption put into the audience's mind was that this mobster was a bank robber, a hold-up artist, an escaped convict... but never a wealthy criminal controlling an empire of corruption from plush offices on the 18th floorÂ  Approximately twenty years later, Bogart recreated his original role in a television production of "The Petrified Forest."
Rutger Hauer looks nothing like Fred who was tall and thin yet the movie although stereotyped is fairly accurate.
(***Possible spoiler, although not really a major plot development as the film does not really contain any***)We know that the voice-over is an older Vladimir, we can see the younger Vladimir (Nick Stahl) following the object of his attraction (Kirsten Dunst), so why does the voice-over tell us that Vladimir is following her?
It is a quiet & interesting movie, although it doesn't spend as much time investigating its characters as other Cassavetes movies.
This is not a glossy, "high-concept" film that Hollywood prefers (although Scorsese is certainly not "high-concept"); it is a rough, confusing muddle and that is probably one of the reasons the film remains highly unseen by a great many people.
Begins in tremendous style and is very watchable throughout although one does begin to worry about a certain lack of clarity.
I thought it was brilliantly filmed and acted...and although some of the dialog may come across as trite, you would have had to live the life of years ago to get it.
It's atrociously bad, although sometimes it's funny.
He is a fine writer, although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others.
And Karen, although she is not in the book, is a good addition, because she adds a layer to Michael that makes him more adorable because he resists her and holds out for Jessie, his true love!
Jessie, although only 13, isn't treated like a baby, even when she messes up.
You know what they say, everything that goes around... although the short-short jogging shorts worn by Rex with the to-the-knees sweat socks probably won't make a comeback.
The acting by Robert Brown as the mad (matter) Lazarus was over the top by even my standards (I consider Shatner an excellent actor) although his sane twin was done much better.
But the sentiment behind it is very much appreciated (although it was already being "covered" by Nichelle Nichols - still never too much of a good thing).
Dramas and Romances are usually movies I tend to avoid like the plague most of the time, although on occasion I sit through one or two every so often to remind me that men & women have the same basic emotions and that it is possible to get along and be happy.
That was the only time I felt any sense of the joy of the classic "Peanuts" specials, although I did get kind of a kick out of Thurl Ravenscroft singing "No Dogs Allowed" whenever Snoopy saw a sign with that on it.
Unlike the first movie, here both Peppermint Patty and Woodstock appear, although Marcie is still missing.
From the gorgeous Marie-Sophie L., Beatrice Dalle, Vincent Lindon, the cast, although familiar faces in Lelouch's films, all show their talent.
A fun movie that although it is not going to change the world gives you a moment away from the day's trials and tribulations.
It's delightfully goofy, although not without precedent--to an extent it resembles the alien insect from Invader/Lifeforce (1996).
It's also wonderfully gory in some parts, although it's mostly bug gore, but that tends to have a higher "ewww" factor for me than human gore.
The Urdu couplets, although all very good, seem to hold back the flow a bit.
The final derailment off a bridge looks real too, although can't be sure.
The film packs action western, riders pursuits,emotion,shoot outs and is quite entertained .Besides contains good feeling as the friendship,faithfulness and companionship although was betrayed for one of them on the final.The trio young players is phenomenal,they will get much success in the future,especially Ron Howard(American Graffiti) with a successful career as director(Beautiful mind,Cinderella man,Da Vinci Code);Charles Martin Smith as famed secondary(Starman,Untouchables);Gary Grimes(Summer of 42,Class of 44) as starring of Westerns with similar role of naive cowboy(Cahill US Marshal,CulpepperCattle) though nowadays he is retreated.And, of course, the great Lee Marvin ,he makes a terrific acting.
On the other side of the camera we have director Victor Fleming, a man who has been largely ignored by film historians despite his importance, although thankfully that trend is starting to be reversed.
This director showed it all in one film & Madhuri Dixit acting showed that although it looked like a defeat, you need to try your best, get up your courage & face your demons whether it be 10 years ago or 5 years ago.
The script, although dated, is often very funny and draws some fine characters, making the craziness that goes down pretty involving even while the technical ineptitude is offputting.
Also we must remember that although its important for the film industry to grow and evolve, its equally as important not to lose what is inherently our Indian identity which is apparent in the songs and the emotional quotient of hindi movies.
It isn't without it's faults, Rufus Sewell although adequate, doesn't steal the show (much like Keanu), and the talented co-stars (k. Sutherland, Connelly & Hurt) aren't utilised as well as they could be.
If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces.
To provide suspense, she mentions that just about the time their window of opportunity for being rescued will end, her clothes are going to wear out (although that would presumably open different windows of opportunity.)
--- [2] It was a nice touch to make the T-Rex's eyes blink (although that apparently left only about $10 for the rest of the costume.)
We are treated to many dinosaurs that, although not the most realistic looking, are quite effective and are integrated well into the movie and the overall storyline.
One does not need to see the original to get that, although it certainly helps with this one, especially since Alfonso Freeman (Morgan's son) is so darned dead on with his impersonation of his father.
Adam & Evil most resembles a Friday the 13th (1980) or The Burning (1981) rip-off with teens being killed in & around a camp, the identity of the killer is kept a mystery until the end when there's a twist & the killer is revealed although one has to say the title sort of gives away who it is.
The film looks pretty good actually although there's not much tension or build up to the kills & they do tend to come & go a bit suddenly.
It apparently got an R-rating, although I suspect it's more due to the kids using the F-word every 30 seconds than gore or nudity.
Though after factoring in this "film's" collection of some of the least talented "actors" (although I'm still convinced they were pulled directly from a local High School Theatre 101 class), we decided that a worse film script might be possible...but it would be impossible to purposely find a worse cast.
this is quite superior to most of Disney's other films in that it is good for adults as well as children, in fact this was probably the only Disney film i liked as a kid (bedknobs and broomsticks is an exception) i usually preferred Disney's cartoons as opposed to their films i have to give this a 7 out of 10 far better than it's three sequels, although Herbie goes to Monte Carlo is nearly as good
This does have classic Hitchcock suspense moments though (although the best one comes towards the end).
John Steinbeck's story was cleverly adapted by Jo Swerling, although it appears Ben Hecht was also a collaborator in the screen play.
Bob Hoskins raves and fights against a world that is rapidly moving beyond his control and, although he is an unpleasant, violent and vicious character, you end up caring for him.
It is very off the wall, and although others have said that it has disjointed dialogue etc, that's what's intended, and it is more like real life in a remote Cote d'Azure fort with such an odd bunch of people would be.
There is a gratuitous titillating surprise for you, although you might have trouble standing up when the lights pop up.
This movie, although a bit on the lengthy side at 2 and a half hours, keeps you pretty much involved the entire way.
The vintage film-clips are cleverly inserted into the plot, so that we get a dream cast, their lines and actions woven even if tenuously into the narrative, although ironically the poorer film-quality of some of their scenes work against the glossier quality of the modern camera-work.
Martin's by turns quirky and laconic delivery works well in context although Rachel Ward, pretty as she is, seems too lightweight in her part, although she does have some considerable footprints to step into (Bette or Lana she isn't).
Set in 1980 in Michigan (although there's not a lot of difference between the show and the real life high school experience now), the show follows the "freaks"- ie.
The acting isn't the greatest in all places although some of it is just fine.
But, at least they did try here and there to do something a little different (both in story elements and special effects), although it was still a bad movie.
As anyone who's read any of my other reviews can see, I like cheap thrills just as much as a good movie, and although Bones certainly was cheap, cheesy, silly, and not in the slightest bit scary, I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd thought I would.
The film is very well done but apart from that, I think it shouldnÂ´t disappoint any fan of horror, it has everything that a good movie of the genre must have, including great amounts of blood, a very good rhythm and effective actors such as Pam Grier(Jackie Brown), the muse of blaxploitation genre from the seventies, a genre which is paid homage in this movie as well as some classics of the genre such as "Hellraiser" or "Reanimator", although the introduction of the comic element paying homage to that movie was for me the weakest element of the whole(it broke the so tenebrous atmosphere).Finally, director Ernst.
Unfortunately, the close-ups of her false monster teeth are laughable, although her creepy eye contacts and furious facial expressions work a bit better.
The acting is exactly as uninspired as you could imagine, although Dawn Wildsmith as Zeitman's evil assistant and Fox Harris as Lynn's agent are a reasonable amount of fun.
The actors themselves are attractive and well-dressed, so much eye-candy:) If you liked "Hell" (the French one) and/or "London" you'll probably like this one as well, although this one is put in a less self-destructive way than the mentioned movies.
No gratuitous sex or violence, although rather large portions of both.
As the series came to a close, however, I became less interested in the Cadena family, although both the scene where Chato killed the policemen who raped him, and the scene where their uncle strangled the senator with a garote were both very exciting.
After having enjoyed the first two episodes of "Kingpin," I was a bit disappointed in the third installment of the series, although it had its moments, the canine shootings not being among them.
If the last three episode are real strong, I think viewers will have found memories of "Kingpin," although daring to be different is not a guarantee of everlasting popularity.
although it wasn't a very popular nor original film i still liked it.
People unfamiliar with John Wayne's vast filmography are often surprised to discover he actually starred in a Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza, although everybody seems to recall "The Film with the Octopus" that Wayne made (it was actually a giant squid, but that's really unimportant).
Also this was probably the first time I saw John Cusak in anything (although still my favorite film of his is "Better Off Dead").
I have always found that although his films are impressive visually, the dialog and acting is purely secondary at best.
At least the special effects were serviceable, if not superior to some recent feature films (although is it really saying much to proclaim that it looks better than Catwoman?).
When the grown A.C. first comes into the show, looking like a California beach dude, I was like "Oh No....This is going to be some Dawson's Creek, contrived teenage drama..." But actually, A.C. shows some depth in his character to make it interesting (although all the characters are pretty simple).
The acting needs serious work as well although I was glad to see Vin Rahmes and Lou Diamond Phillips bring some seasoned professionalism to the show.
I do believe it had good potential to float although the pilot in some ways felt weak to me.
The great British actress Flora Robson plays their mother in a colossal bit of miscasting but since her role is minimal she retains her dignity (although some of the lovey-dovey exchanges with her movie son Raft are borderline incestuous).
In every place the ship stops Rosa Maria and Maria Joana take side trips to see the interesting sites that although touristy, they hold a special significance and serve to advance the story.
I never saw a De Oliveira movie before this, although he is considered by Italian critics one of the most important directors alive.
Helen sees the inner man without being able to see the physical one, and although as I said he's a killer he gives the impression of a very human, tragic figure.
This is probably more the director's fault than the actress's, although some blame should also go to the screenwriter, who has the unfortunate habit of substituting her own annoyingly mediocre narration and dialogue in place of the often brilliant language that's readily available in Dodie Smith's novel.
She was intelligent, articulate, and although towards the end of her spell on death row appeared wildly deluded, was arguably not insane: her view of the world may have been wrong, but it did make sense.
The anamorphic Paramount DVD uses an excellent print although I think the widescreen is a bit too cropped on both top and bottom.
While I agree it doesn't touch Band's older films like Trancers, Subspecies, or The Puppetmaster, I'd have to admit that Blood Dolls ranks as one of his better endeavors, although it feels like the movie was made without a polished script, featuring themes the producer/director depends on entirely(..his resume shows that psychotic dolls are perhaps his favorite thematic element in killing folks)for any success.
Mind you, after reading the rave reviews from other fellow IMDb viewers, I don't find this one the "cream of the crop" of B-Horror films, it has the same standard elements of B-Horror films such as graphic gore, OK Acting, and contrived (although still fun) occurrences throughout the movie.
Recommended, although be prepared for the film's third-act fumble.
I like that the concept that gay is wrong wasn't the only thing pointed out although it was the point of the documentary.
And still the film doesn't degrade Christianity in any way, and although I'm far from a Christian myself I found that to be very refreshing.
People who are looking for quality cinema of any kind should avoid this, although I dare say it is hardly "the worst movie ever made," unless hyperbole is the only means by which you can communicate.
The characters, although somewhat outlandish at times, are not overly ridiculous - for anyone with any doubts, pick up a copy of "Variety" or "People" to see what fame can do to person.
The film is great although the depictions of slavery as a genteel Southern quirk are more than a little cringe worthy.
All in all, this is worth watching, with no real slow patches, although as one might expect martial arts fans Â and lovers of straight-to-video chock socky - will laugh the most.
Although I'd heard of Crumb (mainly through American Splendour I wasn't that aware of his work although some of his cartoons were images that I'd seen before.
Davis is wonderful as Julie, giving one of her best early performances, although I can't see what she sees in Fonda's Pres Dillard!
Tyrone Power is also in it, although he is pretty much wasted in a rather small role.
She meets ironically the same end as Marie Antoinette although with hardly as much dignity.
Although the moral of the story is not my way of thinking and although the end is pretty psycho(let Paul loose in another city),it is a very good movie about New York in the 70's.
He grudgingly admires Kersey's resolve, although he is sworn to put a stop to the killings.
Very good film from director Wyler, although it is its star, Bette Davis, upon whom its high quality mostly rests.
Dr. Stein is one of those "mad doctors", although he's not "mad" in the sense.
Of course, Blacky goes around killing his victims; although he seems to have an agenda when it comes to his slayings.
The special effects, although not without their bad shots, are generally very good.
He just lets the JSDF hit him with everything but the kitchen sink, to no good effect, although the Full Metal Missiles did kinda' do a number on him.
Let's face it - these buildings very nearly dwarf Godzilla; although technically larger than ever before in the series, he looks smaller because of the urban growth he has to wade through.
The fact is, the world around Godzilla is becoming ever more complicated; the film-makers are pretty savvy about it, but many audiences, although more sophisticated about such matters than they were in the 1960s, clearly feel uncomfortable with even minor renovations in the series, since these frequently reduce Godzilla in stature, in comparison with the legendary city-stomper of old.
Sean Connery isn't at his true best, although he is believable in his non Bond role and Donald Sutherland isn't given enough chances to really develop his character.
The original palace burned down in 1936, but the model (although it looks like a model) is a nice reminder of the time and place.
I've noticed there are a couple of posters/viewers who believe that Pierce was the one who strangled Clean Willy, although we do see Sean Connery's character was seen by Willy and that's why he runs, we don't ever see Pierce actually chasing Willy as he runs through the city streets.
The film apparently is a fairly accurate adaptation of the novel although the end is changed slightly & a subplot involving a 12 year old prostitute was also dropped.
I liked the character's, Sean Connery's character in particular is very suave & likable, I love the innuendo filled conversation he has with Edgar Trent's wife, Donald Sutherland's key maker Agar provides good support although in the book it was he who turned Pierce into the police & there's plenty of colourful Victorian character's to flesh the film out as well.
The film has a decent pace although it's not the most incident packed ever made, the film has lots of great sequences from the tension filled scenes where they steal & copy the the keys to the exciting climax where Pierce has to make his way across the roof of a speeding train.
Animal lovers should beware, although not in the UK since it's cut, because there's a ratting scene where a dog attacks some rats.
Davis refused to work with Flynn and angrily turned down the part, although Selznick did not intend to agree to Flynn regardless.
Critchton's direction has never been better, although I feel the film is perhaps 10 or 15 minutes overlong.
In essence, not all that different from his James Bond character, although in this film he is given enough invention & ad-lib to make the character more rounded than the rather one-dimensional Bond.
Despite his somewhat nasty character Olivia falls for gregory harrison who although already has a fiance and in true disney fashion all ends happily with Olivia getting to keep her house and is given a framed drawing of her two daughters by harrison.
This is a great family movie, especially for those with younger kids, although it has many scenes more older kids and adults would understand.
As my first viewing from the newly released Warner Film Noir Volume 4 boxset, I found it an unmitigated success, there's also a hilarious and very entertaining commentary from Noir luminaries Eddie Muller and James Ellroy, although the latters barking like a dog does grate just a little
Pretty cheesy 80s film, few but strong horriable words, but yet the crooks do come up with a pretty (although sick) clever scheme when they get Chucky and Bingo.
I could go on at greater length about how bad Tony Todd is (although he does the best he can with what little he is given), or the excrutiating dialogue, but I won't waste my time or yours.
In the previous instalments he had such an intimidating and foreboding presence whereas here, although he tries, it is impossible to take his character seriously and while he is certainly the most accomplished actor amongst the group his talents are wasted with a completely worthless script featuring some of the worst sustained dialogue it has been my displeasure to have ever heard.
Bronson went on to become the #1 box office star in the World (although not #1 in the USA), herein playing a street punk rather than crime fighter.
I finished reading the novel two days before seeing the movie, and although it had it's differences to the novel, I was gripped.
ENDURING LOVE is not for those who suffer from immaturity, ADD, or Mainstreamitis, although I find the three ailments are often interchangeable.
The score and cinematography is as integral to the success of the film as the script, which I found perfectly satisfactory, although Tresdodge is right when he says the opening sequence of the ballooning accident is the best moment of the film.
In recent years he seems to have found a role as novelist to the middle classes - the message is: Look although we may appear to be comfortable and well-off, nasty things happen to us!
He started to curb joint efforts with Stanton and Anthony on woman's rights, claiming that it just was not the time (although his previous argument had been to strike when the fire was hot!).
Some of the ideas from that time still resonate these days, although there is no comparison.
The ending in the comic was much better, although it might have been difficult to recreate it in a movie (anyone seen a nicely done ageing-makeup in a movie?
And although she doesn't get as much screen time as Birch, she's equally impressive.
These two are somewhat similar to the central villains in the first Star Wars trilogy - Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, although it is doubtful that either of these legendary movie villains would have tolerated the many failures that Zoltar endured.
After the excellent BBC version of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles', I was really looking forward to 'The Case of the Silk Stocking', although not in general a great fan of Conan Doyle.
The sets and costumes are wonderful, although many of the scenes are awfully foggy, even for London.
Rathbone is one, although I think seeing what Hollywood did to Watson would make Conan Doyle retch.
With Tim Blake Nelson's picture, although you're not physically there, The Grey Zone works as a tour through this place worse than hell.
I think it was brave to make a film that didn't fall into making stereotypes of Asians or gays (although a queer man doing drag is old hat) and the choice of very attractive leading ladies doesn't hurt either.
Some Italian dialogue makes me wonder if I have accidentally gotten hold of a dubbed copy, but my fears are thankfully never confirmed - although I doubt that the Italian dubbing mafia could've done a worse job at characterization than the American cast.
This movie had such a cult following that although it's not listed here, and I have yet to see it, there was a Captain American 2.
Still, although The Navigator and Sherlock Jr. were excellent, they still don't quite measure up to Keaton's crowning achievement.
), although this is a lot less thoughtful and a lot more fun.
Lynda really makes this film, although this is quite a good, fun film that was ahead of its time but a bit behind ours.
It's best labeled as dark comedy although there are various tone shifts throughout the movie.
But trying to make a movie based upon a play in 1912 when cinema was silent is quite difficult; so if you haven't read the play, is possible that sometimes you find yourself puzzled about what is going on, although restored titles summarize the plot well.
Fortunately, it's creepy atmosphere and the high tension it creates almost make up for this big flaw, although it is still noticeable.
It's a bloody good time to watch, although it's not scary, but the fun factor makes up for it.
TARZAN FINDS A SON is a grand scale production and the only one in the series set in a time frame of more than the standard months or weeks, in this instance, five years, although the movie itself gives the impression of taking place solely in 1939 instead of from 1934 to the present, especially since Maureen O'Sullivan's 1940s hairstyle is evident throughout, but otherwise, makes little difference to the plot since it's the story and action the viewers come to see.
Suitable for family viewing for the most part although a scene or two may disturb more impressionable kids.
I don't know that much about the real Linda McCartney although I am a Beatles fan but that didn't make the story any less beautiful.
Now I have seen more than my shares of bad acting in low budget movies, but Dorothy's acting although rough around the edges, still have more room to grow, that is, if she was to allow to develop her skill.
The movie doesn't really have that many memorable moments, although the dance sequences are definitely fun, original and amusing.
As this movie is actually much older than me, I'd like to recommend it to anyone who likes sweet, personal and somehow British-like comedy, although I failed to persuade any of my friends to watch it--they think it's just wicked to watch a movie made in 70s which is not famous.
Diane is very pretty in this movie, although I think now she looks rather cruel when she is serious, but man i liked her dresses so much I hardly noticed her acting (sorry, can't help it as a girl).
The style of animation is similar to that in The Simpsons although the characters look more human.
Their work for his delivery firm takes them to a variety of strange worlds although not all of their adventures are on alien planets, some involve the professor's strange inventions and others just involve them living their lives on 31st century Earth.
The voices featured were all great (although Fry always just made me think of Stimpy...).
It's geared to kids in the age range of 4-8 and not adults - although I thought it was cute the first time I watched.
The outcome may or may not be satisfactory to some, including myself but it was still entertaining, although I certainly could see it going the other way.
Clark Gable is the successful publisher, newly married to society lady Myrna Loy who, although very modern and not jealously disposed, begins to suspect that he is carrying on an affair with his bleach-blonde secretary, Jean Harlow.
Fortunately, it's only 85 minutes long, although those last 45 minutes may seem like an eternity.
It's pretty much ridiculous and can be taken as a comedy, although I'm relatively sure it was never intended as one.
Very poor production values, although the orbital weapons platform parts looked pretty good for a bad film, the rest of the film is hazy and crappy, and poorly lit.
This may be one of the more underrated Canadian sci fi movies of the 80s, although much of the plot and characterizations goes way lame in the second half.
It's not without it's humorous jabs at both the upper and lower class and although it's rather over the top, Charles Laughton's performance is almost enough to carry the film alone.
The famous Kansas City massacre did have a bad effect on his public image although not as immediately influential in bringing him down as shown in The Boss.
I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since.
It is no wonder that out of all his candidates he chose Karas - the film's tune is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a film and its music I have ever seen (although "JAWS" is up there with it).
I felt that the actors did well in the roles that they played, although this is not one of Michael Douglas's best roles (I think one of his better performances was in Romancing the Stone, or Wall Street).
Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen are sublime (and convincing) as the lead characters, and for those who complain about A Perfect Murder being a remake, or for those who complain about the older man/younger woman relationship, (something for which other movies such as Entrapment are guilty of too) put those two facts aside and remember that this is just a movie, cleverly made, with more surprises than an episode of Melrose Place (although I can't say that show appeals to me).
Gwyneth Paltrow as Emily Bradford Taylor is also a great character, because although she is having an affair with another man, she's prepared to come clean with her husband before he tries to have her murdered.
I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better.
Possibly the most visible blunder is that the murder set-up is far from perfect, although that's rivalled by silly plot holes like the one in which Douglas goes to Mortenson's apartment to retrieve his wife's wedding ring, thereby removing evidence of a connection between them, but neglects to do anything about the six-foot-wide painting OF HER FACE.
And although it doesn't come close to informing the viewer about what Vietnam was like, it tries admirably.
I don't know how accurate the history really is, but I do know that the remnants of Napoleon's band of loyal followers DID establish a community in the Southern part of the US at about the same time that Andrew Jackson was fighting The Battle of New Orleans with the help of, (although not mentioned in this film), Jean Laffite who may have been a pirate, but preferred to be called a free-booter.
The acting is alright, I liked Travolta (who was apparently paid $7,000,000 for this) as the villain in particular but he does come across as a bit theatrical at times, I thought Mathis was fine as the love interest although I thought Slater was a bit bland & forgettable as the hero.
From the get go this movie had Woo written all over it....the slow motion shots, the double guns, John Travolta, and the Mexican stand off - although this time with a gun and a knife.
The final showdown is laughable as Riki runs out of bullets and the bad cop doesn't shoot Riki (although he has a loaded gun) and just lets Riki run about 20 yards towards him with a sword and impales him on the front gates.
The same goes for the guys (although Michael T. Weiss and Gordon-Levitt try).
The film shows that it is a low-budget labor of love, and although the fashions and beauty standards are dated, I can't wait for it to come out on DVD (hopefully with lots of behind-the-scenes information and trivia).
It is so good that although there are many talented supporting actors, Rosalind Russell is the pivotal character.
Mike Jitlov sold his soul to devil for this film, the agent for the devil in this case was in this case Richard Kaye(the films producer) although this is yet to be confirmed.
The film contains some grim subject matter that may seem like unlikely fodder for a screwball comedy (murder, attempted suicide, and public execution are all touched upon), although the film somehow manages to deal with such topics respectfully and without sacrificing any laughs.
However, although graphic, the blood is a really bright red, and has a definite fake look to it.
Kirsten Dunst is completely wasted in a small and weepy role as the daughter of a corrupt officer, and Eric Mabius as the Crow has a great presence although his dialogue is quite appaling and clichÃ©d.
Still, although it's not perfect, The Crow series is one of my personal favorite movie series.
Another pro for this movie is that although it is a local movie, it draws attention to pure feelings such as love and innocence.
In the end, she has forgiven the boy, although for a "trick" he didn't play.
There are some artistic and original sequences that I rather liked, although that also is what makes "Birth" a movie that not just for everyone.
I said good but this show is amazing...  After watching the first episode most people will discard it as a kids show, personally, I wouldn't let my kids anyway near this show, although I like horror movies and shows it's really rare for me to feel horror myself, this show though, did it like no other.
The story takes place in a small village, around a group of small kids (I wold guess the ages between 8 and 14, but that's all this is), although the village gives you a warm and soothing feeling, it will, by the end of each story, make you feel isolated and suffocating, the children are perky and sweet at the beginning (a little too much, some will say), are really dark and scary at the begging, The show divide to few stories, all around the same time of the year, it runs as a detective story from different angles, slowly gaining more details about the dark past of the village and it's people.
Terminally boring, although the film's one redeemable feature is the grimy NYC locations.
Harrison Ford was fine as a young actor, although his acting skills did develop considerably in later years.
Thus, we get frequent extremely dull conversations about the defection of Hess, the progress of the Wehrmacht, and anti-Nazi sentiments amongst the German intelligentsia, and not nearly enough time devoted to the lesbianism, sado-masochism, violence and extreme decadent behaviour that is normally associated with the genre (although a hilarious nymphomaniac and a female Hitler impersonator do try their best to liven up proceedings).
Here the film falls even further into risibility, as although these couples are meant to represent (or actually be) real people, they are so one-dimensional, robotic and mono-subject orientated that they seem like no one anyone has even met in this world, rather being dead ringers for the inhabitants of some future Brave New World-type dystopia.
One of the best things of this film is that although much of the cast are children, they aren't the typical annoying brats you see tend to encounter in Hollywood films.
The really creepy thing about this film is that the Nazis, although unquestionably evil, show more restraint against their civilian prisoners than Bob Kerrey showed in Vietnam or that the "Dirty Dozen" showed against the female Germans they burn alive in the climax of that insanely over-praised flick.
The Germans (as expected) are portrayed as ruthless (although, given the context, I thought they might have been portrayed even worse than they were.)
Gorehounds should get their jollies from this one although something tells me that they are just going to bitch about how it wasn't gory enough.
As the latest take on the TCM franchise, the film, beyond being a terrific and not-for-the-squeamish horror picture, adds to the TCM mythology and illuminates the dementia behind America's most ghoulish family, although it fails to provide an truly adequate psychological explanation or rationale to the events of the family's cannibalistic origin beyond suggestion that they were a survivalist reaction to circumstances.
It took a little getting used to because although it was a lot like the first one it was very different.
Characters have a realistic and gritty feel to them, although Barkin is far too beautiful and sophisticated to be a down-on-her-luck single mother.
It's possible I've missed it, but no critic savaging this movie and its premise seems to have cottoned on to the fact that Anna was going mad, although the movie makes it blatantly obvious.
Pacino gives another outstanding performance, and he is beginning to look like the ultimate winner of the Pacino/DeNiro sweepstakes, based on lifetime achievement (although neither career is far from over).
A close friend of mine recommended this movie to me and although it took several days to find it,I finally saw it on NetFlix.
I recommend this movie as well as others like Sexo Pudor y Lagrimas, Amores Perros and Ladies Night although this last one is more like a "chick flick" because there are male strippers, a bachelorette party, many guys and lots of fun!
The acting is above average, although it's quite obvious that the Maroccan actors in this movie aren't very experienced yet, with the exception of Touriya Haoud maybe.
It's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical.
Everyone I introduced to this movie found it difficult to watch, because although the gore is toned down, the spookiness is turned up.
"Kairo" remains interesting in spite of its 2-hour length, although a little editing snip here or there might have made it a little more compact.
Forget all the recent American horror films, although some are excellent they really aren't like this.
This does give it a somewhat dated appearance although it was at least in color.
Che may also be shown in a better light than some would like, although honestly I feel the film is fairly accurate in its portrayal of the man and the history.
Again, those looking for a character piece similar to Stone's portrayal of George W. Bush last year would be wise to reevaluate their will to see Che; although titled after the man himself, and a biopic on a purely ostensible level, Che is more about his fight than the man himself.
Of course, he played gunslingers in plenty of films; but here he manages to convince that he's Polish (although the accent does take a little getting used to).
Often this film is mistaken for Two Comapaneros a much inferior effort although using some of the same actors.
Ching-ling (Maggie Cheung) married Sun Yat-sen, May-ling (Vivian Wu) married Chiang Kai-shek, and Ai-ling (Michelle Yeoh) married H. H. Kung, although his role is minimized.
10/10 GREATEST GAME I've ever seen, next to Final Fantasy X and VII, although I think FFXI will be just as awesome!
Orson Welles is somehow able to tone down his larger-than-life persona and give a good performance, although the makeup job he wears is not very good.
I actually think this film although very overlooked where on the the great noir flicks that launched the entire crime genre cause the mood, the style and the plot can be found in later movies, even the ones made today.
Subsequently I think that if this film is intended for people to show to their parents or mates to illustrate metal in general, then it scores highly (although the old story about Satanism and Black Metal is a little over done - we've heard all that before).
Every metalhead I know who saw this loved it (although equally everyone has some minor disagreement with the metal family tree Dunn presents) but equally everyone who I made watch it with me who was not into metal came away surprised at how interesting and enjoyable it was.
I saw a screening of this on Monday, and although I was pretty skeptical, I must say I was pleasantly surprised.
It encompasses virtually all of metal sub-genres like Hard Rock, Glam, Black, Power (although I have trouble with defining this sub genre in particular), death, prog and thrash.
Attempts to locate Peter Pig have been unsuccessful, although there are rumors that he lives in semi-retirement in Encino, having wisely bought stock in Disney and, later, in IBM.
It's my choice, and I complete it at least 3 times a year to ensure I never forget about it: although that's not very likely.
Almost perfectly cast--River Phoenix as a hacker is tough to accept, although he's fun in the role.
Another problem is that although I enjoyed the show, there were huge changes (mostly unwelcome) in the second season.
The series writing was, despite the bad press it has often received since, pretty exceptional, although there are a few let downs.
This idea appealed to some, but Martin Landau has gone on record for saying that although Freiberger may have helped the show in some aspects, his ideas were (in the opinion of Landau) very boring compared to the way that Season One had been produced.
Whatever your views on the Second Season (I personally like it very much, although it takes time to adjust to Season 2 compared to Season 1) some classic stories were produced during it's time.
I always seemed to associate it with some of the best memories of my childhood, although sometimes I wonder if those memories were so good because I had a show I was so fond of to relate to in my memory.
This was considered pretty shocking in its day--today it's fairly tame (although it would still get an R rating) with gratitous blood, gore and female nudity.
Their differences prove effective as the generator of the comedic effect, although -in my opinion- this movie is also a solid drama rather than a simple comedy.
This is a deeply moving story with superb acting although I didn't reach for the Kleenex.
Here again he nobly steps aside so that she will have a more fulfilling life although he won't be part of it as he has so little to offer, or so he reasons.
After that I kept stumbling across bits of it on different screenings and each time I said to my wife "I kinda like this movie" Tonight I finally managed to watch it from the start and although as a film it doesn't really amount to much it's such a good natured, sweet and enjoyably off kilter movie that it just makes me feel good to see it.
I enjoyed the film very much because it showcased one of the original 'invasion' groups, not because it was an award winner; although it really wasn't all that bad either.
And, although Errol Flynn gets top billing, Bobby Mauch as both the prince and the commoner gets the lion's share of the time on screen.
Errol Flynn, although appearing a little late in the film, gives a great performance as an adventurer who protects what he believes is a delusional boy.
The blood and gore, although unrealistically excessive and unnecessary, looks realistic.
Being an early 80's production, the animation isnt that impressive, although the realistic approach is very good and gives the film some authenticity.
And although this is what many people would just think of as an animation, there are performances that actually seem as though they are real.
Jake Busey as Robert Maine was good, although a small role.
I didn't like it quite as much this time, although it still earned a "B".
Jamie Noble defeated the Hurricane to become the new cruiserweight champ in a decent match although the crowd was really dead in it.
A little more exciting than the first, although I prefer Part one for the music score.
POSSIBLE SPOILER INFO BELOW  This film has a simple plot - although, in my opinion, it is not a plot oriented movie.
The soundtrack is great - I even bought it on CD (although some of my more hip Russian friends refer to it as "otstoy" or "lame").
In Russian, "negr" is the appropriate and non-offensive way to refer to a black person - although it is very harsh on American ears.
Which once again starred Kay Parker,in a smaller, less meatier role, although she still played the same character as in the first.
The formula is exactly the same (and man I really mean exactly), although it follows all of the usual rules of an action sequel, which state that it must have a much bigger budget (Axel still does his police work by his own rules, only this time he uses precinct money to drive around in a Ferrari), more deaths, faster and funnier jokes (it clearly shoots for this one, anywayÂ), and at least one more 6-foot platinum blonde.
It's true that some of the jokes and situations are a little too unoriginal, even only in the first sequel, such as Foley's remarkable ability to come up with crazy stories on the spot (although the best one is where he pretends to be a gay prostitute to get into a ritzy club and harass the bad guy) and his loud-mouthed streams profanity.
Secondly, the introduction of Switchblad Sam was a typical (and oh so tired) Hughes device, although it was surprisingly violent compared to his other films (watching a cute little five year old force feed and then accidentally set a villain on fire was slightly disturbing, to say the least).
As a mystery, it works very fine as well although I think most people might be able to pick out the murderer well before either Withers or Piper.
Cody's famous fight with Cheyenne chief Yellow Hand is also included here although that in fact took place in the 1870s not in 1860.
This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?)
I would guess that one could find his "state of mind" also with a range of uncritical believers of many religions who, although ardently believe stay shallow in their intellectual penetration of their believe and worldly life.
On the other there is a religious order, which although is directed towards spirituality is of course also involved in worldly enterprises and has of course it financial interests.
The plot for this great film is based on an old folk tale from Turkey about a man who refuses to marry the daughter of his spiritual master although he clearly loves her.
"The Dunwich Horror" is much more disturbing, although it bears all characteristics of a seventies movie like the soundtrack and the clothing, but it still works.
The movie follows the story much better than most attempts, although there are certain changes to make it more accessible.
Loved the score by Les Baxter, although it seems, at times, to resemble the background music of a Scooby Doo episode.
And, the face off between Begley and Stockwell as Gidget lays on the sacrificial alter in orgiastic(..under an induced hypnotic state, although one might use that as a description of Dee's performance)bliss is laughable.
LL Cool J was an FBI agent, although he was not dirty.
The nature of the plot, although kept vague was necessary for the internal intrigue to build.
According to Lorne Green, the Cylons are just plain evil, but I'm not sure "evil robots" is all that meaningful, although I did have an evil calculator once.
They appear to have removed most of the annoying matte lines from some scenes, although a few garbage mattes are visible.
Wives frequently did not love their husbands and, although they dutifully provided children, they were often happy for him to exercise his virility with paid companions.
It was also a notoriously scandalous film because of child pornography issues (the setting is a New Orleans brothel), which makes it a surprising choice for DVD release in this age of political correctness - although Paramount basically just slapped it onto disc, as it's a no-frills release (with not even a trailer to go with it)!
We get to know the milieu pretty well, although we don't see much of the actual city, only the house itself, its back yard paved with coquina crunching under everyone's shoes, the palms and banana plants, the anoles.
I still have vivid memories of this film, although I saw it in 1986 on India's only public television network called "Doordarshan".
Nancy falls for John, for some reason, and believes in him, although he is becoming convinced that he may be a killer.
Neither could Nancy Guild, although she was attractive enough.
When he gets there, she has a lover visiting her, and although Alyosha judges her, the film itself does not.
I thought the casting was excellent, although none of characters really stood out from the others.
His character is the least trite, although you can somewhat "see him coming" from the moment he enters.
Lastly, the music is all over the place thematically, stylistically and not cohesively or meaningfully - although there are some great players performing.
It had lots of music in it although people didn't burst into fits of singing dialogue.
But no bad language, no visible sex scenes (although we do know it occurred), and overall a delightful film.
A trio of beautiful performances form the heart of this film, although the secondary characters are also crisply compelling.
The first few seasons have been great, and although it has faded a little bit since the start, I will continue to watch this show.
Amos Poe has some kind of Alt -street cred, although now I can't remember for what.
Even the politician/father is more complex than we think at first; although perhaps predictably, because of the career he's chosen, he moves the least of the major characters.
I actually felt Karen Allen's performance was good, although the accent was a bit jarring.
When you look back on the movie, you do realize how everything fits in together perfectly, now that you know everything, although it might seem a little bit muddled halfway through the movie.
The movie is well done, although I think it is hard to watch for most of the people nowadays, since it has that 60's-70's feel to it.
But this entire film was done so well, I can't think of why they're trying to remake it again with Keira Knightly(although I'll probably see that one too, just because I love the story so much).
Jane is, although maybe not for our standards pretty, a very classic beauty, and very much in character.The Bingley sisters are wonderfully arrogant, and Bingley is such a nice guy - not the insipid undecided, but rather too much trusting those he holds dear.
I have the opening melody as my cellphone ring ever since my Cellphone was able too...;)   There are so many little details, over which discussions can be lead for hours and hours, or pages and pages, and this s one of the best parts about the movie - although it gives an interpretation, it is not finite.
The cast is outstanding, although the film's one problem (albeit a very slight one) is the role of Mrs. Bennet, who - although wacky in the book - is completely over-the-top here and quite frequently even annoying.
The Max Steiner score is also very good, although I wish it had been a little more sub rosa.
It was nice to see Kelly McGillis again, although her role was so thinly written it was painful to watch.
They decide to set some seismograph's up near the base of the volcano to measure it's activity, the group set off but hadn't counted on there being a 30 foot genetically created 'supergator' that kills & eats anyone it comes across & it's heading straight for the holiday resort where it has plenty of tasty humans to pick from...  King of the rip-off cheapies Roger Corman strikes again, this straight-to-video Sci Fi Channel creature feature was executive produced by Corman while it was co-written & directed by Brian Clyde & isn't anything particularly special although it passes the time harmlessly enough if you don't expect too much.
What's frustrating about this process is that you barely can see any of the bloody action, although the victims' screams are pretty effective as they are being torn into.
Unfortunately, although this movie features all of the above, it is not one of the good ones.
Its main problem is that the writers have apparently mistaken premise for plot - although it (sort of) makes sense that the Supergator is there (because Kelly McGillis's company made it from a fossil), and that the volcanologists are there looking at the volcano, and that a variety of red-t-shirted and bikini-clad teens are there... that's not *plot*.
And do keep in mind that this movie was made 30 years ago -- the cinematography and over-all feel is kind of dark, although there are some hilarious scenes!
The monsters, although not as scary as the ones in the first two (some are just hilarious), are designed bautifully.
Perry's relationship to his wife, although more involved than his connection with Gruelick, is too cursory and terse to be effective.
It is from a time when horror was about more than hi-tech gory special effects and torture sequences thrown together to make a 'body' of work and although this Hammer box-set is of its time it is a brilliant collection that has also stood the test of time.
(although Hammers 1960's 17 episode series 'Journey to the unknown' was another superior show - shame that was cancelled early).
It's hard to make people age 40 years in one movie, I know, so, director, you have my respect for Adriana, because she really ages perfectly, although when you look carefully, you do see she's only in her 30s instead of her 70s... :)
Crudup's acting is deserving of an Oscar, although sadly it seems unlikely that the Academy will take too much notice of a relatively small budget film and will, as usual, hand out awards for Hollywood blockbusters.
This is a better film than 'Shakespeare in Love', although not as clever; and it's astonishing to me why films so close in quality and subject matter were treated so differently by the public.
There must have been a lot of gay men that were attracted to that world, as was the case with Mr. Keynaston, who might have been bisexual, although that comes as a secondary subplot.
Ned, played with gusto by Billy Crudup, shows an unexpected range, although he has done theatre extensively.
The music score by Max Steiner enhances the film, although it feels obtrusive, at times.
For fans of Angela Lansbury and Dianne Wiest, this is a must-see (although, of course, it's a must-see for everyone).
a dvr that plays back at 300x.What I enjoy the most about the database are the comments posted.Some of the writers should be teaching creative English at the university level although I secretly suspect that all the people who aced those courses didn't get jobs at the New York Times or become mainstream film critics and I know that IMDb reviewers have no reason to distort the truth or are getting paid off.Sometimes the only redeeming social aspect of some of these films are the comments made by the Silent Majority (was that Jerry Falwell or Spiro Agnew who coined that term ?
I enjoyed this trilogy, although I had already seen the full "Dumplings" film which took out most of the surprise element, but even with the disappointment of "Cut" this is still a very worthwhile viewing for anyone into artistic horror.
Each presents their own short visions of horror, although perhaps it's more appropriate to say that although these are horror movies, they are more disturbing than outright frightening.
As anthology films go, this was pretty good, although nothing that anyone will remember in a decade.
DUMPLINGS, in my opinion, had the most "squirm-inducing" scenes, although they were not extremely graphic and mostly implied, and were apparent due to the subject matter of the film.
All the films in THREE...EXTREMES have some decent things going on, although as much as I like a lot of Miike's work, BOX just didn't do a whole lot for me - but DUMPLINGS and CUT were definitely worth the price of admission for these films.
Each section is like a dissertation in horror, although "Dumplings" could also be classified as an exploitation film.
They are each original in their own right, although "Cut" could be compared to the "Saw" or Hannibal Lecter franchises in that there's a psycho who's trying to get a message across by way of murder and mayhem.
Very good action movie that takes the Dirty Harry style more mainstream this time.The story/script here is only average and does not have much depth but the action and Eastwood's charm still makes this film one of the best action movies all time.The deterioration of Dirty Harry movies start with this one but you will still enjoy the action here.Just don't expect a masterpiece.The sound quality was below average.You can tell this film had a B movie budget.The cinematography is also just average although there are great shots of the San Francisco scenery.Only for action fans and big Eastwood fans.....
The supporting cast is also diligently cast, although there's no animal scene-stealer, a la canine performer Asta's memorable turn as Mr. Smith in THE AWFUL TRUTH.
Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children, although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history.
The subtle romantic pieces between Andrew and Sara make it a touching film that although violent never seems nihilistic.
Watch it because although in time the movie is considered cheesy it was what I call a horror movie!
It is a little desperate to save a movie through nationalism, but can actually be fit in here, although it could have been better prepared, by, for instance, by making her a more integral part of London.
Jesse Vint is fine as Mike Colbey, although he spends more time flirting and sleeping about with the women.
The author of the original book was Gabor von Vaszary who wrote it in German although he was a born Hungarian.
The coach was hilarious (although he did go a little over board with the profane language).
This movie, although Korean, also reflects on the other Asian societies where wealth, materialism and self-centredness are overshadowing the importance of kindness and virtue.
Technically the film is OK, although I'm sure that truck at the end changes between a tanker trailer & box trailer... Now on to the best aspect of 976-EVIL, Miss USA finalist Debbie James.
John Waters has made a name for himself by creating odd and twisted films, and although I haven't seen a great deal of them; Serial Mom is his best as far as I'm concerned.
The way Turks are portrayed is offensive, and although "wolves" exist as a right wing fraction in Turkey, they have nothing to do with the stuff they are associated with in this movie.
And although the beginning was suspenseful and good, you will notice the point where the movie breaks ... where it won't only get ridiculous, but the movie also falls to pieces.
and the ending was a twist(i won't say right now)  i recommend this movie for anybody who enjoys movies that don't follow the set pattern of hollywood(the guy gets the girl, the good guy always wins, the bad guy dies, all i good at the end) i AM going to go out and buy this movie(not just because Rachael Leigh Cook is in it, although it is a very good reason to)
And although it does have some pretty well-known actors who generally are known to be able to act, this just never quite comes together, which makes it seem like a serious problem with direction.
It's not because of any religious undertones (although those are botched too), but instead because of the extremely regrettable fact that this script was not anywhere near as engaging as it should have been.
Ringel and his super hot assistant, and other team member figure out and win the case although they know that Mr. Campbell is in fact a disturbed person that gets excited after insulting and raping women.
The film did not have the same emotional affect, however, and although it was still tragic it somehow came across with less impact than the words on the page.
First of all, Billy, although funny, can get annoying occasionally, and sometimes the show overuses potty humor.
And like Emperor's Club, both teachers, although leaving their intangible, yet indelible mark on the young men they taught, are shown to be quite weak and naive in matters of the world and politics.
Besides this incredible teacher, other great characters are: Neil Perry, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, Todd Anderson and even Richard Cameron (although he has the power to anger us at the end because of his attitude).
This concept, although very familiar to audiences today, was something very topical at the time of the film's release and also a matter of great public interest.
Still The Enforcer is a personal favorite of mine for Humphrey Bogart films and I think you'll like it too although when you see it you will see what Bogey did that almost blew the whole case.
The entire sequence of events is well contrived and although you may not laugh out loud, if you listen closely (which is hard to do given Altman's style of overlapping lines) you will be smiling throughout the film.
i agree with a lot of the previous reviews for this film although there are a number of points that i find myself forced to disagree with.
all of the actors played their parts well although they were all cartoon cutout characters.
I still recommend at least one viewing of this movie (I have seen it twice), although you may want to have some sort of medicine on hand.
I was entertained at the very least although I was expecting something else.
A plane crashes in a remote jungle, presumably in South America, although I'm not sure it was stated as such.
Any movie coming out in 2005 and having King Kong in it (although unnamed and in a bit part) is going to suffer badly.
However although the acting was certainly acceptable, the budget for the effects must have been raised by a quick whip round of the stars and crew.
It's an interesting western/prison movie cross-over, although above all the movie remains a western of course with some of its formulaic ingredients, in this movie it's mostly the use of Indians.
As with his unfortunate 1942 reissue of The Gold Rush- with added narration, this music guides the audience too much, although the film's main theme, I must admit, wins you over at the end.
And it's not just the infamous climactic tightrope act, although if for no other reason that's one big reason to see the film as the little Tramp goes haywire with his plans to "safely" go across the tightrope.
I don't know why that would make a difference with the story, but it did as I found it very good for the entire distance, although that's just a scant 69 minutes.
Needless-to-say, the case is not the slam dunk that Willy perceives it to be, and thus we have a battle of wits between Ted and Willy whose ego is just about as huge as Ted's though he is a slight bit less obnoxious - although not by much.
He's only got one case left to handle and, although it looks like a slam dunk on paper, he'll soon find it to be a bit more formidable than he first thought.
It seemed obvious to me where the gun was (although my friends told me after the film they had no idea).
For my part, knowing where the gun was didn't hurt the film at all because although Gosling's battle to solve the case and get a conviction are certainly a core part of the film, 'Fracture' works better as a character study.
Not for kids although because of all that blood and explosing bodies^^  I m not telling the plot... Just watch it.
Nothing seems to connect the crimes except that they seem to take place near bodies of water (although at least one occurs in a bathtub).
Om Prakash is always a pleasure to watch although his role is very small.
I Love this show (although I was a baby when the second series was aired) All the characters are so cool especially Tucker, Garvey, Nancy and Donna.
Well, I've reacquainted myself with it and, although I'm genuinely not the one to exploit yiddishisms, my first thought was "Oy!"
HSM has never been loved for a strong plot, so it's no surprise that although there's now a new focus on college and the future, it's more than a little misrepresented.
Chad might have been wise to realize that although he was saving for a car, Troy was aiming to get a college scholarship.
The character of Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) was i thought not even in half of the movie - and the only good bit was when she stripped and got into her bikini (although I've pretty much seen it all if ya know what i mean!)
It was nice to have his voice in this sequel and the only truly memorable number in the film is the one he and Vanessa sing (Music in Me), although I did like his angst number performance as well.
First, although he had genuine screen presence, Warren William had no talent for close-ups, where his wolfish smile is alienating and undoes his good work in medium shot.
), although simple, as the best often are.
The scandalous best-selling novel by Grace Metalious is brought to life in this somewhat watered-down 20th Century Fox production, although it was still considered shocking and controversial for the time.
Of course, due to Code restrictions, the movie version was watered down, although it still manages to deliver its message.
Lana Turner was great as Constance MacKenzie, although she too did not have enough screen time.
This aspect of the story also had a lot more potential that what was seen, and again, its (sad) resolve was too pat Â although truer-to-life than some of the plots.
I also like the full-length performances by the featured actors, because although I like hearing excerpts of things, I do like to hear them in whole too.
Toy Story (1&2) and Monster&Co were good examples of how to use modern techniques in the context of a good starting idea although I can't help thinking that art of animation the way I knew (and loved) has been certified dead by monstrous photo-realistic productions.
The humor some people pointed out distracted from the film rather than added to it, it was needless for a film of this nature, Gangs Of New York is meant to be about rivalry, revenge and drama, and although there were a couple of places where the dark humor really worked there were too many instances where the humor felt like tacted-on Hollywood cheese.
In the first 2 minutes of the fight, there is absolutely no blood on the ground, on the clothes, faces or weapons of the fighters although all of them are wielding knives, axes, swords and so on.
I thought it was a load of " Â£Â£$%^^$"Â£* Â£$% " he replied " The actors looked like they were all going to burst out singing "   I could see where he was coming from although I didn't disagree with him 100 % .
The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end (because, after all, it is a movie based on a true-ish story), it was incredible to watch how it got that end.
His character (William Cutting/Bill the Butcher) is so complex and although you know you hate him, you can't decide why (for there are so many reasons).
The message that is conveyed, although not an entirely wholesome one, is an important one to learn and, if considered, is very relevant to our time.
The actors/actresses overall do a fine job with the script, although you will catch some flaws along the way, but portraying Midwestern college kids they do not.
After watching this movie, anyone is likely to feel weird about being a health-freak (although there are some good lessons about health).
Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence.
But he did invent the breakfast cornflake, although it was his brother who successfully marketed it.
That should be apparent from the credits on the video box, although the extremely negative posts about this film seem to have missed that fact.
I did enjoy the non-musical clips in this movie, although I thought there were some omissions.
However although it was a rare treat to see them nimbly treading around their props, it looks sadly like two old men going through the motions as Fred and Gene who were at the time 77 and 64 respectively, have neither the speed or agility they both once had, although if I could perform even half as good at either of their ages I'd know I was wearing the years well.
Not quite as good as 'Best In Show' but much better than 'A Mighty Wind' this film is the first he's done that is a straight story instead of a documentary style although he has cleverly woven elements of that in to this film through the actors doing interviews for various television shows and specials.
For me, this was more on the money than "Waiting for Guffman" although I enjoyed that too.
I saw this movie at the Amsterdam Gala Premiere and although I didn't have high hopes for it, it turned out to be even worse.
I think there's certainly scope for more, although the stories would probably be more surreal in order to avoid going over too much of the same material from the first series.
Even Lewis has an acting father - although she has made her own name in the business.
Nicholson's return, although brief, helped this film round itself out.
I can say I actually knew who he was anyway, because he was on One Life to Live and Beverly Hills 90210, although perhaps I should not admit that I ever watched those shows.
(This sequence feels irrelevant to the actual story, although it does serve as a good warning for children who stay up late.)
None of the actors' names are mentioned on the box, although my box was cut, so maybe the names just got cut off.
The awards were evenly handed out and there was no big winner, although "The Departed" of course won the most important awards.
- IMDb has a silly rule about having to have 10 lines of text before they'll allow you to post a comment, so now I have to ramble on although I've already made my point.
He is responsible for keeping the prisoners alive although we know from history that he was brutal in his experimentation on prisoners.
I regret, to this day, that I did not get his autograph (although I did get Vanessa Redgrave's and a few other's).
Harmon Walsh is Johnny, who works under drill sergeant Audrey(..she pretty much orders him around like one, although the hapless guy doesn't do himself any favors)exploding snow which collects on hills.
All in all, this movie is one of the most horrible horror movies ever made, but I gave it three stars, because the last 20-30 minutes were just so plain ridiculous that they made me laugh, and that means the movie entertained me, although not intentional.
Ring O Birthday is a great prequel to the Ring series although the director is not Nakata it is a good drawback to the previously made movies.
Both Midler and Caan are expert performers, but they have remarkably little on-screen chemistry, and although they score points individually they never quite seem to be working in tandem.
Yet Eddie can show a better side (although one that suggests opportunism again and again).
The film is quite well done, capturing the spirit of the UFO shows in wartime London (1944), wartime Korea (1952); and wartime Vietnam (1967) although one song is slightly anachronistic.
I just found it again recently and although the movie looks a bit dated today, it certainly takes me back to a time when individual movie making wasn't that common.
Their destruction by Ladd is welcomed by the post-Pearl Harbor audience watching the film (although Ladd also takes a pot shot at Robert Preston, who is not a traitor but a detective, and does kill a cop).
This movie is appropriate for anyone, although there is this one bad part involving violence.
Later in the series we frequently see instances of Jack attempting to run from his past, although it sometimes consumes him.
We also have our first science/faith talk between Jack and Locke, although it's less of an argument, and more of Jack doubting Locke's explanation of what's happening to him.
Sun thanks Jin for getting her water, and he replies "That's what husbands do," although up til then, we hadn't seen Jin as a particularly desirable husband, and the next episode, "House of the Rising Sun", gives a closer look at Sun's perspective of how he has been on and off the island.
In both stories, he is chasing his father, and although he only catches him in the flashback, the outcomes of both stories are similar in that Jack doesn't get what he's after.
Jack's quest does not end with finding his father, as he wanted it to, although he does find the water that the camp needs, and he steps up and becomes the leader despite failing to save Joanna's life earlier that day.
It is not at all self-indulgent, although it might seem that at first glance.
I saw Gyorgy Palfi's "Hukkle" a few years ago at MIFF and although that was an interesting film, he's really excelled himself with Taxidermia.
although very short the storyline was good, didn't really like the fact that it is a "What If?"
although it got really repetitive, also they could of gave Sam more weapons.
The game, although rather short, is still butt loads of fun to play.
Given that a second, bigamous marriage would in any case have been invalid, though, I'm not sure that Harold needed to put quite so much effort into reaching the altar in time: whether the ceremony had been completed or not, the girl would still have been free to marry her real lover half an hour or so afterwards...  Definitely better than "Safety Last", although perhaps more uneven: danger stunts in themselves leave me fairly cold, but there is some enjoyable character work in this picture.
The story was delightful, and although entirely predictable, was fun to watch.
My only criticism is the message that a "poor boy" can't win a "rich girl" unless he has the money (although in fairness this seemed to be a problem for Lloyd's character and not for the girl.)
Having dispatched of each opponent Ivan removes their (rather crappy) Ninja headbands which he then sends to Gordon as proof of his kill (although I've seen exactly the same crappy Ninja Headbands for sale for about Â£2.00 in martial arts shops so he might as well have bought a few from there and saved himself some hassle)  Finally Gordon is forced to accept the challenge to stop the bloodshed (although as per usual with these films despite ninja being sliced/stabbed etc there is not one drop of the red stuff in sight!!!)
But although there are similarities this is still very much a unique film.
Tony Martin's "Tenement Symphony," although seemingly misplaced in the movie, was great, in that its melody was classic in tone, and Martin's voice only enhanced the overall effect.
The "ditzy" chase scenes towards the finale of the film, although exaggerated, and obviously performed by stunt doubles, and stop-action, or jerky photography, were "over the top" for belly laughs.
Robinson (although he did use some stereotyping) created a character who was not only mysterious, but both an anti-hero as well as deep & complex the likes of which would not be seen for a great long time after.
Meanwhile, good character actors handle themselves convincingly (except for Charles Middleton, who is too much like Charles Middleton, and there is still the question of Fenton's casting, although he performs well).
Overall, I think that the Endless Waltz movie is much better, although the OAV has better background music.
The four cut scenes are not absolutely necessary to the plot line, although Sally's role in the fiasco is much clearer in the movie.
The three men are mere background filler, although Bryan Greenberg ("Prime") looks to be making an attempt at a dimensional character.
This is nearly as ridiculous as "The Clone Wars", although intentionally funny.
Hudson, although seemingly having a bad hair movie, is at her quirky and spirited best playing the strung too tight Liv.
She is the more serious, down to earth of the two and although some have reviewed her character as weak I think she just shows a softer side than Hudson.
These people are the audience for "Bride Wars", although they're not the only ones texting; that's a cancer that has infected cinema going worldwide.
I expected a lighthearted romantic comedy, which I can tolerate although that's not my favorite genre.
Probably a lost film (although I suppose you can find anything on the internet), this could be well worth the research to rediscover.
Munez lives the dream in material wealth, although this starts to get into his head and takes a toil with his relationships, especially with girlfriend Roz (Anna Friel).
I watched the first movie when it released in the cinemas, and although it was highly unrealistic (all the chances he miraculously gets), I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the movie mixed the highs with the lows believably.
There was decent acting, a good story, and as previously mentioned, although a bit far fetched, it made for good watching.
The cameos of famous players were fantastic although I don't agree with the over exposure of Beckham but the other cameos are great.
The film shows how all the fame and fortune of playing football for one of the worlds biggest clubs can get too your head, his girlfriend and he fallout and she goes back to England and even at the end we don't know where there relationship will go (although me and some of my friends agreed that they will get back together)  In the end David Beckham scores the winner for Real Madrid (With Munez and Harris getting the others) against Arsenal to win the Champions League Final 3-2!
Worse than Vanilla Ice's 'Cool as Ice' (although ya'll gotta check that out to hear how he says 'horse'...that alone is worth the rental price).
Good luck with your next project, Jim, although I'm not expecting one.
The studio ought to be sued for the hour and a half this took off of my life (although it felt like much longer) .
While the core of the film is still oriented around fast cars, hot chicks and zany humour, the film's light-hearted French comedic ambiance has been replaced with a dirtier, more strident, and somewhat more serious American action-comedy feel, which, although it tries hard, doesn't quite translate as it should.
Comedy has a fast pace, impressive cinematography (although the swooping crane shots in traffic get repetitive) and some good car chases, but the screenplay needed an overhaul.
Chaney is much better than you might expect, and although obviously not in the same vampiric league as Lugosi, is much more credible than John Caradine, who starred as Dracula in others in this series.
I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.
I always enjoyed how Quince solved complex cases, although he dealt with the dead it was similar to House or CSI probably more CSI.
Well, perhaps it was because although you knew what to expect in general, the shows were very creative in how they thought out the murders.
In order to survive, she must now pretend that von Starker has succeeded in breaking her, and become his lover...  With scenes of mass extermination, violent rape, and general lack of respect for human life, Canevari's sick flick is certainly disturbing; although not packed with the the wall-to-wall gore that one might expect, the sheer nastiness of some moments make this one hard to stomach at times.
And although I imagine the makers never intended to provide any laughs, I defy anyone to not giggle at the moment when Lise is suspended above flesh-eating rats (actually rather disinterested gerbils) or the 'sex' scene between Lise and the doctor, which consists of several minutes of them rolling around together naked, but never actually seeming to bother with any serious boning!
Every single minute caught my attention and although I can't really remember most of the specific details or sub-plots; I can say without fear of being wrong that this is a spectacular sci-fi/action flick in all the sense of the word.
Anderton is a man who uses this opportunity to battle personal demons, although it only partly works.
Which is the final say in the idea that the future is misinterpreted and although appears to be all wonderful with problems is in fact the opposite.
)and some pretty decent kills,with a good amount of gore.there are your typical teen stereotypes getting high out in the wilderness.the problem is,the movie takes too long to get to the gore and really good kills.once the blood starts flying though,it doesn't let up.the movie borrows a bit from the 1981 movie "Wolfen",giving us some shots from the creatures point of view.other than this movie and "Wolfen",i haven't seen that done in any other movie.not that it's a great effect or anything,but it is something most movies of the genre don't employ.the acting isn't that great and some of the dialogue is pretty bad,to say the least.However,i really liked Dione Updike,who plays Aimee,Johnston,one of the game wardens who hunts the creature.She was very convincing in her role and easy on the eyes too.finally,the creature itself.not quite realistic looking,but not as bad as some movies of the genre.oh,yea,the creature is basically,half man,half wolf.the difference is,it retains the intelligence of man.i guess you'd call it a werewolf,although they never actually say the word in the movie.the ending i thought was kind of odd.overall,though, the movie is entertaining and should satisfy gore hounds.
Even as an 11-year old I thought Lon Chaney Jr. was an odd choice to play the Dracula role, although I was a Chaney fan since I had seen "The Wolf Man."
The rest of the cast is ably filled as well: Paige and Albritton are unusually animated although, admittedly, their roles aren't those of the typical Universal leads; Bromberg makes a fine Van Helsing surrogate and Craven is equally good as the practical town doctor suddenly coming face to face with the supernatural; Evelyn Ankers and Samuel S. Hinds' roles are subsidiary ones and certainly straightforward in comparison but their presence in such films is always welcome.
The film just explains it all away as psychoses and nothing more -- although in the real world of 1947 psychiatry that probably wasn't uncommon.
She eventually accepts widower Massey's marriage proposal, explaining that it's terrible for a woman to be unwanted, although she's not in love with him.
This lack of transition really annoys me, although I can't exactly pinpoint why Â I guess the whole thing just feels rushed.
The film is involving, although having seen some of these melodramas prepares us for all possible answers.
Van Heflin, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have been the obvious choice for David, although he was an excellent actor, but in this movie doesn't have much to do.
I count this as one of my favorite movies, although let me state I have about 1,000 favorites!
I was really very surprised to hear that his favorite things are, respectively ***SPOILER*** Philly Cheese Steaks (although we later learn that he likes those big New York pretzels) and purple ***END SPOILER*** His daughter Milla, played by Brynn Lucas, is a naive, young girl who wants to love her father, despite him not really knowing her.
Lastly, I think the title says it all - although there are people who seem to think that this is just a common sequel title used back then and is not meant to be taken literally.
This movie, although extremely realistic and sometimes strong, shows optimism when two persons realize that above the problems, they still love each other and then decide to fix this marriage.
In this country, Lucky Luciano is one of those 20s legends who have so often been glamorized in movies; we tend to be fascinated by such characters, and although films tend to either explicitly condemn them or show them coming to bad ends, they are among the most infallibly popular Hollywood staples.
The other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with.
Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people.
Thoughtful plot twists as players strive to gain the upper hand (although intricacies of the embezzlement eluded me).
It is genuinely humorous, does not take itself seriously and the characters although stereotyped are very likable (but definitely far into the weird side even for someone who has played fantasy games).
I could however see it being a barrier for people unfamiliar with Scottish slang, although if someone could understand "Trainspotting" they should have no trouble with this movie.
As somebody who came to university in Glasgow and found outlets for my more esoteric habits I found myself nodding and laughing redolently at many points, although I should add that I was never into the fantasy role playing contained herein.
Most of it gives me a laugh although it gets repetitive and predictable after a while and it's not so funny.
I personally hate the vulgar humor sported by Madtv, but for some reason Little Britain doesn't seem to bother me, although it is more crude.
The fat jealous women is funny although it can cross the sexual line a bit.
I am a fan of this show, as the skits they do are often very, very funny and disturbing, although I must admit that I wish the repertoire of skits was greater.
The movie is wonderful at how it displays this story and the various characters although it is sad at various times, but if you are looking for an interesting and compelling and sensitive story about real life you will enjoy this one.
Electric Shadows is such a charming film that you'd find it hard to believe it's actually a first film, balancing drama, comedy and tragedy even with great aplomb, although there were some series of coincidences in the events and characters that you'll find it easy to ignore for the whole movie to work.
I have never actually hated one of his movies (although I never saw Little Nicky, nor do I want to), but Anger Management actually begins a new category.
That said the movie finishes well (although totally unbelievable) and ends up as a comedy film you'd be silly to miss out on.
It also bothered me that although Slim was complicit in George's act (by not trying to stop him), he stopped the sheriff to point out George.
This is one of the funniest movies ever made and Jim Carrey's funniest although Dumb and Dumber and Liar, Liar are close.
Yes, although listed at IMDB as 'Barnacle Bill' it's actual release title is "All at Sea" this story of a sea sick sailor made hero tickles the funny bone and warms the heart.
Since he was a beginning actor and this was a Grade B-type of production, I didn't except it to be so entertaining, although now that I've watched a lot of early '30s films, I am not surprised.
It's not a hilarious comedy, although it is quite funny.
The whole movie in general doesn't hold a candle to the original, although it is still entertaining enough.
The plot, which centers on religiously-inspired vigilante justice, has an air of being somewhat cliched, although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.
Plus, although Reeve's character is Harvard educated, that's all we know about his character.
I think that Reeve does a decent enough job in the lead, although it's definitely true that his co-stars fare much better.
This movie, although very rich and lush visually, contains none of the marks of a Hollywood "production".
Like most mysteries, once the cat is out of the bag it loses much of its grip, although the explanation is quite satisfying.
The acting was more than acceptable and, although the genius of the child was, perhaps, not completely credulous, it also wasn't totally unbelievable.
The film itself has a fundamentally creepy atmosphere throughout but as with many prequels never really equals the original story, in this case never really delivering the same level of suspense, (although it does come close a couple of times), and failing to shock in the way the original did with Sadako being a silent Reagan, (The Exorcist), type character staring at you hatefully through a horrifically blood shot eye, peering through a nest of slimy, sinister, long black hair.
Mitchum is a rather amiable, self-confident, yet low-key lead who's easy to watch, although his fight scenes are indeed hard to swallow.
The killers are completely callous and, although the numerous crotch stabbings are not explicitly shown, the sheer offensiveness of the acts (coupled with some suitably yucky sound effects) is enough to upset most 'normal' people.
In one of the first scenes I really got thrilled by the horse racing, although they were just two cartoons "risking their lifes", I felt as if that scene needed a stunt!!!
This delirious movie begins almost as a comedy, although there is always an edge.
one of the best anime's on the planet!although difficult to understand-i.e.
The supporting cast is also diligently cast, although there's no animal scene-stealer, a la canine performer Asta's memorable turn as Mr. Smith in THE AWFUL TRUTH.
OK, the story isn't its strength, well it could be although it is taken out of the bible, though some of the scenes very really moving, not just because of some superb animations (especially everything covering the presentation of H2O).
Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children, although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history.
It was cleverly written, and although oftentimes seemed a bit TOO much like a copy or parody of the Indy series, it always saved itself in the end.
Put aside all of the talk about technique and animation achievements (although these are done excellently) and enjoy the story for its triumph and splendor of the delivery of God's people.
I loved "Queen Bee", because it made me laugh at such meanness, although I've known a lot of those people, too.
Jack Ryan III confirms why he can't be a James Bond for the nineties - he's just too boring, although Ford does try his hardest.
The movie itself is enjoyable to watch, if you can punch through the Spanish actors struggling with their English, and the sometimes laughable B-movie effects (although in other places the effects are once again quite good).
Most of this was shot in English from what I could tell, although the boys' in the opening sequence may have been dubbed.
The CGI computer effects are poor, the miniature model shots are poor although the special make-up effects fare much better.
There's some decent gore here, there's some really cool looking rotting zombies, there are decapitated heads & severed limbs, the main villain like to rip peoples heads in half, someone chest bursts open, someone saws their own legs & hand off & there are also various other minor bits of blood & gore throughout although the murder of Luis seemed cut as there are noticeable jumps in the audio & too many 'reaction' shots of Teresa & Dan even though seemingly nothing has happened.
It's hard to really be scared of an umbrella floating in the air, although May certainly is terrified.
The story of Moses is done here and, although not totally Biblically accurate, this is about as close as it gets in Hollywood.
Instead we end up with tired style exercises like Merci Pour Le Chocolat (although he really captures Swiss-ness in that film, I have to admit).
By not trying to be too logical about the plot here, Nakata actually taps into a deeper vein of horror, although it makes "Ring 2" slightly less satisfying than its predecessor.
The first movie is an exercise in horror and scaredthe crap out of me, the sequel (although there are a number of scary scenes, when they see the manifestation of sadako and her mother for example) is more of a thriller come mystery movie.
As I haven't viewed a single scene from the original second instalment (written and directed by JÃ´ji Iida), it's impossible for me to say if it was deserving enough of its incredibly poor critical and public reception to be completely erased from the continuity of the series (although some who saw it commented that they would rather have watched Sadako's cursed videotape instead).
It's very instructive that although he manages the first test--even offering his satiated wife breakfast in bed the next morning, it is sex in bed--with him (to reclaim ownership) must come first.
Plus, although I have never been an especially big fan of Crawford, you could tell the role was written for and about her!
Inevitably, of course, she gets her comeuppance although she was never a magnificent Amberson so much as an insignificant Craig.
Dennis Quaid makes a likable character as Tuck, because although he is a wise guy, his pep talks to Jack are quite inspiring and how you can learn to take control of your own destiny.
Martin Short is also a likable hero as Jack, although he does have a tendency to go over the top.
The different scrapes they get into are quite exciting, such as Jack's hanging on for dear life at the back of a refrigerated truck (although it is a little overlong).
It is professionally presented although it is a "B" movie but otherwise I wouldn't go see it again if they paid me.
Since the mid-1980s, a number of films have deployed the same heavy irony, although politics is no longer a major concern.
On the plus side it may be good for a laugh if you're drunk at home with some mates, although it still doesn't have the drunken laughter appeal of something like Python or any of the 70's and 80's cult movies.
The pilot didn't quite demonstrate natural chemistry between the characters, although that could come in time.
I really miss the Sex and the city and really like this new project, although there certainly miss the secret charm of the original, The Cashmere mafia is well done and interesting.
The various action sequences of the film are really good for the budget, although again, with a notoriously anachronistic look in the execution.
The experienced Stuart Whitman is less successful, although overall he pulls off an acceptable performance as the Priest that helps Jennifer against the Hand.
The rest of the cast ranges from mediocre to downright awful, although one can't tell if it's completely the actors' fault due to the bad way the script is written.
Such sequences make NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE a very difficult and sometimes painful series to sit through, although the show does end on a positive note (albeit somewhat awkwardly).
The melancholy musical score is very fitting, although not necessarily one that will be remembered long after the show's over.
The company's track record of dubbing has been shaky, although their dubs for LODOSS OVA, SLAYERS, KUROMI, and WORLD OF NARUE are among some of their better ones.
Ed Paul's Shu, although emotionally sound, takes some getting used to as well.
He styles himself as "broker" although the source of his income is a flourishing second-hand trade ("A fortune is waiting for us in garbage-cans!").
It was not very interesting and although I actually watched the whole thing I was rather bored with it.
In many ways, this unofficial sequel to the classic Walt Disney film, has a more gritty, real down to Earth feel about it although it really adds little new to the mix.
George offered a view of the future without hope and although his view may be correct, I would prefer to hold out for a tab bit of hope.
Carlin may be getting older but I really fail to see how he's "falling apart" as a comedian here - I thought it was a great show and although it's his most bitter act I've heard, a lot of it is also totally true.
Maybe not, although I don't think it's as biased as other reviews would have you believe.
Also, I am really confused by the film because although it bears almost no similarity to "A Study in Scarlet", the film is very similar to Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" (a.k.a.
"Peaches" is a naive li'l sexpot who attends her father's wedding, who is getting hitched to another, although somewhat more rouÃ©e, li'l sexpot.
The actors are given no substantial identity and the "leading lady" vampire although is admirable for her physical qualities lacks any skill to draw you into drama.
A progressive people's movement, which already exists, although pathetically fragmented since 9/11, needs to come together and at the center of it needs to be the will of the Native American, even spearheaded and centered around them.
It is however very british in its characterisation and dialogue, although there is something continental about it which lifted it out of the mire of other brit flicks for me.
Although it's been years since I saw this film, and it's not available anywhere in the States (although I did see a copy in a Sydney video rental place...anyone wanna sell me one?)
Jason Scott Lee is as good as ever as Uffizi, Jason London is cool as hell as Luke, Rutger Hauer proves that Buffy The Vampire Slayer was not his best and is great as Dracula (although I still would have loved to see Gerard Butler return from Dracula 2000).
The first movie, although it did contain some really bad and ridiculous elements, still was pretty entertaining imo.
I am a Romanian guy (although I do not live in Transilvania or near Bran :)) and I live in Bucharest.
It wouldn't make sense to give this a theatrical release when Dracula II: ASCENSION went direct-to-video although it certainly did deserve a theatrical release.
I also like the head nurse, because although she wasn't thrilled about him at first, she grew to care for him a great deal, a must see movie.
Despite his sensibilities being contained in a more formal framework his unique aural and visual style (like the sound of blowing wind or the peculiar emphasis of the industrial machinery of the period)clearly comes across, although it's a far cry from the narrative conundrums that comprise Eraserhead, Lost Highway, or Mulholland Dr.
His history makes him a very dangerous man, although he now only wants to live in peace.
This unique and interesting film is actually more of a suspense thriller than a science fiction, although I think fans of both genres will be pleased.
Fans of Busey will Enjoy his moments on screen.... Yeah its a Dodgy piece of Junk .....But it gets my seal of approval Busey & Coates keep it entertaining and although the Action is "Z list" standard the Unintentional comedy element is Top Notch   10 outta 10 for this Bad Boy
This movie, although a long forgotten classic to the trendy, so called "movie buffs" out there, blissfully unveils the solid foundations of a perfect romance comedy.
And yet at that moment in the restaurant when Lenny breaks the news to Lila over that half-slice of pecan pie, our hearts just break for her, and Lenny's feeble, yet honest (although ultimately self-serving) attempt to comfort her also touches us, as does Kelly's joie de vivre and passion for Lenny, and her parent's obvious conflicting feelings of protection, love and knowing they have to let go.
Probably among Simon's best work, although not ever really recognized as such.
The horror stuff generally works, although Sadako would have benefited from not having so many functions.
We finally unravel much of the mystery behind Sadako (although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered), and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film, which otherwise can seem cryptic (it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over--I enjoyed it more the second time).
If you are interested in watching a well made film, full action, great dialogue, magic characters, funny as hell - and without the biblical references, social pap, bare knuckle fighting and blood (although Mr Richie does this well) political correctness, etc.
The story line is very good and although there are some violent moments in the movie it wasn't at all gory or messy.
Played by John Doe, Trucker is as sensitive as he is wise, although neither trait is particularly apparent whenever Zo (Alice Krige) is in the room.
Yes, it has a happy ending although everything does not turn out perfect.
Whatever its failings, it is an astonishing film, and one that would have tremendous influence on a host of directors who followed in Fellini's wake--although all to often without his style and vision.
The action is perfect (although i admit, the guns never run out of ammo), Chow Yun-Fat will be the greatest new action star in the WORLD!
I have been reading other people comments, and most agree, although some people don't seem to understand.
Suffice it to say that no one does gunplay like Woo, although everyone and their mother tries.
The film has emotion,strain,suspense,thriller and although is majority developed on interior scenarios ,it doesn't make bored neither tired.
Fortunately, a big twist occurs late in the movie which saves Buster from going into the ring, although the little man does save his honor after he fights the real "Battling Butler."
After seeing this movie, I've been thinking at "Fire and Loathing in Las Vegas" :) "Cocksucker Blues" was the title of a song Mick Jagger wrote to be the Stones' final single for Decca Records, as per their contract, but the track was refused by Decca and only released later on a West German compilation in 1983, although the compilation was discontinued and re-released without the song.
It is pretty graphic with the sex (chiefly on a plane we see some groupies getting it on with some members of the Stones crew, I don't think they were the Stones themselves having the sex, although they were hilariously shaking tambourines and beating drums like some tribal ritual), casual with pornographic detail in the nudity, and the drug use- primarily coke and heroin but also a little grass- is all real and done almost like it's nothing at all.
which ain't bad,, i guess i'm used to lots of action , gunplay,, something,, although there is a lot of good ole fashioned nudity in here, i just i would call this movie very disjointed at times and that is being kind, this movie took a few years to make,, and now i think i see why.
At the start of the series, she was played by 'Clare Grogan', a small, Scottish woman, who although, again, wasn't that good at acting, was definitely better than Annett.
I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show.
For me, Star Wars pulled it off most of the time (although my wife would probably argue), Star Trek never quite did it for me ["Captain, we've never seen anything like this life force before" -"Oh, well I have, last episode"] Red Dwarf doesn't pull it off, it's neither funny, nor new in its sci-fi ways, but it takes the price as the only blend of Space Balls, Eastenders, herbal tea, and James Brown.
My current favourite episode is "Legion", although today is a Monday, so this choice is subject to change within the next 24 hours... !
You could relate to all characters (all the actors deserve the highest praise), and although there were plenty of plot holes, and continuity problems, there was a classic blend of good story lines, mixed with classic British-style humour.............it was unlike anything else before or since.
And, while SPIN VFX is no WETA or ILM, their work was great enough that I didn't miss them (although the baby Moorwen wasn't as good as the big one).
Garrett did a fine job recreating Gleason, including his voice -- although his one attempt at singing as Gleason missed the mark.
This is very much the case in the interminably dull 'Porky's Railroad', although Tashlin makes a few odd choices himself.
what they feature is utterly saddening (although i do have a weakness for, and do enjoy, jackass).
He thinks he is better than Booth and the other assassins, because he has his escape planned - although Gleason warns him he'll never get away with it.
Castellari never ceases to amaze me with his action-packed, stylistic films like Street Law and the Big Racket, and although folks say that he lost it a bit during the eighties, the Last Shark is the only film I've seen by him that's less than great (c'mon - Bronx Warriors and The New Barbarians are still a hoot, despite their limitations).
Some copies of this film are very dark too, which would hamper viewing (although the first version I watched, on Italian television, was as clear as anything).
Then it takes off from there, electro therapy (although its not used as its suppose to be) golden showers, perfect and a little weird dialog, threesomes, and some nasty violence/masochism.
The elements that fans have come to expect from an FF game are all here to be seen, although they are in an infancy stage since this is the first game.
I saw the widescreen/subtitled 177 mins version, although it is 3 hours long it is not boring, it keeps your attention throughout.
There are too much gratuitous sex scenes and exposure of genitals, inclusive of penises, and although Paz Vega is a delicious woman, I do not like this type of appellative exaggeration in a film.
StarCraft, like WarCraft 2, has a built-in map editor, although it is more difficult to use, simply because the game is more complex.
If you haven't seen Jakob the Liar, you should, although it is very sad.
Incidentally, although it takes some time, this film WILL scare the hell out of you at the end.
I visited him in Hawaii in 1986 and lost touch afterwords and remember his discussions of how the locals there treated him differently as a 'Hapa' (Eric's mother is full blood Asian, although she grew up in the same neighborhood with his father in the U.S.) Anyway, it is no surprise to me that Eric went into writing and directing.
All of these women make permanent impressions on Lorenzo, although he only intends make make anything lasting with Lucia.
Definitely plays better as a musical then the dance/musical of Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse (although that version would have been great, too, if they didn't film it on a set.
I had to laugh though, although many complain about the gratuitous female nudity, this film did slip with the editing of the male nudity, making that seem gratuitous - but in an era where all the Hollywood actress spend half a movie naked and having sex with fully clothed men, it was nice just to see some male nudity (when was the last time you saw a post-80s Hollywood movie with as much male bare chest as in Ben Hur?!)!
I'm from Scotland, & the Kelly version just didn't have it, even although it was entertaining, but the 1966 Goulet version was more realistic & caught the essence of the highlands, I know because, I was a youth hostel member & my happiest memories are when my group of mates & I would travel all over the highlands, magic.
As opposed to what some people may think, I believe that all the sex scenes, although they are pretty explicit, are totally necessary in order to tell the story and to show the characters just as they are.
Oliver Hudson and Ryan Browning don't do a lot better, although one of them (who cares) gets to get shot by Miss Victim -- accidentally, of course -- after getting totally turned on by her secret identity as one of the three female rapists.
I believe the British version to be superior due to less whooping from the audience (although the American audiences are better participators!).
The story, although slow paced is always enthralling (a hallmark of the "Ring" series to date) and it seems poor Sadako never really had a chance from what awaited her.
Pollio just skates by as Sonny Westwood and although his character has some fun moments in the film with his singing dancing, Pollio's real acting chops show in his first movie, HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN.
Not really porn (as the title might suggest) although there is some very artistic explicitness.
The filmmakers took 2 hours & 10 minutes to tell the story although it could even be made in 1 hour 30 minutes because it is an adaptation from an Old Russian short story called "White Nights".
Sonam Kapoor is again a good actress although I don't think we really got the chance to see what we she made of as her character didn't really have much to do...but from what we see things are promising.
All in all, although Saawariya fails to meet our expectations from a great director like Bhansali, it still has that pulling factor I feel to make it do well at the box office.
Anyway, this movie is good although it's not easy to understand!
What impressed me was that although my initial reaction to the two main protagonists was negative, I began to like and to root for each one to survive.
Some of the most disturbing footage was of violence by regional troops aligned with the government, which Director/Producer Phillipe Diaz revealed (during the Q & A after the screening at Slamdance Film Festival) had been given to him by a Sierra Leonian government official who wanted the truth revealed, although it clearly meant he had to flee his country forever.
It does have a lot of adult topical humor along side the kiddie fare...it goes to prove Shrek, although a good movie, isn't as "revolutionary" as some claim it to be...Animalypmics does it with with out relying on sexual double ententes or mocking the easy target of Disney.
- although I will recommend these (not a lot alike): "Dot & the Kangaroo" (much better than 'dot and the bunny') "Emmett Otter's Jug band Christmas" (if you have not heard of this one- you are probably a kid or from another country.
Too bad too because although Meyer improvised by reshooting footage of huge-breasted Uschi Digard (and who can argue with that?
There are a lot of great things about these games, namely, you can't die all too easily (although there may be some spots you might be able to) and you can't ruin the whole entire game by forgetting one thing or not following explicit directions.
)and especially : Bad casting (although the Male lead character who's name escapes me DID closesly resemble a HeMan type o' guy...)  If you are into this kind of "underground" movies, go right ahead and take a good laugh at it before you return it to the video rental store, because I know you won't laugh as easily if you decided to actually buy this one....
Even the performances are all pretty good, at least as far as these "B" movies go, although the script gets progressively more desperate as the movie goes on, particularly during the excellent TARANTULA style finale when the giant spider wreaks havoc in the city.
Clearly a waste of time for the underwritten Perkins and sad to see such a talented and perennially underused actor ill and jaded in a career on the wane, although far worse was yet to come (ie 'In The Deep Woods').
It was an authentic representation of the effect of a terminal disease on loved ones, and although a tear-jerker, ended with hope.
Many clichÃ©d (and I don't say this to be mean) elements are brought into play, although since this is Sweden the "forbidden" pleasures are more in the perception of the American movie goer.
It was probably not that expensive and the actors were not the most famous (although they were good), still it worked better than most Swedish films together.
Hattie McDaniel in an early screen appearance (although running around yelling "Lordy, Lordy" doesn't showcase her future greatness very well).
Bogart is a lawyer and although his part is written a bit hokey, he convinces in the part.
Apparently this concept isn't so new or innovating at all, as the obscure (although less obscure now, with its recent release on DVD) and still criminally underrated 70's gem "Chosen Survivors" thrives on a similar premise.
The film has a reputation for being gory, which it really is not; the special effects are surprisingly good, although dated, with the bats mostly being realized by blue-screen composites.
Badly delivered, childish, corny and extremely dated jokes - although I hesitate to call them jokes.
His manner as he nuts out his idea of holding the archery contest to trap Robin is Cooper's best, most realistic scene (although it's hard to believe that Reckless Robin walks into such an obvious trap).
Uncomfortable viewing at times, but rewarding and some excellent and Oscar worthy performances - although I doubt it will puncture the consciousness of the Oscar voting brigade.
The personal stories of the characters have been seen thousand times before, although the directors show them as very interesting and full of deep passion.
The story, although predictable, is interesting enough to keep one's attention.
Even Hawn's character is dull although Hawn herself is still fun to watch.
It is also fun to see Nipsey Russell although they don't give him enough to do.
Luckily for them Speedy is at hand to rescue them, although as soon as they get rescued they are back trying to fight the cat again meaning speedy has his work cut out for him.
Overall, i'd say watch this one if you loved Fever Pitch, Mike Bassett, or An Evening with Lineker, although this one should be appreciated for its strong acting performances by the female lead rather than the male.
When W.C. Fields set out to make THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY in the spring of 1934, he had quite recently reached super-stardom in the movies, although having been a well-known stage presence for decades, both as a juggler and comedian.
The romance between Judith Allen & Joe Morrison is a rather dull affair, although the young man sings well.
It would be a shame if this movie doesn't spread to more screenings in more theaters in more countries: although marketing it may seem a challenge in a monochrome world, it definitely can have many advocates among those who go and actually see it.
Kevin Costner's remake of this movie and newest version (1991) on the same medieval legend, although is quiet interesting and entertaining, seems to be inferior and mediocre in all comparison to this excellent, and brilliant large-scale epic.
And although the story itself is a fictional one, the cultural shocks and experiences Todd goes through were largely based on John's own experiences during his time abroad.
Bobs Watson returns as Pee Wee, and, although he should have outgrown the game with the candy in the drawers, he remains memorable for the waterworks that he could evidently turn on and off at the director's command.
Lee J. Cobb, who took over for Henry Hull as Dave Morris, Father Flanagan's friend, is effective, although there is an initial jolt when he appears, because his is the only major role that was recast from the original film.
The only problem, that eventually saw the show's demise, was when Lois and Clark married as this lead to it becoming too soapy and cavity-inducing although it did serve as a lesson to future TV show producers that you should always pair your leads together in the finale, not half-way through the series.
A few viewings of "The Official Story" might have provided better source material for Duvall, although the dialog consistently fails to ring true.
although the "apositle" worked for the most part, "tango" doesn't.
The premise is simple, 11 teams of 2 begin a race around the world for 1 million dollars the race is broken into legs in each episode and each team must compete various task through the leg before they can continue on to the pit stop, the team that finishes last in each leg is usually eliminated (although some legs are non-elimination.)
'Tanguy' is a nice French comedy, although it does not start that funny.
Will is the lover of Liv and although it appears they have a nice thing going, we get an impression that all is not well between them.
We settle down to watch a film entitled ANGEL FLIGHT DOWN........sounded promising,I always like watching disaster films especially ones involving planes.We start to watch the film,immediately I recognise David Charvet from Baywatch fame although I'm too embarrassed to tell my mate I actually remember his face so....I keep quiet.The films plot involves a GRIEF-STRICKEN child in need of urgent medical assistance,so urgent,they needed an angel flight,unknown to them,it was going DOWN,hence the title,Angel Flight Down.
it is a likeable and watchable film that was obviously influenced by "The Brothers McMullen," although it's not as good and, in the final analysis, is ultimately silly.
Unfortunately it isn't and although everyone tries hard (too hard) it's a laboured piece and unworthy of it's star.
'Hellbent' is not good horror and it is not good Queer Cinema (although I'm the first to argue that there is very little quality Queer Cinema).
These details are displayed several times, and although the details are the same, the suspect's picture is different LOL
The direction was good, the actors not bad (although would have been nice to see Matt Philips (Toby) out of drag - damn he's hot), and I would LOVE to see a sequel... if they could make one for IKWYDLS, then they can do one for this...  Watch this movie !!
And, although I don't think they really meant it to be, this flick is really funny.
His reputation as a mad executioner would be well justified by today's standards, although he was just a babe when compared to other rulers of his time (his own cousin, Stephen the Great, ruler of Moldavia, "the Athlete of Christ" as he had been named by the Pope for having repeatedly beaten the crap out of the Turks, had reportedly killed many more people through impalement than Vlad but because he had always been politically correct, he never went down into history as a deranged butcher).
Perhaps the animals would have looked fake in Technicolor, but they are quite impressive in black and white, especially the predatory allosauruses (although they are rather cute in close up when they fastidiously lick their digits after a particularly juicy chunk of flesh or snarl like Elvis Presley.)
At least this version, unlike Irwin Allen's later disaster, didn't kill any lizards... although a couple of bears do tear each other up for our amusement.
But from a purely "watching for enjoyment" standpoint, I have to recommend this movie even if it is silent (although the disc I have has a pleasant audio accompaniment).
Other, though, than his poor accent, Berry's characterization is pretty funny, although it doesn't seem to translate well from the stage to the screen.
Chris-Pin Martin, on the other hand, was outstanding ... although he nearly always was.
Not a movie to be missed, although the clothes and music are slightly dated now.
Dom's (Paul) confession in the bathroom to Kate (Jennifer Copping) is quite disturbing in its eluded to subject (although nothing is said blatantly).
*** Minor Spoiler End***  Anyway the movie is OK for an evening to watch, although the story is predictable, (very) hardly believable and the Acting is not really good.
"Dev" although not based on any true story but is Reminiscent of many alleged political events which led to Hindu-Muslim Riots.
Women are almost absent in this film although men always appear under their influence.
The acting is uniformly bad although not even terrible enough to provoke laughter, the "plot twists" are uninteresting and predictable and all of the characters are unlikeable and paper-thin.
Well, grandpa gets it at the very beginning of the film, when he decides enough is enough, apparently, although a little late, I'd say.
in my opinion of the show's fate, i think that warner brothers officials were wrong to cancel this show... although it lasted 4 seasons it could've been at least 3 more seasons until the did what they did... as for this whole comic book movie battle between DC and MARVEL, i think that DC/WARNER BROS. should make a live action version of static shock and bring it to the big screen.
In a way she seems to be the personification of British imperialism, although that's probably a bit of a stretch.
Perhaps he was a significant character who served some purpose in the novel, but here he is just this annoying peripheral character, and had he been cut entirely out of the movie it would have been all the better for it (although I generally like Stephen Fry).
The documentary seemed to be somewhat detached in time although we knew the inclusive dates as it covered multiple issues of race, prejudice, anger, bigotry, self-identity -- and all things that are experienced or tested by humans in sexual drive and satisfaction.
The protagonist is also the antagonist with his often irrational and aggressive behaviour, possibly a trademark of Joao Francisco himself on which the film is based on, although this could be one of the film's flaws.
Chabrol draws heavily on Hitchcockian themes here, and the end result is a short, succinct interesting French tale that, although not meeting the influencer's fantastic work, this film is a good solid starting point for those wishing to be introduced to Chabrol's work; the similarities to mid 20th century English language suspense movies allow the viewer to become easily immersed in the world created.
The plot revolves around Helene, a small-town teacher, played well by Stephane Audren, who is loved by her students, although she does not believe in the concept of true love herself.
"B" movie stalwart James Remar plays an FBI agent who hooks up with Eleniak, although he is given little to do.
There is no parade in this film, although a good portion of the action does take place at night.
Aileen Pringle, who plays Paula Vernoff, the bad girl that tries to lure the boxer down the wrong path, actually had a pretty good range as an actress, although she shows none of that here.
However, although the script still looks good -- the corruption of an honest boxer -- there are far too many issues to make it enjoyable.
That's because they couldn't get the rights to use the Bond name in the film, although Sean seems to have been amenable to his own name used.
Constant references are made to Neal's brother (although not by name, as that might cost money) as Neal takes part in a stunningly uninteresting, slightly diabolical plot to do... something, I think.
Not to be watched by people with functioning eyes, although the music's pretty good.
On hearing the news, Louie, now driven solely by vengeance on the would be kidnappers, returns to his old turf, but peace & profits are the last thing on his mind, and you half expect him to utter Al Pacino's memorable line "Just when I thought I was out....they pull me back in"  Ayres, although brilliant in his role was probably miscast, especially when you had the best movie tough guy in world playing the lead's sidekick.
Lew Ayres acts well as the head guy, "the Napoleon of crime", although he's perhaps a little too cleancut looking for the role.
Interestingly, although the movie was pretty violent in spots and probably featured more gunfire than any film of the 30s, some of the key violent scenes are not seen but are only heard.
When it comes to acting, what you discover in HRH, is a cast of amateurs (don't tell me that these individuals have studied acting - although Mark McPherson and Matt Severson do OK) thrown into a scrapyard and permitted to walk aimlessly around by a director who hasn't a clue to perform his main task... i.e.
My favorite scene was the snowman scene, although I don't recommend it for squeamish and/or prudish people.
The last action scene of the movie (that last like 30 minutes) is simply amazing and this movie is worth seeing for it alone, although the movie as a whole is great too.
So you immediately think that its gonna be a sort of mix between Lau Kar-Leung's Drunken Master 2 and Mad Monkey Kung fu, although its more the monkey though than the Drunk.
In fact the scenes with her, Kadeem Hardison and Mark Dacascos are probably the funniest in the film, although it is a shame she wasn't in the film for longer.
The redneck assassin is pretty funny, although his character tries a little too hard to make us laugh sometimes.
The story is nice, although it sometimes fails a bit when it wants to offer "too much story".
This works better than the later sound version, although that is also pretty interesting.
It as a few innovative touches anyway although it's often a little primitive.
There's also of course a "wrong man", although here he appears more as the subject of a whodunit.
For one thing there is the influence of screenwriter Stannard and the fact that Hitchcock, although he may have relished the material, was still very young and inexperienced.
And a number of characters appear that, although they did not appear in "The Pink Panther," have become familiar in other "Panther" movies.
And, although his courage to tackle this part must be acknowledged, some of his recreations of Lewis routines are painful to watch.
It's also a refreshingly mature approach to make Saladin an honourable foe, although there is of course still the obligatory moustachioed villain in the form of some anachronistic minor king (played by Joseph Schildkraut, naturally).
And although Joseph Schildkraut was, as it happens, a very good actor, DeMille repeatedly cast him as these Judas figures because of his thin face and piercing eyes.
One thing must be made clear at this point: although a team of director's collaborated, it was all written by one man.
It has a decidedly literary flavor, although its shocks are as unpleasant & visceral as any classic horror film.
I don't know why but I used to be a huge fan of Creepshow and Tales from the crypt although the later series were rather lame.
In summation, the film is visually sumptuous, the performances are rather good (although a notable few are wooden) and the story line is clever.
I love this not so much for the story line, although Sandler and Barrymore are adorable together in this but rather the hysterical return to life in the 80's.
The plot's not that complicated (certainly not like "The Lady Vanishes") and there seems not to be enough risk or sense of danger (certainly not like "The 39 Steps")to Mason's life, although there is suspense and surprise along the way.
The story, although almsot laughable, is quite fun to enjoy.
SPOILERS THROUGH:  For some reason, although I should have liked this, my thoughts about Mortal thoughts were all negative.
The storyline is fantastic and the casting is superb (although I would say that as Bruce Willis is my favourite actor!)
As an aside on the career of Demi Moore, I want to say that it's a shame for her that her off-screen personality is not well liked, which in large part accounts for the fact that she is one of the most underrated, although one of the most often seen and hardest-working stars of the last fifteen years or so.
I suspect that although the impact of seeing it today is very strong, it must have been a lot stronger for wartime audiences.
It's still pretty impressive, although some of the flag-waving gets a little heavy and the suds flow pretty freely when the nurses discover romance.
I gave this movie 1/10, although I have to say I watched it right the way through simply because it made me laugh so much.
With a martial arts master (Roddy McDowell as an ancient Korean) as fighting and spiritual adviser, Remo Williams becomes an almost mystical, although reluctant,secret agent/warrior.
And although the actors hold their own here (for a horror movie that is), something is missing.
I enjoyed watching the film although it's not a perfect piece of work (therefore my score of 7/10) but judge for yourself.
Some story elements have been altered here and there but it never undermined the finished product significantly as to throw off die-hard fans, although I was disappointed that Gambit wasn't included.
Such things as telling us Arnold Schwarzenegger is in it, although only a CGI.
Also releasing that th main cyborg, Marcus right, has a human heart, and is in fact half human half machine, when if they had kept that quiet, it could of become a massive although guessable twist in the script.
all decisions a director makes have big impacts, and although I believe MC G will become a talented director, I think the amount of potential and the scale of a terminator film is too big for his abilities, he still hasn't learnt his own directing strengths and weaknesses, he isn't ready for film this big.
All in all X-Men is definitely one of the better super hero movies out there and although it was surpassed by the sequel it still stands as a true testament to Singer's skill.
Good cartoon, although the one Avery did at MGM was just a touch better than this one.
She was although too young but a brilliant and socio conscious girl.
It moves like an Olympic runner on acid, it has a surprising sense of humour, and although it never once takes itself seriously, the film achieves a remarkable consistency and dignity thanks to the sheer enthusiasm of everybody present.
Also, although it has scenes referencing bits from movies as diverse as "Lost Highway," "The Transporter" and even "Raising Arizona" (how's that for range?
The film is rather slow to start although this time is used well in building up the plot line and characters.
I found a few DVD's with some of the episodes (not this one though) and although they are kind of "hokey" by todays standards they are still entertaining.
I still like the psychic/psychotic connection Jaeckel has with the sharks, although I could definitely lose the hokey "shark medallion" sequence, which accomplished nothing.
Watching this documentary didn't make me angry or hateful, although the descriptions of the violence were hard to swallow (hey, it happened.
The stories themselves are uniformly (and depressingly) realistic, although they all end on a high note, leaving the viewer surprisingly upbeat.
The misgivings continued through the credits when I saw a cast of names that, although recognizable, hardly signal quality in a motion picture.
In my opinion, although slow, it was still fun to watch.
I was seriously disturbed; although quelled, the MP invaded the prison anyway and opened fire at inmates that had massively surrendered their weapons.
we are all familiar, so let me say this simply with Pros and COns  Pros ----  -Solidly continues the legacy without repeating the same idea (send a terminator back in time to kill one of the Connors) - Characters are likable (although kinda wooden here and there) - Action is fantastic - Score is actually engaging (i love the old school synth soundtrack, but i prefer Danny Elfman's live strings more) - Visually fantastic (direction, cinematography)  Cons ----  - Stated above, while the characters are likable they are wooden-ish - Script is a little rushed (a few moments of cheese :P)  There you have it.
I just watched "Someone She Knows" although it was a very good movie I I wished it would have had the conclusion of the trial.
The performances were very good by everyone although at times Laurie seemed a bit over-dramatic.
I saw it and loved it, and didn't find it too dirty at all -- although the naked pictures with balloons were a bit weird.
Plot turns are either trivial or contrived, the characters almost reduced to stereotypes,and although Paris is an exciting city architecturally, the makers systematically selected the blandest of settings.
I must say that this not a boring film at all, although I found the endless little quarrels a bit tiresome.
The lasting message of this movie is although you might hate 80% of the things your lover does if you just cant live without them don't lose them
I thought that Julie Delpy's parents stole the show whenever they were on screen, although Delpy and Goldberg both do a very good job.
No Peter Cushing here(although I do understand he was slated to be in it but personal problems forced him to cancel).
In Mysterious skin we're pushed deep into the lives of Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Brian (Brady Corbet), two young men with a common background, although they don't know it.
We see that although the youths' parents were not directly to blame for the abuse, they certainly contributed through indifference or inaction.
After watching Levitt in this film, "Manic" and "Latter Days," I am pretty convinced that the guy is one hell of an actor although he needs to stick to the independent films.
You kind of come out of the theater saying man that was really f*cked up, kind of like the movie "Thirteen" although this movie is much more graphic.
Licon, especially, I think, although Trachtenberg is at a disadvantage, as her part is really pretty small.
It is a difficult story, although I felt it ends hopefully.
Content is very strong, although perhaps not NC-17 strong.
But Gentry herself left the mystery intact, and although often pressed over the years, she wisely never specified exactly who Billy Joe was, what the relationship had been, what had been throw off the bridge--or even if the "something" thrown off the bridge was even relevant.
Robby Benson is good, although the story itself awkward at times, and at times when the plot is revealed outright embarrassing, with an improbable twist.
Webster (James Dunn) and Jackie Frye (Florence Rice) are newly weds (although they don't act like it) and decide to spend their honeymoon at an old country farmhouse, which is to be their home.
Set your hopes low and your satiric spirit high and you will enjoy it, although not that much.
Understanding this, I believe that Dead Dudes in the House does a very good job accomplishing what it wants to accomplish, although there are a couple small blunders--enough to subtract a point.
The sets are reasonable and although highly criticised for her performance, Yutte does her job well.
It is not a typical road movie although 80 per cent of it was shot on streets; the real streets of contemporary St Petersburg.
Davis does a wonderful job as Sybylla who, although headstrong, manages to make the best of whatever situation she's in.
For me, yes, although not one of their best.
If you liked Austin Powers or Wayne's World, you will like this, although the humor is sometimes on a somewhat different level -- not always more elevated, but more subtle.
Some of the better comedic moments, though, come from the cameos, especially by Steven Wright and Charles Grodin, who is always wonderful, whatever film he is in, although the poetry scenes are quite funny too.
As is usual with Bava it's photographed very well, although the mainly outdoor setting limits the application of his usual gorgeous colour schemes.
And although the characters are all fairly cardboard, the cast is good and I did particularly like Claudine Auger's super-bitch Renata.
The cast of the film does well over all, although being dubbed into English it gets difficult to appreciate the talents of any actor.
The film is packed with some memorably graphic mayhem; the sickle to the face will always be my personal favorite, although there's also a nifty decapitation, and a show-stopping, prime example of coitus interruptus that was ripped off later in "Friday the 13th, Part 2".
This film gets right down to business pretty quickly; in short order two of the characters get knocked off although the first nine or so minutes, rather effectively, play out without dialog.
Instead Kisses and Caroms is a sex comedy which doesn't try to be anything more, but although it doesn't aim to be any kind of higher-art, the film leaves you happy and inspired, and to me, that's more important than anything.
Also, I don't care that much that it's not shot where the movie is supposed to take place - they do that all the time now, although I've never been able to figure out why.
Some seventy-odd years after its release in 1932, GRAND HOTEL today holds an interesting attraction more for the presence of its two leading ladies than from its cinematic power, although there will be some purists who will state that because the images of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo have been immortalized in their own respective canons, that in itself is cinematic power.
They bimble across the desert looking for the Mexican border, finding en route a mummified body buried in a dry river bed with a gold medallion on it; when they later find a mysterious Indian (the always reliable, although poorly cast in this case Danny Trejo) who spots the medallion, he tells them the legend.
", although the last one was answered, just not the way you would expect it to be and not clean it up enough.
However the problem here is that the mumbo jumbo explaining Jason's evil isn't very well explained and although it's admirable to offer an explanation, just as many unanswered questions surface.
However I give them points for trying and although it doesn't emerge as the thriller aimed for, there are some inspired moments of gore.
Not to write any spoilers, although talking over the flaws would give some of the story away.
Personally, I was so glad that I was seeing something new here, (although it's actually not all that new as anybody who has seen the fun cult, sci-fi/action flick "The Hidden" can attest to,) that I was willing to put aside a few minor quibbles.
Director Quested does an OK job, the film looks alright although it's not scary, it has zero atmosphere or tension & it lacks any significant gore or violence either.
There's a decapitation, a couple of stabbings, someone has their eyes poked out (although why this would make you cough up blood from your mouth I don't know), someone is slashed across the breasts & not much else to get excited about.
There's a few plot holes and questionable plot twists here and there but it all holds up incredibly well after all these years although in today's world lead actress Billie Dove would have been given more to do.
Louis Calhern does an excellent job portraying Holmes, and Ann Harding does a creditable job as his wife, although she is saddled with lines of insufferable banality.
It has much more of the flavor and feel of the biopics of the 1930s, e.g., the biographies of Pasteur and Juarez starring Paul Muni, although it is nowhere near as good as either of those.
Neither of the protagonists is particularly attractive, not in the conventional way, and I didn't feel that anything was shown for pornographic purposes (although that would have been OK with me).
March (whose looks and voice is startlingly reminiscent of Gene Kelly here) comes off much better as the dipsomaniac star who has seen better days, although James Mason gave a far more trenchant and terrifying portrait of self-destruction in the Garland remake.
I like Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche very much, although they both looked very different physically from their usual selves.
Funny that many people enjoy western films although they seldom have anything to do with reality.
But although goofy at times, Route 666 is a fun-to-watch action/horror film.
Wesley quickly builds an effective, sarcastic and usually witty rapport between La Roca, his partner Steph (Lori Petty) and Rabbit, although Petty can be a bit over-the-top at times.
Their methods of dispatching victims are creative, although I wish Wesley would have gone into a gorier mode with the deaths.
They hurry on to find some extraordinary matte paintings of Sumerian ruins on a plateau(although the ziggurat was out of perspective).
"it came from beneath the sea" etc and has some genuine spooky moments .If you like 50,s monster / sci fi films .I recommend you give this one a chance although to my knowledge Universal have not released it on DVD,you may have to check out e bay for a copy or setttle for a VHS version.Well a lost classic in my opinion ,well worth hunting down!
The film is very bitter about Hollywood, and the sacrifices necessary for fame, as one might expect from a script co-written by Dorothy Parker, although it lacks the attention to detail that would have made the film truly corrosive.
The film is sparse and few incidents packed its 89-minute running time; the movie often reveals itself as something as a travelogue guide to Kekexili, although the cinematography is striking and beautiful.
The pacing is lax although the editing is fast paced, giving an odd tempo to the film.
I expected more of a Christopher Walken film, although all great actors have made lesser films.
Frances Sternhagen, Andreas Katsulas are fine in support, although Joel Carlson is too self-consciously "cute" as the Striebers' son.
The color photography is, although maybe a tad washed out now, still striking in its use of shadows.
'Whiteboys' is not a wall-to-wall comedy, although most reviewers think it's supposed to be.
Best viewed in racially mixed company, although certainly having homosexuals, African-Americans, or those of the Jewish faith would be preferable.
They make it to the roof although the bitchy editor gets attacked and taken away ( "I was chairman of the Beverly hills gun club, of course I can use a gun" .
Overall his character appears kind of twisted... a cold avenger who uses what he learned in military and takes harsh and precise planned revenge (the "drug party" is some pretty heavy stuff although it doesn't use any gory shockers)... yet he seems deeply hurt and vulnerable which in the end turns out to be true and still the worst revenge on one of the thugs.
The movie has some beautiful shots with the two brothers in the irish landscape... the opening is superb with the music and pictures and although the flashbacks often look a little cheap I don't care about these minor flaws... Dead Mans shoes is an intense experience and must see for fans of underground cinema.
Both are also average-looking rather than gorgeous which makes the story more believable although Sorcha is beautiful in a classic way.
Jayston is an admirable, subtle actor, who speaks his many lines well and who is really the highlight of this version, but unfortunately he lacks that charisma, that great overpowering presence and natural authority which are necessary to play Rochester and which for example make Orson Welles a more convincing Rochester in the '44 movie, although he has much less screen time than Jayston and does not possess the latter's subtlety.
As regards the plot most of the novel's important scenes are faithfully shown in this version Â although the part between Jane's flight from Thornfield and her arrival at Moor House is cut out Â but two scenes are altered and to their disadvantage.
Paradoxically, this actually works and makes sense, although it is an interruption in the more interesting Jane-Rochester story.
A glowing glass of poisoned milk (although not a glowy as in Suspicion).
While there are occasional flaws which stop it from being better, they are definitely, although not overwhelmingly, outstripped by the positive elements of this exciting film-noir.
Screwed's pace is just perfect; the laughs are fast and frequent, although you are given a slight breather just before the next joke hits.
The story is well written (although I now know it is based on previous films).
Though one may be expecting a large amount of fantasy and bizarre weirdness-"A day without a Mexican" although has some good messages such as 'where your heart lies' and 'give peace a chance' there is no excuse to poor quality.
It stirs history of who occupied those lands before the United States (Mexico), although there is no mention the same land was in turn, taken away from the native American Indians.
Also, although I generally hate David Spade, his annoying personality fits in perfectly with the character he plays.
The plot, although simple (initially) does become a more twisted prospect towards the end - so it is a highly rewarding movie.
Partially one gets the impression that the director focused specifically Brecht-connoisseurs as audience (although this is not a necessary condition to understand the movie).
And yes, the pace seems slow at first, but the build up is terrific (although the music during the opening scenes could do with a little less of the dramatic bass undertones) and the scenes at the dhaba and in the jhuggis are first rate, as is the portrayal of Gobind by Yashpal Sharma.
Next, when the bartender is shot down and Buster instantly puts up a sign reading "Bartender Wanted," it's darkly funny although the joke is starting to wear a bit thin.
(I first saw this movie at a public screening as part of a Keaton festival some years ago, and although it had been going over fairly well up to that point this sequence totally killed the laughter for the duration of the film.)
Even allowing that OUT WEST is a parody, a lot of the material-- and not just the racial humor --is in surprisingly poor taste for these guys, although fortunately it's a lapse that was not repeated in their subsequent careers.
In 'A Room for Romeo Brass' Considines character shifted from comical to threatening in a truly unsettling way, although in the end his promise 'to go dark on you' is easily thwarted by the decisive action and confidence of a father-figure.
Both Steve McQueen and Burt Lancaster were sent to prison for murder convictions although allegedly McQueen was innocent.
Steve Mcqueen was never a very good actor for my standards of acting and although he has many really bright moments in this one his inability to stop switching his role on and off to his usual Steve Mcqueen persona didn't help much.
(although primarily a thriller).
Right...well Ali (based on a "true" Story) is a bit of a Fat Phobic (just like almost in one in America who's never felt the pain of being fat)..thinking it all about your attitude..and when she loses her sports scholarship..she decides to enter a student film competition for the prize money for school.....and her idea is to prove being unhappy and fat is all out the fat person's negative attitude....if only people like her little brother(overweight) had a positive attitude their lives would be better..thats why she's popular (not because she's a pretty blonde jock)..the commercials leading up to this promised a true look/insight into one area of life where bigotry and prejudice are allowed to reign supreme... i "thought" finally people see something about the cost of our obsession with weight...how thou bashing of gay and others may be illegal...but fat bashing is More than OK....But the promise of the commercials was NEVER delivered...even although Ali don's the "Fat suit" for at least a month...at the end of it..she's still very hateful over her mom's past weight (its treated like a very dirty little secret)..never asking why people over eat...or even some the different causes people gain weight, her partner on the film has a hard attitude towards the world in general and never stops calling the one "fat" girl and meets and befriends.."her Fat friend"...after a month spent on this Ali changes only a little..after lying to everyone very little is said after ward...you keep waiting/hoping for her "a Ha!
Eugene Levy does a nice job too, although you really have to look to realize that it's him.
The parallel between the fighting parents and the squid and the whale (for which the title derives) was an interesting and very thought-compelling one, to the point where I started to wonder who exactly was the squid, and who the whale (I've come to the conclusion that the father is the squid and the mother is the whale, although this might certainly be open to interpretation).
It details the circumstances of his parents divorce, and although names have been altered, Noah is represented by the elder son Walt and his father, the brilliant academic Jonathan Baumbach, is played by Jeff Daniels as 'Bernard'.
SOME SPOILERS TO FOLLOW (IMDB requires that I draw attention to these spoilers to provide readers with a choice but I should point out that I consider them imperative to a proper understanding of the film, although they may be read equally well after one's first viewing)  At the commencement of the film Bernard is a successful academic and writer but one whose work has been overlooked in recent years.
One other thing I found useless was the "gag" although no one laughed where Joan comes out of the bathroom and the Walt says something about the nasty smell.
Technically Howling IV: The Original Nightmare is OK, it's a bit flat & forgettable although a few of the special effects are pretty good.
Always a pleasure to watch Facinelly, though, although he could choose better films to participate in.
The only thing I didn't like was the excessive nudity, although it keeps it groovy to say the least.
It is some kind of spoof, an adventure movie, a historical movie (although far from correct, but that's probably where the humor should be in),... all in one.
He comes to see that idealism must relent to pragmatism in extreme cases, although that knowledge repulses him.
The guilty are arrested and convicted, although their various punishments are a joke.
The characters, although they may as well carry sandwich boards advertising their function in the script, are pretty well drawn.
How to Beat the High Co$t of Living is based on quite a good and easily digestible script, although some of the jokes are predictable or fall a little flat.
And in this thriller, Theodore Apstein's clever screenplay gives the inimitable Page ample opportunity to portray a woman who, although inwardly venomous, amuses viewers in a stylized, aristocratic sort of way.
although there is one thing that i still don't understand very well.
And it is very clear that she got raped by her father when she was 13, although it isn't said (the scar on Julies stomach indicates a cesarean section/ she lost her virginity when she was 13/her father is the "king of orgies")  The publishers "english daughter", named Julia, is french Julies child.
Here we have a woman, who although she is super wealthy and can afford any type of food, instead chooses to deprieve herself of such a basic source of pleasure as eating appetizing food.
That, however, depends on your viewpoint; the action is stretched, but the relaxed tone of the film blends magnificently with the beautiful French scenery, and Ozon's attention to detail with the characters ensures that, although slow, Swimming Pool never descends into boredom and there's always something on offer for it's audience to enjoy.
In fact if it wasn't for the fact that there is no alien, this could be a frame for frame remake of Predator (although it's more along the same lines as the fan made version of Indiana Jones quality-wise than Gus Van Sant's Psycho!).
I liked James Mason as the ballet director, and I was impressed by Moira Shearer's dancing, although I'm not generally a great fan of ballet dancing.
They are both haunted by memories of their past; Nina thinks she is responsible for the death of her husband, and Pierre probably feels he is responsible for the death of his former partner, although he says it was an accident.
This bothers Luke and begins his journey to self discovery, although it's not exactly rocket science.
The film is a bit silly and you and your friends may squirm at some of the lines, but there is a heartfelt message and you will walk away from the film feeling pretty good about yourself (although you may feel like hitting the gym right away and puking up that movie theater popcorn after staring at the gorgeous actors for 90 minutes)
The stock car sequences are visually dull and, although director Norman Taurog supplies a few funny comic touches, the film has no life, no pep.
In doing so, their paths cross, and they eventually decide to take to the road together, although Freddy does so quite reluctantly.
The sluggish pacing and overlength are deterrents, although the beginning of the movie is quite bright and the thoughtful, serious finish almost gives the dreary film some actual meaning.
Certainly, those elements are impressive, although Elsie's hairstyle and figure-hugging dress seem to reflect the fashions of 1957 more than they do those of 1911.
But Elsie (although welcomed by the amorous Charles) finds she has to watch as he spends time talking about a political problem at home - the capture of one of Nicholas' clique of pro-German friends who has been caught with some compromising documents that would hurt the King.
The actors, although not good in any traditional sense, are certainly fun to watch.
I saw it at the Stony Brook Festival (July 2005) and hope it will be released nationally although I'm not so sure it's a film that will appeal to a wide audience.
Overall, it is a very good movie although some of the Chinese to English translation was not well done.
The chase scene through the city is very exciting although at times farfetched, but still makes for some good action in between a few dramatic scenes.
It keeps your attention throughout although I thought the ending was a bit confusing because things happened almost too fast for the viewer to take in.
Fortress is actually a wild concoction of every sci-fi clichÃ© under the sun, which, although entertaining in the check-your-brain-at-the-door sense, proves to be amazingly silly.
The film also shoves in cyborgs (a staple of many self-respecting genre films during the 1990s), with a cyborg governor (who acts more human than machine) & whole cyborg SWAT teams, who prove to be nothing more than convenient cannon fodder for our hero, although they do kill half the escaping party.
Gordon throws in his usual darkly comedic splatter, which does contribute greatly to the film's watchability, although it is a style which belongs more to the horror genre than an action film like Fortress.
The movie tells a good story, although one that sputters and stalls a few times in the first 30 minutes.
And every time that I have the opportunity to watch it again, I donÂ´t waste the chance (although unfortunately is rarely show it on t.v.)
For those who have children who love Aladdin, this film has many harbingers, although the 1940 version with Sabu is the direct predecessor.
Okay, although it may have been a viewing experience in the theater it was boring at home.
I almost disbelieved it was them although I saw other movies of theirs.
She really didn't have much acting experience in 1985, but she pulled the part off very well (although given the circumstances in which Rusty lived, I thought Cher looked a little too good for the role.)
From what I understand, Diana didn't actually exist (although some think she may have been a composite of several girls in Rocky's life) and, while touching, the closing scene, where Rusty, Gar and Dozer visit the cemetery and Dozer puts flowers on the grave, is also a creation - Rocky's body was donated for medical research.
But don't worry about trying to get some 'meaning of life' thing out of this ride; the less you look for the better, because although Jarmusch's script is as complex and thought provoking as they come, there's never an intention of teaching something or giving a lesson of anything.
In a film with a such format, it is tempting to comment on "which segment is superior" but this would be missing the point entirely because "Night on Earth" is greater than the sum of its five parts, although it is true that the five segments can stand easily on their own.
And as for the driver, although he is deeply sad and wounded, this sadness is a little self-centered and he has no pity to those whom he can actually help.
Here we catch a Taxi in different cities around the globe and although the cultures are clearly different , there is something of the blues in each act.
I can't make out which one is my favorite, they all have a certain magic to them that totally captures to mood of the country we are in although the mood itself is that of the night where not much seems to be going on really except in our taxis.
If you like other Warner Brothers' cartoons I'm sure you'll like this although if I wanted to watch a few Roadrunner shorts I'd mix them in with other character's cartoons or they might seem rather repetitive.
This is a 'Beowulf' where the story, although different from the poem, is actually very far from shabby.
Crispin Glover is genuinely scary as the tormented and raw-boned Grendel, whose main problem is that he just can't stand the sound of people having fun, although since most of this fun consists of hairy men singing lewd songs you can see his point.
Despite an accent that's more Stockwell than Geatland, Ray Winstone does a fine, sombre job as the hero, although my wife thought that the animated Winstone looked more like Sean Bean.
Next to the gore, also all of the other typical Italian horror movie elements are present here; many young characters, a scary kid (although she is only scary in one sequence), cannibalism and a psychotic monster like killer.
Much of the movie is badly lit... the screen is too dark, and although this could be construed as being spooky or mystifying, I think it's rather unnecessary.
It drags in some places, although the build-up of suspense that would have been created by director Joe D'Amato is largely diminished by a music score that most of the time is just plain bad.
Being a rather jaded horror/exploitation fan, rarely do I find anything that actually shocks me or scares me to the core (although there are some D'Amato films I refuse to ever watch!).
The violence, as well as bawdiness, does not make it a family film for young children although having said that the lewd references do provide good humour and balances out the movie.
The plot isn't much to write home about (although there's just a hint of a theological debate about the way Christianity has displaced the old mythic religions, which made me think for about 5 seconds).
No XXX stuff here per se,(although it has an incandescent hot tub scene with Ms. Angel Boris, who was the Miss July 1996 Playboy centerfold model, and a great actress, which is worth the price of the DVD alone)but you connect emotionally with the thespians and their spiritual growth or whatever, but everyone complains about the storyline.
Maybe they could do that with a new DVD release with the thespians doing things in a 'Blue Screen' room, (they couldn't use the same setting, because apparently this was a story they created, that was wrapped around a brief availability of a mountain skiing lodge, and they may not be able to get the set again, although they could 'MacGyver' a virtual version of the same original sets in the CGI 'Blue Screen' room, to superimpose later) for an alternative or extended ending with more CGI special effects added to make the storyline stronger.
I always loved the show and found it really funny, although watching it now (8 years on) I know there's a lot in it I probably didn't get back then.
It is circa 1958 in what I take to be a Jersey shore town, although it could be anywhere from Maine to Maryland.
One unconvincing detail in the film is that, although it appears to be the 'on' season from the weather, the street the restaurant is on is always nearly deserted despite being only a couple of blocks from the beach.
We were also shocked by the caresses of the chest scene, which in commercial film is rare today although in the late sixties, seventies, and part of the eighties, the obligatory nude love scene on American screens were mandatory.
Our country isn't concerned with his facts,by the way he is much more popular in here,and the poster of film actually have him..(although he made it 10 minutes max.)
The fight sequences, although dated very badly because of sheer physical deterioration, were particularly entertaining and amusing.
Much has been made out of BuÃ±uel's use of two different females to interchange with the lead character, although anyone who has researched the film knows that this was unintentional and has no greater meaning then necessity despite wild fan theories.
In Forgotten Silver, however, the satire isn't really on high about how a film gets made from start to finish, although it does include that as part of it.
Unfortunately, in terms of actual "filmmaking" the story isn't really done justice, although it's not so bad that it really weakens the film significantly.
The terrorists in the background seem rather contemporary although this movie is from 1977.
He is the masher, the rake who is always working on a new conquest, although he is somewhat naive.
The game-play is entertaining, and that is an(but not the only one) aspect where this really lives up to the first(and at times surpasses it... although there are parts of this that are surpassed by the first).
This time around(in Single Player), more of the game passes before you get your saber, and, well, let's just say, it wasn't by accident the demo(which is very much worth playing, by the way, and not just to see if you'll like the full game, either) had you starting out with it(although the level where you get it is... worth fighting your way to).
This arrived at my house through Blockbuster, although I never remember choosing the title.
Ryan Phillippe, who was previously best known to this viewer as the boy-toy of "Gosford Park," acquits himself admirably in the role of "Doc" Bradley, although the acting honors arguably go to Adam Beach as Ira Hayes, the American Indian who wrestles with guilt and alcoholism after his unwilling rise from obscurity to national hero.
There is plenty of material and themes that the movie touched upon, although it can be argued that each doesn't necessarily have enough focus, issues like racism and prejudice.
although i really like this movie ....i still wouldn't want a kiss of the dragon though (you'll understand after seeing the movie)  Germy
This is Jet Li at his best, without too much fighting, which (although I love it) can sometimes become a bit tiresome if you just get fight scene after fight scene.
This film, although far from accurate, shows a page of history from the not too distant past in which we are shown a different situation of the royal family of England, something that in today's standards wouldn't have occurred at all.
The suggestion bandied about that she had been a whore in a Chinese brothel, was I'm sure pure fiction, but the feeling that (as quoted in the film) "there's no smoke without fire", gave impetus to the general consensus of the day (although there was a certain popular sympathy with Edward's predicament), that the woman of his choice should not become queen.
I thought the plot was interesting, although kind of confusing sometimes.
One because it is that dull - although that maybe a tad unfair on paint.
It is also one of those "axe to grind" films where fans of the short story feel compelled to whine about the adaptation not being faithful to their interpretation of the book, although Oates endorses it without reservation on her website.
although I'm not quite sure what that is.Buckaroo is odd.
Richter deftly keeps the tone light, although there is a heartbreaking death scene tossed in.
One criticism that makes this a less than perfect movie (although I rated it a 10 because it's just so way out there) is the audio track, which seems to be mixed way too low on my copy of the video, making it a struggle to hear what's being said over background noise, music, and tape hiss.
Welding the pieces together is a delirious, kinetic script by Earl M. Rauch.The film, although essentially a spoof of science fiction films and comic book superheroes, remains a delightful, inventive enigma of eighties cinema.
The acting is awful the characters are lame the sets are not very complicated if you know what I mean, the special effects are not that special although the alien actually is passable as a fun monster if not a realistic one.
Bill is docked 6 weeks pay and goes on a serious bender, aided by Marie, although Ed tries to put him wise.
In fact, although the cover describes it as "The cult BBC Science Fiction film", I'd hesitate to call it science fiction; indeed, I'd hesitate to label it anything at all.
100 Women is basically the same movie, but done better this time around (although still not perfect).
Thankfully this also means that it features some good relieving fun humor, of course all involving the unusual Lieutenant, who basically at times is like a child in the big world, although it of course also often is part of his act to gain the trust of his suspects by playing dumber than he really is, in order to get closer to them and getting his information from them.
It is so refreshing to see a movie about good people not compromising their values under pressure, although it nearly never goes the way they plan.
Joe Jackson's cool 40s tunes he composed are extremely well made, although they get in the way sometimes.
Thus the film could be played either direction for the same effect although it is so skillfully done that the viewer does not realize that at first LOL, at least I didn't.
Chief among these are Sian Phillips as the calculating, murderous, and unspeakably cold Livia, wife of Augustus; although Derek Jacobi gives a justly famous performance in the title role, it is Phillips who dominates and drives the story with this, the most brilliant performance of her career.
On a practical level, it's curious because, although it was completed in 2001, it has yet to achieve a wide release either at the cinemas or on DVD.
This Is one of Van Damme's absolute best, and in my top 5, plus this may be Van Damme's breakout performance as an actor in my opinion (although he is always amazing).
The plot is almost nonexistent, although I must admit naked breasts were a real treat to find in the early 1980's and I did appreciate them at the time.
The film reminds me of Schlondorff's The Tin Drum with its rather disturbing, yet comical theme of children growing up entirely too quickly, although The Art of Crying is, in my opinion, far more beautifully poignant as it is told through Allan's eyes.
I like the message that Carter is trying to get across in this episode, although Wayne-O never gets it, unfortunately.
And at the end although the whole Italian festival is kind of humorous to watch it seems like Chris Carter just didn't have any idea what else to do with such a lame story because this honestly has nothing to do with the episode.
I took Mr. Burt as being God, who, although not directly, stops the serial killer by making his actions into a pattern that could be recognized, using numbers and other coincidences.
The one thing that really kicks it for me is the story-line, although it is very reminiscent of RÃ©my Belvaux's "Man Bites Dog" from '92.
There's also an ultimate revelation to come although it doesn't come off as that surprising given the way the film-makers so gleefully play with us, and so well establish Leslie's cunning intelligence.
So, although both movies cover similar ground, "Behind The Mask" is never in any way repetitive.
First, although it's a Betty Boop cartoon, it's an amazingly "by the book" rendition of the old story.
If you liked "Predator" then go and watch "Predator 2", that was an interesting follow up (although missing the presence of Schwarzenegger) ... but watch "Code Red" ONLY if you like a descent into "C movies".
The story is told around the central event of a missing person, although not all of the characters are directly involved.
The movie also featured a decent performance from Frederic Forrest as Rose's love interest Huston Dyer, who started as her chauffeur and ended up as her lover, but eventually had to get away from her and the life she was leading, although I found the romance a bit too contrived to be believable.
Acting tour-de-forces are manifest everywhere, and although virtually the entire supporting cast brings a Broadway-style truth and urgency that make thus excellent.
The play itself was a real downer; a man (Edmund O'Brien) is still living with his mother and sister although he's in his mid twenties.
All 4 actors are quite good, although none received Oscar nominations, despite the hype.
Anyway the evil princess gets fooled into thinking the I-mex is destroyed, although your average street magician could have been more convincing, and we find out daddy is alive (DUH) and is hooked up to some computer... maybe the one that maps your brain and would have told the bad guys not only where to locate it but also which pizza places would have delivered to the house while you were there...  You know some shows have plot holes, some have major ones (Professor stop making radios out of coconuts and fix the 2 foot hole in the boat) and some just say "We didn't actually care enough to hire writers, we just strung together a series of scenes and called it a pilot, we figure sci-fi viewer are dumb enough to watch anything"  Sigh.
I found the plot line to be weak, although some of the humor was good, particularly the parts dealing with cultural differences.
Denzel Washington produces, at most times, passable, mockney accent although there are times when he lapses into American.
That made it a little tiresome although I never tired of seeing Hunter confront criminals.
But I enjoyed James Whitmore Jr and his by the book policing, Didi Mccall (Stephanie Kramer)stunningly beautiful yet so handy with her gun,although I must admit she looked too frail to be a real cop.All in all a good series to add to one's library.Cannot wait for future season releases to buy.
Richard Pryor's striking a match to the big guy in jail was funny too, although it didn't make much sense.
My parents did let me see the whole thing, although there are some scenes that make it R-rated.
There is something about French films that is truly unique and this one is a perfect example of French film at its best - although I cannot think of any French film I did not like.
The premise is simple, 11 teams of 2 begin a race around the world for 1 million dollars the race is broken into legs in each episode and each team must compete various task through the leg before they can continue on to the pit stop, the team that finishes last in each leg is usually eliminated (although some legs are non-elimination.)
Peter Falk stars as nice-guy bookie and pub owner, Vin, who is slowly being squeezed out by Tony Cicero, an arrogant, ambitious coke-head, who's family connections force Vin to take him on as an assistant, although he is unaware of Tony's plans to "own the neighborhood."
Peter De Rome's 'Adam and Yves' was exciting when it arrived in 1974, although De Rome can be a bit corny.
I do agree with the porn spokesmen in the film that the concentration on this persona was very intense and that does make him a real artist, although quite minor.
What WAS incredible was to see icons I admire,John Waters and Armistead Maupin, have the same sort of giddiness towards spotting Berlin that I might have towards spotting them(although that doesn't happen in my town).
One feels that had Williamson developed his characters and plot more he might have had something here, although the vengeance themed Western has been done ad infinitum with two much better examples being Nevada Smith with Steve McQueen, and Last Train from Gun Hill with Kirk Douglas.
Lynn Borden does a good job as a neglected housewife although that scene where she gets killed by the turtle - while having a conglomerate of crabs crawling up her legs - was the ultimate in low-budget cheese).
A snapping turtle killing a human also seems pretty silly to me, although I found out afterwards that snapping turtles actually ARE perfectly capable of killing someone.
You also get Lucille Ball in here, although she's just okay, nothing hilarious.
Demi Moore shows here that she can be a knockout WITH her clothes on, although I'm not partial to blondes and would ratehr have seen her with her natural color.
This is miniatures and stop motion, and although not in the league of Ray Harryhausen, there is far worse.
intact although the back of the case has some errors says 90 mins.
For the most part, the actors do a credible job although Gene Evans (Dr. Karnes) overplays his part a bit.
O'Brien and Peterson probably didn't have time to film the creature's destruction in a more dramatic fashion, although they were certainly capable of wringing pathos out of their creations.
Sun Ra maintained that he was from Saturn, although historical documents note that he was born Herman Blount (or Poole) in Birmingham, AL.
The scene when the dwarfs first meet Snow white isn't entirely a bad thing, although it's probably not appropriate for a younger audience who the original story is directed at.
"Escape From New York" is a solid action noir by John Carpenter, although it lacks the punch of Carpenter's other three previous features ("The Fog", "Halloween", "Assault on Precinct 13").
Kurt Russell became famous for his Snake Plissken, and rightfully so, although the character seems to be only a more gritty version of Napoeleon Wilson in "Assault".
It also, however, captures some of the more beautiful aspects of the city, namely its heart (although the Lewis family are dysfunctional, they have a very warm family dynamic), and also the beautiful scenery in the area (visible in the panoramic shots of the city), and I think that any Welshman couldn't watch the funeral scene at the end as the choir sings "Myfanwy" without wiping away a tear.
I read that someone thought it to be racist... Hornestly that is just BS - and by the way DF only had about 15% of the votes at the last election and although many people want it to be racist it really isn't.
Golf has never been better although Caddyshack might be a little bit better than this but I'll tell you that this was great.
also, the direction is slick and technically brilliant,although the screenplay needed some corrections.
They make a fire and settle down & to pass the time, they tell each other ghost stories, and most of the film is the visualization of those stories, although from time to time someone must wander away from the fire for some reason or another, and all seem to be meeting with unexpected demises.
The one big problem with it is that one of the major parallels,the Don's development of "platonic love" and the "fall" of the heroine are not really justified in my eyes, more development would have been nice but as it is it is a very long movie(although the length seemed appropriate).
I feel that the scenes of the men playing Dominos at Don Ru's cantina are the most important scenes of the film because it tells the viewer that although the characters presented have complex lives, the actions they take to reach their individual happiness are mundane when you take a look at the bigger picture, especially when you realize the men playing dominoes are older and have gone through many life experiences, perhaps they are trying to tell us to relax and not take life so seriously.
There is the occasional laugh, but I would not classify this as a comedy, even a black comedy, although there are elements of a black comedy within.
I have no axe to grind with the actors: Shirley Henderson and Adrian Rawlins manage to evince some empathy although Rawlins clearly struggles with the Glaswegian accent.
Carefully directed, it never crosses the line into outright sentimentality although it does come dangerously close.
The sequences show some enthusiastic acting, although the camera-work is static (like most films of the period).
I guess in one respect it could have been done better although the very final scene (the fade to black and the sound of fired bullet casings clinking off the floor) is excellent and quite shocking.
I have not read the book that the film is based on; although I am a big fan of the first three books in Ellroy's 'L.A.
(He's also very funny)  Cop is too flawed to be great - its plot mechanics are too predictable; James Ellroy, having started with the daring proposition that Woods might be mad, and his investigations just an extension of this, is too afraid of loose ends to be truly scary (serial killer plots, ostensibly about the blackest modern evil, are paradoxically reassuring - they suggest pattern and order, and an identifiable problem, which once rooted will result in restoration); the visual style could be out of any dour 70s cop show (except for some gorgeous Kubrickian tracking shots); the music is hellish 80s synth orchestration; the climactic showdown is implausible and silly, although the film boasts one of the best endings in cinema.
That is a bit hard to take, although in the context of the investigation, it makes sense, since Lloyd has been following an invisible enemy.
So although the movie had the right idea but poor structure, I would recommend the movie for older people that are not African.
Davies' performance was the only bright note for me, although I disagreed a bit with the folks that didn't like the kid.
The atmospherics are actually fairly good, although the pacing is slow.
Fortunately, the presence of Patty Duke holds it together somewhat, although for most of the movie, she's as bad as everyone else.
Se7en is grisly, sick and depressing, although most of the horrific violence is only implied, never shown.
His performance, although relatively brief, is every bit as good as Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.
For what made me love Astroboy the way it is weren't these although they have obviously contributed somehow.
It is a good light introduction to Manga although there are many types of Manga animation styles.
With an average score of 6.4 I went to see the movie with relatively low expectations although I got the feeling that those who did not like the movie were mostly upset about the movie not being "true" to the original TV series and were having some issues with certain characters reminding them of other characters such as Pinocchio.
There are also many funny moments, although not enough time was given to laugh at them.
flatland has always been a magic book for me, as math itself although I was never VERY good at it.
And although it walks a thin line to be clichÃ©, it never feels fake.
Tchaikovsky's imagination and creativity is fueled by these various experiences, and although we do not see him create the ballets he is most famous for - Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker, we see the completion of his Piano Concerto 1 (which was said to be unplayable), his Fourth Symphony which he dedicated to Von Meck and his great operas, the romantic tragedy Eugene Onegin, which reflected Tchaikovsky's own doomed relationship with his one-time wife and the melancholy final opera Queen of Spades, which seems to be making a sad statement about his relationship with Van Meck, the inspiration for the old Countess who has the secret to winning in the card game.
This is an excellent film for music students to watch, simply because the acting is top-notch (the actor playing Tchaikovsky is hauntingly like Tchaikovsky himself) and although this is not an accurate and detailed account of Tchaikovsky's life, it's an impressive film worth viewing by anyone who loves classical music and that of Tchaikovsky, the Romantic from Russia.
The plot is original (if you discount Copycat), and although it isn't exploited to its full potential, there are some damn fine twists that keep the story interesting.
The concept and plot is okay, even the filming (although done low budget) has it's pluses which saves this from me giving it a big fat ZERO!!
I was not expecting a curiously sincere, although somewhat slap-stick, film about class differences in NYC.
This is not just a comedy (although it is extremely funny), it is also a very intelligent and thought provoking film and it is clear that Vasquez would have had a bright future.
In fact, although dense with information, the narrative is straight forward and almost all the information is explained for the ignorant like myself.
You can at least appreciate it as a nicely constructed documentary (although not excellent) that will illuminate a part of recent history.
A small note: although there are some mannerisms of the interviewees that can be regarded as stereotypical regarding computer enthusiasts, they are some of the more well-spoken interviewees I have seen in film in awhile.
Certainly the jokes at the start concerning Ernest Jones are not so funny now - although Hecht did work in a scene where Ernest gets some back (having been called a fake by Oliver and others at the newspaper, Ernest stumbles into the truth about Hazel - and when he sees the others is swallowing it doesn't give a word of warning).
This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it.
Hard to believe that I once thought this ludicrously daft horror-comedy, (although I'm not sure the laughs are intentional), was about the sickest movie I'd ever seen.
The main lady with infected husband is pretty decent too, although her role is kinda thin.
And that gives him a bit of insight as to what's going on at Starliner Island, although, not quite enough to deal with the problem.
It's also a solid film noir which, although often very dark and negative, in balance bucks the trend by being overall uplifting and leaving you with a satisfied feeling Â although some might say that excludes it from being counted as a film noir at all.
I was very surprised after watching the other films from the BMWs films "The Hire", because although all were clever and entertaining, none had the emotional power of this one.
It is a Dirty Dozen-style shoot'em'up action film that ends up not very spectacular at all (although there are some scenes on top of a moving train that is reminiscent of 1983's Octopussy) and tries to be poignant now and then, humorous failing with every attempt.
The story is original although in features all the commando raid ingredients, like sneaking into a SS-Castle, blowing up a bridge and stab German sentries from behind.
The scene (although Wehrmacht did "loan" enemy vehicles) where a huge convoy passes through is a bit over the top containing just a tad much American half tracks although most other vehicles are accurate and the T & A scene with naked Valkyries firing MP-40's are a bit to sleazy for my taste.
The film is often said to be a rip off of The Dirty Dozen (and indeed, the tagline nods to this) although having (unbelievably) not seen The Dirty Dozen myself, I can't really comment on that.
So although it is true that the Swinomish violate the law on fishing, this law does not take into account the fact that they have always made a living out of fishing and cannot survive without.
Although the main characters and the setting remain unnamed throughout (lending it a pretentious air of political allegory also missing from the earlier film), the controversial subject of THE PRISONER got it banned from participating in both the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals Â although it did get nominated for 5 BAFTAs and, eventually, won a couple of other international awards.
I enjoyed Winds of War, although I didn't really care for Jan Michael Vincent as Byron or Ali McGraw (who I never found attractive) as Natalie.
And, although the performances throughout the entire cast were stellar, I have to mention that John Gielgud's Aaron Jastrow was absolutely brilliant.
So, on both accounts it is excellent, and depicts most of the WWII major events, although not all equally.
(I didn't know she was English, so in a way her accent was persuasive, although it def.
(All of the script in Gypo is improvised, although this is not a requirement of Dogme technique.)
The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner.
The acting ranged from quite good to ham, and although I wished the scarecrow didn't talk it was still a pretty creepy-looking horror villain.
But no, this is not a rip-off of "Lord of the Rings" in any way, although it does in the trailer.
The magic is decent, I guess, although I hope they can expand a little more in the future.
Overall, it's a good film for the family, although it's a bit violent for a PG rating.
I read the books several times when I was a kid, although I haven't read any of them for probably almost ten years.
The Christian undertones are slightly heavy-handed (note: when I say "slightly" I really mean "extremely"), although this is not exactly much of an aberration from the novel, which in many ways made real efforts to rival the Holy Bible in its direct, straight-forward Christian message.
It's a major motion picture, instead of the radio plays and animated or television features that preceded it, and is packed with brilliant performances and impressive special effects, although I would be lying if I said that there were no bad effects and no bad performances in it.
There are times when the effects are unimpressive and even downright bad (some of the evil Witches evil henchmen are of the old, cartoon-like CGI variety) and it's interesting to consider that Tumnus's initial betrayal of Lucy is exactly the same betrayal committed by Hoggle against Sarah in Labyrinth, although I guess it's not exactly a rip-off.
That is not precisely so, although I don't think there's any excuse for not doing so in this case.
The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel, they are real people: The younger ones fare better than the older ones, but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.
I was never really a Scott Baio fan, although he did have a good role on TV's "Happy Days," but ZAPPED!
Some of the settings were atmospheric and the acting was pretty good (although the main villain is kind of stiff he's suitably despicable).
I rather enjoyed the leisurely pacing, although it gets more frantic (and goofier) in the last fifteen minutes.
I was pretty surprised to see this kind of social comment in a cheap indie horror movie --- although that didn't stop the director from showing enough young female skin to keep the fans happy!
ACTING: $$ (Nothing special here although Misty Mundae isn't nearly as bad of a thespian as I was expecting.
(although I think that this movie should change it's title, given that the movie itself is totally different from it't title.)
Really, he is more than competent although, as another commenter said, there should have been more whip work.
There is also another Lash La Rue film, "Ghost Town Renegades," on the back side of the disk, although he is "LaRue" in that film's credits.
And although the narrative is rather cold, it's also unique Â sometimes refreshingly so.
It's a nice gesture, although one can't help but think it would have only really made a difference 40 years ago.
And, although it's pretty easy to anticipate where the movie will end, the journey there is so funny and difficult to predict that it is clearly one of Grant's better comedies.
Even your teenagers will like this(although they may roll their eyes in disbelief when they find out its in black and white!).
There aren't half as many scenes between Grant and Loy as I would personally have liked, and although Loy herself is very convincing in her portrayal of Margaret--you really *do* believe that her character has fallen for Grant's--it certainly isn't with the help of the script.
I think, in a metaphorical way, it stopped beating forever afterward, although he kept on living.
Also both men are attracted to Hayward, although both are equally wary of her motives.
Yet he and Cooper manage to create a kind of friendly relationship, although Cooper wonders if he is the kind of man who could fully meet the dangers of this trek in hostile territory.
Over the years I've picked up several copies of this film released by several companies--Madacy, Laserlight, and most recently Front Row--and although the transfers vary a bit from company to company they are never more than extremely bad and quite often down-right unwatchable.
An overriding theme depicted in many wonderful ways is the transition of "authentic" heroes of the sort exemplified by Yaeger and other unsung test pilots, to "astronauts" -- creatures of the media, no braver than other pilots (although just as highly skilled) but marketed as such for the pleasure of politicians and the bureaucracy of NASA in the race for space.
And that he's not doing any of it for fame or fortune (although in real life the real Yeager cashed in with TV ads and a best-selling autobiography after both the book and the movie were released!!).
This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are, as with Ghibli productions, sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions.
Still, for those who can't read subtitles, the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).
The contestants too just seem like really nice and entertaining people (although some of them are a bit dorky, or obviously trying to score some acting points on their resumes, and half of them probably wouldn't make the cut for narcissistic reality shows like A.
I was kind of turned off by the fact that a worn out, middle aged man was pursuing a much younger woman (although she looked about 10 years older than her character's age).
They get away, but not before Sarah is shot and killed (a genuine surprise, although I can't help but wonder if she just refused to do any more nude scenes unless they changed her contract, so they got rid of her.
"All in all, "Going Highbrow" (1935) is a pretty good post production code comedy although its rather fragmented structure works against efforts to make it a unified story.
The Demon possesses one of the group, and gradually they all start dying one by one...  Its not a typical slasher movie, and is different because its getting into your head, and is a very psychological based terror, although there a plenty of jumpy moments.
It has its good points, among the best being the beauty of Ava Gardner (who gives one of her best portrayals,although she makes Julie more obviously sexy than either Edna Ferber or Oscar Hammerstein II intended), the sumptuous color photography, the thrilling voice of William Warfield singing "Ol' Man River", the likewise excellent voice of Howard Keel, and the dancing of Marge and Gower Champion.
Many other 1920's shows have not, principally because of the quality of the scripts, although their songs remain famous and popular.
No real scares to speak of, although the crap-looking student nightclub was a bit of a fright I can tell you.
although Long Time Dead has nothing new to offer to the diserning horror fan it isnt at all bad.
And although I had to tone down the sound because I didn't want the neighbors to hear all the profanity, in spite of this, I thought they did an excellent job.
I found the film light and easy to watch, although not so much the romantic comedy which it was advertised as.
Mostly as a filler for the time after the local news and the start of prime time.as a kid and as an adult i have always look forward to the old movies and this is one good flick for its time.I am trying to find this on DVD and would appreciate if some one who reads will help me find it although it will probably pretty tough.When Tris movie was on the TV i would always make an effort to see it.Although seemly laughable i still think it is a worthwhile investment for what is still a good scare.When the zombies come out to do battle with the police is still a shocker even by todays standards
Not much going on here (but it might amuse those who have never seen a lot of B films), with standard Columbia production values (looks like an episode of "Beverly Hillbillies", in other words) and merely adequate direction by pro Cahn -- the real value of this kind of B-movie has to come from the script, and in this case it's fairly standard, although there is some fun dialogue.
We also get the much used and appreciated staple of 50's sci-fi movies, the educational film strip, although here it is a bare, er, "bones" demonstration, with just a little doggy who has electrodes on his head.
Her "Bill" was also really quite moving (although dubbed by Annette Warren,) especially when she acknowledges that her ring finger no longer has a wedding ring on it.
The film includes one of the most famous fights scenes in movie history between Wayne and Scott (although the use of stunt doubles is pretty obvious).
Now if all this doesn't make sense, you need to understand that although Wayne had made many films by 1942, most were B-movies and he still was only just becoming the break-out star he would so clearly be in just a few short years.
Madge Evans' presence was not appreciably felt in this film, although her close-up during the commencement scene was a true eye-opener for me.
Novarro's costars, although rather boisterous, are ultimately defeated by the script as well.
A high point was the psychopathic performance of Peter Lee Wilson - Alexsie - although comical at times.
His brooding "European" looks and deep and accented speech were instantly recognised by the audiences of his day and although never a major top-of-the-bill star, was a respected member of any cast (e.g.
The plot is barely enough to keep one interested although the movie, as a whole, is grossly entertaining.
The Japanese-accented English only added to its charm, although I will admit that it was difficult to understand the dialogue at times.
Only the female actress spoke perfect English; the others spoke it with an accent, although I could understand what they were all saying.
Though a tribute to Django this is nevertheless pure Miike cinema, expect that same weird humor, surreal kinetic action, with some sexual cues (although much restrained compared to some of his previous endeavors) he's become renowned for.
It's unoriginal, it's dull and although most films like this aren't life-affirming experiences; this one doesn't even manage to lampoon the 'fun' element that most B-movies get right on.
although there is romantic reference, there is not too much of it, and only refers to it I feel to strengthen the plot itself.
Costner seems unsure of himself and comes across as tentative and hopelessly wooden, although he and Houston do seem to have a bit of chemistry between them.
It really isn't that interesting, although there are a couple of enjoyable moments.
Very sadly one of the funniest and most active comedians I have ever seen Bill Owen died recently, but although he was almost the main character in the show I'm certainly glad that for Bills memory that the show has continued.One of the great things about the show is that just about all of the actors in the show have made their mark in other comedy's and other shows, yet they all seem like they have been in the show from the start, for example Jean Alexander spent many years as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street and Stephen Lewis was well known as Blakey in On The Buses.
The print viewed tended to drift in and out of focus from scene to scene and the colour was a little muddy, although in some respects this heightened the atmosphere of the late 1800's.
To be fair, although this movie in no way deserves it, the woman he marries is a con artist(Jolie) who has helped kill the actual intended bride and assumed her identity.
Franco is something of a rich and oppressive landlord himself, although the movie does not spend much time on the idea of an all-powerful and enormously wealthy landowner.
It would seem that this portion of the film presents the harshness of an authoritarian regime as misdirected and even naÃ¯ve rather than inherently evil, although it is equally likely (and, indeed, probably more so) that it is a message to those very regimes (specifically that of Franco) of the reality of their form of government.
I've learned not to go into Jeff Lieberman's films with high expectations, as although I liked his latest film; horror-comedy 'Satan's Little Helper', both Squirm and Just Before Dawn did nothing for me, despite high expectations before seeing them.
I found myself laughing much more then  jolting in fear, although there were a few scenes were I was startled.
Here he maintained in me a level of curiosity and interest, although I knew the whole set-up of the movie going in.
It upholds the John Willie/Eneg tradition of the all-female universe, although we do briefly see a couple of quasi-gay male characters, one of whom wears a ship captain's hat and smokes a big cigar---overcompensation?
The reason I give it 2 stars instead of just 1 is due to a few aesthetically pleasing elements; the cinematography is gorgeous old-school black and white (not like today's occasional black and white efforts that look like crap); the outdoor shots of upstate New York are a nice relief from the largely bare-walled interior scenes (it's a nice touch having Olga's hide-out be an abandoned mine, although clearly the rooms seen aren't in a mine); there's a long (and blessedly dialog-free) sequence of one of the victims getting chased through the countryside that almost achieves a kind of pastoral quality, reminiscent of the silent era; most of the women are fairly easy on the eye, especially Olga (who by the way is clearly American despite her foreign-sounding name).
In the meantime, Pooja has also started falling in love with Raj and when she wakes up from her coma, she identifies Raj as her husband although that is not true.
I used to stay up to watch it, although my parents set a 10:00 bedtime for me because I had to catch a 6:30 bus to school each morning.
That it has never been available in any form on video is a crime (although I have a few other candidates for that particular crime).
Lois Nettleton, Jessica Walter, and Gary Sandy were outstanding in their portrayals, although my favorite remains Chuck McCann as a harried house-husband.
Because the leading roles were played by the lesser-known Warren William and Lili Damita, the film is neglected, although neither Cagney, Garbo, nor anyone else, for that matter, could have bettered the performances.
Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to anyone who's seen GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, although I haven't seen that one.
And although Sabine's incapable of using chopsticks (laugh at the "foreigners" again, why not), overall one must assert Rice Rhapsody really doesn't try to cash in on any Asian vs. Western tripe, nor does it make a big deal of cross-cultural love affairs.
Without a doubt, the film was influenced by the films of Martin Scorsese (see the "Raging Bull" poster in Charlie's room) and although it's not quite in the same league, it's a noble effort nevertheless.
Having just watched this on TCM and after reading the previous reviews for this film all I can say is that although there may be limited moments of great suspense which does not take anything away from the film.The plot- insane man escapes from a mental institution and holds five people hostage in a bar.
The sex sceanes are very erotic although 2 graphic rape sceanes might bother some.
Sylvia Kristel is the wife in an 'open relationship' with her husband, this film takes us through her amorous adventures in the Orient, pretty tame by todays standards, although back in an era of censorship, in many countries in the mid-seventies, one can certainly imagine this film raising an eyebrow or two...if little else!
The movie did not portray most of the characters in a believably authentic manner, although the Hackman character for the first 90% of the picture was fascinating.
His character was as revolting, cold, and repugnantly racist as a human being could be, but Hackman played Sam Cayhall as a person with a surprising depth and emotion that, although you couldn't exactly like him, you find yourself quietly hoping his death penalty will be overturned as he plumbs the depths of his evil deeds and confronts his past.
Apparently by design, Hall works for the firm who handles his grandfather's case, although he keeps his grandfather's identity a secret until he requests to take on the final death penalty appeal.
This film, although unpleasant in theme, is full of stellar performances and by far the most nuanced and conflicted character Gene Hackman has ever played.
An great example of stylistic departure as a supremely successful one shot gesture; Hitchcock achieved something of the same success several times,with "The Wrong Man" and "The Trouble With Harry", although in the latter case Hitch had done comedy before...."The Wrong Man" and "The Fugitive" stand out for me as the greatest stylistic anomalies achieved by major auteurs.
Until then, it's up to Pedro Armendariz to hold the fort as the policeman who has replaced religion with a new faith, politics, although even his missionary faith in atheism is somewhat undermined here by Fonda's nameless priest being a sober believer rather than the drunken fallen angel of the novel.
The script follows correctly an old tested and tried recipe, everything is at its place, and although you can easily plot out the whole course since the beginning, somewhat even this sounds good - you simply have the guilty pleasure of savoring again a story that you know from dozens of other movies.
Each of these characters is defined not by what they are striving for together, although that is the one thing they share in common, but by the weaknesses in their characters, the baggage they have brought with them from childhood, that have made them who they are and conspire to defeat their goals.
Part of the fascination is how the Taliban managed to be so primitive and backward (basically anything that didn't exist at the time the Koran was written was verboten, with the exception of weapons and vehicles for them to get around in) and the peculiarities of Islamic attitudes and practices that distinguished the Taliban from, for example, the Khymer Rouge in Cambodia or the Nazis in Germany, although there are also parallels.
I added the "according to the film" reference because this film doesn't try to convey it's hatred to this regime and although I'm hardly a Taliban devotee, I am skeptic enough to know that film can depict anyone they want anyway they choose (just the other day there was a story on 60 minutes that showed how North Korean kids are brainwashed to believe that George W Bush is the 21st century's Hitler ) so one must approach this film under a very critical point of view.
But other than that, the film is very powerful and although the real magnitude if the suffering in Afghanistan will never be known to its full extent, I still managed to feel empathy for the people I used to be completely indifferent to (I admit to my eternal shame).
Charley, Tom and Audrey are good portrayals of nice, bright but awkward adolescents, and although they move in rich Manhattan circles, they go through much of the teenage angst that other less fortunate kids experience, and they serve as sort of "Everyman" characters.
Edward Clements has done virtually nothing since this film, ditto Carolyn Farina (apart from a small part in Age of Innocence); likewise Eigeman and Nichols, although the former seems to have racked up a few more credits, and the latter was in Boiler Room, although I didn't realise it was him until the credits rolled.
I did see it on TCM and although the theme was indeed on homophobia and the like in movies over the years, I hated seeing her glossed over in the commentary afterward.
This ill-fated screw-up was the brother of Mary Pickford and by the early 30s and had a significant career in acting, although a combination of hard living, alcohol and STDs brought his life to an early end.
Watch it if you can find it, although it will be very hard , as far as I know, it's currently out of print.
His experiences in the army, although they are never shown in flashback, have left marks.
His screenplay is well-adapted from Alex Gardland's novel, and although it weakens near the end, he still keeps you wrapped up in all the brilliantly confusing plot twists.
70%  Overall: The Beach is an interesting, intriguing and different film, and although it is as times deeply flawed, it is still an immensly powerful and watchable film.
"Lord of the Flies" had the choirboy Jack, "Animal Farm" had Napoleon and "The Beach" has Sal, an upper-class Englishwoman who is accepted as the leader of the community (although it is never clear how she attained this position).
It was, however, unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle, who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard, was overruled by the studio, as Leonardo di Caprio, although he is better here than he was in "Titanic", tends to overact.
I'm on Day 5 and have tried to avoid watching the present edition of the show although I did see a portion of the recent episode where CTU is breached and there's a lot of hand to hand fighting going on.
Originally written by Quentin Tarantino, although he was not too happy with the result in the end, this is one of the best satires I have seen.
A series of shorts held together by the NYC subway setting (obviously), by a wonderful framing device that brings the work to a highly satisfying and affirmative conclusion, and by a shared sense of found life, the effect of the whole is even greater than the individual parts although some of those were unforgettable.
I would recommend it to anyone thinking of studying the Black Atlantic although it is hard to watch, as some of the scenes depict the raping and the whipping of the slaves, all of which did happen on the plantations in the West Indies.
All in all, the movie was stellar and grabbed my attention from beginning to end, although, it is definitely one of those films that you either like or dislike, and i obviously liked it.
When I first watched this film in 2005, I loved it, although at the time I was perhaps ready to agree that the second half of the film stumbles in a lot.
It's not the type of adventure game where you have to swordfight monsters every 2 seconds (although you do go through "swordfighting training" to learn some really funny insults) or listen while someone blabs on about how they're avenging the death of their great-grandfather's second cousin's sister's nephew's half-uncle once-removed, wasting your time with stories that don't have anything to do with the game.
Even a handsome newspaperman (Patrick Dempsey) can not sway her from her focus, although they remain friends.
He finds out about his wife and travels to Italy in order to meet up with her; although she has chiselled out a new life for herself which involves a male friend named Reinhardt, and a young kid with a crush on her...  Director Duccio Tessari uses the first half of the film to get the plot basics in place, and as a consequence it's not always exciting.
The main influence would appear to be the American classic 'Wait Until Dark', although the film doesn't take too much from the Audrey Hepburn film.
The stop-motion animation, although underused, was extremely imaginative and is a lost art nowadays in movies that should be taken into consideration.
While the finished film only hints at it, scenes were supposedly played-out more in the original drafts of the script, although much of that was never filmed.
This accounts for the inclusion of the completely inappropriate "Help Me" (The Bee Gees), the movie actually goes out on that song although they switch to something more appropriate midway through the credits.
However, and here's where the film gets dumb, although she knows he's a criminal, she falls in love with him(????)
Another glaring flaw is that although the nudity was gratuitous, it should have been more gratuitous.
In conclusion, although this movie has it's flaws, it's very sexy and definately worth a rent.
I've never been a fan of Christian Slater although I've never been a detractor either.
Bob is unashamedly similar to Michael Douglas' "D-Fens" character from Falling Down, kitted out in a shirt and tie, and even further, seeks moments of reflection in the great outdoors, although in this instance, there are no Mexican gangsters attempting to rob him.
The film follows through with an insane close, yet it is the most manically reasoned, and therefore, perhaps the most realistic end possible (although term "realism" is a very tenuous one in a film as twisted as this).
In every western movie you see somebody shooting with an old muzzle loader 5 miles and kick the rider from the horse; in every movie you see cowboys shooting from the hip, without aiming on a silver dollar thrown into the air, you guess, they hit, not to speak that villains do not get their opponents although they fire from close distance, let us say 20 centimeters, hundreds of broadsides, while the sheriff is shooting back with one single shot between the eyes of the five bandits.
The sheriff is felled - although not deadly.
Director David Lynch refuses to give clear explanations on his movies(with the exceptions of The Elephant Man and The Straight Story)and he prefers the spectator to making the homework of taking out conclusions.I like a lot the films he does but I do not try to find in them a clear explanation.I just enjoy the extraordinary talent Lynch has of creating emotions and producing feelings without a too coherent story.He uses all the instruments to give us something unique which we may not understand it immediately but something which we will never forget.Inland Empire is a very interesting experiment and we can see the same surrealistic style he used on most of his movies.After Eraserhead,his brilliant first film,Lynch continued with more normal films,like The Elephant Man or Dune.But,with Blue Velvet,he backed to show the oneiric feeling he had shown in Eraserhead (although on a lesser degree).With Inland Empire,I had the perfect sensation I was in a dream(or,best said,on a nightmare).But this film is not for everyone:its running time is of 3 hours.Lynch plays with our perception in the time and the reality to create a very interesting experience but which will not satisfy to the people who are looking for a clear story.Lynch makes us taking out conclusions all the time.The film is made with a digital video and that thing helps because it creates more mystery.Laura Dern brings an amazing performance.She always acted well but I never thought she had so much talent.I do not know if I can recommend Inland Empire to everyone:I liked it pretty much and I think it's a very interesting experiment.But I understand some people will not like it.Inland Empire is very interesting and it makes us taking out conclusions.And I always appreciate that.
And although I will admit that I will still miss the look of a David Lynch movie on film, I didn't find anything to be lacking at all.
Young is as assured as Katharine Hepburn was in "Holiday," although you get the feeling, when she's throwing fits and tossing heavy objects at her millionaire father (Charles Winninger), the people in charge wanted to invest her performance with a little of the spirit of Carole Lombard.
Lost Highway is probably his most comparable film based on structure, technique, and bizarre elements, although it would not be entirely fair to use Lost Highway as a basis for judgment.
No profitable comparison to Lynch's more linear films can be made, although, on a second viewing of IE I may wish to spend some time thinking about the connection between the exploitation themes in Elephant Man and this film.
First of all, the movie is not unwatchable (because of clarity purposes) as some critics had said, although I did see it at the Lincoln Center which has a beautiful theater and top quality facilities.
I thought the movie was very funny although in the end the plot about Swann's family becomes a bit too obvious and sentimental.
But although Rojeck the character never reappears, his ominous shadow follows the movie, with late deliveries of supplies to the show, and with "accidents" almost befalling Kaiser and his associates.
Wish they did make a show out of this, although it does seem that MacFarlane was more of a hit with his adult cartoons.
although it was Child based it given a lot of adult humor.
Summarizing, although it was made for kids, i find the dry and hidden humor quite funny.
Winner of the Noburo Ofuji award (the most prestigious award in Japan for an animated film), this film has unfortunately only had a very limited release in Japan (although it is playing in theaters again since winning the award).
The film also has its thrills and fun scenes, although the climax could have been better, but the boat chase in the Everglades was brilliant.
The unfunny comedian is portrayed by Jim Varney in a toe-curlingly horrible performance; although it's just possible that Varney is outdone by John Ross, who plays an uptight scheming skier in a performance that is so atrocious it's an instrument of evil.
It was very enjoyable and although there weren't unpredictable twists, it didn't fail to keep me attentive.
Unflinching insights into emotional cruelty and power imbalances in relationships are one of the most under-appreciated aspects of Hitchcock's films ('Rebecca', 'Notorious', 'Vertigo' and 'Marnie' in particular, although even the minor barbs James Stewart throws at Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window' hit the mark squarely), but here one of the most calculated betrayals in all of his work has absolutely no emotional resonance.
Richard Todd has been much criticised for his stiff portrayal, and I think it's fair to say he's rather a plodding performer, even if he's never truly bad - although his psychosis under the stage is tremendously effective.
Stage Fright has been accused of being boring, although I suspect this is because there is no violence at all until the very end of the movie, and instead it deals quite a bit with dialogue and character development.
It certainly isn't as good as PSYCHO or THE BIRDS or any of his other 50s-60s classics, and Hitchcock doesn't do much of his fancy camerawork (although the mingling through the bar was very nice), but this movie is surely no worse than JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK or TORN CURTAIN.
Jane Wyman makes a lovely heroine for the audience to care about, and Marlene Dietrich is a riot as the stage diva, although I was a bit skeptical toward her at first.
Although most people still don't want to ever think that the characters in a film are lying, you still see it, especially in neo-noir (think Chinatown, Body Heat, etc, although those aren't flashbacks, per se).
It's hardly believable, and they kill the main criminal in a very gruesome way that I would think would get them reprimanded by their superiors (although it was cool).
Raheem, a teenage father, serves as the level-headed leader and peace keeper, and Bishop is a hot-headed firecracker eager to start war with the neighborhood gang (although these 4 don't behave like or consider themselves any sort of gang).
The main character was very good and the two friends were OK, too (although I couldn't really stand Ricco) but most of the other characters were just completely unreal (or maybe I just don't know this world).
Although the quarter they live in, the harbour that pulsates continuously, the places they go to, although these all seem very surreal and unpleasant, as if illuminated by cold neon light, one never feels uncomfortable with that - due to the deep sympathy the three friends have for each other.
Sebastian Schipper in *his* debut as a director really knew what he was doing, although (or because?)
It IS a good movie, although I can't say I would recommend it to anyone.
And although this film doesn't carry the Richard Lester stamp, it is still one of his best films.
The truth is that he has always been a strongly capable actor, although it is of course usually within the comedy field.
Will smith plays his part great and although it was very touching many parts of it were very funny.
Tim McLachlan (the film's writer, director and producer) is pretty much an unknown even in his native country (although he was Ian McKellan's stunt double in Lord of the Rings) but if there's any justice in the world he'll be making a name for himself from this debut.
When comparing "Tombstone" to "Wyatt Earp", I have to say that they are both good films, although "Wyatt Earp" has many points that overpower "Tombstone".
"Wyatt Earp" although receiving some positive reviews from critics, was a box office failure and it won two Razzie Awards (Worst Actor and Worst Remake or Sequel) and it was nominated for several others including Worst Director and Worst Picture.
Good performances all around, although I did not believe anyone gave the performance of their career.
Without a doubt I think this is director Lawrence Kasdan's best work although he did work on another Kevin Costner vehicle that was very good, The Bodyguard.
Any fans of Westerns MUST see Wyatt Earp because although made in the nineties it's the essential western epic and brilliantly done just a little long, that's all.
K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never namedÂ "Frontier Marshal" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and "Wichita" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the storyÂ   To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's "My Darling Clementine" (1946), John Sturges' "Gunfight at the O.K.
Anyways this was a good film and although it was a bit overly violent at times, a little sadistic it was well made.
The man is more than a full head shorter than his companion and although in full macho regalia he looks rumpled and thoroughly miserable.
Beth Goddard (Murphy) was weak, although she was the only character with any sort of sexual allure, and I'm not even going to bother commenting on the rest of the characters.
I watched it again and the violence, although horrific, was easier to get past.
Vanessa Redgrave is excellent in the first part, which thereby moves you although you never feel there is never any scope for anything other than the eventual ending; the other two tales pass without interest.
In the 2nd segment, although Chole Sevigny and Mitchell William were great, something is missing in the message they tried to convey.
The characters build well in this film - not just a bunch of bullet fodder, and although there are quite a few deaths you actually feel for some of the characters.
The acting was superb from all involved, although I do think that one scene where the rescued girl has a grizzle was a tad hammy, but it lasted seconds and didn't spoil my enjoyment or the flow of the film.
The only way to satisfy your appetite is to watch the one-hour version, which crams 20 chapters altogether (although some may expect that the whole story feels too disjointed).
It is the typical Adam Sandler comedy that includes beautiful women, sexual humor and a clumsy but lucky guy that tries to be a different or better person The cast is very good beginning with Adam Sandler that although his performance is a little exaggerated, he manages to make it funny.
I always have hated Adam Sandler movies although I found this one and Deuce Bigalow rather amusing at times.
As well, the endless cameos come off as desperate and pointless, although it is amusing that Mariah Carey has finally found a fitting companion piece for Glitter.
I saw this film for rent and although it's not the sort of film I'd usually go for, being a Dolph Lundgren movie, I was intrigued by the cool looking front cover.
The film was of interest to me only for the fact that it's directed by the great Umberto Lenzi, although it came more towards the end of his career and as anyone who knows anything about Lenzi will tell you - his later films weren't his best!
The film is mostly rubbish and quite boring, although there is a fair bit of gore.
The Evil Dead was called La Casa in Italy and that means The House, Evil Dead 2 was La Casa 2 but Ghosthouse is La Casa 3 so this is Evil Dead 3 in Italy but although this has nothing to do with a cabin and deadites Ghosthouse is a very good film.
There was something very surreal about 'Button Moon' that I loved as a child (although I could see why people now link it to a drugs' trip!)
There are a number of biblical references, and it turns out that John's father is a pastor, although John himself is filled with doubt, especially after the death of his wife before the movie started.
The idea was creepy, the evidence more so, the acting not too bad I guess (although it does deteriorate) and the story line was original and creative.
although some have yet to happen, including something very, very big.
This story is meant to portray a happy married couple struggling to get through life with a son who has a blood disease(although the movie does not focus on the boy).
And although the film kinda ends abruptly, I knew it was ending the moment Breslin says "I love you".
Kerrigan allows us to think that possibly William Keane has imagined the daughter although my own opinion is that she is real.
Some of the characters are abrasive, although that thankfully never became too much of a distraction.
The good points: The special effects are reasonable (although not great) and the set designs are excellent (quite reminiscent of Alien.)
My kidsÂaged four and sixÂlove this film (although I admit that I have been gradually conditioning them: one of the toys they have had from birth is a bendy Gremlin!).
I don't write many commentaries but you will find mine tend to go more into the stories of the actors in the movies than the movie itself (although some of that too).
The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard and although Harvey Keitel is an "adviser", he still gets the chance to show that he is one of Hollywood's tough characters.
I a Spiderman fan since I was a kid, although I stop reading the comics long ago, but this movie is probably the best in the series, mainly because it's superb special effects and CGI.
And it's not as accurate as the New York in Spider-Man 2, which wasn't entirely accurate, although this one is still a major disappointment compared to the SM2 one.
The only reason you'll want to play it is to get to Venom and Sandman, although those fights aren't everything you'd hope them to be either.
The best parts of the game are the three Sandman fights, although even these are not all they're cracked up to be.
The dark humor here is hilarious, although some may find the side characters who torture Monty, to be way over the top.
And although its a little OTT in places it never quite gets too silly.
Plus, although at first I liked Sylvia Sidney's character for believing in her man, after she knew he was a murderer and STILL followed him, she just seemed totally stupid.
This gritty drama is an early example of film noir, expertly directed by Lang, the great Expressionist filmmaker, although he sometimes goes overboard with the symbolism.
I only found out afterwards that it was made pre Blair Witch which makes it even more appealing in my book although I didn't fall for the "this is the real film footage" line.
Along with all this, the story keeps twisting and turning, and although it's a movie about aliens abducting people, it could make the biggest skeptic believe some of this stuff.
All these movies spawned sequels of their own, and none of them came close to capturing the greatness of "Gremlins" (although the original "Critters" came the closest; it was the only movie out of that bunch that I mildly enjoyed).
But folks, although it seems illogical that a movie like that can be shot with 2-5 shots, the special effects are very adequate and believable, and the acting is more than OK.
All of the jokes are still funny, most of them are nearly identical, although on some he adds more, or does it with different emphasis, but that is expected.
The drug rape of Patsy is his idea, although it's promoted less for his own advantage than a wish to see his new friend reach an overdue fulfilment.
Even more generously, the set includes a full soundtrack album, although this lacks the Mozart that so memorably underscores some of Arthur and West's escapades.
I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something beyond the usual Hollywood crap, although the language may turn some people off.
I think I would enjoy it again, although I doubt I would watch it unless I chanced upon on television one night.
If so you will like this - although it would also help to have seen the original LOTR film.
It will be interesting to see how 'NCIS' continues to develop, especially with the recent introduction of a new main character, although I sincerely hope it avoids the pitfalls of 'JAG' by focusing on being about the NCIS rather than delving too much in the love lives of the characters.
Time for another update as season 5 comes to a close in the UK although we are getting to see the first episode of season 6 a few days after it airs in the US.
Watch it if you can find it, although it will be very hard , as far as I know, it's currently out of print.
There is no narration, although factoids appear a few times.
Plus, although the movie gave us some insights, the actual span of time covered in the film was rather limited.
The best intentions (although the title does not necessarily refer to this) do not saints make.
Like the locomotives one sees so often steaming through the glorious landscapes of this story, this movie starts chugging slowly at first - although never boring -- and barrels full steam ahead during the second half.
Where the books had been quite dark, the white screen presented comedies and "jolly old chap" sentiments, the only exception being the Richard Lester excellent versions of 1973/74 (although made with love and humor, it was not even close to being reduced to a "d'Artagnan and the Merry Olde Musketeers" level...).
Unfortunately, none of those performers get a chance to stand out and do anything memorable, the story is confusing (although the main villain's "hidden" identity is easy to guess) and karate expert Lewis, who stars, knows all the right moves but has little acting charisma.
This is not an ordinary love story, although love is always lurking in the background.
The music is quite haunting and lovely, although I still feel quite strongly that "Life is good" and I am not struck with a desire to end it all.
Now this is my view, yours may differ, but in this movie although he does give a good performance, it's not to the level of Fanning.
The rest of the movie is set at a really good pace, although at times it seems against the building of the story and some of the characters.
although things surely did not come to be as they seemed.
although it took 2 times for me personally to completely grasp the movie other people might have understood it right away.
There is just something about it that I never tire of, although there is nothing particularly unique about the plot.
But DOUBLE HARNESS, although it has two good performances (especially Ann Harding's) from it's leads has a script that most people would not accept.
She starts being seen around town with Powell, although he is simply being polite in taking her to lunch at such.
Its characters are humans of flesh and blood, and although their acting is stiff and sometimes uncharismatic, they feel natural.
This is the type of film that, although it is not heavily marketed (I was in the Philippines in 2003, all year, and never have I seen an ad for it), will spread its magnificence through people.
No disappointing acting performances, although one of the children looked like she came from a different family all together.
(SPOILERS) This is the story of a man (Delon) who commits a mistake (a bank robbery) and, although being an excellent person, is never given a second chance by so-called justice.
The film almost has a strange aura similar to The Sentinel (1977) although without the supernatural aspects.
And while LL might have lost her Parent Trap appeal (the freckles, although this film shows that she still has some on her back) she can actually act.
I wont go into the detail of her life and what we see of it, because you can see that in the movie and read about it in the plot summary... some of the shots in this movie were spectacular... especially in the first half, and the final sequence in the water.. but there were points where her ranting and raving became almost painful to endure.. contradictory, angry, and occasionally insightful, Estamira is a rather unique and confusing person and her story is heartbreaking, although it is difficult to empathize given her temperament.
In addition to the constantly surprising narrative, viewers are also treated to some surprisingly nasty bits of gore, but, unfortunately, no nekkidness from the star (although there are still a couple of moments in which she does turn up the heat: as a stripper performing a pole dance, and during a sex scene).
He really humanizes Prince Charles in this film, I think overall it is a very flattering portrayal, although I don't really like how he and Camilla took advantage of Diana's innocence and youth, they really ruined her life.
Her words, although sometimes senseless, start to make some sense (if we take her living context as a start).
While it had fun dance music and hits (although I am usually not a Bee Gees fan, even when I was younger) with several famous and soon to be famous actors, the reason I give it a 7 versus something higher is that it gets a little too serious regarding Sandra and Danny (inconsistent with the rest of the movie, even the possible pregnancy is taken less seriously) and it did not keep true to the original musical.
Some weeks later, my mother decided to turn pro, although double Olympic Champion Karl SchÃ¤fer implored her to go on skating for one more year.
In the end, my parents were lucky -- although my father was unable to restart an amateur career (my mother was already a professional, starring in the Vienna Ice Revue), as they soon became one of the worldÂ´s best professional couples.
So 'Au coeur du mensonge' belongs to a relatively marginalised (and recent) position in Chabrol's filmography; its most famous predecessors are 'Cop au vin' and 'Inspecteur Lavardin' (although there are important echoes of earlier Chabrol classics like 'Que le bete meure' and 'Le Boucher').
Art of the Devil 2 is not a sequel, in that it has no relation to the first (which I am now intrigued to watch as it stars Chai-Lai Angel Supaksorn Chaimongkol), although they deal with the same supernatural forces in Thai lore.
Ann Sheridan is in her prime here, although she pales in unfortunate comparison to Myrna Loy in BLANDINGS and isn't really asked to carry much of the comedy.
Whatever the reason, I found Jack Benny to be quite humorous in this starring turn, although the old caretaker nearly stole the show from under him.
Benny was most popular when he played himself in roles tailored to his talents, but although this role is a bit atypical his talents are well suited to the constantly harried Bill Fuller--and he has remarkable rapport with co-star Ann Sheridan, an underestimated actress who shows tremendous flair for comedy as his determinedly optimistic wife.
Every time I watch this film, it leaves a good (although, a bit sad) impression.
Dialogs were funny, although English translation did not do them justice (on the other hand, certain things you simply cannot translate: they only make sense in the cultural context).
She's chasing Tyrone Power across South Africa, although he's something of a stiff, but she also loves hearty Richard Egan.
Obviously most people didn't think this movie to be much anything special, although I tend to disagree.
On the contrary, the film repeatedly makes the audience laugh hysterically, although sometimes without the intention of being funny.
She begins very fragile, but in the end she finds love and accepts the death of her daughter, although keeping her faith.
The story, although being a love and hope story, is not corny.
I had my doubts at the first episode, I will admit, although I stuck through.
After that I saw "She-ra" again too, and although this show was a little better, I still found that it lost a lot of it's magic during my growing up.
Today's breed of programme makers, although largely familiar with the era to which I am referring, have rejected this format, and now have an addiction to making everything look like it was shot on film.
Acting is fine, although dialogue is shouted more than spoke, and delivered with all the subtlety of a flanged mace.
These last renditions, although they have their appeal, cannot measure up to the movie "Excalibur" which was largely based upon Malory's original tome.
The acting is rock solid, the effects although poor (it's 1981, let's be fair) don't really matter since they aren't integral to the story.
The original is lost forever (except for two episodes) and the film, although a fairly good version (sorry Nigel) is half as long as the original.
The acting is excellent all-around, although the voice-overs are a bit much.
The business of the three sons, Arthur (Frank Albertson), Dick (Eric Lindon), and Tommy (Mickey Rooney), and the daughter Mildred (Bonita Granville) all helps paint a picture that is close to Norman Rockwell (although the apparently alcoholism of the uncle is troubling).
William Holden (the writer) is the coolest narrator ever and his character, although often unlikeable, just about keeps us onside for the duration of the movie.
It boiled down to this: the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main (although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance).
Von Stroheim's performance (one of his greatest) was not harmed by these cuts, although one wonders what his performance would have seemed like if they had been retained.
Truly one the all-time must-see films, although I don't know how to classify it - film noir?
It's perfectly staged to mimic some aspect of the 1970s, or 60s, although which aspect I'm not exactly sure, I'm tripping out of my area of knowledge here.
Not that "Hobbit" is ideal in a lot of ways either -- the story is truncated (although not much changed), the music is quite cute and dated (my girlfriend always says it's like James Taylor's stunted half-brother).
That treatment was appropriate for "The Hobbit" which is more of a children's tale although of course it's pleasing to people of all ages.
We're left with a very inadequate film, although it's still good that they finished the trilogy.
I found it to be historical rather than dated...although that last line is, inarguably, ridiculous.
I award the original a 9, the remake, although updated and excellent, a 7.
The story, although dated now, was great.
But the acceptance of racial inequalities that really are not acceptable anymore (although much improvement is still needed) does stick in one's craw.
She takes success gracefully, although she does not really care about it.
Every segments of the film is "different", although it's related on sex issue.
Most of the current direct-to-video sequels by Disney have distinguish themselves for a considerably lower quality in the art department, but "Bambi II" is truly an exception, as it seems that the animators really tried to stay true to the first film's style (although of course, there were some modernizations), as even some backgrounds were reused to keep the same art direction.
However, although "Bambi 2" is quite better and more "logical" than most Disney sequels, it suffers from the same "syndrome" of the rest of Disney sequels: it doesn't fit well on the first one's story.
"Tropical Malady" has been promoted as a gay film, which in a way, it is, but basically it presents a mystery that is never solved, although we know that in this case, the soldier is so obsessed with his opponent that they end up respecting one another.
If John Cena ever wins an Oscar (presumably the same year that gravity is disproved) it would be for the best animatronics in a movie, although I think that he still has less emotional range then that talking tree from "The Lord of the Rings."
So go for the explosions and the star is good looking (although we only see his body in one scene unfortunately) but don't expect too much from a movie produced by the WWF.
this show is absolutely dreadful, although Brooke burns is a nice looking lady, she does not have what it takes to present this show.
I did not find the movie suspenseful or scary and I'm not sure why anybody would, although some people seem to.
The ending particually cracked me up, although I honestly don't get what the hell happened (and I don't think I'm supposed to).
Things to watch for: the explorers climb a cliff with no supplies, but somehow a huge tent filled with sleeping cots is set up in the next scene; the plane diary is in English in a Chinese movie and although the jungle girl can only grunt, she can read the handwriting in the diary with no trouble; the "costume" she wears keeps peeling off when she runs...you can even see some of the glue peeling in a couple scenes; AND, the tree-climbing scene is NOT to be missed!!!!
A shame, really, because the premise is solid enoughÂhulking maniac Jeremiah has spent thirty three years hiding under the floor of his cabin after witnessing the rape and murder of his mother by rednecks, and now kills anyone else who should stumble across his homeÂand although not great actors by any stretch of the imagination, the cast are likable enough.
Hell, even Gary Busey's name on the cover is a tease: he's only in the film for five minutes (although his surreal rant about chicken-wing suppositories is definitely the highlight of the film).
At the end of it you think back to the film and although most of it was less than mediocre, you still class it under "Ok" simply because of the ending.
The acting is very good, although I would have liked to see the old pro's like E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, and Kim Hunter all have more time onscreen.
DO NOT WATCH THIS RIGHT AFTER EATING, although dieters might do well to watch it before eating.
I rate this film as about average for the genre at the time of production, although its major failures are from its adherence to the premise of the 1950 Stewart Granger version of King Solomon's Mines.
although lol its probably obvious.
The 2006 movie Boston Strangler is not a remake of the 1968 movie with that same name, since they have completely different perspectives on the historic basis of the respective stories, although both versions attempt to blend fact and fiction about events in the early to mid 1960s.
For the most part, the less important characters were portrayed in an adequate manner, although there were some lines that were delivered in a stiff manner and a few lines were overdone.
Finally, although this film was obviously trying to set up some kind of a 'this is how things really are, folks' ending, I fail to see why relationship failure is any more realistic a conclusion than happily-ever-after.
And although the tragic female ribbon dancer/swordfighter (far classier than her descendant, O-Ren Ishii) gets relatively little screen time, it's still more than the later additions to the group get in terms of character development or backstory, which is practically none.
And the Rugrats' potty humor is not as bad as it could have been, although there are diaper jokes, bird droppings, and Spike the dog raises his leg a few times.
You don't need to whore the characters, although Sci Fi managed to make one up for just that purpose.
While here characters were elegantly and ingeniously crafted (Billy Pretty, both in tyhe pages and on the screen by Newfie Gordon Pinsent being the best of the bunch), and here sparse descriptions of the Newfoundland landscape befitting the sparse and bare Western Shore (although there are some mighty fine towns along that same coast), here characterization of Newfoundlanders is very 'look-down-your-nose' - they are all rustic, and seem never to have seen any modern convieniences, and are second kin to the McCoys of the American Ozarks.
I found this short dumb and almost totally laugh-free (although a couple of the cheap jokes did hit their mark -- barely).
In my opinion it's not Joe that ruins this (although his repeated "let's get outta here" lines are unnatural and annoying).
This film is characteristic of the type of films Ernst Lubitsch made in Germany after he stopped making exuberant, although (from what I've seen) hit or miss, comedies and started making vehicles for Pola Negri.
On a positive note, I gotta give Zoe C. credit for doing something that was arguably a little risky, although it seemed tailored for film-fest crowd.
If you haven't seen the movie, but have plans to do so (although I wouldn't recommend that as you can see by my voting), I'd tell you not to read this beforehand.
**Possible spoiler here (although what's to "spoil?").
Special effects are mostly poorly executed, although some of the matte shots did seem convincing.
Most of the suite, although is surprisingly good for a no-name composer, is mostly unoriginal and uninspired.
its there because it looks something like a Swazi, although its really 3 number 7's connected, meaning 777 from Christian dogma.
And doesn't it seems slightly odd that although Danny has a huge collection of jewish items, knows hebrew by heart and doesn't want anyone to get close to the tora, and nobody seems to think, "well, maybe he's jewish???"
The actions of our heroes is well done, as are the resulting confrontations although I saw a missed opportunity or two in plot execution.
hard to tell if the acting was particularly bad (although i can say  with certainty that at least 'the partner' was really awful..) as the  actors had NOTHING to work with.
There is a good cast, but the dialogue is empty and its delivery perfunctory, although Ian Richardson's Vorontsov is done well and Brian Blessed is surprisingly well-moduated (and exceptionally quiet) as Bestuzhev.
At this point in time, NZ films were often remarkable only for their weirdness, and Vigil, although tender and with heart, is not an exception.
Most of the stories revolve around somehow saving the life of the planet, although you don't usually realize that until a ways into the story.
The level of detail in the faces and the character movement is especially impressive, although at times it didn't feel quite right (on a few rare occasions it looked quite bad.)
Eventually, Lucy goes missing and a search party is formed, just like it was 250 years ago and the cycle repeats itself (although no murders of Native Americans take place this time).
There were beautiful underwater shots, and it seemed like a legitimate documentary, although the narrator's lack of commentary skills, and low audio quality were foreshadowing bad things to come.
Laughably bad are the following films: The Core, The Hills Have Eyes (the original), Troma's War, Class of Nuke Em' High, Class of 1999, Bad Taste (although entertaining for its gross-out quotient).
And they completely changed the ending (although it WAS great to see the mother get it at the end).
When I first watched this short, I actually was enjoying the new footage and when I saw the reused footage, I was quite dissapointed and when I saw reused footage from another episode, I was even more dissapointed and I think this short is only worth for the first 5-6 minutes and I understand that Curly was ill during this time and I think that Curly was more sick than usual in this short although Curly seemed more healthier in the next two shorts 'Uncivil Warbirds' and 'Three TroubleDoers' although his condition went even more downhill in the two shorts after that.
Being shot with a hand-held camera just compounds that feeling, although it's different I guess.
Some reviewers complain about the continuous hand held camera, but although it makes you a little dizzy I think that it has its purpose.
It seemed very odd that although the film was set in Australia and he was supposed to be English, he sounded exactly like an American!
I feel sorry for Andrew's parents - who probably just want to see their son succeed in this business - but their acting was awful - although 'realistic', to be sure.
The artwork was fantastic and although it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw I still bought it.
However although he has no idea how to make a film, he sure does know how to get them made.
This was one of the SciFi channels better offerings (although that isn't saying much).
I had Greek mythologies back at school and although I do'not remember much of it, THIS was'not part of the Minotaur story.
.......Nor particularly noteworthy on the filmographic CV of Gary Daniels sadly, although he does at least get to show off some pretty cool martial arts moves.
It other hands, the concept might have worked quite well, but although the cast is accomplished and the production values are generally quite good, the make-up effects are hardly up to the Universal standard, the pace is slow, and the script is quite dire.
And although you might think that JLo was in this movie after seeing it, you won't find her anywhere in the movie or in the credits.
This film does not leave you feeling the need to throw out one liners with your friends over a couple of pints, it does not leave you believing they had some fun over in Vietnam like in Hamburger Hill when they go to the local massage parlour and get laid and drink beer (although Hamburger Hill does hit home), this film shows exactly what fighting that war was all about.
I hired it immediately, although with some trepidation.
The reality is that this cheap slice of 70s drive-in fodder is extremely tame stuff, featuring very little violence, no sex, and almost no nudity (although it does admittedly feature several hot, scantily-clad women that aren't shown on the cover, including Playboy Playmate Claudia Jennings).
The film is rated PG--there's no nudity (although they come close once) and there's no gore.
There isn't a lot to laugh at, although the characters are well-developed enough that we get to know their hopes and fears.
First of all,i NEVER appreciated any of the work of German movie-maker Uwe Boll,although I cant say I seen all his work.
But I don't want to give away too much, although I'm sure most of you will be able to pick up on every little thing that will happen plot-wise after the first twenty minutes.
This is definitely a film of and for it's time, although not  quite as painfully dated as St. Elmos Fire, you'll still laugh at some  of the hair styles and fashions and music.
Technically the film is alright, nothing special but is professionally made although I thought the music was crap & it annoyed me, basically Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo has cheap made-for-TV film written all over it which is not a good thing.
Too bad that the first "Appleseed" (although not too great in itself) did circles around this utterly meandering story.
He kept repeating himself (although he disliked that...) and come on... every killer must have a reason for his murders (even a hidden one or something...).
The entire cast are all very ordinary and uninspiring which results in a potentially fascinating and aggravating true story (although claimed to be fictitious in the end credits) becoming an uninteresting drag.
The rape sequences, although they are actually more on the verge of necrophilia sequences already, are disgusting and Â as mentioned above Â completely gratuitous.
All in all the movie was not that bad as far as it went; although much of the conversations in private must be in the writer's imagination.
The love stories, although not germane to the main action, are not so intrusive as to off-set the film.
However, in "Stick Around", Hardy sports a bowler hat that's identical to his later "Ollie" titfer (although with a fuller moustache), and he and Bobby -- after spending most of this movie as adversaries -- end up as drunken comrades.
however, although you know the movie might suck, you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was.
in fact, although it seems close to action movie background music, it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically.
Rhames' former chief (Brian Cox) shows up randomly to offer sage advice, all to the backdrop of Michael Giacchino's derivative score (although it is good to see him breakout from the video game scene).
Neither cult star David Hess' direction nor Alex Rebar's writing seem very inspired(..it feels like the cash-in of a fad, with little spirit or innovation), although the concept of a killer dressed as Santa was somewhat fresh at this time.
It's something that he'd like to try again, although he admits that he has neither the time nor the cash flow to direct a second feature.
We can only presume that the girl died, although we're never given an explanation to the scene.
I must admit the film looks quite nice with good sets although the special effects vary between impressive & poor.
Looking at the cast list it's pretty impressive although no one covers themselves in glory, O'Toole is good but that's it.
Larissa in particular really seemed to like none of the guys, although apparently her and jock boy were dating for a quite a while afterwards.
I think the actors were probably good, although it seems they were allowed to improvise too much.
although there's lots of hard work & temptation to overcome between.
I love science-fiction, and will watch almost anything in the genre (although so far have resisted seeing Battlefield Earth).
However, although E.T.
although it was kinda hilarious,it was downright terrible.
I think I would be hard-pressed to find any less-talented people than the ones that were responsible for this mess, and boo and hiss to Troma for even putting it out, although my uh, respect for Troma has waned increasingly over the past couple of years as Lloyd Kaufman continues to get more unbearable with his shameless huckster shtick.
Sadly, it had all the tools to be successful, including an interesting premise, a wealth of experienced acting talent, a great filming location, and convincing effects (although this being 2008 you can't really give much credit for the latter anymore).
The film appears to be trying to make some sort of social commentary and although similar ideas worked well in the 1971 film, here they're portrayed with the use of a daft looking biker gang and it doesn't really have the same impact.
Sadly (although there's plenty of funding for this sort of thing) though, it fails on many many levels.
The story is enjoyable (although a tiny bit long for the age group), and the premise is something that the children can understand and get into.
Perhaps, although I think the last 10 days in Hitler's bunker were probably more interesting.
There's a very small role for the famous Lillian Gish as the matriarch who dies near the start of the movie (although her body stays front and centre through the movie.)
One final note: the climax, although still good, was pieced together in such a way that it did not hold the tension enough for the theater audience.
It's a very acceptable family film, although the very young will squirm restlessly through the talkative exposition.
Despite being lifted from a Hollywood flick Derailed (which wasn't exactly a huge hit), The Train was far from entertaining and so predictable that you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to figure out who is bad & who is good although I've not seen Derailed.
Humphrey Bogart does Humphrey Bogart with no surprises at all and although he's enjoyable to watch you just get bored because he's the same in just about every movie you've ever seen him in.
All in all I thought this movie was perfectly appropriate for families, although from reading reviewers comments on another website, you'd think 'The Last Mimzy' had some kind of subversive plot.
El Charro himself, although dumber than Jason the Hockey Mask Boy, has a couple of nice scenes and a certain presence.
However, we have to acknowledge a couple of good scenes, especially the last one, the beautiful Africa shots and (although inappropriate at times) Morricone's soundtrack.
Well, for all its faults at least it's not a desperate attempt by a major studio to milk whatever money they can out of a pre-existing hit by combining a-list actors, and a controversial visualist director, with a hastily prepared screenplay that shares little of the spirit and intelligence of its predecessor, producing a boring, although often laughably pious bastardization of something far, far greater.
Apparently the book is quite different and has vampires in it or something so god knows what the screenwriters were thinking here because there's no undead chomping on the lifeless actors faces, although this actually would have made the movie vaguely interesting.
The overall acting is pretty mediocre, although Isaak and Pucci bring some life to their characters.
I have no idea how well this is gonna do at the box office, although Amber Heard's constant nudity will certainly catch some attention and give her lots of job offers (too bad her acting skills are still rather poor).
The truth is you know all this already, and although I feel a slight guilt that I don't surrender my free time to the discussion of more pressing matters such as those aforementioned, I still cannot allow myself to let the memory of Feed pass without discussion.
I personally loved Gundam Seed, although I was cheering for Fllay to die lol.
The actors in general are giving solid, although maybe not the most memorable performances.
Contamination .7 is a terrible film for sure & I'm not saying otherwise but for some strange reason I sort of liked it for what it is, don't get me wrong as 99.9% of the film going public will hate it with a passion but I guess I'm in that 00.1% minority & proud of it although I'm not quite sure what that says about me.
The result: a potential story of tremendous personal conflict and suffering ends up a curiously uninvolving pastiche, although one in Amazing Living Technicolor.
Production values are mostly good, although you do see the boom microphone is a couple of scenes.
Unfortunately, although the Tudors are doubtlessly a visual triumph, they are also a fiasco in terms of pace, dramatic development and characterization Â that is, the things that matter.
Milo knowing that Mad Dog is a cop (although not a good one) offers his services as a Mafia boss to Mad Dog.
The only reason I even finished watching the movie is that I have some issues with OCD in certain venues, and one of the weirder (and in this case maddeningly inconvenient) manifestations of this is that once I start a movie, I feel compelled to finish it... although, on this one I almost threw in the towel.
Well it wasn't scary and there were no parts of it that were scary, although it was good for a few laughs.
Secondly, although Malkovich's intensely colourful campness is a remarkable achievement, he stage centres in practically every scene and if you cannot fall completely in love with it, the effeminate preening eventually can look dated and rather irritating.
To make things worse, although she is NOT a rich woman in the film, repeatedly she sports gowns that were right out of Vogue magazine--yet she is supposed to live in Vietnam, not Paris.
The movie's dialog is not always plot-driven or cutesy-poo, like most romantic comedies are (although sometimes it is).
One of the disadvantages of films no longer having all the credits at the beginning is that you now have to wait till the end for clues that the film in question may suck - the appalling film of "The Saint" a few years ago had Leslie Charteris' name nowhere in sight, and similarly "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" credits neither Kevin Williamson (writer of the first film) nor Lois Duncan (author of the book that it was based on), although they could both lay claim to having originated certain characters.
But basically this is a waste of time for fans of good movies, although the delicious Miss Hewitt is as fanciable as ever (which is why I gave this film 2 out of 10 instead of 1).
This film was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be--although it's no masterpiece, either.
It's not, although it's definitely the kind of movie that Troma spoofs constantly.
This is completely different from the books where Babar, although chosen king, is mature by then; is the one who makes the elephant society "complex" and urban, etc.
The acting was laughable, the dialogue cheezy and the story, although different, was grasping at straws to be TOO different.
Hers is a performance that could only be described as vapid and which consists mainly of Johannson's perpetual look of dumb surprise, her mouth hanging open continually, which although was probably meant to be seductive, looks more a general lack of intelligence or a contrived expression of feigned innocence.
The ending is left open for another sequel, although I hope that'll never come.
Rene Russo is wasted too although then again I don't think she was put in the film for her acting skills - they just got her because she looked like the character.
Costumes look more as if they were made with high school production rental in mind, although they are generally immaculately clean Â even those worn by "pirates" of the lowest rank.
Like others, however, I did enjoy Lance Hendriksen as Long John Silver, although his infamous handicap is conspicuously missing.
The film's direction has all the staginess of an early talkie---only a few imaginative camera movements, but those eerie lighting effects wouldhave been difficult to duplicate on a stage in that era.There is no music except for the opening and closing credits, and this also dates the film, although it adds to the spooky atmosphere.
It may not be everyone's cup of tea (the language and content can be a little 'strong' although entirely appropriate and in context) but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment, shouldn't go past it.
For no apparent reason although it's hard to feel sorry for Rachel since she was standing right in the middle of the road.
With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 Grim Reaper was a reasonably well funded film & it show's with it's decent production values although as I have already said the film is terrible so that doesn't really matter.
(and fair enough..we banned fox hunting in the UK and thats not even apatch on this ..fox hunting is humane compared to this)I for one am unable to support or watch this movie as I know enough about the AHA that although they may not print the whole truth and they may err on the side of caution ..they do get at least the tip of the iceberg out so you know on both those film -FLicka and LOTR things were amiss...and thugs were worse than what the AHA can reasonably say on their site(see film & TV unit of AHA).Disappointing that Tim McGraw allows this and he is not Ã«yes open yet.You know can one forgive him for this kind of support for these wild horse races.NO.Cna I buy his movie now.NO!
Now Chuck is of course a pensioner now and although he's in excellent shape he is, how Gibson and Glover might say "too old for this s**t!"
LeeLee is as stinkin' BEAUTIFUL as ever, although that is not really relevant : ) Even the production and camera-work in and of themselves were very polished and well done.
Part of this is due to the fact that although Pacino is convincing as an experienced psychiatrist, his dyed hair isn't, nor is his ability to womanise with females around a third of his age.
The core idea of the movie was interesting (although amateurishly handled), and Micheal Berry gives a decent performance as the protagonist (or maybe the worse actors in the film just made him seem better).
For the latter, a laurel or two although I wasn't quite so ready to buy into the voicework: Robin Williams especially has a tendency to modulate the volume of his projection so wildly as to render many lines inaudible (sic an actor error, not production).
His hair is strangely yellow although the whole film the evil people are looking for a boy "with brown hair".
The leads girlfriend in the flick looks about 31 (although I must admit she keeps in shape as she spends ample time in a bikini) Anywho, the acting is pretty stiff, but not terrible (Except for maybe Thor), that's the best I can say about the rest of the movie.
And although the time machine looks pretty cool the time travel sequence is horribly lackluster to the special effects it deserves.
First of all, the book is not one of his best, although the plot actually makes sense in the book.
And I suppose Billy Connoly did an ok job as the professor, although I just didn't quite believe that he was a professor for some reason.
The bottom line is that although in real life Tim McCoy was a great guy (look at his WWI and II record for proof of this) but he has all the on-screen charisma of a block of blue cheese!
I'm a big fan of Christie, not just Poirot and Miss Marple, but also her other characters, most of these novels have been made into decent programmes (although when her short stories are adapted for television there is obviously some padding put in,) but in most cases they tend to stick quite close to the source.
Ricci's performance is nothing to write home about although that is probably due to the lame script.
This newborn has the strength of a thousand man, although looking at it; it probably doesn't know that.
"I Don't Want to Be Born" (aka "The Devil Within Her"), clearly shows the influence of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist", although the film to which it bears the greatest resemblance, in terms of its story, is "The Omen".
(At least Lucy is assumed to be a stripper, although from what we see of her act it does not actually involve taking her clothes off.
The said dwarf is employed by the nightclub to prance around on stage while the girls are performing, although it is never explained why the club owner assumed that this bizarre diversion would increase the erotic allure of their performances.
Whatever is said or done, the camera ALWAYS zooms in on Chesty's chest (although the nipples are located somewhere in her waist-area)!
This ruined the flick for me, although I'm not really homophobic or have any particular stand on that topic.
The music was inspiring and makes you want to jump up and down, sing along although you don't know the lyrics.
Henry is a prime candidate for an Auntie Mame, although he's a bit beyond his formative years.
Absolutely terrible, I read this novel when I was very young and although I didn't fully understand it, I was as haunted by Rebecca as everyone else in the novel was.
Also, Diana Rigg's much-touted performance left me cold; although, to be fair, in both her case and Fox's, I suspect that a large part of the problem was in the script and direction, which tended to be cadenced and lingering to the point where it seemed contrived to me.
Interestingly enough, although you can't hear her perfectly, Miss Brooks appeared to possibly have either a speech defect or perhaps an odd accent--either way, her voice might just be the reason she retired soon after this film.
Joseph Cotten and George Sanders were entering the last decades of their careers, but they are both competent and energetic here (although it is painful to see Sanders submitting to the indignity of being crammed into a plastic tube).
Robertson seems a comfortable lead, although Lawson's character is never totally fleshed out.
Personally, I could not get up from rolling around on the floor, nor the people I was with, although they had it worse, as they kept falling off the bed.
See, I agree that there are *some* movies that, although bad, could actually be sort of interesting to watch if you take away Joel and the bots.
I have to say, although this film was badly executed, it still had a cool storyline and a lot of potential.
Yet, although this film was formula in some ways, it did escape some of the non sense of a slasher and chase, kill em all dead and bleed em dry blood feast.
The first half is promising; Majors makes an affable protagonist; Saul Rubinek is quite good as the harried eccentric who first discovers Mitchum's conspiracy (although his open contempt of his boss makes his continued employment at the agency another implausible factor).
Having said that I did smile on occasion and the film definitely has a certain innocent charm, although the film does contain some bad language.
It's the only time I recall seeing Jack Carson playing a dramatic part, although he still had some sarcastic lines that were apparently supposed to inject a bit of humor - inappropriate in this movie.
The writing was egregiously bad, the story was uncompelling and trite, the direction was lackluster, the editing was atrocious, and although the actors try valiantly none of them come off at all well.
Lindsay Lohen, although a talented actress, was dressed like a 9th Avenue hooker and looked about 35 years old.
I though this was quite a good film to watch although i did not find a lot happening in the film.
The action and stunts aren't even imaginative,.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?'
Samuel L. Jackson this time gets more screen time although I would prefer they lessened his action scenes and added talking scenes instead.
The cast isn't much good either, although it's fun to see Peter Strauss as the President (in spite or because of his not sounding like he believes a word of this); Xzibit not only helps parts of this seem like "Pimp My Ride: The Movie" but he can't act, Dafoe is Special Guest Villain level, and Jackson phones it in.
In 2000, Dominik Moll had introduced us Harry in "With a Friend Like Harry" (2000), a charismatic and mysterious character admirably acted by Sergi Lopez who by wishing Michel's well had managed to break his peaceful household although it was a bit on the edge on a knife.
In short, although a great personal accomplishment, "Mr. Vincent" remains a film without anything unique to say.  
There is some relevance to the events that took place, although I can also say there is a bias to towards an anti-communist ideal.
To be fair Gregory Christian was not the only bad thing that happened to this movie (all though he happened a lot) the other two principal actors are not much better although James Michael Bobby compensates greatly for lack of acting skills by his very good looks and sexy/charming smile!
The premise main was not entirely flawed, although it does gloss over and leave out a lot.
It's possible that Mary Queen of Scots may have been setup by Phillip the Second, although, no one can really say whether that's true, it seems highly unlikely.
The first 10 minutes is interesting and intriguing although poor acting is obvious almost from the beginning.
And although creative lens flare can be a useful technique, there is so much of it here that it looks like simply slovenly photography.
Colonel when he died, although I looked hard to see his rank, and couldn't see it.
The relationship between the two characters will likely remind you of "The Devil Wears Prada", a much better adaptation of a lightweight roman-a-clef, although Mrs. X is not as complex or intimidating a character as fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly.
Unfortunately, Scarlett proved once more that although she's a voluptuous figure of epic photographic opportunity, she lacks a buoyant charm to overcome that phlegm ridden congested voice.
The whole movie was pretty lame, and although there were a few funny moments, it's not all that enthralling.
Yes, the acting isn't bad, although Teri Garr is wasted, but they might as well be acting in a paper bag, they can't fight their way out of this insipid, even if true, plot and the total lack of anything to keep your interest up, except the faint hope that there will be some of element of surprise sometime but alas, there never is.
The first has some creepy moments (although they have little to do with the show's '60s incarnation), but the second quickly deteriorates into a simple-minded impending-disaster-on-a-train scenario that just left me cold and probably belonged in another movie.
The acting was competent, although I doubt that Bakula's confused, rather passive protagonist could have sustained an entire series.
Richard Thomas is pretty good - although he still looks about 25 and as if he just wandered off the set of The Waltons.
although main character mehmet ali is a talented actor, he has chosen the worst and easiest way to act in this film.
"SS Experiment Love Camp" is an infamous video-nasty and, although it really sounds like one, it's hardly worth calling a shocker.
"The Hills Have Eyes Part 2" is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters,who are attacked by cannibals:Pluto(Michael Berryman) and his uncle Reaper(John Bloom).Absolutely no suspense,even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks(although there's a nice throat slashing).The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid.The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb,but also hilarious at the same time.Avoid this junk like the plague.Not recommended.
Available in the US in both 'R' rated & 'Unrated' cuts I will be basing my comments on the longer version although a few extra gore shots doesn't significantly alter the film overall.
Filmed in some wood here in the UK in Cambridge somewhere although it could have been shot anywhere since one tree looks much like another.
Third, although the acting is hum-drum, it is at least adequate.
A pity cos it was a brave attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying that'll be OK for a scene, he puts the work in before he shoots and he is Clint Eastwood.
The film reminded me of something that could have been directed by Jim Jarmusch, although it's only a cheap imitation.
She gets sexually excited (although fully dressed) and has orgasm.
Later we find that the girl who has been whipped to death has died as a human sacrifice, although it's not clear how, since the blood on her dead face has nothing to do with the whipping.
Still, we do get some lively snake dancing and the matching of the two sets of footage is not that bad, although Karloff's foreman appears in one scene with a beard and the next scene without!
Bettany, although great in other roles, has a hard time convincing me he could kill someone.
The storyline is amazing, thus the characters are chosen so well, and the actors are the best Yugoslavian actors there are today in the acting business.The whole storyline is carefully planned, although it might seems a bit confusing at first, you get used to it, and after that it's just a Joy ride from than on.
They constantly sell the nationalist/republican side and although I am catholic and from Ireland I find it really annoying because it is nothing we haven't heard or spoofed before.
The acting is appalling, although perhaps some of them could be forgiven as English is apparently not a language they understand.
A couple of other points - Mae Marsh's performance is semi-decent although there appears to be a bit too much over-dramatisation at points while Constance Talmadge's character (the Babylonian Mountain Girl) although sometimes implausible is a nice humorous insertion (I used to know a girl like that!).
I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.
It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well.
Epoch is a film with an interesting, although re-hashed, derivative premise, harkening back to everything from 2001 to Sphere, this "Made for the SciFi Channel" (!?)
Asks Keith early on in the film.. although he is called in to analyze the thing, almost everything he suggests is summarily ignored, laughed at, or cast aside because, well, I suppose your average 12 year old viewer finds constant machine gun fire much more compelling viewing than a lot of talking or philosophical speculation.
The stars could all have performed the musical as written--the most accomplished, acidic, and cynical of Rodgers and Hart's output, thanks to a great book by John O'Hara, but Columbia just couldn't leave well enough alone, although it certainly didn't take away half the score and replace it with half-baked numbers by Roger Edens, like MGM did to "On the Town."
Sinatra was close to perfect for Joey Evans--although certainly no better than Gene Kelly would've been; both Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak were equally attractive, although since the only musical number that Rita has to put across is "Zip," in an incredibly bowdlerized version (robbed of its intellectual heart) I wonder why her voice had to be dubbed.
The locusts are also BORING...although I have to give slight kudos to the fact that it doesn't look like a big swarm of computer animated bugs flying around.
The details and monsters good...although I miss the -old-style- gum-heads and dogs.
This is unfortunately not currently available in any home video format, although in my opinion it provides a more enjoyable example of movie nostalgia than the Catwomen.
In Buffy, his English accent was convincing, although it veered between Olivier's Henry V and Eastender's Peggy Mitchell at times, it was still very good, in this film he paradoxically sounds like an Englishman doing an incredibly bad US accent.
Although the movie may be trying to say something about justice and corruption, it's hard to engage, because there is no real protagonist [it's not Caine simply because he's a fugitive although the audience roots for Caine at times because the camera follows him].
Maggie McNamara's seeming willingness to experiment with sex is another reason (although it turns out she is more talk than action).
Hollywood although as multicultural as ever still would seem to orientate towards white audiences and also of course towards men, hence there are few interesting roles written for men of non-Caucasian heritage and also women, but importantly the figures are better.
Still, however the films of Spike Lee and co although important are still essentially cult movies.
At a meagre $15million budget this is cheaper than the latest Van Damme and Seagal efforts and the film, although getting a limited release on Oct 30th, is basically straight to video and in quality it's not even one of the better.
Directed by Television maestro David Carson whose only previous big screen gig was directing the fairly enjoyable Star Trek: Generations, although that was only enjoyable for seeing Picard and Kirk team up and for laughing every time Shatner opened his mouth to say a line.
Once you get over this initial disappointment, there are moments and contributions that suggest what could have been, particularly Trisha Mortimer as the 'love-keeper' who manages to breath life into Prattens inconsistant dialogue and Voda Barnes who although over-written is suitably sexy as the Au-Pair.
Wilson is somewhat effective in his performance although he ends up being too sympathetic and the movie needs an actor who isn't so goody-goody.
Also...the voices are distractingly childlike, although I know that they can't help that.
I caught the flick on TV and I am not sure how easily this movie is to rent, although I know it is on DVD.
I would definitely recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it; although it's gotten mixed reviews, I still think it's a gem among other more shallow, lackluster films.
He's in love with the King's daughter, although how she stood his open mouthed trout kissing is anyone's guess.
These aren't even B grade films-they're more like Z-grade for the most part, although most of them do have the laugh factor going for them, since they're pure Italian cheese of the stinkiest kind.
The film has a fast pace that doesn't let you get bored and although it lasts about 2 hours, it's coming to the end quite quick.
Where the first movie had humor (although a very dark kind of humor) and it's own kind of sick style that I think worked very well; this is just as weak as it can get.
Heck, I even like "Drive" and "Mean Guns" better, although they're of a totally different genre (and most people didn't seem to like "Mean Guns", especially).
The only reason that I would not have included it is because although it's very bad, there are SMALL glimpses of actual entertainment scattered about.
But toward the end the moral seems to be that no matter what you do to change the past, the final outcome is the same; actually a clever idea (although not an original one).
I do not refer to this as a "film" since it was shot on video and run through the "film look" software (like Magic Bullet) which only makes your video look like grainy video (although some of the cinematography on the outside stuff is done really well - I'll give them that).
At least, the makers of this Oz trilogy put some care and energy, albeit a nauseating excess of it, in front of the camera although not behind it.
I wonder how popular these films were, although, apparently, they weren't popular enough because Baum's production company was short lived.
I have higher expectations on him, although his recent work doesn't promise much.
Lastly, although I could probably keep complaining about this film, Jason is absolutely NOT SCARY in the first half of this movie.
The mother dies of a heart attack it is clear and it seems like some of the youngsters who die later on might have died by accidents prompted by the spider attacks although this less clear due to the shoddy way the scenes are shot.
All the later victims effectively dying by chance like this seems contrived and extremely silly, although if they did die by spider venom the forensics department in this town is really bad for not picking up on it.
The movies climax in which our heroine finally deals with her sleazy uncle does not involve the spiders at all, although the way in which she deals with him makes it the best and creepiest scene in the movie.
Sullivan also sings well; although, his choice of material definitely does NOT rock.
Don Sullivan delivers sufficient charisma and screen presence to keep his "gee-wiz" 1950s teenager enthusiasm from becoming sickening, and even allowing for subplots with his girlfriend and handicapped sister to ring surprisingly true (although Kellogg's comical attempt to worm in song numbers for him underscores the credibility of the character and film simultaneously).
The cast's performances are laughable, the special FX consists of a real gila monster walking around on miniature models, and the 'pop music' is wildly inappropriate, although the atmospheric score isn't bad.
But the film suffers from the production code of the day; Hammett's novel holds up, and the sexual politics of it wasn't allowed to be transferred to the screen (although it could have with better writing -- Casablanca has a lot of dark sex jokes).
This was, although nothing extraordinary.....just pretty entertaining with an interesting lead character and strange soundtrack.
there is not much blood to speak of either although the version I watched is probably the cut one.
This film although uses a lot of profanity is one of the best comedies produce in Mexico in the last 5 years.
And, the vampires require a justice to arrive after enough time has been provided for possible escape to declare their prisoner guilty, although, to their credit, they never do that again.
although there are lots of boobies and sex scenes, none of them are even worth fast forwarding to.
although those weren't that good either.
I'll add a couple comments more since IMDb asks me to do so... although I think that it's boring and unnecessary to say that the actors are as charming as a brick is; that the movie is interrupted by a stupid "amateur home musical video clip" in order to promote the latest (Chilean maybe?
The absence of Peter Sellers is palpable in the second half of the film, and although the film clearly attempts to remain light-hearted and Pantheresque, this absence lends a sadness to Trail of the Pink Panther which makes it a much more successful eulogy than comedy.
He probably hated the idea, although he was writing the script.
It's not that the story is so bad, although it's not particularly outstanding in any way, but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters, meaning those other than the regulars in this case.
A man may marry more than one wife, although a wife can have only one husband.
The only thing that was decent was the acting job by the dead daughter, which although tried to copy Blair Witch Project acting, was very good.
There's a neat fistfight on a staircase, supposedly down two flights of stairs although I suspect it was filmed on the same one flight with the protagonists starting over at the top.
Casey's old gang and surrogate family keeps popping up and a lot of people are killed and Casey goes after them and eventually everything gets sorted out, although even after just watching the whole thing I couldn't have told you how.
Depp is watchable as Abberline although Abberline is far less interesting than Depp's similar character in Sleepy Hollow.
The reveal of who the ripper is, will come of no surprise to anyone, although the depth of the conspiracy is interesting.
No... A lot of the scenes looked although they had been filmed on a sound stage, whose sets were not particularly impressive.
I have seen a lot of Hindi films, and although I am not Indian, I found them easier to understand than this movie.
While I love Varley, his forte is short stories, some novels are moderate to great, but definitely not screenplays (although we don't know how tied his hands were and he only wrote one other screenplay - "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank", which I have not seen, but have read, yet another fantastic short story).
Kim Rossi Stuart, one of the best of his generation, is wonderful to watch but his character swings from gloomy to gloomier and we're ask to feel compassion for him - although we're not allow to grieve for his victims.
In S7, you have six people you'll never hear from again and David Straithairn, who although he is a fine actor, doesn't deliver here.
So, although I love John Sayles (Matewan and Eight Men Out were unbelievably terrific movies), and although this movie did come first, I would avoid it like a dead skunk in the middle of the road.
Michael Moore and other American liberals, although critical, don't go this far, but the blindly patriotic assume so because they can't stand any criticism of their home team.
And although cinema has gone through a major evolution in the past 30 years, most nowadays thrillers don't come even close to TCM when it comes to atmosphere and "creepyness".
I wasn't particularly offended by anything in the film although I can imagine some people would be.
However - one plus was the Selma Blair character - although it sort of felt it was a little underused.
There are long, dry conversations and some tepid flirting between the Goddess and the less looney of the two men, although he manages to patronize her like crazy.
They finally all run away together, although why they didn't leave the psycho Snidely Whiplash wannabee behind is beyond me.
Even Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan couldn't save it, although JB was funny.
The performances are relatively functionary from the cast, although Marilyn Burns puts in a good turn as the tortured 'final girl', making us feel that her life is truly at risk.
Most of these questions are not even addressed although they are essential if the Âmodel" should work.
my least favorite of all the Meyer films, and although I do like Napier, Supervixens and also Cherry, Harry, And Raquel are the 2 Meyer films I've seen that I really don't like much.
The actors, although some of them veterans in the biz, were terrible.
Bill Murray was one of the most successful although many of his movies have been downright disasters (Eg.
I like Maury Povich, but although I watch this show, only because of him and his advice, I don't like it.
Mr. Carpenter doesn't evoke either the other "master of suspense" (Alfred Hitchcock), or even Wolf Rilla; although, he does include examples of his own abilities to startle.
Sometimes they're visibly mangled, although the visuals aren't in any way offensive.
This isn't a pro-war film or an anti-war film, although I can see why the fanatics on both sides would like to claim it.
The Sacrifice (directed by Koji Shiraishi) is the title of the third story, and although lacking in scares, it is made watchable by the presence of the gorgeous YÃ» Yamada who stars as a young woman cursed by a creepy workmate, but who is ultimately saved by her mother (who sacrifices herself to a giant disembodied head with strange eyes!).
although i then found out the truth about the Kevin Mitchnick story.
There's little effort from the production to create any suspense at all...  2) Because although some of the technical aspects are rather accurate (the Dumpster Diving and all the Social Engineering) , most of them are truly absurd.
Unfortunately, Katherine Isabelle who played Ginger in the original film isn't in this film as much as most viewers would like, and she serves the plot in more of an advisory capacity (much like the ghost in American Werewolf in London) and this doesn't allow her much screen time (although this will hopefully be rectified in the prequel; Ginger Snaps Back).
It didn't top it - the ending here, although good, and very imaginative isn't as well done as the idea suggests it could have been; and that's a shame.
Some films are so bad they are fun to watch in a perverse way but this is just dull and boring, although, seeing respected actor, James Earl Jones, taking out the baddies with remote control radio Spitfire planes has it's bizarre, surreal moment to be sure!
I think K-9 and Company was a good idea,and Elisabeth Sladen always gives a great performance although Sarah-Jane seems a bit more grumpy than her normal self in this spin-off.
There's a military man who wants to stop them, although the motive is really fuzzy.
- The story, although it doesn't really matter, starts with a 13th Century monk who turns to Satanism in exchange for immortality.
A poorly developed script full of diabolical dialogue and precious little action doesn't help matters, of course, and with Findlay's visuals having that distinct porno quality (an effect helped no end by regular nudity from some suspiciously low-rent bimbos), the result is a nasty looking and amateurish yawn-fest that, although not quite as terrible as Blood Sisters, is still a chore to sit through.
Most effects appear to be the practical kind although there are also a couple of dodgy camera effects which are overused.
No background music at all would perhaps have been a better option although strangely enough there were a couple of scenes near the end where it actually worked.
The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 (1993) & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise.
The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good, there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle.
He is not changing anything although one thinks something would change in his mind.
By the end of the movie no one has gained much of anything, although it appears Violette will have the time to do more shopping.
I noticed it was from the producers of saw and although it was a straight to DVD film I thought it couldn't be terrible due to the quality of the production team.
The killer wears a little tiny face pulled off of a mannequin, which is sort of a nice touch but there's your Michael & Jason...although this thing is called Jonah.
Looks like that girl from the Sopranos and the kid from The Sandlot have nothing to look forward to in the way of acting careers, although it wouldn't surprise me if there was a sequel, what with the way it was all set up.
David Rogers is terrible as Steve and Alex Solovitz as Jim wasn't much better (although he does try--Rogers doesn't).
although i had heard it was offensively bad and horribly violent, it wasn't as bad as all that.
The man shows that he knows nothing about self control, although he is trying to teach people about "cults".
Therefore Daisy Kenyon, although it possesses a few noir elements, is not film noir.
Preminger doesn't have many surprises in store for us (except Andrews' scorned wife, who takes her frustrations out on her youngest daughter), although Andrews' penchant for using terms of endearment towards both women and men is amusing and the design here is tidy and attractive.
Casper Van Dien breaks a new record in looking shabby in this movie, although he is supposed to be a marine biologist.
The acting is pretty bad all around, although the mad scientist is amusing and has some good one-liners.
and kelly hu, although hot, is useless, whats with all the crap about Chinese way of life and low wages.??
Exchanging furtive glances, Mr. Namath and Ann simply look foolish, although there are great location shots..I believe in the Southwest.
Having said that, it's rather bland and unemotional at times (which, admittedly, fits the stereotype of an early Puritan community) although in the few scenes in which there is emotion (I think particularly of the closing scene with Dimmesdale's public confession) that emotion is well portrayed.
Some of the performances (especially I thought that of Hardie Albright as Dimmesdale, with the exception of that closing scene) seemed a bit forced, although I appreciated the attempt to mix some humour into a movie that could have been very heavy, as Alan Hale and William Kent portray the attempts of Hockings to help Goodfellow court the widow Crakstone, although in some ways (again, I haven't read the novel) that seemed unconnected to the overall story.
In the lead role, Colleen Moore was good as Hester Prynne, although she didn't dominate the movie in the way you would expect the lead to do.
In small edition there was a couple great song tracks in the movie by the Robert Cray band, that set off a cool and rude mood, although there was a lack of good scoring through out the whole story.
For a start the title The Fear Chamber has no real relevance to anything featured in the film although that's not a major issue to be honest, what is a major issue though is how bad the script is.
I was a small child when this ran during its one season in 1970, and it had a profound effect on me, although at the time I had no idea why.
Emily Perkins does a wonderful job as Brigitte, and the new character, Ghost, was perfect, although her lines seemed a little too rehearsed.
I was not aware, although not surprised, that there was a whole series of episodes "spinning-off" from this original, and I wouldn't mind seeing those.
Anyway, I don't think this was meant as a comedy (although after the beatnik scene I'm really not sure) but if you're looking for horror this only qualifies if you're looking for so bad it's good I need to be high to enjoy omg I'm horrified I paid for this.
But there is a continuous stream of action running through the film, and Kelly shows once again that he had the stuff to be a martial-arts star (although his career was fairly brief).
The final massacre is so over-the-top, it's simultaneously appalling and laughable; the idea that someone would actually hold this viewpoint, however, is what's truly appalling here (although, not as laughable as believing that thousands of rounds fired by trained Guardsmen could only result in three deaths in a huge crowd).
I watched it, and although the animation is not on par with anything that is out today, it is still probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life.
It kinda ruined the entire thing, although it was ruined anyway just by making it a movie.
Walken effortlessly explains the plot and invites the girl in, although she has been sleeping with his associate X (Willem Dafoe).
This curious, good-looking version of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" was promoted as faithful to the original work - and, although is follows events much more closely than the familiar version, its changes make it a more different, distant work than you might expect.
However, although deserving a place among the worst 250 films in IMDB, there are movies worst than that.
I do not consider myself a die hard fan of the anime version of Fist of the North Star, although it does have its moments.
The conflict's introduction with some proper material is good--although begins a little straight forward and seems jump started.
The characters and performances are wooden but functional, although this is probably a deliberate method of enhancing the surreal aspects more.
So, I put on Spoorloos, and although I've seen it a few times before, it once again grabbed my interest, and I noticed, right away, a few details that make this version far superior to its American counterpart.
with guns...although he's unarmed.
Fans of both older movies and the psychological thriller genre should get a kick out of this, as it is a reasonably well made film with lots of bizarre plot twists and plenty of suspense, although it should be noted that the movies that appear on the 50 movie boxed sets are usually NOT of the highest quality, so this is hardly what I'd call a "classic" in any sense other than age.
Also of note is that Claudia Christan (So hot in The Hidden) is ultimately wasted as one of the hero's sidekicks and although she is a woman that even I would be afraid to mess with in real life, her character is too lightweight.
There are 14 songs in all, the best one being the finale although part of it is just her shaking hands with people in the audience.
Simon Yam's screen presence is good, although he fails to impress.
The actors try to overcome the limitations of the Z-Grade script, but the performances are merely passable, although the actor playing the nanny was suitably creepy.
And finally (although I could go on and on), the ending where Ben and Rebecca ride away from Hollywood to who knows where.
Nothing really happens during the movie, although there seems to be some subtle winking going on between the soldiers.
Although the film is stained with the fore mentioned vulgarities, some of the actor's performances and beautiful, although most likely inaccurate, set designs cannot go unnoticed.
Despite the fact that she speaks solely Japanese and never has subtitles beneath her, Machiko Kyo was able to communicate through body language most of what she was saying, and this cannot go unrecognized, although her portrayal of a geisha is far from accurate.
Watching Rex become consumed in every way by his quest to find Saskia was also extremely difficult to watch, although it was certainly inevitable.
Well, he was confident and everything, but nothing he said was funny (although to be fair somebody else probably wrote it).
Despite the synopsis, unintentional laughs are in short supply, although a sequence where one of Curtis' elderly customers is possessed, floats down the hallway and throws herself down the stairs is a mini-masterclass in ineptitude as it fluctuates between failed attempts at humour and laughable attempts at drama.
Curtis was doing pretty much everything to pay the bills about this time period, so although he's not exactly phoning it in as Harry, he's also got this look like he's going over lines for his next gig in his head, even while he's doing this one.
I don't really mind Drake, although it gets annoying that all he thinks about is girls, and Megan gets annoying that she just can't leave Drake and Josh alone for once.
The father was slightly better in his part, although he just came across as an utter moron.
And although it was painted a la Down With Love, it did nothing to uphold the style statement it seemed to be trying to make.
Ultimately, I was surprised to learn that the director was behind some pretty famous music videos...and although I think she should keep to that genre, the directing I think was alright.
Bloody Mary rarely gets much horror treatment, although with the right filmmaker it's rife for exploring.
Strangely, although every adult and a bunch of kids were killed, no cops stick around after the first five minutes, leaving Knox free to discover bodies all over the place.
The locusts are also BORING...although I have to give slight kudos to the fact that it doesn't look like a big swarm of computer animated bugs flying around.
There are brief glimpses of Argento's class, the nicely lit blue tones as Mel is killed, or the sequence when Argento's camera pans across the floor for what seems like an eternity with lots of people walking past to come to rest on the killers & their victims feet by which a few seconds later her decapitated head lands but these scenes are few & far between as although technically Non Ho Sonno is good it's all pretty bland & forgettable for most of it's duration.
And, sadly, although she is evil, you KNOW that by the end of the film everything will work out perfectly--making it predictable and very formulaic.
For a start the character's are awful, to call them one-dimensional & bland would be too kind, the dialogue is terrible as for some reason these people can't seem to string a proper sentence together, it's an absolute bore to sit through with a predictable & clichÃ©d 'plot' although I use the term plot very loosely, all the zombie attacks are virtually the same & end up with the human character's having a karate fight with them, however on the plus side Swamp Zombies might just be the best horror/zombie/martial arts film ever made, not that I can think of any others mind you.
The cheerleaders spend more time swimming and laying out in the sun than practicing their cheers (although Garrett's rap was bad enough that I only needed to hear him practice it once) and the main character Alison wonders around into creepy shacks in the woods looking for soda.
In case you're not up on your trivia, Leif was Brooke Shield's first boyfriend when she was a 13-year old sex symbol (although it was Dean Cain that got to break her in at Princeton).
The acting performances are far above average and the gruesome make-up effects (although nearly not enough in my opinion) look very convincing.
If you want to see a OK soap from Norway the only one is Syv SÃ¸stre, although it had some really bad actors in it the story lines were far more exciting and actual had original characters.
shots really grate the viewer (although, I'm sure the crew had a much worse time having to waste their efforts on such shots as an elevator button P.O.V., etc.)
I enjoyed watching this movie, although I may never look at locusts quite the same way again.
Then, those who are familiar with the series should also bear in mind that, although the series ended with a cliffhanger, this one was very badly done, ridiculously showing images of people performing so-called 'miracles' and that stupid thing of Seattle being renamed 'Promise City', and completely evading one fact clearly emerging from that pile of garbage: even if at the end of the series, they found a way to make a test to determine who could or could not take promicine without danger,the fact remains that this 'new world' would be divided between two classes of people: those with abilities and those without, in short, practically two species of humans.
It's number one strength is definitely the skill of Lucy Lawless(although it's somewhat wasted in many emotionally light scenes), and the script can, at times, be slightly inept.
The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 (1993) & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise.
The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good, there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle.
There was an enormous amount of confusion regarding her character and at one point it was suggested that she played a major role in Sean Penn's character's (Thomas Janes) past, although this may have been a projection of Jean Janes' suspicious fantasy.
The dialogue direction limps and although there are some good gags in the opening scenes, including a music-hating music critic and Jack Norton playing his usual fine comic drunk, there isn't that much in the way of laughs to recommend this piece.
On the positive side, I thought Jennifer Rubin was beautiful, although she played a total jerk and that Grant Show was good.
They attempted to put a story in there and follow it, although they didn't and the characters had to state the obvious intermittently in the film because they obviously weren't devoting much camera time to it.
And yet "Cabaret" is still standing as one of the most crucial films of the 70's, although it has to be said that the actual love story is secondary to the immortal songs and Â especially Â the portrayal of frustrated Germany during the years prior to WWII.
The dance routine was quite interesting, although I have seen Tim Curry dance better in films like Annie and RHPS.
However, there's at least one messy special effect worth seeing & at less than a hour in length it moves along at a decent enough pace although even then it failed to really grip or engage me.
Technically the show's fine & even pretty impressive as it belies it's low budget made-for-TV roots, the special effects are excellent as usual although how the actor's managed to keep a straight face while acting this stuff out is beyond me.
He's no Hannibal (although they try really hard don't they!)
The director needs to take some of the blame for his failure to reign in the actors and the script (although when your lead actor is also the writer and the producer ...).
Take, for instance, Julie Christie's hair in "Dr. Zhivago," or Kate Beckinsale's...well, entire appearance in "Van Helsing" (although, was that even an issue in that steaming pile of bad FX?).
If it were made in 1931, it would almost certainly be in Black & White, have primitive sound quality (sound pictures still being relatively new at that time), and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content (although being that 1931 was a year pre-code, who knows...).
So although McCloud was originally born in Scotland and Ramierez in er, Egypt, now they were aliens from a planet called Zeist; handy, because this new ancestry meant that all that was needed to reengergise the concept was that another visitor showed up on Earth and the games can begin again.
Co-scripted by Dylan Thomas, this tale of three ageing and infirm, although philanthropically inclined, spinster sisters presiding over a crumbling mansion in 1930s South Wales is an oddball post-War slice of Welsh Gothic.
The vignettes are standalone (although the bit with the RZA, GZA and Bill Murray was referential), pointless and trying too hard to capture absurdist humor.
Talking of Slim's zombie horse the special effects on it are poor, as are most of the special effects in House II: The Second Story in fact, although as I've already said the zombie Slim looked good.
The FX are not very convincing, although may be unpleasant for the casual horror fan.
The movie is in my opinion a POOR rendition of the book, although I would LOVE to know where the house is that it was filmed at.
This is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, although I'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema.
The worst performance is "Ranger Bill" played by David Johansen, he really sinks this movie before it has any chance to be anything although the other actors are not much better.
Holmes, in the end, is able to figure out what exactly happened, although it does not please his client.
The director, although having made his displeasure with the studios clear, doesn't seem to give us anything to cheer for him in the parts where he might have been given control.
The characters, although almost brimming with development possibility, were left to hang like a basketball mid-flight, as if we were watching a trilogy without the courtesy of seeing part one and having no hope for part three.
My first reaction to Babylon A.D. was that it's not nearly as bad as its own director, Matthieu Kassovitz, has been claiming it is, although that reaction came to me before I got to the end of the movie.
The movie has a cool set-up and a few good action sequences, although they suffer from that all too modern symptom of having been put together by editors who must have been on some kind of amphetamines.
Vin Diesel stars as Toorop, a hardened loner of a mercenary whose latest mission is to escort a mysterious young woman from a convent in Russia to America (where he is listed as a terrorist), although like so much of the rest of the movie, we never learn why.
The sex scenes seem to go on & on forever, they are at times quite strong with actual masturbation & fellatio although these scenes are brief while at other times they consist of nothing more than two people kissing for what seems like an eternity.
That previous film had boasted a nearly incomprehensible plot and was truly a mess; "The Corpse Grinders" at least has a story that hangs together, outlandish as it may be, although the acting, scripting, editing and camera-work are all fairly inept.
The main story had no direction and although the hospital was clearly the central setting it did not give any sign of coherence to the series.
Yosemite Sam was more nuanced and received less cloyingly saccharine comeuppance from his adversaries, although Yosemite's comeuppance was distinguished by being funny: no such luck with Stegman, and the Kingdom Hospital is plagued by King's inability to write intentionally funny lines.
But this thing could have been written and acted by members of the robot army, who look like they're made of Lego's or like unusually angular Gorts, although we only see one of them at a time.
The map shows California is a state although in the 1800s; I believe the map is wrong for that era.
It's a mess of 70's clichÃ©s, which, since it came out in 1981 (although it might have been on the shelf for a while), you've got to believe were stale, even then.
The film is quickly paced but poorly edited, although it may simply be the age of the print.
i just watched this film, and although it's received some rave reviews on here which piqued my curiosity initially, i was thoroughly disappointed by this horrible, horrible movie.
Whoopi Goldberg,although a good actress and is funny, is dull in this film as a woman who is again asked to don the nun's drab to teach choir to a bunch ofmis-fit run of the mill clichÃ©d kids at a Catholic school.
I saw 'Father's Little Dividend' without realising he was the director, and although there are obvious parallels - both family comedies set over a number of months -'Father's Little Dividend' lacks Minelli's great strength - the extraordinary beauty of his cinematography.
No one really shines, although Billie Burke, as the paternal grandmother, keeps threatening to burst out with a real comic performance.
It's the best played scene in the film, tipping from comedy to genuinely heartfelt emotion (as opposed to Hollywood sentiment), although it's almost spoilt by the reconciliation, when they fall into a typical movie clinch.
And although some of the set-pieces are impressive, it doesn't seem to be able to sustain optimum thrust for long, as others seem painfully dragged out.
Considering it was made in 1967, the film is fairly graphic; we've got a scene that sees a girl have her eyes poked out (although we don't actually see it) and there's plenty of nudity, of course.
Surprisingly, given McGovern's own politics, there's almost no hint of republicanism here, although within a few decades Britain was engulfed by a civil war that disputed absolutely the relevance of monarchy: perhaps this is ignored because it was a Protestant rebellion.
There was zero chemistry between the two leads and, although I am a big fan of Russell Crowe's, I could not for the life of me figure out what Colin and Midori, the main characters, saw in each other.
The ending, although it's good looking and effective, is a letdown that doesn't feel like a fitting ending at all.
I am amazed this had a budget of near $50,000,000, it doesn't look like it although it's undeniably well staged & made.
But although this is her story, the one character that steals the show is a young girl at the hospital named Ghost.
After running around corridors for an hour and a half, being put in solitary confinement (although allowed out to have sex, because sweet mercy that's what being Jean Claude Van Damme is about) Burke suddenly finds out inmates are being killed and their organs removed, not in some event relating last hour's worth of clues he'd been gathering but because the guards left a surgical saw conveniently next to their big suspicious medical cabinet.
The story itself is too routine and although at times Death Warrant has a grisly twist that give it a jolt, Death Warrant is very forgettable stuff.
His play is flat, as is Luchini's, who isn't funny enough to pull the audience through this annoyingly foreseeable screenplay (although the basic idea behind it is quite interesting).
The camera angles are often unique as well and give the entire scenery a strange sense of familiarity although they are actually portraying future scenarios.
There is a fairly high body count & a fair amount of blood too although it's not that graphic it is quite violent & whether Red Dawn would still get a PG-13 today is debatable.
SPOILER ALERT: The "Ape" was actually a guy in a really BAD gorilla mask, although I have to admit I did get a pretty good laugh every time the Ape sat next to a lamp or a wall and turned his head so you could see the empty eye sockets.
About half the characters are also homeless, which is nice although it's not exactly a social-realist or intimate portrayal.
Its budget really shows on screen although I must say that the cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers are not bad looking.
I didn't see the movie from the beginning, and can only assume from the bluesy chords on the soundtrack that the movie is set in the Delta, although that's not really Caldwell country.
This was shot on no budget and it shows: the sets are really shabby (although that DOES fit the tone of the movie); all the characters are unpleasant; people scream rather than talk to each other; the dialogue is banal; Stoler and Lo Bianco aside the acting is terrible; the music is hilariously inappropriate; the attraction between Beck and Fernandez is never explained and, quite simply, this is boring!
Considering some of the minor characters in "Dream Date" (including Pauley Shore as a brain-dead high school student who was convinced that the father is the devil) and it being predicated upon more slapstick humor than we saw in "She's Out of Control," it is a bit funnier in comparison, although probably geared for the more "wholesome" family film choice.
Yet, I'm sure it is still a favorite among 80s nostalgics (although, I'll pass on this one).
Vince Latello's one-liners fall flat far too often (although that line that I used to title this review was one of the better ones).
Dark is depressed because his ex-girlfriend only wants to have sex with him (no-strings-attatched), although, she has a new girlfriend named Lucifer.
Do not watch this movie unless you want a good hour and a half worth of laughs (although the director didn't intend this ).
Martin Landau as Geppetto is quite a nice guy, although you don't exactly see him a lot.
Aqequate, although it is okay for kids!
One more gripe: the stylized animation, although meant to be hip (I think) just seemed unappealing.
I think if you are trying to enjoy this story, read the book because Hollywood does a poor job with this one, although i don't feel that book is a real knockout either.
The other dumb thing is that although this guy is supposed to be such an amazing hunter, he keeps missing--even at point blank range.
I wanted to see it because Michael Cera is really funny in SUPERBAD and he is funny in this "movie" as well, BUT his role although being on the cover of the DVD is limited to one sketch that runs for about 3-4 minutes.
The film is some time during the reign of Queen Victoria, although it is impossible to be more precise than that.
This tradition was already strong in the late sixties, and was to become the dominant one in the British cinema (although fortunately not on television) during the seventies.
The film has also been described as satirical, although it contains little satire worthy of the name; it is hardly cutting-edge humour to satirise the ways of a hundred years ago.
The original, starring Humphrey Bogart, was bad enough, although considering that it was made during the war, it probably served its purpose as a propaganda piece.
It's depressing, all right, because it's always depressing to spend two hours in the company of someone or something with no energy, no life and not very many thoughts; and I'm not referring to Harry Caul here (although I could be), but to the film itself.
So although special effects, acting, etc are more or less on par with other Sci-Fi Channel movies, this movie fails in the one place a lousy movie never should - it fails to entertain.
if some thing like that would approach me, i'll just smack it right into the ground, although i'll probably need a bigger shoe.
Also, the structure of the novel, which although overwhelming, is supremely successful, and is again lost in the film.
This is possibly Bluth at his worst, although it's a toss up between this and A Troll in Central Park.
His barnyard friends, which include Patou, a droopy canine unable to tie his shoes, Peepers, a bespectacled and lisping mouse, and Snipes, a zany magpie, do little to emerge as anything memorable, although the first two are well voiced by Phil Harris and Sandy Duncan, respectively.
Phil Harris has a great voice and does a credible job (although some might find it strange that the dog is recounting the whole thing).
Campbell, Harris, Duncan, Plummer, and squeaky Ellen Greene (as Goldie) all do the best they can with their characters, although Toby Scott-Granger's childish speech impediment does get in the way of his portrayal of Edmond (although considering how weak his character is, it's no surprise he doesn't give a memorable performance).
T.J. Kuenster's dozen songs, on the other hand, are mediocre to bad, particularly the owls' Bach-style numbers, although the ones for Chanticleer are admittingly a lot of fun.
Right away, The Farm is identified as the perfect place to be, although there's no farmer, no crops, and I don't recall seeing a barn.
Patou told us that a) Goldie was a lot smarter and nicer than she seemed at first and b) that she was really falling for Chanticleer although she was only supposed to fake it.
The Boston Tea Party is entertaining although the singing after it is unforgivably Disney.
's family as the film progresses, but there's no closure on his mom-and-pop issues, although I suppose one could argue that the lack of parental comfort has something to do with the end of the movie.
However, those playing the roles are NOT the same (although Jean-Pierre Bacri stars in BOTH films but plays totally different roles).
This movie is a great Fictional creation (just like, let's say stories made up like in Star Wars or Star Trek) although it lacks in the whole story, characters are clumsy and so on - the movie is OK (3/10).
Worse yet, rarely very suspenseful, although some viewers will doubtless be on edge of seats waiting for the annoying heroine to get her come-uppance.
A young couple get arrested for selling 'dirty pictures' (one of the titles for this release) although the pictures sometimes show nothing more than Ornella Muti naked in a photo-me-booth.
Mitchum tries hard to hold the film together, but although he plays the main character, he has the least footage.
I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better.
Possibly the most visible blunder is that the murder set-up is far from perfect, although that's rivalled by silly plot holes like the one in which Douglas goes to Mortenson's apartment to retrieve his wife's wedding ring, thereby removing evidence of a connection between them, but neglects to do anything about the six-foot-wide painting OF HER FACE.
Sure, little kids might be amused (although my cousins- even at very young ages- found it lame).
Director Nosseck doesn't do anything special with the film, it has no real style or flair to it although it does look a little better than it's low budget made-for-TV origins would suggest.
It was his last great masterwork although he somewhat betrayed the novel.
Other options instead are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable) which has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (although completely mispronounced), and there are some Esperanto street signs in Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator."
Pretty hair on the redhead, too, although I never did figure out what she was doing in this at all.
The mood and setting of the film appear authentic and honest, although often tranquil and unsettling.
Second, the implication for most of the deaths in the tunnel was that somehow the water in the pipes had turned into sulfuric acid, although they don't explicitly say so.
As an adaptation it reminded me of those online translation services that literally show you the meaning of every word you give them...although the translation doesn't make much sense.
Anyone who doesn't get that, obviously can't be that big of a Star Wars fan, although you definitely don't need to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this simlulator.
To the film's credit, the shots are in focus, and although most or all shots are hand-held they're steady.
Conversely, the relationship between Suzy and Victor's father feels completely unbelievable and seems to work only as a means for Victor to better know his father, although I am never convinced that happens.
All you have to do is put on a red t-shirt and he will probably wet himself (although by the end he has inexplicably gotten over this fear and dons a Santa suit).
My only comment on De Mornay is that although she had her moments, on stage and being sultry, it seems to me she has about as much talent as most strippers.
Dolph takes a break from directorial duties with this one, which is just as well as the poor chap needed one after the varitable trio of The Defender, The Russian Specialist and Missionary Man, although according to the trivia page he took over for most of the time from director Samuel Dolhasca.
It sounds like a troubled production, shot officially between China and Canada, and although there are moments of flair, it's usually quite obvious to see.
Also, the actors often try too hard, or, they're simply incompetent, although it's probable that NOBODY could convincingly deliver what's written here.
It was artful and flowing and did the most towards helping understand what was going on, although the scene changes were a little jumpy, visually this film was great!
The film's few attempts at humor are pathetically unfunny, although many other lines that were not intended to be funny may elicit laughs for their absurdity.
A bunch of teenagers arrived for a party and wrecked the house, but although there was a teenage son, he was of a different age group than these people who came from nowhere.
The CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more detail on the characters, although I must admit that Advent Children's characters moved much more naturally.
Eponine and Gavroche are favorites in both the book and the stage production, and although you see "glimpses" of them in the film, they just don't hold the obliged significance.
All in all, this movie, although it has a nice blurb on the back, stinks.
This is true, although the problem didn't really manifest until Ernie Carroll, the voice and puppeteer of one Oswald Q.
For God's sake it is based on another Indian (non-Bollywood movie) Many previous movies have dealt with the romances of married couples- although not nearly so effectively.
The REAL next big thing is here (although I would like to ask the real next big thing what he is doing with that biker bag slung over his shoulders throughout the movie).
He extracts good performances from his actors, he has a sense and understanding of emotion, he portrays the entire story realistically, and that's what makes his first work so great (although he would ruin that image in his future projects BAB and JBJ).
The soundtrack was kinda neat although very oddly placed along side the story.
In effect, A Little Trip to Heaven plays a bit like the watered down, third-rate cousin of the thriller Insomnia (nothing spectacular to begin with), although here most potential intrigue is crushed by the deadening weight of a charisma-lacking direction.
Because these remakes can't achieve the status of the original versions (although good story, good performances or good music).
What mostly bothered me in the movie was that pinhead,although getting shown little enough to keep him scary,does most of the dirty work himself,but the thing is he doesn't use the regular chains and stuff.
His friends later mourn that they all knew what was happening to him but still kept playing Hellworld, although if you watch the making-of featurettes on the DVD, Director Rick Bota refers to Hellworld as "a website, or video game."
This made-for-TV film is quite well made, the giant squid CGI computer effects aren't as bad as I had expected although that's not to say they are good.
It's nice to know that there are equally unwatchable "straight movies" about relationships (although with Hollywood budgets, celebrity casts, and big-name directors).
The script is a little weak, and things get a bit maudlin at times, although the pre-code one-liners are fun.
He merely puts the emphasis on the comedy factors, and although not always equally successful, at least he manages to keep "Tequila Body Shots" endurable.
I have to give him some credit as it's certainly colourful & has a garish look to it although all the Mexican stereotypical clichÃ©s come out like innuendo about sheep, everyone seems to wear sombreros & that all Mexican jails are full of gays...
However, although deserving a place among the worst 250 films in IMDB, there are movies worst than that.
Robin's rise from simple outlaw to leader of the gang also seemed a little too quick and easy, although I appreciated the background that was offered to his character, which offered a reasonable explanation of how Sir Robert Hode became Robin Hood.
In regards to the latter point, I didn't feel that Robin came across as particularly noble in this movie (although he does decide to return the taxes to the common folk) but rather he seemed interested primarily in Marian (Uma Thurman).
The underdog-friendly class consciousness is pervasive and fitfully amusing, although it's schematic and sentimental as well.
In the end, it just seemed like one big incoherent, underdeveloped mess, although I felt it earned 3 points for the combination of Forsythe's performance, the odd usage of Gary Busey, the cinematography and the production design.
Well, hardly, although I admit the Irish actor Gerard McSorley's performance as John Gilligan, the man who supposedly ordered Veronica's murder, gives it a momentary kick, not because his character rings truer than anyone else's but because McSorley makes Gilligan such a monster he actually makes him entertaining which, of course, is the one thing this film should never be.
It's cheap, it's boring and although there are a few unintentional laughs along the line, they aren't worthy of the price of a rental.
I said about 20 minutes in, we'd seen a nice but cheaply made, with some woeful sound effects flashback sequence, which basically killed any hope of a final pay off, as you already got to see her ride naked although it could have been mistaken for an ironing board.
Likewise, I think that although driven by true-to-life narratives, the edgy exactitude of Solomon's cinematography indicates the artist's innovative imagination.
(To override a mission saving action by the computer you need two people and security codes...) Once you raise it, although it turns off, in a while it will destroy itself, somehow.
- Any science that was once in the script has been gutted here - there's no mention of WHY the sun is dying or exactly how the bomb will restart it, although an interesting theory about a "Q-particle" infesting the sun is on the production blog.
Even veteran horror actor Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame can't pull this movie into something watchable, although his sudden turn to the dark side is probably the only good twist in this terrible film.
The plot place for Van Campen's character was right, too, although her own dubbing (to spanish) was bad bad bad.
Jeffrey Combs still is the man, although it hurts to see him being downgraded straight to the supportive cast.
The film, although fictional is directed and filmed with a documentary-like sense of realism.
(although that whole "bad juju" episode was sooo bad and contrived it made me want to through my TV out of a window).
That was many years ago so I guess something about this film impressed me as I have never quite forgotten it although some of the people in the cast would probably like to.
If you're interested in the ideas of the film then read Crichton's original "Andromeda Strain", although the plot of this version is actually closer to Sagan's "Contact" (more investigative, and perhaps even more worthy than Crichton's).
On the acting front, Essex's limitations are exposed and he fails to draw in the viewer, unlike his lighter playing in "That'll Be The Day", although more experienced actors like Adam Faith and Larry Hagman get more to chew on in their roles.
The acting was mostly convincing, although there were some spells of poor acting.
I don't even want to meet somebody who finds this to be funny, although I already have numerous times.
It does have a nightmarish quality to, although I feel that the fright factor could have have been better.
After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.
I do think that there were some good comedies in the 1970's, though, and these include Dad's Army (although after James Beck's death these were considerably weaker, relying on slapstick from Clive Dunn and to a lesser extent Arthur Lowe) but of course, this was really a 2060's comedy; altogether a different era of quality.
And it's true that very few moments require you to suspend logical disbelief, although we do have to question if it's possible to successfully pull of the stunt where Bruce jumps off the building with a hose wrapped around him.
It does make you relax and feel all romantic, although this is often spoiled by a moment of simple humor.
It's not just Bruce Willis that makes this movie, although he does a fantastic job as the ultimate hero, his line delivery is always perfectly on cue and he's just such a cool guy that anyone could love.
Seeing Charles Durning run, although highly amusing and slightly worrisome from a coronary angle, is not enough to elevate this segment of the film.
But although their hearts are in the right place, I still have to say that they're wrong.
Not to talk about the camera work (probably a first time operator, at least I hope so), although the "day for night" they invented for this movie is shockingly interesting (I understood this only after the first half of the movie and when I mentioned it to the others watching the movie I could see that no one had understood the purpose of this strange color effects before).
Together, they develop a close relationship with each other during the operation although they never see each other until the end, in a very heart-warming scene.
It is the camp's intention to bring the teens face to face with their problems, although in a rather unorthodox manner.
The story behind the movie is good, although some of the special effects could be better.
although some of the characters actions did seem unrealistic.
The only sour note is the abundance of the F-word (although, in retrospect, I might be swearing a blue streak if I were in the same frustrating situation) and the variety of truly moronic supporting characters in the film (the self-serving, coke-snorting yuppie Ellis (Hart Bochner), the foolish and brain-dead deputy police chief Robinson (Paul Gleason), the equally self-serving and pompous TV news reporter Thornburg (William Atherton), and the ignorant and overconfident FBI men (Robert Davi, Grand L. Bush).
While on the surface it seems like a real "Guy's" film, Bonnie Bedelia, as the estranged wife, has a decent role, although hers is the only prominent female role in the picture.
Oh yeah, and although Angie Everheart does a better-than-expected acting job in this movie, her character has been done before.
The dub is also bad, although Hakufu's dub made me giggle a bit.
The plot (complete with minor "twists") is, most of the time, devoid of interest, and the sex scenes, although frequent, don't last too long (OK, I probably didn't see the unrated version).
A very small company, Night Eyes Security, composed of two Griffith brothers, is tasked with guarding the Beverly Hills estate of a British pop musician, Brian Walker, and his wife Nikki (Tanya Roberts) but after she discovers her husband making the grade with a young woman during a party in their home, Mrs. Walker files for divorce, following which Mr. Walker hires Night Eyes to supposedly protect his soon-to-be former wife at their Malibu residence, although his true purpose is to obtain damning video tapes from surveillance cameras that he hopes will record Nikki's own sexual misconduct, thereby crystallizing his courtroom defense for their looming civil trial.
Thank god I didn't buy it, although when i'm on my death bed and cannot stay awake long enough to say my farewells to my grandchildren, and children so forth I will remember that this was the 87 min of my life i'm never getting back !
The senior Dumas' novel is turned into a knockoff of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA -- although as I have never read this Dumas novel, it may simply be returning the compliment.
It started off mighty fine too, Nettles was superb throughout and although the Watson seemed a little young I grew to like him.
A conflict between Leatherface and his father that would've been very interesting was hinted at, but never fully attempted (although Leatherface did burn his father's hand in the oven so he could get a favored tape back).
Though I'd been told this movie was not "cyberpunk" like testsuo, in a way it had a similar ethic, questioning "what makes a person a person", although in this case it's more about what makes one "good or evil".
But that's not all... Our blond cutie-pie leading lady even gets into some heavy underwater-wrestling with some real alive-looking, although clearly heavily drugged, alligator.
The main problem is that although the imitations of the original movies are rather well executed and the famous-actor-look-alikes really look similar to their counterparts, the directors somehow confused simple references to famous movies with being funny.
It is terrible, cheesy, low-budget, slow, and although it has such an incredibly innane straight out of Thundercats plot, still manages to be one of the most confusing films I've ever seen.
I think it was the intention of the filmmakers to mock that, although I don't remember the early 90s enough to conclude that based on its original context.
Retitled to simply Dummy (which was apparently the films original working title) here in the UK this was written & directed by Mark Jones the man responsible for starting the Leprechaun (1993) franchise (gee, thanks a million mate...) & I have to say that I thought Triloquist was rubbish & there's not a lot else to add although i will attempt to try & explain why I am of that opinion.
The acting isn't great although Paydin LaPachin is a real looker but not enough of a looker to make Triloquist worth watching.
Sorry but, can't people see that, although those people might have been good, fine citizens with families, they are not very interesting?
He is also a fine mechanic (although not as fine as the sexy school teacher whom he initially patronises when she offers her help), he can handle a gun, he can give moving speeches and he is an explosives expert ("Where did you learn to do that?"
There they mature into leggy swimsuit models and "dance restlessly" "without knowing why", although we know why, and it has something to do with Loincloth Boy and his rugged pals, with whom and their ilk the lonesome doves have had nothing to do these many moons.
The women are cute and the men are personable and virile...although I found it curious that the "hero" of the movie had less muscle mass than a 14 year old girl; that the monster who attacks the clans at the climax of the film looks like a stop-motion rubber chicken with a pteranondon crest taped on; that the men didn't figure out the part where they picked up rocks and threw them back at the women, but managed to invent fire and cooking...etc.
As for the rest of the film, although it was filmed in color, the print I saw was very, very muddy looking and ugly.
The is much similarity, although the dismal, slow-moving EWS is FAR more interesting than this turkey.
Rosalind Russell would have been far better for the role; although, Davis does an adequate job as well as Brent.
The acting was OK (although at times the actors were inaudible).
I think it's her 4th movie, so it's interesting for me to see her when she was "younger"--although that's only a few years ago!
And although Jean Reno is one of my favorites ever since Le Grand Bleu, his character was just plain weird here.
I love this movie; although not amongst Bergman's best, it is very funny in parts and should not be shunned.
None of the characters were likable, and although it can be fun to dislike awful characters, this film was just too horrible to offer that solace.
The intended audience for this movie is children although the movie was not rated.
"Raise The Titanic" may be the worst big screen adaptation of a novel ever, although the "Da Vinci Code" isn't far behind.
Overall I thought that it was a terrible movie, although I did laugh at several different points because of it being so absurd.
The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular, was well reflected, although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst, misrepresented.. Middle class Americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats, or disowning their wayward daughters.
Probably it is specifically made for girls but my sister didn't even like it although she is a huge Bratz fan.
the girls in the movie, although beautiful, seemed to lack something that would make their performances believable.
Crosby is always good, although the arrangement and photography of his performance of "All Through the Night" were so anemic that one might doze through it, without danger of anything happening to wake one up.
I haven't met a musical that I couldn't find something to like about it, so although the story is somewhat bland one can still enjoy the good highlights.
Bing Crosby stars in his second big screen version of the Cole Porter Broadway smash, although this plot has been modified slightly and brought up to date 50' style..it therefore tells a completely different story to Crosby's first version twenty years earlier.
Bing sings his way through Porters songs in his usual effortless way, as he tries to discard, appease and finally woo a French Ballet star played by ZiZi Jeanmaire, billed here simply as 'Jeanmaire' Another pleasant appearance is made by 40's band leader Phil 'Balloo in Jungle Book' Harris, and he is a welcome addition although regrettably he is not given an opportunity to perform some of those comic southern songs like 'Woodman, Spare that Tree' or 'The Dark Town Poker Club' with which he made his name.
It's just your basic sports movie (although there is debate about whether cheering is a sport.)
The final shot (of Elizabeth Shue in a habit, turning around to expose her butt), although hilarious, just doesn't work.
The CGI is completely horrible, although back at the time this was made (1986), I suppose that this could have been looked at as some high-quality technology.
I did find reason to watch this movie to the end although I fast forwarded some of the more seemingly irrelevant parts.
None of the blame lies on the actors, although you do wonder why they would sign up for something with such a bad screenplay!
I'm surprised to see this listed under "Horror", but not "Comedy" - although it's neither funny, nor scary.
If you were to cut an hour of this movie you might have something a little bit entertaining, although even then I don't think you'd have anything memorable.
For his pains, Castellari was even taken to court by Steven Spielberg and Universal Studios for plagiarising JAWS (1975)...although, if one is to believe Castellari's own statements at the 61st Venice Film Festival, Spielberg and Co. were merely envious that THE LAST SHARK had been more profitable (in the expenditure/profit ratio) than JAWS itself...!
(Possibly Spoilers, although you probably won't get this far in the film if you have any sense)  - The acting.
his courage comes from a book and his best friend is a little mouse named snow...  the story follows the boy as he decides to wait in dangerous territory for his father, whom although was taken away, promised to return...  this is a touching story and a great chapter for anyone iterested in this tragic time period...
Unfortunately, Ling Bai has zero chemistry with Woodbine, although that's probably not her fault, as nobody seems to.
MY LOVELY SAMSOON also had weak writing and no chemistry between the actors, although the leading lady had an endearing quality about her.
Hallson (Arthur O'Connell) is dead in the centrifuge, and evidently has been for hours, although we all heard it turn on only minutes before.
There is an extensive scene in the movie where a woman has sex with a dog, although taboo, it makes for a most needed hilarious fill in the movie.
His fighting technique was quite pitiful, and although so was Van Damme's, the slugfest was rightly won by the 'Muscles from Brussels'.
What I had trouble with was how unexciting and emotionless the film was, despite its comic-book edge and choreographed action being superbly executedÂ although director Albert Pyun could've cut down on the over-cooked slow motion.
There are some fairly graphic rape scenes between the monsters and the women, although they really just consist of a guy in a fish suit laying on a naked woman as she struggles and screams.
The math teacher who thinks that his kids are being neglected in favour of the rejects (although none of the math geeks are in detention, and the 'teacher' (Banderas) is there for free?
I watched a few episodes of "Ghost Hunters" on a recommendation from a friend (who believes in ghosts, although his girlfriend doesn't).
The plot would be intense, although not necessarily very dynamic.
It's like you sat through the whole movie for no reason at all ... Roth's acting is good ... although bit overkill on the crying scenes ... the actor who plays Felix is a bit distracting ... facial expressions and lines are given unnaturally, and the other man, her young-love toy, is nothing more than slight eye-candy to hormonal admirers.
Technically Silent Scream isn't too bad, the house & locations used look OK even if the talentless Harris can't evoke any kind of atmosphere from them & generally speaking it's adequately made throughout although it ain't going to exactly knock your socks off.
Also, they managed to transform Sturbuck, the hero of my childhood, into a female character, although there were some interesting female pilot characters in the old series.
The performances are pretty good, although Glenn has some trouble acting hurt.
I was brought up in an English village during the same period (the Fifties) in which this production was set (although the book was written about 20 years earlier), but I didn't "recognise" any of the characters.
The ending was unsatisfying, although unexpected (or was it really?)
This excuse its clunkiness and the lack of scope somewhat, although not completely.
Also, except for some mild butt shots, there's no nudity or sex--although the poster has one of the hunky actors with his shirt off.
Admittedly, the film's premise, although clichÃ©d, has its comedic possibilities, but the script doesn't really take full advantage of this inherent potential.
Once Masturbating Woman has been falsely-secured, Wimpish man produces a miniature spiked ball and chain which he uses to supposedly whip Masturbating Woman, although every blow only manages to hit the mattress.
I am thankful to say that he has ditched the soap opera elements of Tintorerra in favour of some more exploitative survival style elements, and it's slightly more interesting; although really the film is a mess and far to boring to entertain.
Johnathon Schaech has definitely got talent, writing and acting in this although it was a mediocre film.
However, it was not necessarily gratuitous--although the symbolism was--and did add to the story.
Anyone seeing even a few minutes of this lousy excuse for a horror flick will quickly note the BLATANT theft of plot device after plot device from "Jacob's Ladder," right down to the head-swiveling demons -- although this low-budget turkey obviously didn't have money for special effects, so the demons just shake their head from side to side accompanied by sound effects that resemble someone shaking a tin of peanuts.
although i've used IMDb as a resource for years i've never felt the need to chime in as a reviewer or post on the message boards, in this case i felt absolutely compelled to, especially after reading the false glowing reviews posted by others...which is just as fraudulent as this movie winning any recognition, a DVD distribution deal...any of that.
I am this strongly critiquing this movie not because I have a grudge against its creators (although I'm not happy about losing 90 minutes and $4).
It's a distorted trip into the scattered brain of a drugged out poet/rock star, and although some try to rationalize that this in itself is some sort of achievement, it's a journey I could easily have done without.
I went because I wanted to know why this film was so highly rated across all the demographic areas although I had my doubts based on the preview.
Even younger audiences may become bored after 1/2 hour although the visual stimulation may be sufficient.
Maybe it is not a good idea to name your protagonist like yourself (although there was no problem in "Andrej Rubljow") and letting him read your brother's poems.
It's not without its compensations and a couple of striking pieces of imagery Â a recurring sequence of a Saudi execution and an ultra-slow motion car crash Â although Argento seems to be expending far more energy and visual flair into purely expositionary shots like letters being delivered or phone calls being made than the surprisingly few setpieces.
Funny thing is, Sam's not dead, or he's dead but not really dead (although he sure looks it); maybe he's undead!
We picked up this movie at the video rental store thinking that this would give us a good laugh, and that's exactly what happened, although the laughter was really just mocking what a lame movie Uncle Sam is.
The obnoxious Mother is fun to get annoyed with and the troll creature is very awesome, although the blue screen scenes it is in are some of the worst I have ever seen.
Beautiful Olivia de Havilland (as Abbie Irving) provides romantic interest, although Flynn gets off on the wrong foot by helping cause the death of her brother (William Lundigan).
Of course, the original short story confined itself to the time the couple spent on their honeymoon, although the subsequent adapted theater play expanded on the plot.
I was the principal cinematographer* on EVIL'S CITY ( credit omitted from the film at my insistence for countless reasons although it still shows up on IMDb.com ).
This one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (am Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas.
Errol Flynn would later play some great roles in westerns (for example, They Died with Their Boots On), but here he is really just playing Robin Hood in a Stetson, and only the vaguest attempt at an American accent (although, like Captain Blood, he's supposed to be an Irishman here, making his plummy English tones even more bizarre).
I am using this term although i dont know why.
It basically goes like this...  1- Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school, so the movie says, although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life, and how he has been with girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York, and just suddenly decides he's going to turn himself around.
But this movie, although it contains brilliant jazz music, was simply boring.
She seemed too old for him and although she was good at her part when not romantic with Haas another actress may have been more appropriate.
This remake, although it had quality actors, left out the critical material which made the original film (and the book) so unique, leaving this as another Hollywood rehash.
The book by Ursula K. LeGuin is widely regarded as a science-fiction classic, although I have never thought it was among her best work.
I read it after I saw the first "Lathe of Heaven" on PBS in 1980 and realized that considerable liberties had been taken with the story, although it was much closer to the book than this latest endeavor.
Delta Burke needed a bigger role (and perhaps should have been portraying Latrelle, although Bonnie was doing a good job with that character).
"McQ" is John Wayne's attempt to move away from the western genre with which he was most commonly associated (although he had dipped into other genres along the way).
Samuel L. Jackson, as the narrator was an excellent choice, although even his central dialog feels like his head is somewhere else (to the scripts credit, they actually throw in a joke to echo this sentiment).
His autobiography, "My Wicked Wicked Ways," is full of humorous anecdotes, although the best revelations must have been edited out.
I honestly believe that he got lucky when he made The Exorcist although I do think that The French Connection was pretty good.
It's very much a primitive sound-movie, in which the director is still working with silent movie techniques, although not in any sophisticated way.
Charlie plays a dentist's assistant in this one, more of an office custodian than an actual dentist, although he takes an active role in anesthetizing patients with a mallet.
The adults continue being the only people who can actually act in these movies, although Slughorn seemed a little off, he was better than the youths.
The acting has improved dramatically, although there are still a few cringe-worthy moments.
The story has numerous twists and turns which disguise what's really going on for awhile, although clever editing does give us some hints.
Obviously they had a clear vision of what the film could be, and their rapport with director Robert Cary helped him achieve that vision although he joined the project relatively late.
Reno is the one holding it together, although his ennui is rather more phoned-in for this one.
In retrospect, although the summary explains that it about a powerful love between two men at an ex-gay ministry, the title really exemplifies the message.
Even decisions he makes at the end as Fletcher wishes to abandon their work, kind of lacks logic(..he'd be willing to jeopardize his career releasing patients that had been tested on like guinea pigs he himself contributed to), although maybe the filmmakers were hoping to humanize him a bit because in working out a formula he was hoping to cure brain ailments.
"Black Hawk Down" is a film that offers up an indistinguishable cast of characters, Army men devoid of personality but all trailed by gold haloes (heavy irony here, as one reviewer mentioned, one soldier is presently in prison for rape), as they carry out a rescue mission that goes awry (although the plot becomes a moot point even before the troops arrive), which turns into the type of loud, exploitative, and soulless bloodbath we've come to expect from the prolific, oh-so-patriotic Jerry Bruckheimer.
Yes the space voyage interrupts the various sketches although the intent is to have it the other way around.
Mediocre is the most fitting compliment that I can honestly apply to what was the equivalent of a really long Saturday morning cartoon(although, most episodes of "Ducktales" harbor more of a plot).
Here, although Ferrell's character felt like a retread of earlier, better performances, he appeared to try his best.
It wasn't exciting, the jokes were groan-worthy (although after a while I even gave up groaning), the plot was.. well there didn't seem to be one, being more a selection of scenes thrown together with no reason behind them.
Judith Light's (Gayle) performance is outstanding, and although you may not agree with her beliefs, you can understand and respect her perspective.
Richard Grieco and Jamie Pressley are also wasted in this film, although Grieco is humorous at times.
This all happened during the Second World War and although it's immoral to influence children the way it's done in this cartoons (and other Looney Tuners), you have to admit it's smart to use the Looney Tunes for this purpose.
I don't see how anybody can sit through this movie, even if it does have a popular heart-throb (although horrendous actor) Orlando in it, it's just a very very badly made and badly acted film.
They might have considered reading an actual book about Antarctica, that might have helped the script although I doubt anything outside of burning it would have prevented this abomination on film.
Everything in the film is hand-held and although it gives the film a very realistic quality, the shaky camera gets old quickly.
She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious results...  One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a Vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in Mexico City, she's fine, although her body temperature is below room temperature...  Guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires, hero leaves the next day.
The music in the movie, although sometimes too much, was often used to good effect.
The men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women (although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl-girl sex scenes), and eventually, as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere, the women become convinced that men are good for something.
I think I enjoyed it a lot, although I don't remember why (I was too young).
It's tough to handle that everyone in this movie speaks English, although for practical purposes it's probably more handy than having small children try to read subtitles.
The two Spanish protagonists are white enough to be from Norway (although the other, evil Spaniards are dark-skinned).
John's songs are actually OK, although the movie probably would have benefited had he not provided nearly all of the song's vocals in the movie itself.
In his only stint as director of a feature, Steve Railsback, although a charismatic actor, obviously lacks those skills requisite for guiding other players, since he merely turns Russell and Glenn loose to fish for whatever they might find of worth within a sloppily written screenplay and as these two happen to benefit from a strong director, their mannered performances must rate at the bottom of their portfolios.
The first twenty minutes are mildly engaging, although even then it was quite apparent things were only going to get worse.
There were some very good scenes, especially the one involving deer (although I have to say, at one point I was reminded of the deer scene in "Without a Paddle", where a deer suddenly seems like he's growling at the actors!).
I can do some research and find the answer, although if isn't worth the space of my page.
He invents too much and ends up confusing him (although that's in part fault of the screenplay).
I guess it is the finished cut, although the guy asking if we liked it didn't seem to know or care.
Davis is watchable, although her performance is variable; Montgomery gets more annoying as things progress and is particularly done in by the strained plotline.
Melanie Griffith is completely wrong for this part, although I can't think of anyone that would be good in this story.
Yet - oddly enough - although plainly she's out of her element, the fish-out-of-water aspects of the story just don't work.
Actually, the fact that no one answers the phone in both cases might be exactly the reason why the fateful car crash appears in both scenarios (although in one of the scenarios, Simon survives and in the other, he doesn't): Claire decides to return because she is getting worried about Simon and/or Peter.
This is a haunting movie with a really nice, twisted plot, a lot of suspense (especially in the first part of the movie), overall decent acting (I thought the character of Anna and the guy waiting for a heart transplantation were done especially well), but rather uninspired music (although the sound effects are nicely done).
No inner motivations or inner conflicts seem to exist and there's no evolution of any characters' personality and beliefs over time - although there is plenty of that in the books.
Spoilers follow, although I doubt I can spoil the movie any more than the director already did.
None of the characters really develop past the basic storyline which is poor at best, although the acting is OK.
This was the last film with his characteristic young-go-getter persona, although by this time all the go had already got up and gone, and Lloyd himself was a less than youthful 38.
These young men (and a few female dates), although mostly conservative-minded, were still eager to absorb the mod culture of the times, and probably had enjoyed movies such as "Alfie".
The rest of the cast play it strictly by numbers, although once again Heather O'Rourke is fab as the little girl.
trippled" *Grimmace* Its like a porn style acting but without the porn.. although Cade looks like he should be in one.
The film is notable for the fact that it was written by and stars Jacinto Molina; also known as Paul Naschy, who is apparently a big name in Spanish horror cinema, although this the first film that I've seen from him.
On a technical level the film is generally bland and forgettable, photography, editing, lighting, acting, music and direction although passable could all have been better.
But, getting a job in the Big Apple proves difficult and she needs cash fast, although a kindly retired professor offers her a low-rent room in his apartment.
Bad acting by most of the cast, poor direction and the sound was crappy (although the crowd noises during the concert scenes sounded real).
I am not a fan of the Germs and although I do respect what they tried to do but this seemed like a whole lot of nothing.
I don't know how much worse of a decision you can make in a action/horror type yarn -- from the opening moments of the film we know exactly who is going to make it and who isn't (although the odds of Natasha Henstridge not making it were admittedly slim).
Nowhere near as much fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some of the fight scenes are decent enough.
The cinematography in this film isn't bad, although it suffers from being shot on video.
Potential spoilers follow, but the film is already spoiled enough and anything but profound, although definitely steeped in crimson blood.
(although those who died most likely have 'honor'.
High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.
I also didn't see the point of the young boy's character, although I guess it is an Ann Hui trope (if that's the right word) to have a character's story told through the eyes of a kid.
This is a truly terrible low-budget movie, although according to director Roger Corman, the even lower budget remake was even more terrible!
This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen (although I want to see 'Manos' Hands of Fate).
But these ants can supposedly strip the skin off a human body within 30 minutes, although with out an ounce of blood.
Here the film falls even further into risibility, as although these couples are meant to represent (or actually be) real people, they are so one-dimensional, robotic and mono-subject orientated that they seem like no one anyone has even met in this world, rather being dead ringers for the inhabitants of some future Brave New World-type dystopia.
I can't imagine why I took the time to slog through this unfortunate excuse for entertainment, although I did get a little bit of exercise from constantly shaking my head and wondering how much worse a "family film" could get.
Horrible actress although for a second I thought it was Priyanka Chopra only 2 seconds later to have my dreams crushed.
There may have been some edits to the film upon US release that made it more tolerable, although I doubt how they would have been achieved.
The booby traps are more violent comparing to the first movie, but somehow they're more hilarious, although sometimes they overdo it.
Cedric is a likable chap, but the Concierge not so much because he dislikes Kevin from the very first moment, although this guy is hilarious at times.
But I must sound a dissenting note: although it has its charms, I personally found the film somewhat difficult to sit through due to the age of the cast.
Yet, these two apparently find marital bliss although her clothes closet gets bigger and bigger to the point a whole room has to be taken over to accommodate her lack of control.
I do not live among people who shout and wave their arms about all the time, although I will of course accept such behaviour in a film where it is a natural response to a stressful situation; but if I do not live among people who behave like that, I am not likely to watch a film that shows everyone doing so continuously, for very long before I turn it off - or at the very least feel compelled to complain, as I am doing now.
Cuba's character then rises to fame and fortune, although I can't imagine what he could have been thinking he would do at this point.
What I mean is the same pretension that she seems to be commenting on (although too little too late by the last shot when she calls for the camera to move in front of her directly in profile), and done with a very 'this is how it is' take on things.
This is one of his early movies and, although I haven't seen any others, I firmly believe that his production has improved vastly with experience, but you should definitely not see this as your first movie by him.
although it had an aura of the gumshoe mystery to it you could easily get the feeling that the film was almost plotless.
What was a much worse problem is that although the story is supposed to be told by the dead woman, many scenes in the film don't feature her and you are left wondering "how did she know about that conversation?".
Well, here is another of those quickies that the studio forced upon Bette Davis although this one is not quite as bad as some of her other efforts during this time (Fog Over Frisco, The Big Shakedown).
Lou Costello, one of the funniest comedians (although underrated) of all time and Bud Abbott, the greatest straight man ever are woefully misrepresented here.
Hackett bears somewhat of a resemblance to Costello, although he's taller and heavier, and Korman is about the right size and build as Abbott, but that's it.
Hackett sounds like a Borscht-belt Catskills comic, which is what he is, and Korman sounds like a classically trained stage actor, which is what he is, and neither of them even tries to come close to the way Bud and Lou spoke--Abbott's mile-a-minute carnival barker spiel, Costello's excitable sputtering as he gets more and more confused--which was central to the astonishing verbal byplay between the two and which, although they made it look easy, was actually quite complex, especially in the "Who's On First" routine.
While a case may possibly be made for leaving that out, less understandable is the fact that, although the film covers the team's career in radio and movies, for some unfathomable reason it completely ignores the fact that they had a hugely successful television series for several years (which is still being shown in reruns today).
The acting is actually quite good although it's sometimes hard to judge the acting when the dialogue is this bad.
My advice: although having a great lobby, do not waste your time and money in this crap.
The film has no storyline, no good actor (although as far as I can tell, Ben Stiller's wife is in it), no horrifying atmosphere or even a decent screenplay.
At least Morbid Angel is on the soundtrack, although their music rocks far too hard for this movie.
The twins although looking good, just don't make up for the poor movie, unfunny comedy scenes, strange characters for the given actors.
I just never warmed to either of them although to be fair Sutherland does try & his character does come off as the more likable of the two.
The saturation of the colours throughout the film make it all look cartoony, and the CGI does look like CGI although it is much improved on the previous film with Yoda at last looking real.
On the plus side: Yoda drew some genuine laughs with his "kung fu" stance, although high-speed Yoda was a bit too fanciful for my liking.
A less inspired actor to play the part of Chan could not possibly be imagined, although I should mention that Winters was to improve considerably in his later Chan characterizations.
The DVD picture is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, although you only notice it during the few action sequences, as the movie is mostly talk.
We could almost call it a love story for New York, although maybe only people who have lived in New York for an extended length of time would understand that.
this thing gets a low 1* note:this movie is sometimes referred to as "House 3" including the copy i have.SO,although it may have little or nothing to do with the "House"other than name,i chose to refer to it as "House" 3 in my summary.i hope this clears up any confusion.
So was Leonard Maltin when he gave it 1 and 1/2 stars, although his use of the word "appalling" is pretty much on target.
The acting of the movie isn't really that good, although Connery is okay.
Fixed on her, he decides to pursue her (although she is increasingly frightened of him).
It is a tired plot, mostly because there is little chemistry between Foster and Karloff (although that is not a fatal flaw - he is fixed on her, she need not show any type of fascination towards him).
Not many people know this, but these two great action stars made over 200 films together, although this was the only one released stateside.
Anyone who's been to high school in the last 30 years will definitely relate, although some may not tolerate the weirdness well.
You won't find these people together in any other movie you see, although you're likely to encounter them in real life whether you want to or not.
The time period is set by the fact that the evacuaters all drove Ford sedans of the 1946-48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955.
Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie "Miami Vice" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it "Miami Vice" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it "World Vice" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.
Still, the film isn't dull, although a bit slow here and there.
This film starts off well (although the makers clearly 'borrowed' a lot of their ideas from Darren Aronofsky's 'Pi') - it looks gritty, cold, suitable for a film about paranoia.
I don't know who wrote the material for this stench bomb, but it couldn't have made a 5 year old laugh, although I wouldn't dare subject any 5 year old to this.
There's even the rather inexplicable addition of a police lab robot which acts as a comic-relief (although we don't really need it since the film has enough comedy), even reading comics & being interested in a colleague's fries.
Matriculated is the worst of the bunch (although it's a close call with Program), as it takes a great idea (showing the machines the beauty of mankind by plugging them in) and turns it into the worst experience of the 9.
She becomes the mistress of her married boss at the law firm (although the Hays Office undoubtedly required the removal of any breath of sexual content here, it should be pretty obvious to all what is going on).
It was a complete waste of time and money, and although I am a fan of Keanu Reaves and Vince, they really should have avoided this script.
), Gone With The Wind (although that stupid sequel Scarlett was bad enough to try), etc.
Considering the fact this was done better (although outdated) in 1971 makes this version even worse.
Beings who rewrite reality so magic isn't exposed to humans (although I never understood why everyone was so afraid that humans would find out.
The film is well shot, although the comparisons to "24" are laughable (I won't even mention the comparisons to Altman).
And that movie, although fanciful, is much better and many times more realistic.
"The funniest film I have ever seen",says Peter Sellers.Well,certainly everybody who's in it seems convinced they're being funny.Knowing looks,nods and winks are dispensed freely isn't this a hoot everyone seems to be saying,you've got to laugh haven't you?Er,no,actually,you haven't.You've seen one spoof Nazi production number and you've seen them all.Messrs Mostel and Wilder work themselves up into a frenzy to very little effect as far as I'm concerned although I note that many many people find them hilarious.
The costumes and production design fits the style of the old films, although here, much of it looks out of place.
The fight is cool, although sped up to an incredible extent.
"Paul Andrew's" comment says it all for me, although I agree with the majority of the other comments.
I really, really dislike The Specialist & would call it more of a thriller than an action flick although I'm betting the trailer makes it look like it's full of explosions & action scenes but just don't be fooled because it isn't.
With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 The Specialist was a well funded film although I struggled to see where the money went although Stallone was paid $15,000,000 to be in it so I guess there's my answer.
Special effects were reasonable, although the multiple alien spacecraft sitting in the crater, each one an obvious copy/paste of each other... at first, I thought it was a computer wallpaper.
This is quite disappointing because the idea of the film has so much more potential, although it is an idea that has remarkable similarities to about 20 other zombie type flicks.
Sid James, Hattie Jacques and Charles Hawtrey are greatly missed and although the others try to make good the deficiency the film just doesn't get going.
I wish there was more of the sphere although we'll get to see a lot more of it again in PHANTASM II (1988).
I won't give away the ending but let's just say the Tall Man is temporarily disposed of until the next sequel comes out, although the dream element that's supposed to encompass the whole sequence of events in the film, is a big negative against it.
The beauty of Duel was that the evil machine clearly did have a driver, although you never saw him, and that's what made it very tense and scary, something that this film is not in any way.
It's difficult, while watching this Giovanni flick ,not to think of Jacques Becker's "le trou" (1959) ,the script of which he wrote.But whereas the heroes of Becker's masterpiece were digging a hole to escape from jail,the "heroes" of " les egouts" are digging a tunnel to rob a bank.The characters are not endearing ,former firebrands ,although the lead rather recalls some kind of "true life" ArsÃ¨ne Lupin ,but a humorless Lupin.One does not see why one should take an interest in those men (and woman).Robin Hoods ,they definitely are not.
Appalling cinematography, grating music, atrocious acting, and a director who praised Palance's what-was-he-thinking turn and despised the very presence of Power as Justine, although she was almost the only one who wasn't mugging in every scene.
It's a pretty entertaining movie for the most part, although by the end I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters (though that could have been sleep calling to me).
There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster.
Baldwin directing this although I could have sworn he didn't direct all of it, I thought I read somewhere or lots of re-shoots wasn't bad but he definitely has some potential in there.
The male members of the cast appear to have been selected for their looks (certainly not their acting skills) while the female members are a dreary looking bunch (although their limited acting skills are well-matched with those of the male cast).
Pretending like these people go to Columbia University-- also not cool (although Julia Stiles actually does and she's very nice I hear, so I don't want to bad-mouth her, just her choice to play the part).
Full Moon pumps out sludge better than this all the time... although after seeing "Gingerdead Man", I can assure you they also make much worse.
The characters are extremely one dimensional, they have virtually no personality or background although having said that a one or two of them were sort of likable.
There's absolutely no tension, although Coto seemly tried hard to create some, and the supportive characters are all insufferable.
In the third he watches them again, although there's a suggestion that he may have acted on what he's learnt from the first two.
The film's merits are largely to do with the unimpeachably youthful beauty of the principals, although MichaÃ«l Balerdi, the young man, is a distractingly weak actor.
Yes, the cover has Apache helicopters, although none appear in the movie.
First off, it is similar to Alien in atmosphere but it is really closer to Forbidden Planet in plot although nowhere near as good.
For some reason the film includes sex scenes that seem to come out of nowhere and have nothing to do with the story although they rarely do.
Enlivening proceedings (but only slightly) are some gratuitous sex scenes: sexy maid Lily (Laura Otis) imagines herself having sex in a bath, pudgy museum curator Brice Renard (Richard Karn) inexplicably beds a massive-jugged blonde hottie, and Margaret does a brief full-frontal flash towards the end (although this is more than likely a body double for Amy Locane).
in fact,it's your typical action/crime drama.the characters are stereotypical for this genre.i also found the movie slow and depressing.i was quite disappointed.i was expecting a much better movie than this.the action is slow,and there really isn't much originality here.Andrew Davis directed this one.he also directed The Fugitive,Under Siege and Above the Law,all after Code of Silence.but it's not all bad.for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys,although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a 4/10
I would not attempt to compare this to another film, although the subject has been done far better innumerable times.
The scenario is full of dreary eccentrics, although Parker Posey's 'Jackie-O' is a dark, original creation unto herself.
feel good movie nor is it an interesting and beautiful, gut-wrenching movie like the Swedish movie "My Life as a Dog", although it had tried many attempts to redeem itself.
John Terry plays our hero Hawk Â no, not the central defender for Chelsea Football Club although, were this true, it would be the least of the casting disasters.
Donkey Punch has a very interesting (although fu*ked up) premise in which seven people have a party on a yacht out in the Mediterranean sea, only to have one of them try the infamous "donkey punch" during sex with one of the women...and accidentally kills her.
If you want to know what a "donkey punch" involves you will have to watch the film, although I can report that it does not actually involve donkeys.
Not because it's a good movie about the fight business Â which it is Â but because it is, of them all, the only one that uses the story as a blatant metaphor for the sham of the American Dream (although Bogie's effort in The Harder They Fall touches upon that idea).
Rules of Engagement starts off relatively strong, although I was confused because I came into the theatre about 3 minutes late.
The other thing is that the screenplay by Stephen Gaghan isn't that bad at all, although it definitely lacks in character development.
Some weren't even communists (although most were members of minority groups).
Furthermore, starving families still exist (although Stella's mother does well to encourage ignoring that), wars continue and isolated tragedies like Unity's go unabated, yet the intertitle states "all's right with the world."
Therefore, I am going to try and leave my own political persuasions out of this review although I definitely have a viewpoint about what was happening in Iraq and the need for US involvement there.
*** This may contain spoilers, although this is a simple documentary with no plot, so there ain't much to spoil.
I can't really say I was disappointed by this film- I knew nothing of it, although I regularly do like D'Agosto.
It's not fair to describe it as Asia's Alexander, because although often horribly executed, there was a governing intelligence behind that.
Yes, apparently although they lived there in town their whole lives, they never knew that it was right off the coast.
The acting has got to be the worst part about this, although everything about it is very ameteur-ish, and stupid.
And although Charlie weakens, he never breaks, and when put to the test, his basic honesty and strength shine through, which makes him a hero and which transforms this movie from just another boxing movie into a true cinematic classic.
For some strange reason, Tori Spelling wasn't originally credited in this movie, although her appearance as Jan is, in my opinion, the only thing that makes this movie worth watching.
Of course there are positive points in this movie: It ends; it have some nice criticism about future of mankind and the paths that man are taking; the thematic is very interesting, although it's poorly developed; for a low budget movie, it's well produced for that age; the sequence where Rantes conducts an entire orchestra is wonderful; the doctor plays sax very well; the soundtrack of the movie is also brilliant; and it makes me wanting to watch K-PAX all over again.
Thankfully, although most of them are practically extended cameos, the supporting cast Â of whom, I thought, John Hurt comes off best Â does keep one watchingÂbut, again, the utterly predictable double surprise ending closes the film with a whimper instead of a bang.
However, I did enjoy it, although the TV version was as good.
The purpose of this revived hunt will be for MacGregor to expunge a newly found emotion within him: fear (although his high-powered scoped rifle should be of no little assistance in that regard), and after giving his servants two weeks off with pay, loads his weapon with nine rounds (for the fabled number of lives), frees the creature and limps off alone in pursuit of it.
The matter of Axel's struggle with fear becomes subordinate to his offspring's emotional entanglements, although there are many slow motion closeups of the brute to enliven the action in a film that is bedevilled with serious flaws of continuity.
...These hit-men friends are played by Lou Diamond Phillips, Bookeem Woodbine and Antonio Sobato Jr., and although I wouldn't necessarily say that any of their performances sucked big time, they are not really worth mentioning either, and neither is the performance of Wahlberg himself.
Matthew McConaughey, although usually a very good actor, I found at least his role, to be very numb, and not of much use.
It was a very bland character, and although he certainly is a lot of eye candy, the role may have been better suited to a different actor.
The acting varies, with Farrah Fawcett clearly not a good actress, although Kirk Douglas & Harvey Keitel are not too bad.
Nicky Katt (although very annoying) was the best actor in this mess.
An absolutely terrible film, the characters are all so lovely & good I wanted to be sick, Alan Bennet portrays a rose tinted view of the world and although for a bit of light relief I don't mind optimistic films from time to time 'the history boys' takes this concept too far for my liking.
It should be noted that although there is a Jessica Simpson in the cast, this is not the notorious singer.
One has to wonder what Andrea sees him in, although the performance of Marla English isn't much better.
The 'giant' lobster from Teenagers from Space was a lot scarier than the She Creature, although I'll admit it wasn't quite as lame as the Corman killer carrot from Venus in It Conquered the World.
Therefore, he's different from the deranged quack Lombardi, although we're never sure how.
You can have worse times though...  Ruud van Hemert brought his dynamic duo from his previous flop, 'Ik Ook Van Jou' back into this one, and I must say that Van Erven Dorens is likable in his role, although one can tell it's not acting which he does for a living.
The performances are competent, although Dickie Moore is a scene-stealer as Lightner's son, and Lloyd Bacon's direction is perfunctory given the restraints of the period.
Vinnie Jones rapes the Hispanic women who was there with her husband (although you see nothing, it's all implied) and then blows her up so she's #4 dead.
Without relying on copying the actual words and phrases of the book (although crucial plot moments were often almost word-for-word), it was very true to the spirit and intention of the book and didn't offend people who have loved and re-read the story.
See it if you possibly can, although since it was broadcast on PBS at least ten years ago it's probably hard to find .
Another reviewer put it best with the title for his review: "made for TV" One of the problems with made-for-TV movies is that some producer or network executive comes up with a concept and then hires by commission the writer and director; and if they are 'professionals' - in TV-industry terms, which has just about nothing to do with film-making, although the two industries do feed on each other for talent - they will slog through a couple weeks production whether they care about the concept or not.
Well, at least his bod was nice enough to look at, although his hairdo was a bit scary -- it looked like it would hurt if you touched it, and I was kind of hoping the aliens would shave some crop circles in it -- and I wasn't too thrilled about the goatee.
and "Close Encounters" are top-notch, although the aliens in "Close Encounters" were rather disappointing at the end (a bunch of bald little people surrounding a tall bald anorexic - a benevolent Ann Coulter without the hair).
There's plenty of nudity, although the violence was a little lacking.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
The only negative about this DVD is that although there are quite a few topics in the DVD they don't go in a lot of detail about them.
The two main characters of the film choose Westworld, although we check in from time to time on the other two parts of the park.
Nothing is truly scary at all, although it is a little gruesome at times.
James Wainwright, as the villain Stryker out to rule the world and collect fuel, is good although he could do this role in his sleep.
Thus, although some here have written of this revealing how the war changed people's morality, this is false.
Overall, I liked the show although I wouldn't recommend paying money for it.
I have been a fan of Michael Ende since childhood and, although this interpretation of the Neverending Story strays from the plot of the book, I still found it delightful to watch.
The cast, although young, give wonderfully natural and committed performances.
It turns out that the movie's main problem isn't acting or continuity goofs or anything like that (although I should affirm that I believe that there are a few too many movies about people looking for killers).
The flaw in the film is the script, which tends toward a certain clinical, slightly artificial awkwardness from time to time, and although the film offers many interesting visual metaphors, it ties them so loosely to the overall story that it is often difficult to know to what these metaphors refer.
This movie was a huge mistake, although Robin Williams managed to slip by with a few chuckles, but I realized his humor only works if he plays off other interesting characters around him.
In the role of Reverend Frank, Robin Williams, all cutesy mannerisms and third-rate mugging, hits a new low in teeth-grinding unctuousness, although one likes to believe that, if director Ken Kwapis could have gotten the actor to dial back his performance even a little, this might have been at least a tolerable movie.
There is also a "no talking" feature which allows you to watch the movie without the interviews, which would be better, although if that's your bag, just get a Gothic porno.
However, on the DVD case, it mentioned that the lady was interested in "ecological preservation", and although she briefly mentioned something about this in the film, it was as if this HAD been part of the film but most of it had been excised--leaving a lot of loose ends.
The few scenes of real apaches I'm pretty sure are taken from the American mid west, although the movie is set in Europe.
The film is detached, not in a Michael Haneke way, but in a most tiresome unmoving manner, treading its way down the sunny slopes of Greece at a snail's pace, although it wants to mislead us into believing that what we're dealing here with is a thriller.
When these 'criminals' weren't slaving in the field, they were rockin' the house, although you'd think they'd be exhausted after all that physical labor.
Jacey becomes close to this family, although at the start she doesn't seem to want to know them.
By the time the end sequence came around I was rather bored, and the ending, although good, couldn't make up for the earlier scenes.
Alas, although the knight's role is little more than a cameo in Alice, the writers here have mercilessly expanded the part, even though it meant treading on the lines of more capable players like break-your-heart Rita La Roy (a most engaging and super-attractively regal young duchess) and Kay Hughes' pleasing Cheshire Cat who, as we might expect, disappears from the action, alas, for long spells.
We are left too often with Wade Boteler's far too bellicose Mad Hatter, and are also forced to suffer far too much tiresome comic relief from Tweedledum's Franklin Pangborn, although admittedly William Newell's occasional input as Tweedledee is just about right.
A new half breed mineral-animal mutant creature is born, fed by poisonous gases etc...and Godzilla is there to fight it before humankind gets destroyed...although the new monster has 3/4 time the upper hand...in the end the idea of the child characters saves the day after many ups&downs.
So, although this is most likely the worst Godzilla, it's also the most creative.
Just like Bambi's mother, your mommy is going to die, although chances are it won't be from a hunter's bullet.
See this film, and judge for yourself, although I think you'll agree, that digitizing can't make a film that is already of this quality any better.
The other characters were well written, but I saw a depth of understanding in Danielle that I didn't see in the rest, although they did a marvelous job as well.
Mae West's one liners, although bordering on slick, were those of a person desiring a kick in the chops.
The performances are passable although Stephen Fry does little more than play himself and the lead actor is so inconsequential that I can barely remember his performance.
The story is plain stupid, although the story has never been the most significant part of the Argento parcel.
About as interesting as a corporate training video, the best thing that can be said about "Il Fantasma dell'opera" is that the sets are typically opulent, although you may rightfully wonder why the Phantom's "underground" lair is so surprisingly well-lit.
This definitely wasn't a breakout role for Asia Argento either, although she eventually did become recognized in her own right.
Don't misunderstand me, I don't find violence offensive or something, but here it was wrong to use, although Argento usually makes gory movies.
The main message seems to be that nobody can be happy alone, although the irony is of course that all are alone (or lonely) because of one abusive relationship.
Dialogue may have helped, although I doubt it.
For a low budget film I do think that the quality of the movie itself was pretty good, although the sound at times was annoying.
What I particularly liked was that although it didn't give in to Maria's cynicism, neither did it pull any punches as to the way the world really works.
And honestly, has anyone ever believed, Wesley would die in the end (I for my part kept hoping, although I knew better)?
The beautiful lawyer tries to track him down, the trial is an interesting farce and although the twist was predictable it was reasonably well done.
Lastly, the only reason why this film gets a 1, is because they are after some rare diamond (although the plot is still pathetic) and the beginning titles was actually decent (like showing the 7 ninjas individually).
[ possible spoiler(s) - although I think I could dictate exactly what I saw in this particular movie from beginning to end without really giving anything away.
I love Barry Sonnenfeld as a nice crazy director, although all of my friends dislike a lot of his work but I've always loved his distinctiveness and advanced capabilities in not too many movies like (Men in Black - 1997) or (Wild Wild West - 1999) or as a producer of the brilliant TV-Series (Secret Agent Man - 2000).
And although they seemingly tried to duplicate the original set for the opening scene -- which was utterly gratuitous, the only purpose being to let us see that Larry Matthews ("Ritchie Petrie") grew up to be a fat, balding old man -- they completely screwed up the most important piece of furniture in the living room... the famous ottoman is replaced by a small chair, as if the set designers actually forgot what it was supposed to be!
In 2009 we are perhaps more sensitive to the suffering of our fellow inhabitants of the planet and although I suppose the film is a masterpiece, I cannot enjoy seeing an animal given a slow and tortured death anymore than I can bear Hemingway's favourite sport, bullfighting.
Deathgames had plenty of potential, although some of it being falling prey to the standards of the cat-and-mouse chase thriller, with some Hitchockian elements.
For what it is worth, at one point the action once again requires Ursus to engage in a tug-of-war with a number of elephantsÂalthough here he needs their impending threat to his little sibling for him to eventually manage in suppressing them!
One - animation is decent, although animals look like old Pixar and Dreamworks, or clones of them * especially the donkey, who is 99% Shrek's Donkey, and the hen, very much like in 'for the birds'.
The 1926 version is actually pretty good--probably because although the leading man is a jerk, they managed to tone him down a bit and making him less of a loud-mouth.
Rosalind Russell is superb as Ms Randall-Pierson, and although the film is a mite long at 117 minutes, it is expertly directed by Michael Curtiz, the dramatic and comical aspects being cleverly balanced.
This is definitely not a movie for everyone, although it does appear that some folks enjoy it.
This invasion is a blatant War of the Worls homage and although I hated the film, I appreciate references.
It's a lot like how Hollywood ruined Scooby-Doo for me, although that didn't happen for another 10 years.
I rented this and Dirty Deeds on the same night, and although I didn't think much of Dirty Deeds, it's looking Oscar-worthy after seeing Crime Spree.
I guess I should start with the fact that Kristen Kreuk is starring in a movie about a martial artist (although wu shu is more of a performance art than a martial art Â but that's another story) despite the fact she is utterly incapable of moving gracefully.
A few twists and turns keep the viewer's interest in this one, although Van Heflin's whining can turn you off.
There was no mention of insurance in this movie, although that would have been an intriguing plot point.
Rory Cochrane's character was interesting as well, although only about 10 minutes of the movie is devoted to it.
The acting is good from what I can tell, although lousy story makes the performances a moot point.
Crass picture filled with characters one would hope to avoid in this lifetime, although Suzanne Pleshette's beauty is a visual compensation.
The jokes are obvious, but director Mel Stuart can't wring any fresh laughs out of them--although he does manage to shoehorn into this scenario everyone from John Cassavetes to pop singer Donovan!
(although watch for the "Tic-Tac-Toe bathrobe guy, not only is it the director, he always gets cheered at the mass showings).
Though billed as a hybrid giallo/erotic thriller, there are few thrills to be had in this plodding mess of a whodunnit, and with only a few unimpressive scenes that feature any sort of horror element, the spaghetti splatter here is closer to Stauffer's lasagna (although such a comparison is actually insulting to Stauffer's, since their lasagna is loaded with taste, while this film has none).
But they know that they are not doing a masterpiece and knowing that you will not take the film seriously, so although it is a bad movie, it can be watched.
One of the main aims of "Deathstalker II" is to show breasts (although not quite as often as the first film), but sadly it fails to achieve the amount of gore featured in its predecessor.
I noticed that although there was a diversity of women represented in the hundreds of bridal extras, they were portrayed in a negative light as they bickered, shouted, argued, begged, whined and accused each other to get the bachelor.
Finally: it is true that seeing it in with a full screen can help; I have watched it as DVD, and although it was a very good screen, it could not reproduce the immersion effect possible on a large screen only.
I have nothing against age gaps in relationship, although reality has taught me that sooner or later one of you is saggy and baggy and the other gets disillusioned.
The relationship between "old man" Rea and his muse Polley didn't look believable at all to me, although in one of the first scenes (which turned out to be one of the only likeable ones) they seem to hit it off pretty well.
its a painful watch for the person who chose the film, although with so many positive reviews they cannot be entirely blamed.
But in its favour the film, although potentially offensive in its approach, is sumptuous enough in its production values to wallow in forgivably.
Freeze is one of my top favorite villains in this show thanks to Michael Ansara's magnificent portrayal of a tortured man, who although dead to emotions is more determined than ever to save the life of his dying wife Nora.
Rhames plays basically the same character he played in the Dawn of the Dead remake, although he only appears for the first 15 minutes or so.
I have seen the movie Knight Rider 2010 and do agree that it is not the best.in fact,it is extremely poorly produced.However-I think Tug 3 should get his facts right.James Doohan is in Knight Rider 2000,and not Knight Rider 2010.Dont' roll over my leg KITT!In any event the original is a great show which,although very eighties,still carries enough punch to make the grade.Reading about how some of the stunt work was done makes the big budget shows of today a bit naff.some of KN might seem a bit cheesy,but then again,some cheeses have a great flavour.and if super pursuit don't blow your mind just see a black pontiac close up-KITT is timeless.cue purple sunset
I saw the movie as well and i thought it was mildly entertaining although i have to agree that it was overall a bad attempt to milk the TV series.
There are, however, love scenes although about as soft-core as a soap opera.
For at its heart, Bill Forsyth's film captures two eternal realities, the (potentially charming) essential uselessness of a certain sort of teenage male, and the particular uselessness of just about all males when confronted by a sufficiently pretty girl (Dee Hepburn, although Clare Grogan, later a pop star, appears in a secondary role).
A little welcome nudity helps a tad to keep viewers from nodding off completely (although none of the girls could really be classed as total babes, they do have nice jugs), but it's left way too late before big bro' finally gets into full-on killing mode.
I thought Moore's Bowling for Columbine was brilliant, but Fahrenehit 9/11 was a little too much propaganda (although he hit some heavy notes such as the failure of the media, corporate irresponsibility and class-ism) for me.
The storyline in most places is fairly obvious, although there are a couple of features which make it different enough to make the film not a complete waste of time.
One of their more recent releases (although the IMDb says it was made in 2003) is Jake's Booty Call, an animated comedy using two-dimensional computer animation not unlike that used in South Park, but still with the characters looking like cardboard cutouts.
I didn't mind her that bad in Millennium although she could get annoying occasionally and she was actually quite likable on Space Above and Beyond, but she drives me crazy in this episode.
(In an odd way, although it never happened in the book, the scene in the Mel Brooks version with Stewart and Renfield in the garden gives a much better example of Renield's frequent fluctuation between sanity and insanity.)
And, although fangs are alluded to, you never see them.
Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band-aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem of homelessness.
It's all too easy to lose one's concentration watching this film, although admittedly the subject matter is dreamy.
Firstly i can totally empathise with the lead character.... even down to the the fantastic choice of bands displayed on his wall (the Jam and the Specials although i am not too sure about Patti Smith myself!)
Not one of Karloff's finer moments although I'm sure fans of his will lap it up.
the acting too was pretty pathetic except sanjay dutt who did a decent job(although he got irritating in the second half).
It is a shame that Colin Firth agreed to appear in it, although at least we came to see a lesser known part of him: that of the leather-clad arm-swinging Angus-Young-style-jumping former rock musician.
This would not be so noticeable in your average teen flick; the problem here is that her "charm" supposedly makes her be the object of attraction for a whole bunch of lads - even a cranky old princess gets fond of her, although the lady seems to like no one else, apart from her lapdog.
Oh, and those awful "everything fits perfectly" parts of the plot: mom appears at the ball exactly when she has to, perfectly dressed for the occasion; sudden boyfriend Ian is ubiquitous and has 'chosen' to perform all kinds of low-profile jobs, although he attended the best schools and therefore (very convenient) has at least a piece of the necessary substratum to be rightfully considered a peer by "Britain's snobbish upper class"; etc.
But being a cheap made-for-TV affair this has to be the worst, although boasts an impressive cast.
Frederick Forsyth has the same problem when transferred onto the big screen - although at least Freddy is plausible and has some real experience with what he writes about.
But being a cheap made-for-TV affair this has to be the worst, although boasts an impressive cast.
This is no ordinary tomb, readers, it is a "Dracula" tomb, although the foolish soldiers who leave one of their own behind to "guard" the tomb all night do not realize this.
Surely they would have known what tragedy might befall this man had they realized it was a "Dracula" tomb they have opened (although the tombs are clearly marked, and they see that among others, Count "Igor" Dracula was laid to rest (?)
A bumbling mayor, policeman, and coroner try to figure out who the "scumbusters" are, although two of them destroy some evidence.
But being a cheap made-for-TV affair this has to be the worst, although boasts an impressive cast.
John Pinette, although larger than I have ever seen him was entertaining.
Bonaduce is in a number of scenes at the beginning of the movie, but although he is in the same section as the rest of the passengers on the plane, he is not seen anymore during the second half of the film.
Rodman plays a agent for Interpol it is said, although I'm not quite sure these are Interpol's working methods.
The positive things that I can say is that they do sort of tie some things together at the end (although the results will only serve to tick most people off).
The most marked difference between "Dahlia" and other classics of the more recent genre is that although "L.A.
The best actor on the set by far was Rosie the dog (although I can't remember if she's in the movie and can't bear to watch it again to find out.)
There is also a very lame comedy attempt thrown in with using a racist portrayal of a black man with big eyes providing the hucks, although they are obviously borrowed from other movies.
The film although directed by the person from the first was nothing like the first, whereas the first film used suspense and dark atmosphere with only very minor gore effects, The second film skips the suspense and atmosphere and goes straight for the gore, It seems like the director wanted to go in a different direction with this film in order to make it more action-packed, it really doesn't work.
I've always been a big fan of the film Freaks and think it was very ahead of its time although in its day it was thought disturbing.
So we have a traveling circus and one of the attractions is the freaks or strange people as I think the sign on the tent said.Also traveling with the circus is the support group of guards and mechanics etc.Anyway a few of these support guys and a girl decide to rob the circus during it's travels.The group decides that the girl should cozy up to the owner and trick him into marrying her where the group of plotters will have access to his fortune.Apparently the owner of this fleabag circus has big money somewhere although looking at him you'd never figure.
Directed by Drew Bell & although uncredited & unacknowledged Freakshow is a remake of Tod Browning's controversial classic black and white horror flick Freaks (1932), not wishing to put to fine a point on it Freakshow is frankly crap.
Brendan Fraser, although somewhat intense with early geekish Elliot Richards, enjoys being there more as the film grows.
The ending is straight out of the blue, although it does make a certain amount of sense.
Some of the delivery is just cringe inducing although one or two of the girls look quite nice.
Extremely odd piece is not an attractive vehicle for Susan Sarandon, although she's as interesting as ever.
Think about it, although the family is Italian and the dad wants him to be a concert violinist instead of a cantor, it's almost the exact same film.
And although the film was cheaply shot on video, the camera-work is decent.
Much discussion of fish in tanks that does not appear to serve any purpose - although they are interesting to view, especially through the tanks suspended from the ceiling.
(***Possible spoiler, although not really a major plot development as the film does not really contain any***)We know that the voice-over is an older Vladimir, we can see the younger Vladimir (Nick Stahl) following the object of his attraction (Kirsten Dunst), so why does the voice-over tell us that Vladimir is following her?
She was although too young but a brilliant and socio conscious girl.
The story has a few logical problems and the fighting need more edition, although I understand Michelle had practiced hard for her own film.
although it has some laughable scenes, but failed to reach the quality badly which is other great parody movies has achieved.
Sissy's real-life husband Jack Fisk directed the film, and although he sets up some good-looking shots, he doesn't feel the need to involve us in this character's thoughts: does she have a selfish agenda or is she removed from all the confusion and heartache she causes?
Not to be confused with the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle with the same name, although released just a few years earlier and clearly featuring a couple of common themes, this "Red Heat" is actually a 'Women in Prison' exploitation movie starring Linda Blair (the amount of trashy B-movies she starred in during the eighties is nearly endless) and Sylvia Kristel; the one and only original starlet to depict the legendary soft-core film character Emmanuelle.
Noonan is a little more restrained than usual, although he still seems very hammy because his role is in such stark contrast to the rest of the cast.
Norman Krasna wrote and directed this misguided comedy, one without a single laugh or single engaging character (although Myrna Loy tries).
He declares that he wants to keep Missy, although he complains about her and insults her quite a lot, but he never dumps Alex - that's what made zero sense.
this movie is good for someone young...although come to think of it, i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion.
And, the more serious problem is that although the people are exposed to the elements in the desert, they seem amazingly healthy even after many days there.
With a lead character named Frank Stein & a dead body being brought back to life by electricity with a killer's brain inside it's not hard to tell that this is a parody of Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein although to be honest this plays out more like an episode of Dawson's Creek as it focuses on various teen issues & problems, in fact there's little reason to have the Frankenstein subplot here at all.
A man marries a young woman and beats her almost to death on their honeymoon, although the wife vows he didn't do it, only to find out for sure later that he did.
It turns out the missing person was last seen as a customer in Sweeney Todd's barber chairÂ "The Tale of Sweeney Todd" is reasonably entertaining throughout, although there are too many dull sequences and moments of substantial emptiness.
It's all a grim, unpleasant, talky new version of the famous tale that could have used some more comedy, but just barely skims by on some good performances, gore and, especially, excellent costumes and sets that accurately capture rich 19th Century London atmosphere (although it was actually filmed in Dublin, Ireland).
To add to the confusion, Stephanie is married, although her husband does not appear.
Director Neill does his usual competent job but this won't impress many these days although you have to remember this film was made over sixty years ago.
Technically the film is OK although the ship is obviously a stage.
Generally, the performances were almost there, but not quite (although i still found Seth Green entertaining).
Overall, I can't really recommend this film...although it may appeal to some.
I can confidently say that this film should be a "pass" for most viewers and would only be recommended for sleaze-film completists - and although the torture scenes are decent, they are short and aren't anything that are so interesting as to make it a must-see...4/10
Uncomfortably brittle and hysterical, she is unable to meet the basic requirements of her role, although I guess you have to give her credit for trying at this stage of her legendary career.
She never got a specific Oscar, although she did get nominated for her best recalled role of the villain Phyllis in DOUBLE INDEMNITY (still the champion icy killer of that period).
Of the many AFI awards "La Spagnola" was nominated for (don't blame the institute; it can't be easy coming up with candidates - although Alice Ansara, who played Lucia, DID deserve her nomination for best actress; she even deserved to win, which she didn't), the most puzzling was for original screenplay.
And the Avatars speak perfect English in normal tone of voice, identical to their human voices, although their bone structure is completely non-human?!?!?!?
This picture gave me the answer, although I can't say that Lemmon gives a bad performance.
Also, I was reminded from time to time of Argento's witchcraft masterpiece SUSPIRIA, although there is no gore in THE WOODS.
Another problem is that the film lacks purpose; the tapes of the title seem quite irrelevant, and although the confused ending is in some sense superior to the glossy "perfection" at the conclusion of movies like "Ocean's Eleven", the viewer is still left asking "so what?".
Caught this one by accident on the TV here ; although the ending was about as satisfying as could be, it was difficult to feel any real emotion.
"The Woods" plays on the tone of older, classic horrors with ominous Gothic atmospheres and a slow build up that will probably disappoint people expecting something more "modern" (although this doesn0t mean that McKee's style is out of place).
The characters are impossibilities, the plot, although overly twisted, doesn't manage to keep the interest, and the beast's FX are worse than those in 1984's Terminator I.
The full Beatles group never released a less than stellar LP (or if they did, I've never heard of it), although "Two Virgins" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono is arguably the vinyl equivalent to this drek.
The central focus on "tween" characters seems to suggest that this film may have been aimed towards children and hence the relative low volume of bloodshed (although as mentioned above there are one or two scenes that are somewhat frightening).
they're annoying, I hate them, I'm sure everyone else does too, although there might be that random girl who sort of takes interest in them.
There are several reasons why this movie doesn't work, although it did have potential.
It's not that he does it better (although compared with most Hollywood releases, he really does it better), but that his work is instantly recognizable as unique, clearly identifiable, unlike anything we've seen before.
Similarly the CGI was okay, although nothing to be particularly proud of.
Perhaps the most disappointing was Kathy Bates, who is usually a great actor, although I do not know that anyone could really do all that much with the flotsam of a script they were saddled with.
She is accepted into the school as the result of some test she took which proved her to be worthy, although worthy of what is not quite evident at that point.
With the exception of Gale Harold of "Street Time" and "Queer as Folk," performances are less that attention-grabbing although some might find this kind of film a style of restrained acting worthy of note.
I'm not saying they should have set up a musician on an Atlanta skyscraper, or even in the middle of a college football field (although that's the real church of the South).
Horror legend Bruce Campbell (of the "Evil Dead" series) plays Heather's father, although his role is pretty minor.
All four of the main characters are terrible, terrible actors--although it's Aniston at her finest.
That's the impression I got, and although that may have been necessary to make the production affordable, it wrenches the stories out of their proper places.
Here she plays Samantha Sharpe a glamorous but fairly hard boiled private detective investigating the suspected murder of the wife of a businessman, in a story which is very similar to that of Raymond Chandler's thriller "The Lady in the Lake" (although this novel was not officially credited in the film version I saw).
The story is interesting, although not much exciting.
A wonderful book and the film captures much of the beauty and culture, although some side-stories are given short-shrift (Portia and her father).
Light is also working with the cops and a detective called "L" in this one, to find out who's making these deaths happen(although no-one knows he carries the book and is causing it).
Maybe it's because of the fact it is a made-for-TV movie, although I have found many other made-for-TV movies much more enjoyable.
The nudity can't save it and the jokes, although trying hard to be campy, are just plain dumb.
Another problem is that although up until the end you are never sure if the haunting is really the aborted child or just a manifestation of the guilt the lady feels about her past actions, the uncertainty and psychological aspects of the film (the best things about ARAF) are completely done away with--providing an ending that is just too well defined.
These choices make it hard to take much of the story seriously, although probably many of the events related are based on truth.
Would just like to add that the latest movie to have such an effect on me, although not necessarily for the positive(!
The novel on which it is based is, sadly perhaps, too complex and long to adapt to the screen without sacrificing some aspect of the many subplots it contains, and although I regret the loss of the radical political dimension, the subtle and heart-wrenching way loneliness, racism, impoverishment, snobbery, and disadvantage are conveyed are so powerfully treated that the end result is a film of almost unbearable sadness and melancholy... and yet... And yet there is an element of tremendous hope also at work; of the human spirit overcoming huge odds and learning life's lessons as the various characters go along and work out their individual destinies.
OK, this was Oliver Stone's first movie, so I'll cut him some slack (although Satyajit Ray and George Lucas didn't need any pity points for their stellar debuts, "Pather Panchali" and "THX 1138", respectively).
Nancy Kwan is OK - although she is so skinny and frail looking that it's kind of hard to see her as a sex object, and the other female "lead" is annoying, shrill and unappealing.
This is probably Dolphs worst film besides Stormcatcher, and although i was expecting something bad i was pleasantly surprised, in that it had some good moments.
This is a cult movie alright, although I'm pretty alone being a cultist here, this movie has all the elements of an ugly movie of the 70s (though i hear its huge in Australia).
It has all sorts of separate threads that never really come together, and although the film opens with a bang (car chase, shootout, multiple explosions), then it slows to a crawl as we spent too much time with Traci's relationship problems with her unfaithful long-time (also cop) boyfriend.
The "operation" scene is laughable, which perhaps was the idea, although I would have thought we are supposed to be laughing at the horror of it all, not at the ludicrousness of the action.
The original "Blues Brothers" is one of my favorite movies, so although I didn't expect BB2000 to be as good, there is no way I expected to be so bad.
totally predictable plot (although the final few frames were nicely done), unbelievably banal dialog capped by McDormand's soliloquy to her son -- how such a great actress agreed to deliver such tripe is beyond me -- this movie just fails.
But ranged against the likes of classic Amicus anthologies such as From Beyond The Grave (another Chetwynd-Hayes miscellany) even its dubious cult status is unwarranted - although the song "Monsters Rule OK" is pleasingly jaunty, and you do get to see Vincent Price and John Carradine disco dancing.
Carrier based aircraft was still an unproven tactic for war, although aircraft carriers had been developed since the early twenties.
Taylor is okay as the new pilot, although I'm not one of his biggest fans.
"Flight Command", although dated, proves to be a pleasant time at the movies.
This movie was awful, although I have seen some worse movies before.
As for my 2/10 rating, I did find this very humorous, although not in the way Filmation intended.
an appearance by Donald Gibb as the unforgettable Ray Jackson from the original film.That's not to mention the fact than Bernhardt does bear a startling resemblance to Van Damme in both looks and accent (although whether that was just put on I don't know!
When the baby arrived then got really funny although you didn't need any brains just sit back & laugh.
Now, I'm not going to complain about the bait-and-switch marketing (the chick on the box cover and on the DVD menu never appears on this disk), which other reviewers describe here, although it is true.
The acting was rather weak, although it was not painful, to watch.
You know, although I love the Lady Chablis a very great deal (when I'm not busy hating her for wearing tailored skirt suits so much better than I do), you know something is dreadfully wrong with a movie when it has Kevin Spacey and Jude Law in the cast, and Chablis is the one whose performance everybody remembers.
It is impossible to pour enough vitriol on the "acting" of John Cusack in the ostensible lead, although others have given it a brave try.
The book makes it quite clear that although her sex and gender don't match, she has no desire to undergo expensive, risky, and painful sex reassignment surgery.)
One of us owned the game, although we never played it, but stumbled across this dreck some years back.
Mia Farrow gives one of her best performances as Cecilia, a Depression-era waitress with her head in the clouds who gets dumped on over and over; after a miraculous situation comes her way and promises a better life, she has to choose between reality and fantasy...although some outcomes are predestined.
Even Freddie Prinze Jr.'s enthusiastic vocals can't lift this one - he's clearly trying his best and, although his best is not wonderful, it shouldn't have found its way into a film this poor.
The plot is roughly the same, although this time he doesn't go after his parents - even the voices sound alike!
I've seen several others copy this sort of thing, although it also was done in some silent comedies, too, if memory serves.
Because of the setting, including that a lot of the film takes place in a black jazz joint, the "Hey Hey Club", the music is jazz during its transitional phase between swing and early bop--heck, even a young Charlie Parker (Albert J. Burnes) is in the film, although the setting has Parker too young to be shown performing (and Parker turns out to be irrelevant to the film).
The story itself, although relatively simple--too simple, perhaps, is chopped up and told as if it's going to have some big revelation or twist.
Of course, the "artifical" penis that hums served as the running gag of the movie, although it really wasn't all that funny to begin with.
In this short, under an hour feature, all we have is the narrative, which, although risque in 1915, seems tame today.
The scientists seemed to already know they were in danger when the eggs arose, although they should not have had any clue whatsoever about what the eggs were.
The cast seemed excellent (although the inclusion of "Homer" should have told me all I needed to know about the script).
It is an old fashioned fantasy film with OK effects although the action sequences are a bit poor.
Long's trickery of her friend near the end, although cleverly "acted", was lame and contrived.
After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.
Vaughn  Vaughn was equally boring, although the actor did a slightly better job of delivering his lines.
Finally, you need to worry a lot less about the hype and a lot more about real quality, although these days, Hollywood seems intent on committing Hari Kiri by hiring bad writer-producers like J.J. Abrams again and again to watch them fail again and again.
For one thing, I was turned off by the fact that the language of choice was French although the story is in Algeria and the characters are Algerians.
I suppose I just enjoy going along on the ride more so than having the story be given to me through the eyes of the documentarian covering the deaths of the filmmakers, although the ending does give us a rather splendid surprise.
As it stands now, the 'twist' at the end barely made sense, and although I understood what they were trying to portray, it came across as a cheap ending, a 'it was all a dream' sort of conclusion.
For me, this film failed on most levels, although there were a few small things that worked.
The Blair Witch Project didn't work for me, either, although in my view, it works better than The Last Broadcast does.
It is not the case and although Bellucci does have the star power and presence to carry such a film, she turns out an average performance at best.
Jack Black was passable, although perhaps he got better later in the movie.
When we watch "Blues Brothers" or "Animal House" we know that although very exaggerated, they are believable in their own crazy ways.
Saw it once at 9-10 years old did not care for it although I was syked when I heard Jason (Austin St. John) the original Red Ranger and the greatest ranger of all time period!
a big disappointment from tamara davis (although not as big as finding out that she directed a b.spears film - what did mike d think about that?)
3) The other guys drop by, no other person attempts to enter the bank, only these guys, although the bank is full of people.
Considerable pruning would definitely help the film, although Miss Totter is likely to remain a firm liability.
Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs.
But totally bad it's not, although were it not for Shelley it might be.
Even when Orlando changes sex I did not find her acting to be of the required emotional depth, although the script was probably partly to blame for this.
Everything is laid out for the audience, beginning with the conscious and the unconscious, and later leading through a handbook of dream interpretation and even dabbling with the Oedipal complex, although that part isn't gone into to any great extent.
On both counts 'Rogue Trader' is left severely lacking, although McGregor tries valiantly, portraying Leeson as anything other than a spoilt child would seem impossible.
It is not your typical 80's movie, although a lot of movies were (and still are) being made where this one takes place in New York City.
Things fare better on the nudity front but the actors used aren't exactly model material, unusually there is full frontal male nudity although I only mention it because it is unusual & not because I'm gay or anything.
It's always difficult to comment on acting when people have been dubbed, here the English dubbing is pretty terrible although maybe Geeson spoke English on set.
Directed by Sally Mattison (at least we now know a woman can make a horror film just as badly as any bloke) I thought Slumber Party Massacre III (although the version I watched had the title A Stab in the Dark) was a dull, predictable, unoriginal teen slasher that does nothing to try & distinguish itself in an already over populated & limited sub-genre.
Its total cheese, although its not meaning to be.
They're a dangerous pair (although, they turn out to be pretty wimpy in the end).
The cinematography was a huge let down; no special angels or dark contrast, although the startwas OK, but a bit too nice for me.
It's all to samey for my liking, although I did like the bit at the end, which pushed postmodernism to new extremes......I wonder if they'll get divorced too.
I know it was released at least 3 or 4 months ago although with films in this category the distributor is pushing to get it to video release as soon as they possibly can because the video release is where much more money can be made and in this case video release will surpass domestic profits.
I have been wanting to get all the above thoughts down somewhere where someone MAY read them, although as you begin reading and notice this is not about this film specifically but about J A, you may skip over this 'review.
Generally, in most anything, you are usually only as good as those surrounding you and although JA tried, she could not carry the film herself and end up with an enjoyable product.
Their parallel destinies occasionally touch each other and finally merge at the end, although the end is shown at the beginning and the story then told in a series of fluid non-linear flashbacks.
There are signs that the writers have some talent, and are able to convey things subtly, but the larger narrative is not very compelling or capable of generating strong response-- although you will almost certainly hate Gershon's character.
he almost forces the crowd to listen to how each day seems as bad as the one before, with him getting fired from his job, his wife divorcing him, or having to care for his ill mother (although that doesn't seem to both him as much).
i have always enjoyed frank whaley in comedy (although he does almost none of that anymore) but this does not really qualify as comedy, no matter how dark or satirical.
although, there is one scene in the movie where jim is working at swamie hots, an Indian fast food place, where you get a little comedic shine on an otherwise horribly depressing film.
The details of the case make little sense, and although the dead-end leads might reflect real-life police business, they don't do much for a plot already messy with loose ends and too many characters (all of them sordid).
This movie was terribly done, although Paul Giamatti did well in his performance it was not enough to save this film.
Bryce Dallas Howard is someone I cannot place, although she has been in a few big movies.
Three are aggressively, generically, cheerful, although one of them, "Up at the Crack of Dawn," gets a first-rate, swinging treatment from a trio called The Tanner Sisters.
There are no characters in this film, only bad actors wearing bad costumes, spewing dialogue so bad it rarely even approaches unintentional comedy (although there are mercifully a few moments of that, as well).
What I also got from the interview is that David Hess, although strange, is a pretty deep and real guy with some interesting insights into the characters he's played and the movies he's made.
Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans.
I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films.
I was unfortunate enough to catch a screening of Experiment at the Phoenix Film Festival, although I'll be honored to be the first on IMDb to warn you all of what you'd be getting into if you were to see it.
Some of the concepts here aren't completely bad - Anna and Morgan struggle with learning their own language in a completely foreign country, although the dialog and performances amount to confused stuttering that drags already unnecessary scenes out.
When the actual plot is revealed in the last half-hour, the film starts to move - too late for those who wisely walked out, although they weren't missing much.
The new camp, although better equipped, has a very different regime, and introduces us to Miss Hasan, the malicious and spiteful right-hand woman to the Commandant.
That film was well received although it didn't transform Abel into a leading man.
It is a highly biased propaganda piece, although there is some counterpoint scattered throughout.
I know one of the experts interviewed, although I won't mention his name because he is tort-happy.
Corporations have served to enhance the standard of living for all Americans, although at times in unethical ways.
The film moves along at snails pace and although it only runs for about 70 minutes or so it feels like 3 hours.
Heck, even "Goodfellas and "Passion of the Christ" had more laughs than this pointless piece of dredge which takes the worst elements of "Meet the Parents" and "The Girl Most Likely To," although with none of the charm, intelligence or humor of these pictures.
She plays an American student on sabbatical in Paris who, although she does not speak French, is hired by and then immediately given the keys and codes to a jewelry store to satisfy the plot!
The acting is very flawed and quite comical although I am sure that was not their intention.
And although he is the best thing in it, that isn't saying much.
A female police officer (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is drawn into a situation by a drug dealer who has come to the station with stories of being kidnapped (with a few other men) and submitted to some "game playing" for their lives, but he managed to escape, although others were not that lucky.
It might be a good movie to watch if you were extremely intoxicated for sheer comedy value (although the movie isn't supposed to be comedy).
i wasn't too impressed with this movie.it is in the style of both the Conan movies,but i didn't like it anywhere near as much.there was lots of action,but i still found it to be slow and boring.it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on,but barely.i didn't find the acting very good,although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character.but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen.however,the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie.he doesn't show up until about halfway through,but i liked him in his role.otherwise,the movie is tedious and very hard to get through.for me,Kull the Conqueror is a 4/10.
The movie is strictly Grade B material, although there are some nice special-effects and color to it.
I saw it a few days ago and it was far below my expectations, although it wasn't completely a bad movie.
Nero is declared emperor, although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old.
The two boys hung in there during the movie; patiently (although there was A LOT of sighing) and I kept thinking...something good Has GOT to happen because Dustin, Natalie & Jason would never haven taken a movie with such a dead beat theme and ending.
OK. Let's start this by saying that I am from Belfast and although I haven't ever lived in a nationalist "district" like the one this film tries to portray I am fairly aware of what happens in parts of Belfast.
It is not badly made, although it is very cheaply made, but it was just trying too hard to be something it wasn't.
I don't want to beat on Lewis too severely (although he WAS partially responsible for "Monster A Go-Go" as well).
The Director gives us a sleek and highly enjoyable (although not a bundle of laughs) peice of film work that looks brilliant on the screen and the script is of the highest order.
Sometimes this tactic goes terribly wrong however and the rented film proves to be too bad even for laughs...  Camp slaughter is a story about a few kids who go out to a cabin in the woods to party (although mostly it just seems they want to whine and complain at each other).
Their English is terrible and make many scenes laughable although they try to be serious.
For all else, The Breed, is little more than a template horror movie that, although has the rare incentive of decent acting, offers extremely limited thrills or even decent writing.
I can't believe Ackroyd lost all that weight for this (although he does look very good).
I'll admit, I think I rented it when it came out on video, although I was very young so I will assume my mom rented it for me.
I don't care... watch irreversible, since that movie is shocking and has stunning cinematography and visuals and keeps your interest and massages your mind (although I think Noe has as little to say as Dumont, but he made a f***n MOVIE!).
Oh, and speaking of animals, when David has an orgasm he makes more noise than Katia, although, to be sure, both of them overact in these scenes like porno superstars.
Apparently shot under the cheeky title of Unravelled, written & directed by Paul Bales I thought Leigon of the Dead was an OK time waster although many may feel I'm being too generous with that description.
The character's & dialogue aren't great but they suffice although what saves Legion of the Dead is some reasonable gore, the fact it's a little bit different, it has some good looking birds in it & it moves along at a fair pace.
I wouldn't call Legion of the Dead particularly scary & the action scenes lack a certain spark although the zombie mummies are quite cool.
For what it is it's reasonably well made & the acting is OK as well although it saddens to see decent actors like Zach Galligan & Bruce Boxleitner reduced to bit-part roles in films such as this.
Legion of the Dead isn't a great film that's for sure but I found it a mildly entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes although I wouldn't be able to argue with anyone who called it crap, not as bad as I was expecting but still far from what one might call a good film.
It looks like five-year old kids playing in the backyard - although this remark may be offensive to the intellect of any five-year-old, or two-year-old for that matter!
Anyway, the acting of all involved is pretty medium and the movie is not horrifying at all, although there really is some gory stuff in there.
The majors guilty of this box office flop are Szwarc and Odell but the acting is another problem for this movie although the all-star cast.
The version I first saw was the original American theatrical print, although even the extended cuts of the film don't help explain much.
As Marlon Brando in Superman movie Peter O'Toole shines as Zaltar and is splendidly camp; his hamming was funny and entertaining although the character and the lines are very poor.
She bears the palm of the worst actress in the movie but especially this time she wins also the award as the most ugly woman in the screen although the presence of the fat Vaccaro.
Does anyone but me wonder how it is that Kara-El could automatically speak perfect contemporary American English although it's not likely she would have known a single word of English as she knew next to zilch about Earth as she was portrayed here?
although attractive in the face, he has the personality of Nomie Malone from Showgirls, and I have trouble believing all women fall for his charms.
I don't normally ever watch network TV, and i'm not really big on reality shows at all, but i have been watching this because i thought it would be somewhat interesting.. turns out to be a poorly executed show that'll probably never recover from it's first season without some major changes (although it has already been renewed for a second season in '07).
Breathnach's direction and Nanu Segal's cinematography weren't bad and worked well for the film, although the 'trip' visuals got a little too 'MTV' in their editing.
The creepy stories around the camp fire - which although are the starting point for the horror, like in 99% of horror movies, it all starts with the telling of a story.. but it is getting tiresome and the story itself lacks any horror merit i think..
To sum it up, the only saving grace to this movie was the half decent acting, some of the camera work was well done - nice moving shots through the woods.. And although most of the reviewers here say the twist was obvious and they got it in the 1st 20-30 mins.... Well, i got it - but only figured it out maybe 10-15 mins b4 they dropped it - maybe just a slow night for me.
They are meet at the airport by main character Tara's (Lindsey Haun) on/off boyfriend type Jake (Jack Huston), he appears to be local although he too has an American accent.
I found some of the scenes, although admittedly supposed to be taking place at night, too dark to really see what's going on, which was frustrating at times.
The restoration is very good overall, although there are two or three very rough sequences.
This was the one Gainsborough film he actually wanted to make, although he had hit the top of the charts with other Gainsborough Gothics such as The Wicked Lady and The Man in Grey.
Anyway, I found it all rather silly and not really all that interesting, although a bit funny in places.
The ending of the film is highly unusual but effective, although especially for me--as someone who champions extremely liberal sexuality and thinks monogamy isn't really a great idea--there was a contradictory one-two punch of being disheartening, then shortly after uplifting.
Persons with a special interest in the careers of one of the four actors might also find it somewhat interesting, although this movie was a best a footnote on any of their careers.
It's one of those films that manages to make a serious statement about human nature purely by presenting believable (although zany) characters and behavior, never getting preachy.
I like this combination, although it's likely to throw some viewers off track.
Hung and Ann(Pauline Chan and Rena Murakami)are down-on-their luck prostitutes trapped in Hong Kong.Pauline's boyfriend,Sam back in China,who is under the impression that she is away working at a factory,is double-crossed by Billy Chow,and while looking to escape;flees for Hong Kong and winds up at the brothel where Pauline is employed.He is crushed when he finds out the truth..."Escape from the Brothel" combines plenty of gory fighting,romance,sleaze including several violent and unpleasant rape scenes and comedy,all into one.There is plenty of full-frontal female nudity and I'm not complaining about that.The violence is rather brief until the full-blooded finale,although one scene where a woman is strung up and has her nipples wired to a portable electric generator is strong stuff even for Cat III sleaze.A must-see for die-hard fans of smut!
The movie is tense without veering toward melodrama, and although it begins rather slowly, the final twenty minutes or so are unsettling, nerve-wracking suspense.
Well, although he seems to have moved away from his bright colors and chaotic chasing sequences, and although Live Flesh is to the best of my knowledge the first movie where he openly praises the post-Franco era, it was as tasteful as its predecessors.
The events are displayed without any dark atmosphere and although the idea of what happened is scary (I wouldn't want to give away the ending) it appears just plain.
The main problem with this film is that although all the cast try very hard, its just not *that* funny.
And although the musical is meant to be laughably bad, it mostly just seems fairly dull.
Perfect Strangers is a good place to start, although he doesnt actually feature that strongly in that either.
Coincidentally Dick Foran also appears in that film although as a character similar to Dick Powell's, the phony cowboy.
but unlike Big Brother the film is entertaining, very impressive and worth watching although the twist is plainfully obvious.
She signs him on as a new singing cowboy although Powell has a deathly fear of anything on four legs.
Douglas is wooden as Adam, although Chriqui is very convincing as Eve.
The music was fantastic (although a bit outdated) and realy set the tone of the movie.
The animation itself is quite beautiful, although it may seem somewhat primitive by today's digital standards.
Thora Birch is also noteworthy although her British accent is inconsistent at the best of times.
The sets and special effects are all well done, never detracting form the believability of the story, although the Kilrathi themselves are rather under developed and one dimensional.
The acting isn't great, although it's not downright awful - it's close.
I do not feel that these two were able to capture the true spirit of these characters completely, although Lillard is close.
The Hole is an effective little thriller that I thought was well worth watching although probably not more than once.
Norma, distraught, tells him they have to face reality, that he'll still want to see Marian (although why he would ever want to see Marian again escapes me), and that if he marries Norma, he would shame his family, be alienated from his children, etc., etc.
It is when Rory suffers a near-fatal heart attack that the film really gets it's biggest interest (although there are moments of good chat before), and all characters are brought together to rediscover themselves.
The acting is of a high standard although the actors are, in this light, pawns rather than agents and I find the film consequently weak.
Sadly, although the themes of insightful portrayal into class-ridden British society are present, 'All Or Nothing' lacks any of the vitality or wit of the earlier films.
There used to be flats on our estate that, although not the same in appearance, where practically the same in their inhabitants: the drunk family, the quiet family (Phil's and Penny's family), the druggie families, the slightly odd kid, the angry violent boyfriend, the single mum with foul-mouth daughter.
As in the 1974 version, Nemo's major role, and his motivations and loyalties, are as Verne presented, although his nationality is changed to an Englishman who has adopted India, given the casting of Stewart.
Special effects reminded me of Jason and the Argonauts (1963), although not as realistic.
There's nothing new, although the return of Detective Miles comes as a shock, and it's shot brilliantly.
Whether this is lucky strike number 2 for Mulder isn't clear, although I believe it is.
This low-budget effort is less a horror flick than a psychological thriller, sort of HIGH TENSION without the barbed-wire baseball bat, although it has its share of grue and contains a couple of highly squeamish moments, the worst involving a pre-PIRATES Keira Knightley.
This may have been Angie Dickinson's best performance, although she was also terrific in in "Dressed to Kill."
It will remain with me forever and although yes!
This is certainly not a Blair Witch Project clone, although this impression has been given by the press.
But although this movie does acknowledge that aspect of prostitution, what it does better is explain how, despite the concept being unconceivable to so many 'normal' people, many if not most women that go into prostitution do so of their own free will, find it a very financially (and often mentally and physically) rewarding profession, and the only misery they really suffer is not directly from their work, but from the rejection that society thrusts upon them.
Frances and Geoff have had an intimate relationship, although any relationship between them seems very tenuous, and Elizabeth has had a crush on Mike for a long time; Mike was otherwise going out with another girl, but she had just dumped him.
The investigators trying to piece together the case come to know this, although they never directly state as much, but the performers give very subtle clues to their complex realizations as the story goes on.
This one, although better than a lot of the other garbage out there about exorcism, is not nearly on the level of either of the two other movies I mentioned above.
All in all check it out, it's not a masterpiece by any means, although it rather strikes my fancy!
good movie, although sometimes its hard to see the subtitles.
Many, many good ideas, although violence and humor are not always too well-balanced: sometimes they simply clash.
I must say that although flawed, it is one of the better horror/comedy hybrids that I've ever seen.
He was the least offensive of the three main characters although still a drunken crook - but he seemed less harmful.
It's not really a film-noir, although the movie certainly shows similarities to the atmosphere and the story also shows noir tendencies.
During that time, although I had forgotten the title entirely, there were aspects of this film that stuck in my brain and likely contributed to a few random dreams; I remember not really following the plot as a child, but I recalled finding it A) very beautiful, and B), unbelievably dark.
Many reviewers have compared the story to Romeo & Juliet, and although I wouldn't have understood the analogy as a child, I'm sure I recall the realization that, however majestic and omnipotent the combatants (Sea and Fire, in this case), the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud, a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory.
Despite the fact that the two main male characters pretend to be married to each other, there is no gay theme going per se but the comedy clearly arises from the fact that everyone is fooled by Maurice's act as he pretends to be George's homely wife (unlike in The Birdcage, which, although the latter is a very good comedy on its own, I find to have nothing in common with this one.
The only reason I was interested in watching The Canyon was the presence of actress Yvonne Strahovski, who is brilliant as Agent Walker in Chuck, one of my favorite TV programmes.However, The Canyon ended up being an entertaining thriller with decent performances and a generally good rhythm, although it is not very memorable.
If you have seen the movie on TV you have missed out a lot , because the quality of the images deteriorates considerably, so I suggest you watch it in a cinema, although this could prove hard.
I expected more by this movie, and let's admit that after having watched Fandango, I was a little disappointed, although some good elements are to be appreciated.
Second, Lombard was never a bigger star than Gable (although at the peak of her career, she was the highest-salaried star in the industry thanks to her shrewd business sense).
Carole always called it the worst film of her career (although, personally, I deem it far superior to her lone foray at Warners, "Fools For Scandal" in 1938).
Of this small group, the urban crime drama 'Across 110th Street' will probably remain his best-known, although it seems destined for eternal life in obscurity.
It's a spoof of The Jazz Singer, and although seeing that film helps make the cartoon even funnier, you can still appreciate the cartoon without seeing it.
It's this that makes this movie worthwhile, although there are fantastic performances from Plummer as Nicole's tyrannical father and Orbach as Mario's frustrated boss.
There is a positive out-look in that both the central characters are concerned with fatherhood; one is already a father and both do not know their real fathers (although this changes during the film).
Personally I liked it, it has plenty of bad language, one-liners, decent set-pieces & fights & a bit of mystery surrounding the plot although it's not that hard to work it out.
Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own.
The formula is very similar to the original, although it's not quite as good.
This is thin stuff although the director (Patrick McGoohan, a talented actor) tries to lay it on with a trowel.
The film's subject matter, largely implied about death, the heartfelt hymns, and the film's lighting combine to render a general tone of sadness and depression, although laughter and joy find their ways into the story, as well.
The Divine Woman, although short, is one of the most beautiful films in which I have seen Greta Garbo.
The film is not as heavy as some of her other work, although there are some sad undertones.
The main events and characters of the book were translated to the big screen although non-essential characters such as Kimi or Ingrid were completely omitted and the ending was slightly altered (and I liked it).
It is not perfect; although, it ends perfectly.
The film creates a great sense of atmosphere, with the long hallways and the tremendously and unnecessarily elaborate living quarters that Mary is placed in, and we see some wonderful things as Mary sneaks around to explore the mansion, although she really only goes into one room and then her explorations are over.
We know that the garden once belonged to and was loved by Lord Craven's wife, and we know that she died giving birth to Colin which is why Lord Craven locked up the garden forever and can scarcely stand even to look at his crippled son, who he fears will turn out to be a hunchback like himself (although neither of them look like hunchbacks at any time during the film).
The movie is OK: Bogdanovich knows how to direct a thriller, although his best work was "Noises Off...".
It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.
Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in "The fifth element" and also the character in the later "Ultraviolet" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character.
The dubbing on my version was actually not half bad although I would have preferred the Japanese version.
I'm a great fan of polish cinematography, although I have to watch all these movies subtitled.
She also dies in the end, although she commits suicide if I remember correctly.
It is a wonderful movie, but I do find that Vickie (Jean Arthur), although wonderfully funny, was in reality quite a vixen and quite selfish in this version.
Although the overall structure isn't as tight as the other three, the jokes are often still 'fresh' and there's a lot of slapstick, which, although predictable, is still funny!
A death occurs, and although Chris is innocent of it, it looks like the blame will fall on him, particularly when Bert forces Chris to make repeat visits to the club.
And when he himself directs a movie that doesn't work, he shelves it, although the move means near bankruptcy.
In 1951, although ostensibly a comedy, SINGING IN THE RAIN did show the disaster to so many silent careers (even the detestable Lila Lamont's) that sound brought in it's wake.
May Hope be carrying Bo's baby...although I don't know how old she is supposed to be.
The still  photos of the ladies, although they are not the originals,are very  artistic and well made.
A cheap joke is made about the centegenarian grandmother's inability to hear well (although this character had a very poignant scene at the very end of the film).
Re: whomever's comment about Clu being "demented," he didn't seem that way to me, although I guess he had somewhat of a rep as an actor.
His interview on the DVD of "The Killers" is very lucid, although it may have been rehearsed?
I'd say this is probably one of the best episodes of the series - although, to be honest, still not even a patch on The Girl in the Fireplace, which is easily the best since the show was revived.
What an outstanding actress, although this is perhaps not her best performance.
Ackerman's love of all things Fantastic brought us together (he as editor, myself as reader and fan) and, although I did write back to him and thank him for his help in getting my script to Romero... it just doesn't seem like thanks enough.
It's not as if the horror content is particularly scary, although it's not for want of trying.
I caught it last week on a TCM program, although the advertised cast mentioned only the names of Lana Turner and...Thurston Hall!
A must for all the Artie Shaw and Swing Era fans, although the jazz sequences - except TRAFFIC JAM - are unreasonably shortened.
I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.  
There's interaction with Emily's son that could have been excised (although it serves as the source for the movie's title), and there's not quite enough interact between Hank (who's investigating, near the base) and Joan (who's still at home, a two-day drive away); true, too, that the stiff-necked bureaucrats are a little too stubborn and uncaring.
But that's pretty common in mysteries in general, and I didn't feel like Haggis had cheated, although it's entirely possible he's just kind of stupid.
Jones' performance was nominated for an Oscar, and it's well deserved (although I would have rather seen him get one for No Country for Old Men, where he was even better).
The film although written and directed by Paul Haggis doesn't feel like a Paul Haggis film.
Notice that although the movie's crime story is solved by the end, it turns out not to involve any conspiracy, the exact reverse of what the story has led us to anticipate (we misread the army official's behavior, assuming the military must be trying to cover up something).
"Saving Private Ryan", although based entirely around an objective, used the multitude of horrors the characters encountered to highlight their methods of dealing with it.
His second major directorial outing, "In the Valley of Elah," avoids both of the "mistakes" (although I'd hardly call them that, seeing as he won Best Picture for what he did with "Crash") that he made last time around.
The movie works because although it does have quite a few negative things to say about the current war in Iraq, the entire film isn't a two-hour tirade against it.
You can see it in this film, although almost all characters being yakuza makes it less obvious.
"Captain Salvation" was beautifully photographed, and although it does show the difference in the movie-making of that day to this day, it was a captivating journey.
Unlike previous Peanuts features, which almost always contained a coherent (although occasionally bad) plot, the only prevailing theme here is that it is Valentine's Day.
I've seen most of "Monk" episodes, although I didn't begin to watch until sometime after it began.
Shirley may be one of my favorite actresses, falling in right behind Audrey Hepburn and one ahead of Liza Minnelli and Barbra Streisand but she wasn't that glamorous or amazing in this movie, although that blue dress of hers does show off her eyes.
Great movie, although it rather is a documentary...
My suspenders of disbelief were stretched to the max throughout this film, although I stuck it out to the end to give it a chance.
The characters were not developed well, although the father in this movie did seem to be a very good actor in his expression of words.
I kept wanting to see the real Soren (although his replacement was good - but too hurried)- what a great character and actor the original Soren is!
I love the sensuality of the movie... and the way Teresa's sister finally gets her head on straight and realizes that he must be killed, although I was a little sad.
Badly acted (Hack is so bad you stare at the TV in disbelief), poor direction with some really terrible songs (although the title song was a minor hit).
I will say though, it was nice to hear Michael Richards voicing a character, bit part or not (although not so nice to not hear Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Larry David at all).
I was expecting the sorts of cheesy werewolf effects that we saw in such movies as "Dog Soldiers" and "Underworld" (although to tell you the truth, I enjoyed both of those movies, solely for the action content in them).
Overall I really enjoyed the movie although there were moments where it kind of slowed down towards the middle, but really picked up at the 3/4 mark.
This is not a B movie, although the title is rather hokey.
I recommend to all to look at, even to the children, although it is sad and too heavy for them, because it is an example to be followed for all, children and adults.
Norris is as stiff as ever, of course, and there are plenty of hokey fight sequences, often filmed in slow-motion, although I can't quite understand the necessity of that "gimmick".
I liked the show and wished it could of lasted longer than it did, although I suppose it is a miracle that such a high styled campy escapist detective show like this would even have been revived in the mid-Nineties and went for 27 episodes!
'Romasanta' tells the chilling tale of Manuel Blanco Romasanta, known murderer of 15 people (although confessing to murdering many more) and how he charms women before killing them brutally like a wolf.
So, although you should not expect a formidably audacious experiment in film-making, you will be treated a deliciously immoral chamber piece on sexual banter and other not so politically correct behaviour.
Still though, this isn't a bad film, although it's rather typical Italian stuff where you have to pay attention because otherwise you can't keep track of the players without a score card.
Surely black people do the new York Times puzzle, although due to intrinsic economic and educational disadvantages they may not make the top 10 - this probably goes for women, too.
I attended the movie with two friends, one who is no longer able to do puzzles because of failing eyesight; the other for whom doing the Sunday New York Times puzzle has become a religious experience; we were all equally enthusiastic about the film, although we were all rooting for different people to win the contest.
The film is well-written, although a few things don't quite sit right with me.
The special effects leave much to be desired although it claimed to be to gory for the silver screen, and the story line was boring and uninteresting.
Poe's story had already been turned into a film by Roger Corman as he directed Pit and the Pendulum (1961) staring Vincent Price although this 90's version has next to nothing in common with Corman's flick other than the title & even that was changed to The Inquisitor for it's US DVD release, the script by Dennis Paoli is pretty good here, the character's are better than one would expect with Henriksen obviously having fun playing the part of Torquemada as he's a character with some depth even if not a particularly likable one although I'm not sure about that silly hair-cut.
With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 this looks nice enough if a little forgettable, it's reasonably well made with better than average production values & decent period detail although most of it takes place in the same room.
To be fair, the cover art's impressive, although at least one of the screen caps on the back wasn't even in the movie.
And they immediately do so, although the Chief was the only one of them who had gotten killed.
Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic "La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus"), it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome.
Water is a motif in the film--probably because of its relationship to food, as a means of necessary nourishment, although ironically, in a world characterized by food shortages, water is mostly wasted in the film.
While not a depressing film (it wasn't to me, at least, although not that I dislike "depressing" films), Delicatessen isn't exactly uplifting, either, although there is a message of hope at the end, I suppose.
In a stark contrast to Dreyfus, Marie-Laure Dougnac; the young lady that plays his daughter and love interest for Pinon is very down to earth, and is the most 'normal' character in the film...although there's still room for her to be a nearly blind klutz.
As previously mentioned, Julie, although not entirely 'normal', is the most normal character in the film; the rest of it is populated by lunatics.
That is not to say that the film completely lacks depth or meaning; although a moral to the story doesn't seem to present itself, the film takes it's depth from the 'what if' scenario that it presents; "if the world's food supply became too short to feed the population, would you resort to cannibalism or join the vegetarian freedom fighters?".
Well about the plot and the characters, you'll just have to see, it is fairly well done movie, lots of good scenes, although some bring up thoughts of deliverence , but don't come close to 'Squeel like a pig boy'.
Liam Neeson is fantastic as the brother, he made a great vigilante, had excellent chemistry with Swayze, was very intense, and was really into his role!, i loved him.Adam Baldwin is wonderful as the main villain, he is extremely sadistic, cold, although that smug smile of his made me want to slap him silly, i hated his character, and he played it really well, one of my favorite performances ever by a villain!.
Ben Stiller is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, although he didn't have much screen time, he had a great character, he was so vulnerable, and i just couldn't help but like his character i really felt sorry for him, he rocked!
I must comment on the outstanding acting which although must have been done under lots of distractions never wavered and continued to excel throughout.
The comedy team of Wheeler & Woolsey come off by far the best, although one wishes one could see more of Maurice Chevalier, Laurel & Hardy and the Our Gang kids.
These generally involve his criminal peers although his donation of his share of the drug rip-off loot to a friend as an investment in the latter's computer business only backfires when the treacherous fellow blackmails Joe.
A story capturing my mind: although most of the audience in the cinema were laughing a lot and the two user comments I found in IMDB both claimed it was a funny movie, I found it rather sad.
And he sure seems brainwashed although nice and soft-spoke.
But it's still well-observed and disturbing, although it's almost as shocking to hear its really quite distinguished cast speaking in Forest of Dean accents as it is to see them dressed as children.
They bimble across the desert looking for the Mexican border, finding en route a mummified body buried in a dry river bed with a gold medallion on it; when they later find a mysterious Indian (the always reliable, although poorly cast in this case Danny Trejo) who spots the medallion, he tells them the legend.
Not to write any spoilers, although talking over the flaws would give some of the story away.
Director Quested does an OK job, the film looks alright although it's not scary, it has zero atmosphere or tension & it lacks any significant gore or violence either.
There's a decapitation, a couple of stabbings, someone has their eyes poked out (although why this would make you cough up blood from your mouth I don't know), someone is slashed across the breasts & not much else to get excited about.
I thought this film did an admirable job portraying most of spideys origins, although a lot of key events were left out entirely.
This is one of those typical Twentieth Century-Fox Laurel & Hardy pictures, that in style and humor quite differs from their early work but still has its certain charm and entertainment value, although the movie is far from an hilarious or great one.
The movie isn't consistently funny but yet it always remains perfectly entertaining to watch, although I would definitely had prefer some more slapstick from the two boys.
the way there is an 'adults world' and a 'child's world', although Pan's Labyrinth focuses more on childhood escapism, but 'Blame in Fidel' is more about childhood realism.
Hard social facts are faced from the perspective of a little and very smart and inquiring child, although there's no violent scene on the movie the political tension is well expressed by the parents and friends, to the very confussion of the girl.. i don't remember her name, but her performance is outstanding, its very interesting how she interchange her wasys from childish feelings and behavour to thoughtful and even worried attitudes, being all the time very credible, the picture has a sad background, but the bright of the girl as the protagonist gives the element of hope, being the picture not sad but quite interesting and rich, with a lot of joyful funny moments.
Paul Vitti's sexual life needed more exploration; although his adulterous intentions do induce a few laughs, the story could have gone somewhere with his infidelity.
I liked Imola Kezdi ("HoltvÃ¡gÃ¡ny 1973) as Ana Criveanu, who falls in love for the prince, and later on kills herself when rejected by the prince, although I had the feeling she did not look exactly like a 20 years old girl, as the script requires.
If you watch it in English, you will notice times when the lips and the dialogue don't quite synch and that can be annoying, although I wager that French speaking viewers will have a more rewarding time of it.
The story has some rough edges although the global plot is quite interesting.
Most actors do a great job, although some are a little too frenchy.
Not much from him that is that interesting, although you could feel sad for the kid, as early on in the movie Pan collapses onto the floor and is taken to a hospital where of course, they can't do much for her.
Ms. Holm was also an athlete; and, although she swims and cavorts wonderfully, she can't lift herself out of a shallow pool!
--- I didn't leave, although now I wish I had.
Literary and historical references are sparsely sprinkled throughout the film, and although Miller has a few monologues in which he attempts to express the point of his writing, Miller fans will find nothing more than a superficial synopsis.
I must admit that although I knew of her for her TV role in "Joan of Arcadia" and for the movie, "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," let's just say that I don't think a 46 year old guy is typically in her target audience.
the teacher replies that, although she would like to agree with him, the only official answer the school board will allow her to give is abstinence.
Oddly bland are the romantic leads, although their characters put them at a disadvantage, since every one else is over the top.
However, I think a great deal does happen, although quietly.
By the way, although it looked cool, why did Shaft bother to blow up the bunker at the end of the film even though the bad guy and all his men were dead?!
(some plot content included, although there is no way to spoil this crap) Ok, here's the scene: Me and my friends are renting movies one night and we decide to rent this (thinking it would be funny, not a porn because of it's R rating).
Not that Christopher Lee singing and dancing with a deadpan look on his face isn't somewhat amusing, but this is chock full of songs and after a while I just wanted to stop the DVD before the end, although I somehow managed to get through it all.
I first saw this film when I was but a young lad, and loved it - the fact that some of the film was set in Australia played something of a major part in this - although some bits frightened me for no apparent reason.
Unfortunately, Howard Ross' one-dimensional characterization of the rapist/serial killer sticks out like a sore thumb alongside this caliber of acting and, in any event, the actions of the characters strain credibility on occasion Â Ferrer is conspicuously absent most of the time (although he is inherently aware of all that goes on in his household and his eventual suicide arises more out of selfishness than resignation at his crippled condition or the immorality of his kinfolk), not to mention the fact that the investigating police officer decides to consummate his obsession with Gastoni while the manhunt for the rapist is in full swing.
Well, although some might strongly disagree, but despite these actors and Lubitsch teaming together, this is not one of the director's better films.
All three find this an agreeable idea, although Max does not.
It's ironic that Horton played Max, for in real life he was gay (Cooper was notorious, despite his marriage, for affairs with Marlene Dietrch, Patricia Neal, and several other women; although March had a long marriage to Florence Eldritch, he had a reputation as being a real "letch").
"Plan 9 from Outer Space," often talked about as being the worst movie ever made, was, in my mind, a far better movie, although I think its director, Ed Wood, would have brought considerable talent to the making of "High Noon Part II."
Anyway I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through.
Still, some make-up effects in this film are Â although cheesy Â rather hard to digest.
Speaking of being bored, Christopher Lee doesn't exactly approach his role in this film with gusto and his performance, although still malevolent as Lee always is, pretty much is the epitome of this film; bored.
This may be a true story although there are critics out there who claim that the man made up the story because he wanted attention.
That being said although Boorman did capture the authenticity of the native tribes and address the issue of deforestation the storyline was a little dull and clichÃ©.
Despite being top-billed, it's actually a supporting role, although it's definitely the juiciest part.
It's rare to see this film although it's shown on Fox Movie Channel once in a while.
Marvin tries to create some style with the use of bright neon colour although completely fails of course.
With a supposed budget of $2,700,000 The Wraith is technically good although nothing spectacular & they should have put more effort into how the wraith himself looked.
Personally I didn't think much of The Wraith although it's just about daft enough to have a certain charm & maybe have a few admirers.
The characters are very good; although, I felt that Charlie Sheen was a bit wasted as the title role of the movie.
I think The Wraith is a fantastic movie,although in my opinion, the film could have been more creative with the car racing sequences and maybe could have explained a bit more about Jake and his past, but otherwise I have no other criticisms.
ajith has come with a refreshing movie and although it has a weak story yet it was entertaining.
The acting, although amateurish at times, doesn't distract from a believable story.
The "mystery" is well-shrouded throughout the film and not revealed until fairly late in the film, although there's plenty of strange goings-on to keep your interest until then.
And they, although sometimes out of breath, are still the best around.
Of course Eddie Murphy will rescue his wife and Master Gracey will be reunited with his love and the bad butler will be punished (although nobody really knows why and by whom).
Barbara Barrie is a school teacher, and unhappy although she does not know it.
Sharpe's fight with Loup is excellent, although I do agree with another review I read somewhere here in that the expressions of the characters when they hate each other has echoes of lust as well.
Indeed Radler rebounded with the far more enjoyable Substitute 4:Failure Is Not An Option, although that one is no great shakes, at least it doesn't have Olivier Gruner trying to talk all lovey-dovey with his co-star.
Dynomutt was hilarious as the mechanical Dog Wonder who although being a state of the art (at least at the time) crimefighter, Dog Wonder always malfunctioned.
In fact there is not one single instance of cannibalism in the entire film although we are treated to some decent gore even if it doesn't reach the heights of some other splatter filled Euro horror, there is an effective slit throat, someone has their head bashed in, someone gets his face split down the middle with a meat clever & there are various gory sequences inside the slaughterhouse & all that entails.
No real big names although by now you should have heard of some of the actors.
Made with amateur actors in many roles performances are pretty good although the odd line is fluffed this only adds to its charm.
Scully's character, although not that important in this episode had some really nifty scenes.
Most of these people had never acted before, and although it does seem like they're just reciting their lines (there's almost no break in between the dialogue), they do a good job at it.
The movie kind of reminded me of my crush I had on a coach, although I was in college and nothing like that happened.
How wonderful, then, that I should run into this quiet little movie, which, although I will admit that Boise, Idaho is not the largest outlet for foreign film, I don't remember ever being released in my area.
This movie is more like a Wheat Thin, possibly underrated, certainly rather bland looking, but somehow much more satisfying and although it comes salty or in low sodium flavors, is surprisingly sweet without a trace of gooeyness.

No big plot, no big camera moves, no big cast, no big musics, no big budget... (although some of the best movies I've ever seen were very cheap).
I saw this film with the title "The Very Thought of You" and think that "Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence" is far more apropos and distinctive, although a bit of a mouthful to casually mention the film to friends.
I liked the fact that it didn't go the typical sex route, although I didn't think about that until the movie was over.
In other words, although this outdoor adventure film is set during the early days of man, nobody is bald and the women far too gorgeous.
There are obvious connections to Rear Window, the movie even being dubbed Rear Window for the MTV generation (although aren't we a bit past that now?
So Distubia was a pretty good movie, I would recommend it, although before you see it, I would highly recommend seeing Rear Window, but this was a good updated version that I'm sure you'll enjoy.
The climax is very suspenseful, although it did contain a few minor lapses in rational behavior by both the heroes and the villain, but I suppose that could be written off as desperation.
Many great one-liners too, a definate must see, although perhaps not your average family movie!
Read the reviews of the professionals at the time (Ebert, Maltin, and others) and you'll see that it was more or less expected to bomb (although I think in hindsight many more people found the film to their liking).
It actually worked quite nicely, although sometimes it actually left comedy and again showed Korman's handling of drama.
Directed by Gordon Flemyng this late 60's crime heist action thriller is unfairly rather obscure but is worth the effort to track a copy down, although you can compare The Split to The Italian Job (1969) since they are both 60's heist films The Split was made & released a year before.
The character's are also very good with each member of the gang having a distinct personality & getting at least a few minutes screen time to develop it although McClain is hard to like as the lead character since he only seems interested in serving himself.
The Split was apparently the first film to be given an 'R' rating by the MPAA thanks to some fun fights, a few shoot-outs, a bit of mild bad language (although the 'N' word is used here in a casual fashion, something unthinkable these days especially when the IMDb flags it as a 'Prohibited Word' as I have just found out...) & a bit of blood.
The Split is a good heist film that starts out like The Italian Job but goes in a significantly darker direction although not to the films overall benefit in my opinion.
Not so much as the flow of the viewing itself (although it does tend to be slow), but for other flaws.
Perhaps director Lewis Milestone wasn't aware that he wasn't making a stage production, because although the style resembles many of the time, here he even has the actors exiting what looks like a theatrical set, all the times.
We almost come to admire his character, and side with him, although he is insane.
The photography in this is not quite as good as the original although the films are almost exactly the same length.
And, although the video I got was a poor copy, Crawford literally shone, an illuminating contrast to the dark nights, the unending sight and sound of the rain and the dour and dominating aspect of Walter Houston as the self-righteous and chauvinistic preacher Davidson who tries to reform the prostitute Sadie Thompson (Crawford).
Such a story, of course, has its roots in numerous biblical accounts of fallen women and men who try to redeem them, although I'm not suggesting that Maugham simply plagiarized the bible.
Joan Crawford was reportedly not happy with her performance in Rain although for the life of me, I can't figure out what she had to be ashamed about.
The three girls in the family generally outshine the boys in this production, although a visiting schoolmate named Louis (Parnum Wallace) provides a couple moments on camera that are on the same level as those of the girls.
As for scariness, I don't rate it very high, although there are plenty  of good scenes that are pretty freaky.
I've seen Sherlock Holmes In Washington a couple of times and although not the best of the series, I found it enjoyable.
This is a great light hearted comedy done by one of the greatest comedy teams in America, although this film was shot in England.
Playwrite Sam Shepard's Pea Eye, although losing much of Tim Scott's original Bentonesque forlorn rube, is filled with earthy heroism and and poetry.
Yeah OK, I'm giving this flick a 7 because I really dug it in the day (although of course not nearly as much as Star Wars which I saw at the Lowes theater in full surround sound, now that was an all time high!).
It's got great acting done by Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts, and the others are all good too (although the little girl gets kind of annoying...).
This movie reminds me of another one of my favorite contemporary movies, Serendipity(2001), in the sense of being destined to find our soul-mate (although it is not a fantasy piece).
The animation is good, it's the only cartoon drawn on black paper to aid in its dark feel, the music score is powerful, dark and brooding, the voice acting is top notch with Batman and Andrea played wonderfully by Kevin Conroy and Dana Delaney although the film is stolen by the Joker who is played by Mark Hamill from star wars fame.
As I said, I don't believe the premise of the film could ever happen, but the way Ginger looks at Cornel Wilde is believable and, although it's probably with more infatuation than love, I know every guy wishes for a girl to look at him that way.
As I said before, it is a graphic piece of animation, very dark too, it's not kiddie and doesn't play along the guidelines of a "Family film" although there is no cursing involved in it.
The only downside is that it could have been longer, although the rather short (compared to most movies) length does a good job of not making the flow feel dull or boring.
Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous isn't necessarily a good thing.
Traitor is clearly indebted to The Departed in its plot Â no points for guessing what happens to Daniels eventually Â and the Bourne movies in tone and style (although not nearly as shaky).
The FBI are Guy Pierce and Neal McDonough ,who to their credit do a very nice job, although it was a just a little too "Good cop, Bad cop" for the entire film.
But, although it came and went without much notice, "Traitor" is well worth seeing.
What a compelling vision, this time of a side of hell which is hysterically funny, although it portends the doom of us all which a world run by fools will inevitably bring.
I watched "Annihilator" a few months ago and although its strange and unpredictable, enough happened to make me continue watching it till the end.
Its quite a good movie and a clever idea although where they got the idea from is clear to see with the dinamatard robots having red eyes just like in the classic movie "The Terminator".
although when you kids see this and also the first sequel (cinderlla 2 dreams come true) they will learn that something might happen to their magical person and that when you sit around doing nothing you wont get anything near of what you want (ofcoarse friends would also be helpful) also in both sequels Cinderella is much more independent and you learn a lot more about the other characters like the princes mother and the kings past and the stepmother is countless times more evil.
She plays Karen Silkwood excellently, and although she doesn't resemble any likeness to the real Karen Silkwood, she still manages to fool us that she is actually the strong woman herself.
Neither will I criticize that everyone in the movie speaks English, although some sort of lingual contrast between Romans and Boudica's tribe would have been desirable.
Tacitus, although on the other side, describes the British tribes and some of their customs and clothes in some detail.
The Roman women are dressed up to the nines, although tacky and pantomine like.
Jeff Goldblum is great as Ichabod Crane, with his tall, skinny frame storking throughout the movie (although for some reason he's constantly licking his lips).
The music is excellent (although you better love violin music, because that's all you'll here), the acting is very nice and the story really is very beautiful.
The chopped up storytelling much like that of 21 Grams and Pulp Fiction (although not as chopped up and graphic) is incredibly hard to do.
The story follows a red violin, an inanimate object, although at times it seemed alive to me, thru three centuries and the influences good and ill that it has on its possessors.
Wadleigh shows a deep empathy for the men and women in charge of the festival (although you can still take him to task for his dishonorable treatment of some of the foot soldiers, most notably the Port-O-San man) as well as the townsfolk of Woodstock, New York; and he shows just as much passion for the music.
Weapons and locations are good: although the sounds of the weapons is historically incorrect it gives the player a rush: yes, the M1 Garand still is a great rifle.
And the denouement isn't as satisfactory as the balance of the picture, although the motivation for the spree comes off as too creepily real, with what we now know about serial killers.
The movie was made for a very low budget and features a lot of shaky-cam, which is obviously used to hide some of the effects (although they were, in my opinion, pretty good - the rat people are appropriately gruesome and deformed) but it doesn't hurt the film.
The other actors in the film handled their characters very well although the Ernie character could have easily come off as "Barney Pfife" but Norris was able to hold back and make it somewhat believable.
It is a critical look at political correctness, and a highly comedic one, although most people are probably too offended to see that.
I can't say with time this film will be looked back on any more favorably, although it deserves it.
Solondz' comedy works for me, because it is not forced, although his punchlines are more like social commentary.
The short film comes across as even trite and cliched, although now I realize that I'm quoting a scene from it almost directly, so perhaps this is Solondz's point.
The action isn't half bad, although the CGI for a bit in a boat is pretty poor.
Harry Treadaway does well as her friend, although nothing very special.
For the most part, the casting is on target; Ronan seems a lot more engaging and appealing here than she did just last year in Atonement, and Treadway, although looking like a refugee from High School Musical, is just as impressive.
Furthermore, the special effects work, although a little obvious during certain sequences involving humans, is noticeably strong; particularly when a giant mole-like creature appears.
Murray, although arguably underused as far as his talents go, does well to establish a character that nobody is necessarily going to warm to, and uses whatever screen time he has adequately to further the movie on and to back up his lead performers.
Sure enough there are countless rough edges present, and characters, although compelling in their quest, fail to resonate emotionally, but the overall adventure itself Â that is, the tale Â is one that will be sure to captivate imaginations and the attentions of many diverse audiences.
The woman and Luke never appear in the same frame and the shots of him reacting to her, could have been taken weeks apart (a common use in porn to make models appear in the same scene, although they were never on set).
An early scene where Thomas the patient flips out violently after being touched by an extremely hot, sexually agressive young woman gives away the fact that Thomas was sexually molested as a child, although like a bad poker player who shows his cards but figures nobody was really paying attention anyway the filmmakers seem to think the audience will react with something other than complete indifference or a loud duh when they finally pull the molestation card out about forty minutes later.
Her price was the rock although she knew that in doing so would risk the lives of her compatriots.
Overall, I felt the movie flowed quite naturally and was focused on the storyline, although I went into the movie expecting a loose meandering plot line (as some other reviews have suggested).
Again, this was one of those rare scenes that shows Leung's character as human (although it was a very brutal, violent side of him).
Now although Leung's character development was sacrificed for the benefit of the film, Tang's character development was actually enhanced.
Although, more artistically adept Anime fans may detest and although 'The Lion King' is traditionally realized as the quintessential animated film, 'Beauty and the Beast', in the indiscriminate animated realm, may very possibly be one of the most important animated films, Disney, Animated, or otherwise, ranking alongside the likes of 'Snow White', 'Toy Story', and 'Fantasia'.
His childhood friend is Frey, who also happens to be his first real love, although she doesn't know exactly how much he loves her--at least not at first.
Compared to their previous live concerts (especially the sound fiasco at the Shea Stadium event, although that was their biggest performance) this album and this concert was the best this band ever made.
"Mr. Epstein" was long dead although Paul was trying to fill his shoes, and their Apple Empire was shrinking.
Of course there's a sadness and elegiac sensation for fans in watching this "posthumous" film and it's also fair to say the music isn't always top-drawer Beatles - only McCartney brings his best work to the party, although John and especially George would recover their chops in time for "Abbey Road".
In fact, although the band was working on the edge of their break-up, almost 90% of the scenes are cheerful and enjoyable.
A fun bit of TV fluff although like most of Potter's work it goes on too long.
Ewan McGregor, in his very much younger days, presents the best performance of his career (alongside "Trainspotting"); in a way it's a pity that he showed so much promise early on but, although always very likable, he was sub-par in many movies that followed.
For some reason, Sommerfield gets the infamous "and" tag on her name in the credits, like she's a special guest star, although her resume shows nothing but one-time guest shots on TV shows.
An orgy in boredom, although not as dull as "Yrrol", focusing on some married couples and their endless whining and nagging...  A fat 0 out of 10
One of my favorite movies, although it's really too long to be a "movie."
We all could do with a little more of that - although I don't think we need to do it for hours on end in a bar.
And, although on the surface everything is resolved in the end, there are still a lot of questions one asks.
Oddly enough, although the bar is a nice neighborhood one, Howard Freeman and Natalie Schaefer go to the bar (they are wealthy people) as though they are slumming.
The visuals in this film, although slightly over the top, are fantastic and will never be forgotten.
although gruesome sick and very stomach churning, it compliments this classic in the making back in the 80's.
Unfortunately, in the process of teleportation, his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly, and although not immediately transformed, as in the original, the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before Â and for damned good reasons.
I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel "Requiem for a Dream" Â although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror Â and in both examples the source is basically Love.
I'd recommend this picture only to hardcore Karloff fans and aficionados of Val Lewton (although many Lewton fans agree that this is one his weaker pictures).
Well, let's assume he wrecked the other boats, too, although one of the characters says, "He's wrecked the only boat on the island!"
Thoughtful plot twists as players strive to gain the upper hand (although intricacies of the embezzlement eluded me).
We both liked it, although she has seen it more than I have!
But for some reason, I'm not too keen on Zac Efron, although all my friends think he's the best thing since Jesse McCartney.
I saw this film shortly after seeing the same director's The Isle and was much more affected by this production, although they are both striking works.
Rio de Janeiro and the ranch are both superb sites (although Rio has it's problems with poverty and violence).
The boxing scenes were hokey but I liked the ending because at least Beery won the fight, although he collapses afterward.
It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet.
Brilliantly written and directed--although most of the actual dialogue was cut out to make it a little less verbose.
Jersey like the other Channel Islands is an Independent State otherwise, for example it would have the same income tax regime as applies elsewhere in the places Governed by the UK parliament which are currently England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although in 1857 the whole of Ireland was under UK law.
Based on this one film, he shows absolutely no talent for directing, although perhaps he might have acquired the proper skills if he'd continued.
At one point, Garbo dons a local costume and, although she fails to charm her husband, she does presage her subsequent appearance, opposite Stone once again, as Mata Hari.
But this is not "Brokeback Baseball," no, although surely that may enter your mind.
Special lines and scenes are added for Zaky el dessouki (Adel emam) only because he's a famous comedian and the audience would like him to throw a joke every now and then although it's totally unnecessary,Taha's (Mohamed emam) clothes are not of his social class in anyway!
Also the character of Hatem and Abd Rabo I think it's a very rare case in an Islamic society although the actors role was very complicated and hard but they made it with Professionalism.
the movie is really so good and the director succeeded in making the movie although its his first movie.
The cast off course was logical although some names that were nominated to take part declined, at my great astonishment the movie was simply awesome.
All characters were obviously very well written as a script , the actors ,all of them gave an outstanding performance, Adel Imam , radiant , witty & funny as ever;Nour el Sheriff made a come back..... it's been a while since I've seen him perform so well on the silver screen; Hend Sabry was lovely; Yousra just Radiant; Esaad Younes more than superb; Ahmed Bedier Wow.... he had the Egyptian Coptic genera nailed to the T; Ahmed Rateb as usual a gr8 performance although the part was too small for such a talent;Khaled Saleh a monster of acting A+ ; Soumaya el khashab a small role but with a lot of soul put into it.
What I got was a great, although flawed, film.
Had a chance to watch KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and although I don't agree with the claims of some that if you must see one "crime" film, this is it, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and that James Cagney was again terrific and on top of his game for this one.
The acting does leave a lot to be desired, although Jason Carns is thoroughly convincing in the lead role.
The living dead in Franco's film, although they could be more well-developed, are much more interesting.
(although you can be sure if that ever does happen he'll film it & stick it in a movie!).
I've yet to see an erotic moment in any of his films (though the moments in this one are probably the least annoying of his I've seen) and most of the naked women he's used aren't all that attractive either (although again, to be fair the women in this movie are about the best I've seen in a Franco film), so no real reprieve there.
And there was a man (Antonio Mayans I believe) talking often to some girls, and there were scenes of various sexual intercourse; although I found the atmosphere in the film very serious and unpretentious.
'The First of the Few' relates the story of the development of the Supermarine Spitfire by R.J.Mitchell, although as almost anyone who knows anything about the 'Battle of Britain' will tell you, around 70% of the Royal Air Force's front line fighters were Hawker Hurricanes.
It's not necessarily an easy film to watch (although it's not heavy-handed by any means), so I'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie).
Additionally, although German Sign Language is somewhat similar to other European sign languages, it is not related to ASL at all.
The horror was not really terribly scarey, more funny, which I kind of thought was the point, although I guess some people on this board disagreed.
According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $5,000,000 which amazes me, although the film does have a nice look about it & decent production values virtually nothing happens & I can't believe that amount of money was spent on this but having said that it's not impossible it cost that much.
This movie also mixes in a bit of cop drama with the good cop bad cop showdown, although unnecessary it still seems to work in the entire B-Movie atmosphere of the rest of the movie.
However, although having some flaws in the story, the movie is very funny and attractive.
Anyway,that made the movie all the more interesting and unique - although likely far removed from what Jules Verne envisioned.
The acting is very good for the most part, although Corey Sevier is a bit weak for a lead role.
The film has the obvious flaws of a b-movie film, although some of the CG effects are very good.
When I came across this, although rated highly by others, I shy-ed away from it for the same reason above ...
The film boasts a great, thought provoking script (which granted does take some liberties with the source material although much of the lovely dialog from Scott's book has found its way into the film), great performances (especialy by Neill, Mason and Hussey and the incomparable George Innes as Wamba) as well as beautiful production values and photography.
