But what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:  - the death of Poppaea and St Paul's talk with Nero at her dead body,   - Claudius' mention of the current conquest of Britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife much before his death),   - Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother,   - Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators,   - finally, Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by Acte "Let us forgive him"  All in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the Roman Empire.

This film which purports to chronicle the childhood of the Babe is almost entirely a fabrication....he didn't grow up in some small town....he grew up near the waterfront docks of Baltimore,MD for the first few years of his life where his father owned and ran a saloon that catered to a very rough crowd.Young George was largely unsupervised most of the time and was continually getting into one scrape or another...as a result George Sr had him enrolled in the St. Mary's Industrial School for boys and pretty much stayed out of young George's life from then on...I'm sure this film's version made for better publicity for the up and coming Babe as well as for the Yankees...Colonel Ruppert was very mindful of his team's public image and making a film about the real version of Babe's young life at that time would have had a lot of negative consequences
