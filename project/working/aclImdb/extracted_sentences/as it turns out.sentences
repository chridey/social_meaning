Keaton is a terrific foil for Allen, both platonically and as it turns out, otherwise, while Tony Roberts as her husband (this being his first of many Allen films, too) makes for a wry straight man with his constant phone calls and his appearances in some fun fantasy send-ups, the best of them in Italian.

Personally, I am more concerned with the sheer lack of quality of any kind from top to bottom in this movie (there's a scene at the end, during the `climax' of the film, where the hero and heroine are hiding from the approaching demons, and decide to lay down on the floor and make-out and just not worry about the monsters that are closing in, I guess hoping that they will just disappear Â as it turns out, they were right), and besides that, even if someone wrote a sequel to this mess, who in their right mind would want to direct it?
I actually didn't expect this film to very funny, as the cover mostly made it look like more of an action movie - but as it turns out it was very very funny.

Mr. Wylde bumps into Terry (Cynthia Rothrock), who -- as it turns out -- is an ex-girlfriend of Mac.
He's not Meryl Streep as it turns out, but you will want to see this powerhouse example of Hollywood art anyway for Toland's camera-work, the ensemble acting, and Dudley Nichols' seamless adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's four one-act plays.
He is helpless outside and inside the ring as it turns out.
But fun and laughter aside, this movie as it turns out, is a very keen, and introspective look at modern day love and relationships.

Their trip is set to be anything but pleasurable, however, as it turns out that there's a deformed killer stalking the underground cave system.
The Enoch Powell episode is dated, and as it turns out, fatuous (declaration of interest: some of us are erecting a statue with the epitaph: He was right); same goes for the Rebrick University episode.
In fact it's for him that some of the picture is most watchable, as he flexes his emotional chops for a scene where it's required for complexity like when he misses the boat and is asked to bless someone dying only to realize there is no wine and must go to ask from a vulgarian for wine (which, as it turns out, is drunken with brandy and all by him).

Bloodier and also funnier than the first one, 'Evil Dead 2' manages to be as good as the original, but in a different way.
I think in the long run, it comes down to the script which as it turns out is badly written and is in need of improvement.
He gets busted in short order, but it's not a big deal as it turns out the girl thought she had just slept with someone other than who this boy turns out to be.
