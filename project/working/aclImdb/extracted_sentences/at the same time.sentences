I will admit that some of the more talky middle "soap opera in space" segments sort of lag the pacing a bit, but the 81 minutes is over quickly and the impression one is left with is that the thinking behind the movie was miles ahead of anything that came out of the West at the same time.
I was ready to punch, slap, or spit in the face any one of them, and it is hard to laugh at the same time.
It's sentimental but at the same time totally bizarre and crass.
It was touching yet erotic at the same time.
The Big Store is a Marx brothers movie from 1941.The plot is irrelevant as it is in any other Marx movie.All that makes any difference is how funny these movies are and I can tell you about this one; IT IS.This time the brothers go crazy in a department store.Groucho plays Wolf J. Flywheel, the private eye, Harpo is Wacky, his silent partner and Chico is Ravelli, the bodyguard of the singer Tommy Rogers (Tony Martin).The amazing Margaret Dumont makes her last appearance with the Marx brothers playing Martha Phelps.It was most hilarious in all those movies to watch Groucho court Margaret and at the same time humiliate her the worst way.She didn't seem to mind.The Big Store is an underrated gem that shouldn't be thrown away.There are lots of scenes that raise this movie higher than many modern movies would deserve to be raised.It's incredible to watch the brothers roller skating in the store.There are also some musical numbers in the movie.It's great to watch and listen to Groucho singing "Sing While You Sell".There's the lady (Virginia O'Brien) singing "Rock-A-Bye Baby with a frozen face.I just loved her!
I auditioned for Mr. Holden in 1999 for the lead female role (Jenna) in "My Father's House," and remember him saying then - after I asked him what he was looking for in regards to the scene I was about to do - "Make me love and hate you at the same time.

The whole episode is reasonably well-paced after it carefully sets up the necessary plot information/murder scenario as Columbo tries to unravel the real truth whilst at the same time undermine a very self-confident murderer.
The story never really build up, useless extended footage on the pitch, lousy snow cgi, all the blame is put on Gavin Harris when Real did not score, when they have Ronaldo, Raul, Robinho, Baptista (that's already 4 strikers in 1 pitch at the same time), with super playmakers Beckham, Zidane, Graveson, etc.
The best scene (to at least have one good comment about the title) is a scene involving Jennifer Esposito and Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, which had a sort of "tension" to it, that was funny and sexy at the same time!
But it's neither funny nor sexy ... and I'm not talking at the same time, at all!
You'd tend to think people get soft as they grow older but with regard to Spielberg's last two films, the director continues to, not only, challenge himself with complex subject matter but also reinvent himself as a director at the same time.

Most of the characters in the film are very special and at the same time you feel a connection with almost all of them, as if they were your friends telling you a personal story while you're sitting with them in a park.
The premise of the film sounded promising to me (three female friends weathering different challenges at the same time in their lives).
It was as though all 3 films were made at the same time, I love it when there isn't a horridly noticeable gap between productions, which ruins the feeling you get from the original.

You'll get to know a little better who Sadako really was before she died, how the curse was born and what makes this whole story so sad and scary at the same time.
The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, Sadako, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.
I have read that heavy accents worked against some actors in the early days of sound film, but I also think that people in North America were more willing to accept certain accents at the same time.

Already the subject of a comprehensive TV series ("Ringu: Kanzen-ban", 1995) and a theatrical spin-off (THE SPIRAL, directed by Nakata and released in Japan at the same time as the original RING), the series represents little more than a millennial update of old-fashioned Japanese kaidan, though its ghostly villain ('Sadako') is now a part of the cultural lexicon throughout SE Asia (rather like Freddy Krueger in western society).

After having watched this movie Dracula III i thought that they should have kept Stephen Billington as the one and only Dracula in the third movie because he gave it that, how do you say?, mystery and yet at the same time he keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart rate fast and makes you anticipate his beautifully exotic voice.

The film is a window and a mirror where we may see both past and present at the same time, a world without moral anchoring, a nightmare world, a decomposing body infested with vermin.
This film is has bizarre dialog, repulsive images, many freaks of nature, strange music, scenes that don't make sense, and yet at the same time, repeated viewings will show that it does make sense... simply because the moral of this story is that it doesn't make sense, and life can go in a thousand crazy directions, we're all like dice in the hands of fate.
However, at the same time, it also had wonderful acting and a superb script about people--something you often did not see in other episodes.

Where WarCraft 2's storyline was excessively simple, and the Orc and Human campaigns were concurrent (that is, they're just two different perspectives on the same story, happening at the same time), StarCraft's storyline is as rich and detailed as a sci-fi novel, full of dissention, assassination, and alliances made and broken.
Robin Williams dominates this movie and is brilliant as usual in the endearing, sympathetic role of the kind Jakob who must try to balance getting out lots of hopeful (if fictitious) war reports to keep spirits up while at the same time avoid Nazi suspicion and detection.
Jakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased.

In fact, we're not made very much aware that there is a serial killer- save for a few mentions here and there- until halfway through the movie, and by the time we are it's full-throttle in a kind of expertly manipulated suspense, not in the usual sense but through an ominous musical score by Pierre Jansen and a movement of fluidity with the camera that tells the story sort of conventionally but not at the same time.
The music is playing right here, and it's really chilling for how simple it lays out the tension, like a weirdo standing across the street in a black cloak acting suspicious but, at the same time, too subtle to pin down.
The color scheme, the manipulation of light, and the stifling editing are as meticulous as in a Hitchcock film, or a Truffaut film, but are at the same time nearly invisible.
Most of the films shot around this time were shot with multiple cameras covering a variety of angles, but all running at the same time so that the scene could be played without stopping.

The main reason this film is probably unheard of is that it was released at the same time as Rush Hour which was a big budget version of this film, in the sense it is an action comedy with African American/Chinese protagonists.

Miss Vinson portrays without falling in the caricature, a shallow, but at the same time likable society woman, who thinks that life is a never-ending party and does not take marriage as seriously as it should be taken, realizing it too late.
The movie has some good moves done by Bruce Willis and the bad men to outwit each other, which keeps you interested in the movie, but at the same time some scenes are too long and take the interest out of their move.
It's complicated satire, because at the same time it promotes and mocks arousal.

Prisoners like Highness, who is eternally juggling two women at the same time (even while in prison!).
The movie made you feel sentimental towards the characters, showing glimpses of whom they were, inside and out the Center, but at the same time making you despise them for the terrible crimes that they had committed and showed no remorse for.

"Tee for Two", despite being so simple and predictable, is different at the same time because it is one of those Tom & Jerry's cartoons all about sports (in this case, golf).
Then at the same time, the killer is killed by another person!
It hardly matters because the killings aren't being made by a single killer with a singular reason but by several killers, whom all have a confusing number of reasons (which can all be traced to greed), with few of the killers knowing that others are also killing other people at the same time and as the film progresses, the killers, in turn, also become victims themselves.
The flick follows in the path of Kevin Smith while at the same time blazing it's own unique path by putting a spin on the classic romantic comedy rules, i.e.

Paddy's character is both welcoming and menacing at the same time, a perfect acting job, he should have received some recognition for this.
Maybe it's because I live in California, but I like to think that the vast majority of Americans with two brain cells working at the same time already knew everything that this movie had to say.
But at the same time it represents the end of a generation of traffickers who also want to run things in a smoother way.
The worst of humanity laid bare, making you want to retch and laugh at the same time.
You might get emotionally confused when watching this movie, you might even sense a little bit of friendship or love between the prison guardians and the prisoners and at the same time you might be able to sense the unreasonable hate.

This movie was very intriguing, yet very disturbing at the same time.
Second, the camera work and lighting are excellent, both subtle and dramatic at the same time, fully enhancing the flashback aspect and sense of fantasy in all of the stories and revealing the delicacy and individuality of the three women, not to mention the great Agnes Moorehead in the first segment.
Although not in any way a great film this will cheer you up and you can feast your eyes on the beautiful dazzling costumes and you won't be able to take your eyes off Marilyn.She lights up the screen and is very funny and touching at the same time.Olivier appears a little uncomfortable in a lot of his scenes(maybe he had too much on his mind as he directed this as well)and in some scenes he seemed to look really creepy.However his acting works for the character of the Prince Regent who doesn't really know how to handle the situation he's in.Worth watching but don't expect much and you should really enjoy it.
Another subtlety that is often overlooked is Northbrook's initial apprehension at accepting the job of being the liaison with this royal family, at the same time he is obviously, explicitly, attracted to the regent in a way you would not expect to find in a movie of this era.
On screen, Findlay's hammy, bloated performances would be laughable if you didn't know you were watching someone acting out of the depths of his mind, which makes them both disturbing and compelling at the same time.

It makes the movie more mysterious and tense at the same time, which also really adds to the atmosphere.
I also at the same time adds to the charm of the movie and it gives B-slasher movies like this one (because let's face it, this is a B-movie, no matter how well its made) a big cult following.
The story is drawn out slowly and the island sets and backdrops are simultaneously beautiful and yet still creepy and atmospheric at the same time.

To say any more would be to spoil it, but needless to say much of the fun in Forgotten Silver comes from the fact that Peter Jackson and Costa Botes were so successful in pulling the wool over everyone's eyes while at the same time including absolutely outrageous details in McKenzie's life.
Being tired of watching U.S. detective and spy movies, with all their over used cliches (the spy who falls in love and must not, as in "The Saint", the nice looking hero who saves the free world, the Russians as being always the evil guys and sort of) all I can say about this one is that it recaptures the original meaning of detective movies, and shows us at the same time a new perspective (the troubles by keeping the detective job secret from the family, the unusual emotional ties between the assassin and a journalist, the passive role of the government in the crime, etc).
Some of the shows detail some pretty sick people, but at the same time, some of them go a little too far in their zeal to just find people to prosecute.

They made a movie which is terrifying and humorous at the same time.
It's so respectful of the genre at the same time that it plays with it... Nathan Baesel, who says he was inspired by Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter really pulls off charming and cheery -- not copying Lecter, but applying the influence to create a new and lovable serial killer (this is what makes him both funny AND creepy - it's impossible not to like him!
Wes Craven's "Scream" was a strikingly dead-on persiflage of the Slasher genre while at the same time including enough scares to become more than just a parody, but an important part of that genre itself.

For example, it's hilarious to see Tom pretending to sing "If you're ever down in Texas, look me up" and playing a guitar at the same time (while he hears the record), to seduce the cowgirl (the well known Toodles, Tom's passion), but Jerry makes the whole thing even funnier when he decides to give wings to his own sense of fun: he ruins Tom's plan by changing the speed on the record player, which causes Tom to sing very quickly and then extremely slowly (with a typical cowboy voice).

Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive.
Astro Boy is another horrible animation film from Hollywood, which is truly boring and irritating, at the same time it lacks of any creativity.I suggest you to avoid it.
And when a movie teaches you something to make you evolve,and at the same time you enjoy and spend some quality time I think I can say that the goal of the movie was accomplished,they have set up the bar very high,but still,they managed to live up to the hype...which makes this movie a classic...1996...It seems like I saw it yesterday...

At a point I felt the same intensity of watching a "certain" scene from "The Deer Hunter", at points, this film shares the same mood of the "The Deer Hunter" and "Amores Perros", but at the same time creates it's own mood.
And, yes, it probably does crib from the likes of the Great Escape (motorcycle jumps, anyone) and Bridge on the River Kwai (bridge blow-up, anyone), and at the same time it holds its own as a legitimate effort.
The great director, Lamont Johnson, ( who directed Richard Chamberlain in several episodes of Dr Kildare in the early 60s and in Wallenberg in 1985) succeeds in making a movie with a quick sequence of scenes that follow each other very smoothly but allows at the same time the actors to make great performances and fully take advantage of the dialog that sounds in some instances like a theater play... Richard Chamberlain, Karen Allen and Hal Holbrook are magnificent, sober intensity is the key word for their acting in a movie that allies hard facts of life with tenderness, romance, love and forgiveness.
I won't describe it but it will lift your heart and make you cry like a baby at the same time.
On the one hand, it is very didactic, simple, sometimes pathetic, but at the same time: Be it so.
As Good As It Gets is the worst movie of 1997 with its technical features:  Editing is the worst, screenplay is a mess, no camera aspects, no successful sound editing or mixing(no one has no idea how can a puppy murmur through a garbage chute and can be heard inside an apartment unit), art decoration has zero achievement(that's why it's a sit-com) ; at the same time As Good As It Gets is at its best for 4 great performances: Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson at the leading, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. at the supporting.
With a renewed sense of purpose, Thomas begins taking lessons from a beautiful Chinese virtuoso while, at the same time, attempting to pull away from some of the more unsavory elements of his life (including his own derelict father who he keeps having to defend against recalcitrant debtors).
He makes a morally ambiguous character both repugnant and strangely appealing at the same time.
An audio flashback has his teacher telling him, "The emotion is not very generous" and at the same time the film slips into a minor key as our emotional involvement with the character kicks in.
It never becomes overly sentimental, but at the same time all these characters are real and completely believable, just incredibly vivid characterizations.
It is a violent film, yet a humorous one at the same time, with great acting.
when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter.
The film was quite hard to digest for the simple fact that the older brother, Seita, can be easily sympathized with but at the same time, we realize that the situation he is in is his own doing.
This is a film that I hate and love at the same time.
He was looking for closure and writing a tribute to his sister at the same time.

This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.
Tasko Nacic is funny and at the same time disturbing as the monster-man-child, talking to his customers, his mother and his victims in the same plaintive, whiny voice.
Overall I thought Long Time Dead was a slightly below average horror that didn't do much for me but at the same time I have seen much worse & at least it kept me watching until the end.
The sniper rifle scene was also very humorous to me and scary at the same time.
Luis BuÃ±uel has precisely constructed a work that preys on our society's monotony, while at the same time pointing out the insanity that lies within all of us.
How these snobbish upper-crust sorts had, at the same time, a code of honor, and would fill noble places in society is an interesting question.
Also I think the same actor plays a woman at the same time.
but she also detailed what the other couple was doing on another part of the island at the same time!!

Now, after re-watching The Age of Innocence, I am sure that Scorsese has made one of the most beautiful, tragic, passionate, sensual, sexually charged screen romances ever, which is at the same time perfectly suitable for the whole family watching.
Lieberman's direction is allows the movie to move along at a good pace, allowing the movie to build slowly and the audience to get to know the characters while at the same time not being overly slow and boring.
There are a lot of laughs together with a subtext about colour not mattering, while at the same time trading on those differences, thus enabling the film to have its cake and eat it.
I think the director and writers found a happy medium that allowed issues to be raised while at the same time keeping the movie light-hearted, funny and entertaining.
If you are looking for something meaningful and entertaining at the same time, with a touch of romance and some eye candy, this is the movie for you!
It is filled with difficult scenes and ideas and certainly is not a film for the faint of heart or spirit, but at the same time it is a brave film depicting the dissociative state of sexual mind to which we've come after the influences of such thinkers as Bataille, Foucault, Derida, Gide, and others.
His interior life sustains him and the ending is uplifting and sad at the same time.
There is a bleakness to the film despite the vivid colors, but at the same time there is a sense that the surviving characters have not given up hope for the future, and the final message in this film is the same as in "Battle Royale"--Run for all you're worth.
The beauty of the movie relies on the clever photography on not going too graphic, not over emphasizing on the oppressors and at the same time does not draw too much melodramatics in form of emotional music.
That they are one at the same time cerebral, immature, literate, prankish, frightened, polished, well educated but vulnerable and inexperienced, puts them well outside the troglodyte teens that inhabit the deconstructionist zoo in most post 1970 films, (with the exception of a unfortunate and mis-placed "strip poker" sequence which violates the picture's otherwise overall mood.)
It's sweet, smart and touching all at the same time.
and at the same time twisted.
The camera-work was especially good and nauseating at the same time, just how it seems to have meant to be.
This is why the ending is gory yet touching at the same time.

In many ways, this is a plot less, jumble of the movie, but at the same time there is something really fantastic about it, and some movies are better off jumbled up cause its fitting, never more so than in the case of "Petulia."
The best drama movie of 2006, so sincere, real, intense, inspiring but at the same time challenging you to participate in the movie, you are being dragged into the movie, in the end it will not only bring happiness to your face and heart, but it will also make you a better person or at least highlight the great parts you have in your character.
Will Smith did a great job as the father trying to protect his son from their circumstances of becoming homeless as much as he can, while at the same time trying to work in the competitive world of stocks as an un-paid intern.
i did watch this to the end, while i was watching another movie at the same time on my laptop.

I will never understand how this film manages to be so cheesy yet so creepy at the same time, but Ghosthouse pulls it off with ease.
The numbers on the paper that Cage's character used to eventually work out where to go to save his son, was this their primary purpose or was it a fluke that he had the paper and his son just happened to be "chosen" at the same time.
Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.
However, I used to love getting scared and thrilled at the same time, and that's what this movie does so well for youngsters.
This film as some have noted is not only a very specific account of a possibly schizophrenic man, but also a study of urban angst, a depiction of how crazy-making urban spaces can become for every person who approaches them without armor.Michael Atkinson's statement about this is perhaps a bit too sweeping Â- "Keane" (he says) "is a painfully specific figure but at the same time a totem, lean and frightening, for a morass of modern anxieties" Â- but the borderline between Keane and us does indeed at times become hauntingly blurred.
He begins shouting at no one in particular and at the same time he begins to struggle to keep them at bay.
The movie very realistically portrays poverty and mental illness and makes you feel great compassion for William Keane at the same time that you feel frightened and uncomfortable.
They can either be out-and-out menacing, funny and stupid, or both at the same time.
The better news is that I was doing something at the same time so I didn't waste any time on it.
The premise is great, Adam West is great, and the Lookwell character is hilariously annoying and genuinely noble at the same time.
O'Brien and Smigel manage to drop in references to nearly every Quinn Martin 70s police drama while at the same time weaving a bitterly hilarious ode to the chew-em-up, spit-em-out world of Hollywood TV actors who go from being essential pop-culture icons to unemployable has-beens in what seems like weeks.
Feast is the brain child of Project Greenlight--a horror film which attempts to capture the essence of classic horror films while at the same time putting a contemporary and gory spin on things.
The film starts out with all these guys at a bar and they aren't the typical type of people hanging out at a bars either, they are a bit awkward and unreal but at the same time hilarious.
Somehow this film is creepy, suspenseful and sweet all at the same time.
It is for sure a twisted and perverse movie but at the same time it has a message and funny all at the same time.
if you really want to check something out that is different but at the same time a good movie, check this one out.
The fact is, is that the movie wasn't about Billie's making of jazz as it was about the struggles of a young black woman with a passion for singing moved by segregation and Jim crow and having to constantly adjust and reinvent herself to cope in a society that loved and hated her all at the same time.
It doesn't take away the fact that this is still a fun movie to watch, but it at the same time also prevents the movie from being a truly great one.

I saw this movie on opening day,1981.It enthralled and depressed me a little at the same time,and I could never figure out why....till now.I am an Arthurian buff without being a fanatic.I have "Knights of the Round Table","Sword of Lancelot","Excalibur",even the obscure"Young Arthur,Warlord"[from british TV.]
I really liked it, scary and violent at the same time.
It creates a nice sense of its own world, but at the same time its not wholly believable.
One of the best love stories this year; gripping, touching and warm at the same time.
The place was noisy, many people talking at the same time and the movie began... slowly people was silent.
Double Indemnity, Ace in the Hole, Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch, The Apartment, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Witness for the Prosecution, Sabrina and Sunset Boulevard all have a great comforting quality at the same time they are helmed by the silent man behind the camera who you never think about, the sublime master of mood swings, not to mention he consistently shows his strong sense of the importance of a memorable closing line, closing shot.
His character is a genius who is out of control, but Conti's talent depicts his situation as comic and tragic at the same time-no small feat-- while being absolutely sympathetic.
I didn't particularly care for the plot, and it is ironic how the film tries to show that women can be independent (a big theme for the 1930's) but at the same time it portrays white women much more superior to black women.
All at the same time!
The film is awful.But it's awfully funny at the same time!The producers didn't want it to be funny,but it most certainly is.There are scenes in this that have to bee seen to be believed!Spoiler alert!Best bits:a)The elephant stampede,b)The tiger attack,c)The scene in which Evelyn Kraft runs through the forest,d)The scene in which the all-powerful monster gets some oranges thrown right into his face...There are more,quite possibly even funnier moments,but I don't want to give them away for those who haven't see it yet.This is the epitome of so-bad-it's-good cinema.It's a King Kong-Mighty Joe Young-Tarzan-Godzilla RIP-OFF!Seriously,this film is ridiculously bad.That's exactly what makes it worth seeing.It is the best COMEDY off all time.The effects are bad,the acting is bad,the "script" is bad...Please,do yourself a favor and go buy it.You won't get bored watching it(If you like these kind of movies).Hell,it's even WORSE than "Plan 9 from outer space"!
It's one of very few movies out there which can appeal to a five-year old and an eighty-five-year old at the same time, on different levels.
Though the movie is set in the real Ireland and not some fairytale facsimile thereof, writer and star Barry McEvoy is still guilty of spinning a totally fatuous yarn that strains a bit too hard for whimsy while at the same time never managing to find the right tone; set in Belfast "sometime during the 1980s," the movie revolves around two friends and barbers at an asylum, one Catholic and the other Protestant, who get the rights to the only hairpiece company in Northern Ireland, and thereby hangs our tale.
release dreadful films at the same time as guaranteed big sellers of a similar genre?).
Brittany Murphy portrays a girlfriend who is crafty and intuitive but at the same time clueless.
I can't really recommend the show, but at the same time I don't think you'll pluck your eyes out of you see it.
If you want to watch a movie that gives a more balanced portrayal of both sides, along with some important insights into the Vietnam conflict, and at the same time portrays the true horror of the Vietnam war without dishonoring the men who were forced to fight in it, then give Tunnel Rats a miss and watch We Were Soldiers instead.
Instead, the happy threesome decide to blow off the strange phenomena with a bottle of Xanax while turning a blind eye and deaf ear at the same time.

Imagine yourself watching a film with only dialogue, and then at the same time listening to music from a totally different context.
Manages to be both finicky and slapdash at the same time.
But more than one grenade thrown at the same time will get you a result.
The Last Mimzy doesn't pander needlessly to its core audience, but at the same time it also has a good accomplishment in that it also has an appeal to adults, or at least those that have passed that age of adolescence and look back on childhood with levels of nostalgia and relief that it's over.
I thought the kids' interactions were very true to life -- sniping and fussing at each other and at the same time being close and loving.
While intensive drug abuse, cheap rock n' roll and sex is going on the director shows confrontational situations within families, adolescents that have everything and nothing at the same time and Micky Roorke, that was probably in this film as a source of information about the 80s cocaine as the new trend and career downfall.
In 1525 (the year that Charles V armies capture Francis in Pavia, which occurs at the same time in the episode) Portugal didn't have a sick old king.
He died 10 years before king Francis was captured in Pavia by Charles V armies (not at the same time, as we are shown in the 4th episode).
A college-campus Casanova (Jones, who looks a bit like James Dean) keeps three girlfriends at the same time, and when they find out about each other they lock him up in an attic, where they take "revenge" on him by alternately having sex with him - thereby draining him of his energy, will-power, or something like that...
The writer hasn't stop for a second to think of his writing, basically writing the movie and perhaps reading a book on how to write movies at the same time.
"Kissing..." tries to be a '40's-style romantic comedy, a modern sex comedy and a sit-com at the same time.
Then I wouldn't have spent so many sleepless nights...."   The plot seems cruel and creepy, yet too sit-com-like at the same time.
One wonders why this movie exists, but at the same time I have to say it wasn't anywhere near laugh-out-loud terrible (though some people seem to think so).
James Ryan also sports an English accent that indicates a sophisticated intelligence which makes it hard to buy that he could be a killing machine at the same time.
CSI Miami is a much better show because it's their job to do forensics and they're also police officers at the same time.
The acting is good (but at the same time depressing), and the music is beautifully haunting (but once again sad).
I didn't exactly hate it but at the same time I certainly didn't like it either.
The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat.
I adore this show for being painfully raw and oddly sensitive at the same time.
How could 4 people in completely different places be singing the same song at the same time.
This is so horrible yet laughable at the same time.
I can't in good heart call it a bad film but at the same time I can't really say I enjoyed it when I didn't.
Something creepy seems to be going on in town at the same time - his cousin is found hanged from a tree in the cemetery; necrophiliac grave-digger Igor (Paul Naschy) starts to act more outlandishly than usual; Aunt Nadia seduces and copulates with young Serge; a doctor residing in the house starts to show off his experiments to reanimate dead animals; and uncle's corpse occasionally goes missing as if it's got up and begun walking of its own accord.
Firstly, Naschy as the necrophiliac grave digger is hilarious and disturbing (at the same time) in all his scenes.
(r#31)  How can a movie be hyperactive, slick and flashy, yet boring, mind-numbing and comatose at the same time?
Women are treated as fodder to either slap around or grind up against (sometimes at the same time) all to a soundtrack of nameless rappers inserted at appropriate moments so that the white kids can know what its like to be African American.
After all, the Cold War was heating up; at the same time organized crime was growing, so who better than the FBI, DEA, Treasury Men, et al.
"The Hills Have Eyes Part 2" is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters,who are attacked by cannibals:Pluto(Michael Berryman) and his uncle Reaper(John Bloom).Absolutely no suspense,even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks(although there's a nice throat slashing).The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid.The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb,but also hilarious at the same time.Avoid this junk like the plague.Not recommended.
The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat.
**SPOILERS** Highly confusing and extremely muddled made for TV suspense/thriller that has two stories that come across as if they were two independent films playing together on the same screen at the same time.
"A Kiss so Deadly" is only worth your time watching it because it's just too bad to be true and at the same time too good for bad-movie fans, in a cheesy and unintentionally funny sort of way, to be bad.
Once again, Ford plays someone who has to rescue his family from danger and get the bad guys at the same time.
He should have jumped right into it, making everything gory and shocking and funny at the same time (for instance, there could have been a freaky if hilarious scene where Angus could have mated with the pure white sheep, instead of the one-off "animal husbandry" line).
But at the same time there is a murder on the loose who is out to kill as many of the models as possible.
What a hoot but at the same time pathetic.
15 minutes pass, you're annoyed and nodding off at the same time, and you wonder if you should hit Fast-Forward or Eject.
She seemed to be in love, but at the same time enjoying moments with Arthur.
It's believable at the same time unbelievable.
And at the same time, I found myself enjoying it enough to sit through all three hours of it.
It wants to be satirical, farcical, and dark all at the same time.
If you're very interested in the old Hells Angels (pre 60's) and think that smelling bad, looking bad, drinking and driving at the same time is cool then this film is most certainly for you.
What I find amazing is that these films were produced at the same time the original "Star Wars" Trilogy was filmed, and the difference between the two series is dumbfounding.
Taken straight from "actual files of the Hollywood Vice Squad",Penelope Spheeris' fourth film tries to be both a comedy and serious drama at the same time,and fails miserably at both.The comedy doesn't work,and all the actors look like they're acting underwater,so the viewer ends up not caring what happens to any of the characters.This movie is like watching a train wreck in progress,without the adrenaline flow.
Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is again called to solve the case, and at the same time driving Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) insane.
I'm sure Blake Edwards wanted to make something special for his good old friend and at the same time also use this movie as a set up for the next sequel "Curse of the Pink Panther", which was also shot at the same time as this movie and is therefor also featuring most of the same actors.
Announcing at the same time that he changed the script from younger British boy to older American boy to avoid having yet another Harry... Well, Susan Cooper's book series the Rising of the Dark sequence was written long before Harry Potter and it has all the material for a good movie.
______________________________ EDIT:Okay,I'm past the half way mark,and all I have to say is,this is just about as boring as Faces of Death.It's like watching a whole bunch of FOD shorts throw together.A guy blew his brains out with a hand gun,race track accidents,more autotopsies,a sex change operation,brain surgery,crime scene pictures and so on.The final clips shown in the movie,was the classic tourist killed by lions and one last autotopsy.This movie was a big disappointment.It's an okay mondo,but nothing even close to a snuff.If you want a good mondo,go watch the Guinea Pig series.It will make you sick,but keep you watching at the same time.
It is touching and very funny at the same time.
Rickman didn't even bother to try and sound northern, whilst at times I thought Hartnett was trying to sound more like he was from Ireland, Italy or Kentucky than Keighley - sometimes all three at the same time!
And sometimes you'll have to shoot at them in different directions, because they can attack you from the air, water and jungle at the same time.
Having said that, there was a lot going for this...some nice shock surprises (albeit totally unbelievable, if the killer is supernatural like Michael Meyers it needs to be established, how  else could he be EVERYwhere at the same time, and know the kids' next moves before they make them?).
Its in keeping with the plot, but at the same time I'd have liked to see something else.

There are scenes in this movie both comic and unsettling at the same time.
All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by Miss Monroe proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time.
Ansara gives a surprisingly good performance considering the material, but even his Indian magic isn't enough to fend off an evil Felix Silla from summoning the Devil himself, who can only be defeated by turning on every computer in the hospital at the same time and Susan Strasberg getting her tits out in a vaguely New Age Meets 2001 finale.
Ms. Sprecher and her sister Karen wrote a delicious movie that is on the one level a satire about the way "temps" are used in an office, and it's at the same time, a character study about these four souls at the center of the movie.
He ends up falling in love with a her and at the same time he changes her reputation as an actor to be a real star.It turns out that his buddy plays a joke right back and well.... you should watch it.
And then they followed it up with a sequel, Urban Legends 2 : Final Cut which was absolutely awful but rather amusing at the same time, mainly due to the superb Loretta Devine who is always worth watching.
I thought thought we'd be seeing a bio-pic on Monica Lewinsky I seriously did but instead found myself watching a black comedy road movie   This is a co-production between the BBC and the Irish film council made at the same time when British film production was picking up thanks to TRAINSPOTTING and THE FULL MONTY .
Non Ho Sonno feels like a commercial attempt at making a film that utilises what Argento is best known for but at the same time he was under pressure to make it a success, while this is undeniably a Giallo I felt that it tried to incorporate elements from American teen horror that was proving very successful at the time like Scream (1996), I know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend (1998), Final Destination (2000) & their various sequels & imitators.
It does however have the feel of The New Addams Family, and indeed, coming out at the same time as that series, it seems that this was released to promote and be an introduction to that series.
She can give us a wonderful display of mixed emotions....laughing and crying at the same time with a tear-stained cheek.
We are in a sense encouraged to follow Chucky and still despise him at the same time.
It was so bad, i wanted to laugh and cry at the same time.
THere is SO MUCH the movie runs together and leaves out at the same time.
Technically Please Don't Eat My Mother is an absolute mess of a film, the acting is of amateur level, the special effects are terrible as the plant looks like it's made of paper mache by five year old children & their mates obviously composed the music which seems like various instruments randomly playing at the same time, the cinematography is as basic, bland & static as I've ever seen & the direction is unimaginative failing to inject any personality, charm, entertainment, humour or pace into an already very thin concept.
There is a funny sequence, and at the same time totally idiotic, when Caleb pulls a gun on Landau and forces him to pay him money that he owe's, after Landau has given Caleb the money Caleb hands Landau the gun!
Everything sucks, from the 'mother who has sex in her daugthers bed with 4 guys at the same time', through the 'robbing When Harry Met Sally thing' right until the Dutch actors playing Americans, and making a crappy job of it.
Stryker is coming back to his hometown at the same time a maniacal cult is cutting up the locals.
Rebecca Demornay is so cool in this movie, she's pretty and kicks butt at the same time.
This is a film with great actors who are becoming elderly and looking for a pay check and it is great to see these great veteran actors performing and at the same time it is rather sad to see at what steps they all take to make a buck.
The fact that Mae appears to have dunked her head in a bowl of make up and is filmed through what appears to be guaze seems to indicate that all others concerned were at least trying to take pity on the poor woman while at the same time humoring her.
Firstly it has terrible animation, the animation looks as if it was made at the same time as say "The Aristocats" which was made in 1970 and the animation in that looks better than Rock a Doodle's.
I suppose this premise isn't inherently the worst thing on earth, but the execution is horrendous - it's amoral, boring, and irritating all at the same time, which is a pretty unique combination.
It actually is just confusing and predictable at the same time.
They would mumble their lines or deliver them like they were stand alone lines that had nothing what-so-ever to do with the other person talking at the same time.
They finish their books around the same time, and dare to submit them only by dropping them into the mailbox at the same time.
An overbearing Eric Freeman takes over the psychotic mantle, and is unbeatably awful and at the same time comical.
Which is it, and don't say both cause it's just too unbelievable they worked at the same time.
Take a load of this, they all play two generations of themselves, sometimes at the same time (OK, the James Caan with the graying hair is the dad, and the one who looks not a year younger, with the red hair is the son.
(What I know of city issues in Toronto come from my niece and nephew that live up there)   watching the move was refreshing because it really is a remarkable work of art, but at the same time I was frustrated because, I said to myself damn why is it they never try to show you Canada from this perspective  I would definitely recommend this movie here are some links about flick: ledaserenesnewz1.blogspot.com, awintertale.ca  Best thing about it was the Director and two of the actors were in the audience.
The climax and resolution of the film leave you spent, unsure of what to feel next other than anxious, a little "mad", and exposed at the same time.
The boys' language is grammatically correct and unprovocative, yet at the same time slightly "off."
There were a lot of parts where Sissel's character was overacted and boring at the same time, and this especially made me not like the movie.
I didn't think a movie could be disgusting and boring at the same time, but LOTD manages.
After the funny black humour and over the top gore of Flesh for Frankenstein, which was made at the same time with some of the same cast and crew, I was expecting more of the same.
Shore is like that class clown who tries hard to annoy everyone in sight, yet at the same time tries hard to be liked.

Ia m trying g to watch the movie at the same time I am writing this comment.
After THE BLUE ANGEL and MOROCCO, DISHONORED was a bit of a come down for me, in my opinion it is the one film that Dietrich made with Joseph Von-Sternberg that has the least meaning, Publicity hyped it up because it was released at the same time as MGMs MATA HARI with Greta Garbo, unfortunately for Dietrich she was no match for Garbo and MATA HARI wins hands down.

The hip 70s score is also incredibly funky and spooky at the same time.

Diesel 10 is a great villain, he's funny and evil at the same time, and there are enough engines and "in jokes" to keep most children amused for hours.
It's hard to describe my feelings about the movie, because I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen, yet at the same time I suggest people check it out (if you get the chance; don't spend a hell of a lot of money to purchase a copy of it!).

The first half of the film dragged mercilessly, while at the same time facets of the plot were not fully developed, making the story line weak and non-sensical and the characters shallow.

Unfortunately, I suspect that the author of such one-sided point of view cannot tolerate anything that does not come out of Hollywood whose films are indeed well-structured, well-paced and contain humour but at the same time are mostly idiotic, shallow and meaningless.
As the movie progresses it's informative of the movie making process, but at the same time it's emotional in the sense that we are following the hopes and dreams of all these extras.
The plot is so tight, story arc so suspenseful, acting so affecting, and the scenes so horrifying and heart-wrenching at the same time, I'm completely captivated just 3 episodes into the show and ready to buy the entire series.
Mathew Lillard's character is somewhat unlikable, but well-acted, and has some redeeming qualities at the same time.

Some scenes struck me as just right and way over done at the same time (the onanistic football watching scene is a perfect example, too much but there was something about it that I just loved).
This animated movie from Dreamworks is visually stunning and at the same time hilarious.
The story and dialogue are unique and refreshing, but at the same time it almost feels wasted because half the audience will get a kick out of it.
Such easy to understand and digest TV shows around at the same time like MURDER SHE WROTE and MATLOCK were designed to appeal to similar tastes, but with BURKE'S LAW you had to have a more fine tuned appreciation of wit, well timed sarcasm and style plus a tongue in cheek sense of humor to fully appreciate the gifts and sheer force of personality and presence that Gene Barry brought to the screen in his role and to enjoy the campy proceedings at hand.
it's fantasy and reality at the same time.

This really is a great movie from 1933 and very ahead of its time.A young woman who is in love with two friends and is obviously sleeping with both of them must have shocked a more prudish audience back then i think it had been censored for a while.But never mind we can view it today knowing that there are a lot of gems like this one waiting to be rediscovered,its a shame that so many of the films made from this era are now lost.A modern audience wouldn't turn away from this film,as you don't expect a film from this era to be saucy and it is.Gary Cooper was a very nice actor and you can see why he was so popular back then,he had a very unusual style of being very masculine and at the same time very sensitive,he was great at picking the more complex roles,his characters weren't as one dimensional as most actors of this era.He was easily one of the most interesting actors of the 30s,this i would say was his best era in films.Unfortunately A Farewell To Arms is the only film you can buy in the UK from this era,i don't know why.Its sad that he is becoming a forgotten actor,i think we must have lost our imaginations a bit as we keep harbouring on with the John Waynes and the Cary Grants,and forget there were other classic actors around that don't deserve to be forgotten yet.

The music by Georges Van Parys is poignantly nostalgic and at the same time entertaining and light.
I do like bits of it, and there are bits I'm not crazy about, but at the same time any film that makes me want to watch it again (even if its to work out what I just saw) is worth a shot.
This is a very predictable movie yet at the same time very entertaining.
i don't know about you guy's but this movie was awesome.also the message that the movie is trying to pass is the reality of our life's.the end of the movie where bless is being killed by the cop and after that it says "you have to make the right decision" it's the best ending and at the same time the most touch full ending that i've ever seen.
She is reduced to one mannerism, an "oh dear oh dear oh dear" or some slight variation, while at the same time hovering near fondly remembered grandmotherisms.
Technically La Semana del Asesino is basic but professional enough, Iglesia films it in real locations which add to it's grittiness & credibility while at the same time giving the film a nice atmosphere throughout, the cinematography is OK, the music forgettable while the special effect's aren't going to impress too many people these days they are good enough.
It's really hard to count this as a definite flaw when it does so much for the movie, but at the same time it is obvious that cons of the dialogue: (A)covering too much essential material too briefly (B)statements that are too long and elaborate for the given actors to do them justice (C)unrealistic detail and stream of conscious in the character's statements; out-weigh the positive aspects: (A)humorous anecdotes and tangents expressed through tirades (B)unique character interaction.

What I wasn't prepared for was the overall sadness of the movie, sad in that here is a man who genuinely has a vision and a desire and the determination to try to make something of himself but whose affliction is at the same time both the wellspring of his inspiration and the source of his inability to achieve his goals.

Batman does more research into this mysterious figure but at the same time an old love interest of his comes back to Gotham, flashbacks of his past haunt him.
But, besides of all the ideological background from this film, Traitor work perfectly as an ambiguous and incredibly tense thriller, which has perfectly developed characters who occupy their ambiguous positions without revealing their clear porpoises, provoking a delicious suspense on the spectator, at the same time it is difficult to know where the story will take us.Nachmanoff's direction is sober, something which works very well on the context from this movie.The performances are excellent, not only the one from the great Don Cheadle, but also the ones from the supporting cast, where the members who mostly stand out are SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui as a terrorist and Jeff Daniels as a security contractor, which is a role where this underrated actor shows his wide range, which goes more far away than the family films where we usually see him.The only fail I found on this movie is that the ending could have been a little more polished.But, in spite of that, I recommend Traitor with a lot of enthusiasm, because it is an excellent movie which does not only entertain very much, but which also leaves the spectator thinking.
I'm not sure exactly how Samir pulls it offÂand this is probably a first in the history in the fight against terrorismÂhe manages to arrange for 50 would-be suicide bombers to be on the same bus and they all blow themselves up at the same time.
but in this film, it seems like it takes forever to get to the point (the CD) and all the time up until that point seems kinda boring but at the same time entertaining.
Funny and going deep at the same time, "Burn" presents a series of character studies (hence the thought of MoliÃ¨re), in the context of mannered yet true social interactions (Waugh).
Going backwards and forwards at the same time.
This film won the Academy Award for 1970 as Best Documentary for Michael Wadliegh as he uses split screen imagery for many scenes capturing different events at the same time and different angles of same events.
The film is an awful mess but at the same time I found it fascinating.
I think Jason is a good actor, especially for having to direct the film at the same time and do his own action stunts.
Brook Shields is good even if sometimes she looks like playing "Suddenly Susan" again, but her character is always surrounded by a lot of happenings being hard to follow all the issues at the same time.
You just can't wait for the nerve racking scene to finally end where at the same time the director of the movie, Jacques Tourneur, keeps you totally in the dark to what's happening off screen.
Of course, stepping in the Guinness book of world records is not exactly enough to create a memorable destiny, and choosing the pornographic field attracts heaps of hungry viewers that cannot exactly be called reputable admirers, and yet...I think movie managed to show us in Annabella a pretty unique and sympathetic character, at the same time excessive, provocative but also sincere and fragile.
She pokes fun at every aspect of herself, her life and past experience, but the genius is that at the same times she's broken out of the typecast...  She has proved, thus far, that she can be a strong part of the creative process that yields great television.
The virus is in fact a metaphor for greed, as it arrives at the same time as a development corporation is evicting lower income Bronx tenants via "emiment domain."
Makes you feel depressed and amused at the same time.
Disappointing 1957 musical where within an 1 hour and 40 minutes, Jane Powell gets engaged to 3 guys at the same time.
In my opinion, he had a big depression, he was forced to go to the psychiatrist who happened to be his father's friend, he abused him and he wasn't able to talk about it with his father even though it seemed that he was a good father and was open to hear everything his son wanted to say The boy felt too bad and desperate that he prefer to die than to speak... On the other hand, there's people who told me that they think the boy was depressed and forced to go with his father's friend and when he started abusing him, he started to feel dirty but at the same time he liked it, so he got confussed by the feeling of being gay, that he commited suicide.
When you watch this movie, you have a sense of magic and a sense of sadness at the same time, because the Beatles were about to break up, and yet creating great new music at the same time.
But it is also slick and polished at the same time and nothing sort of fall into your eyes as irregular, it's just the feeling that this isn't how it would be looking in real life.
The acting, so atrocious that it is funny and embarrassing for you at the same time.
Maybe a lot of people over the years have seen nothing but a reflection of his TV work, but I thought William Bendix was very impressive as a man who is at the same time savvy enough to run a saloon in the waterfront district of San Francisco and charming enough to be believable as a family man.
I thought this movie was fun to watch while at the same time provided plenty of healthy messages for kids/teens without overloading them or taking away from the movie.
I was very afraid as a child about Kato and all that dark atmosphere near his castle, not to mention the kids who were kidnapped and transformed into a bird; the last scene where Kato dies was terrifying, and at the same time very satisfying.
And that ending, with that traveling den of iniquity makes you feel both sorry for the two and at the same time you feel that these two people have found something that they have been looking for.
(Yes that's what I said).The themes are very dark and at the same time this is a very loving film.It is certainly a challenging film and strangely being set in South Korea has many European sensibilities.If you think the world can be explained in terms of black and white then this is not an easy film.
Ever since the holiday special "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving",first aired on CBS-TV in November of 1973,this was one of many "Peanuts" inspired specials that brings out the kid in all of us,but at the same time have a message in between the lines.
i dislike this film but at the same time i love it, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has made up his story line with fascinating camera angles and shots which have even made the biggest movies look dull.
The pivotal scene in which Madeleine's father discovers his daughters affair, while at the same time Madeleine learns of Emile's death shows Lean's dramatic staging at its best.
The whole film is a new trend which reflects the history of Egypt in 75 years but at the same time it is not a summer commercial movie like the audience expect .
What I like most about this movie is that it opens a window into an unknown world for me, that of relations between men an women in modern Egypt, and it does so in a style that is at the same time sumptuous an unfamiliar.
This movie encourages people to go and search for their own ideals and ambitions, and at the same time let them know that despite every kind of fame and riches in the world, nothing can be more important and precious than the love from your own family.
The mood of the movie simply progressed with ease and gentleness, and at the same time hurled you into a world many never would have thought of.
The world of a normal young girl, who has to go through an unusual dilemma, because both of her parents are deaf, and at the same time face the difficulties of life, experiencing her own true self.
Emil makes a complete jerk of himself in him trying to be a spy for the Fatherland and at the same time blowing his cover, by bragging about it, and not realizing that the Fatherland, wanting nothing at all to do with this nut, had him unceremoniously kicked out!
Where at the same time having him try to destroy, in his own childless way, the country and its people that did nothing but help him in every way it and they could despite his dislike of both of them.
:)  With so many TV programs trying to "buy" an audience with "sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect)" screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence!
Among many other epic movies that depict the period is IVANHOE based on Sir Walter Scott's novel being at the same time a remake of the 1952 classic Hollywood production.
He's constantly asleep or spilling coffee, sometimes multitasking by doing both at the same time.
