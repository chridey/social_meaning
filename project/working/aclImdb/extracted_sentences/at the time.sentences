While I'm sure that the gigantic scope and vivid color made for a great experience at the time, it often doesn't stand up today.
All three of the people that Day, Cagney, and Mitchell portray were still alive at the time that Love Me or Leave me was being filmed.
Holden and Mitchum both do very well in typical roles for both at the time.
I know at the time people were worried about the subject matter.
This forth and final series is perhaps the best of all the Black Adder episodes; it is also more of a tragi-comedy than just plain old slapstick perhaps because at the time (1989) the events of WW1 were very much in the minds of a lot of people, whether it be surviving soldiers or relatives.
There are flashbacks to failures of the 4 young men that show the frustrations that got them where they are at the time they decided take matters into their own hands.
Quentin Masters' spare, sharply observant direction wisely avoids the usual stylistic overkill excesses which mar many counterculture films made at the time, opting instead for a more timeless, largely unadorned and plainly naturalistic style which has dated pretty well.
The story is great, played out with a solid cast of familiar A list Kung Fu actors from the Shaw's studio at the time.
And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho, and heck I think Anna came back for him, granted he did get hit by a huge log, but who the hell else could it be.
It looks like a shot from Die Hard (which wasn't made at the time!)
She was a teenager at the time, and she once told me that no one believed that the war would actually escalate so far, until before they realized it, a battle was being fought in the neighboring town a few miles away.

I wish there had been something like this when I was younger rather than my 70 year old music teacher who had no idea what was going on in the music I was listening to at the time other than the certainty that "that's not music that's just loud banging and screaming!"
Here, we are told that the time-travel window to the past is just ten minutes long - something to do, we find out later, with not having enough power.
Sure, it might be a bit windy in the cabin, but even that shouldn't be a problem due to the low altitude at which they were flying at the time.
They even came to Southwestern College (a school I was attending at the time) to shoot some scenes.
It was critically blasted when it was originally released because of the "high" cost at the time.

Her death 18 years before Peterson's trial was found by investigation at the time to be by natural causes.
The chemistry between Donald Sutherland as the leader of a secret government agency and his son, played by Eric Thal (an unknown at the time) is actually quite good.
It's clearly a Corman knock-off of earlier brother avenges brother efforts, but it's head and shoulders above most of the crumby video fodder that was being fed to the hungry market at the time.
Watching these two train, fight, and of course bond, was surprisingly effective, considering how badly written and acted most of these cheapy fight vehicles were at the time.
The chemistry between Donald Sutherland as the leader of a secret government agency and his son, played by Eric Thal (an unknown at the time) is actually quite good.
i mean, a comedian most kids didn't know of at the time, dressing up as some iconic people kids don't know exist, (Quint, Tony Montana)and a scene in which a bumbling idiot and his grandfather disguss the size of a woman's ass?
I don't really think they meant it to be awful, I mean the story sounded good, I'm sure...on paper..to a bunch of film executives who were drunk at the time they heard it.
I ran cinemas at the time and the audiences let us know their irritation at his bad films well known.
The star power at the time of Steve from 90210 is not enough to keep this movie going  The storyline is a good idea and could be done at least as good today and that was the one thing that had me up late watching this on TV but in the end a great idea poorly executed makes you more mad then a bad idea done well.
Ren doesn't fit in with the "wierdos" of the town except he finds a friend in Willard played by the very missed Chris Penn, who was skinny at the time.
Not quite the same as that where I wasn't dancing with anyone at the time, but the girl I loved and still love was, and we maintained eye contact despite her dancing with someone else.
Senator McGovern is a spry 83 years old at the time of this review, with an intellect as sharp as ever.
Therefore, actual members of the political scene at the time interact with star Michael Murphy as if he's a real presidential nominee, and the viewer is never sure what action is authentic and what is staged.
As for the past comments on stereotypes and lack of plot, this movie was designed to be a spoof of the Bruce Lee/martial arts movies at the time.
It turned out to be nothing short of a well-balanced, historically correct film that arouses great curiosity about what went on in the streets of Budapest (and elsewhere in Hungary) in October and November 1956, and in my mind provokes enormous sympathy for the Hungarian civilians at the time, and the country in general.
The observer is carried from one realistic scene to the another as quickly as the bewildering swiftness of the revolution must have unfolded at the time.
Although I don't recall much of the plot, and perhaps didn't even grasp it completely at the time, a few scenes are simply as etched in my brain: The scene where they struggle to repair the radio with graphite from a pencil.
(The fact that he was undergoing painful radium treatment at the time may have colored his words.)
Just look at the time we spend watching television or listening to the radio.
With some film from the Louisiana maneuvers, at the time the largest combat training exercise in Army history, the thin and predictable plot develops to the singing/marching end as the now ready recruits prepare to take their places in line units.
Later, there is a short scene of some of the settlers playing cards, which seems superfluous at the time, but it pays off towards the end when one of the men is killed, the cards spilling from his hand as he falls.
The series is not only a truthful rendition of mid-century Denmark from 1929 to 1947, but also a documentation of Danish self-understanding in the 1980'es - at the time of Danmarks Radios broadcasting monopoly Â and the series itself was, and still is, an integral part of the ongoing formation of the national self-understanding (of which we seem to have a LOT!
Was this done by the director because of the Hays Code and how did the public react to all the innuendo about infidelity in the film at the time of release?
What struck me so powerfully was that Weill's music never fit into what anybody would mistake as a 'musical' or 'opera' or 'pop', but amalgamated them all in an attempt to bridge art with the politics that surrounded him at the time.
By all accounts a flop at the time of it's release, it has become the hardest to see of all William Castle's movies.
The actress, Aoi Miyazaki also played one of the leads for Nana 1 ( They changed her for Nana 2 because she was shooting tada kimi wo at the time) The third one is the perfect girl.
And I think at the time of this release we had gotten "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Star Wars" so our expectation levels were running higher for "special effects" and "whimsy" than this.
Its creator, Robert Benton, freely admitted at the time that he intended this to be an homage to Hitchcock, and he's largely succeeded, right down to the cool, mysterious blonde female with a troubled past and the detective who is drawn to her, and the balletic, deliberate pacing that accentuates the suspense and tension, almost to a fault.
In many ways THE RED BERET is much more enjoyable than most of the British war movies at the time probably down to the fact that it`s made in glorious technicolor rather than monochrome and I`ll probably be accused of being a heretic by saying that it`s more enjoyable than the depressing BAND OF BROTHERS a mini series that has a lot in common with THE RED BERET   * Watch the scene where Major Snow walks into the office and throws his hat onto a hat stand .
The reality of it was all too real for me, as I knew first hand the sub-zero temperatures and high gale winds that were present at the time of this accident.
My Dad was sixty, at the time, and not prone to liking many movies.
Good lord, this is just a pathetic waste of celluloid (or whatever film was made of at the time).
Maybe it seemed a good idea at the time.
Also, most of the cast perpetuate the stereotyping at the time - that of blacks being simpleminded human beings.
This is an Oscar worthy performance by Rex Ingram, one of many black actors at the time who seldom received decent film work from Hollywood.
Meting Laural would certainly be motivation in itself, cuz Kate Ross was still a doll at the time of the movies' production.
When the captain learned that the time vortex was actively pursuing the ship and escape was impossible, he recalled his men in order to avoid stranding them in time.
I saw this movie a few times in the theater in 1980, when I was 12, and at the time it was pretty much utterly awesome.
I think the first time I saw this movie was when it first made the cable circuit, I think I was seven or eight at the time.
Develpoed quite a cult following and thanks for the support of me (at the time just a new AF model) then and in my career that has followed.
He was only 38 at the time but had begun drinking in the afternoon, causing problems on the set, what with multiple retakes and a major binge that lasted several weeks.
And although it was said at the time that he was slowing down and that he hit the booze while filming there is no evidence of it on screen.
The stunning blonde beauty Madeline Carroll (she would later say this was her favorite role) was the most successful actress in England at the time.
His casting was even better, he only had the very best available cast at the time.
It shows us the creative work that could be done at the time, by hugely talented artists, long before the advent of zoom lenses and computer graphics.
I watched this film a few years ago with my little brother, who was 8 years old at the time and only watched Disney.
It's been a few years now since this was filmed and at the time there were big issues about the United States involvement with the Iraq war and Madonna own thoughts are aired.
Aimed as a rival to the BBC's Doctor Who, the Boswell's and excellent television writer Bruce Stewart produced something entirely different from what was available on British television at the time.
Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson was one of the funniest men around at the time.
He was one of the few African-Americans of his day who was able through sheer talent to rise above the racist Hollywood stereotyping rampant in the media at the time.
A far-fetched fantasy adventure at the time of it's making, The Omega Man now seems to have uncannily anticipated the major political themes of life in the early Twenty-First Century.
Philip Bosinney is described as a little older than June - well, Janet Leigh was 21 or so at the time of the filming and probably playing an 18-year-old.
The movie is very timely in that it involves the Breeder's Cup, which, at the time of this writing, is coming up this weekend.
But just watch the movie and you might disagree with this, since all you think about at the time is "will World War III start over a snowball fight?
But the films shocking subject matter and startling imagery were too rich a combination for audiences at the time.
The verrismo genre was new at the time; in 2000 it doesn't have the same impact that it did when Open City, Bicycle Thief, La Strada, et al were all showing at about the same time, and showing us that there was a true, artistic alternative to Hollywood pap.
It's an amazing performance, especially when you consider she was 18 at the time!!
The Then Secretary of Defense James Vincent Forrestal, Eugune Roche, was reported to have had a major hand in the Roswell Investagation back in 1947 that at the time was classified above Top Secret by the newly formed CIA.
Unfortunately, Splash did not make a big splash at the time of its release.
One top film critic at the time commented that 'Picnic' with all its ethereal mystery was Weir's take on sci-fi movies, while 'Cars' was an allegory of the vampire movie.
Remember Pius XII was Pope at the time and he was a staunch anti-Communist.
Even at the time it probably had this resonance, if more faintly, since sodomy, atheism and Communism made up the unholy, if unspoken, triad of the times (aka: moral turpitude).
The story is true as well as the fact that news of the battle was radio broadcast to some of the world at the time of action.
Poland had been overrun by the Nazis and the British and French forces were on the continent safely behind the Maginot line or so they thought at the time.
But the Graf Spee headed for Montevideo which was neutral territory at the time.
Maybe today it looks like child abuse to some people but it was probably common enough at the time.
"Public Enemy," however, was a bigger-budget production, directed by William Wellman, and it contained all the elements of successÂ It is the story of two brothers who become Chicago booze barons in the Twenties... One was Cagney, the other Edward WoodsÂ   It is sometimes claimed that the story of "Public Enemy" is based on that of "Little Hymie" Weiss, leader of the North Side Chicago gang after the murder of Dion O'Banion by the Capones in 1924Â What is more likely is that the Cagney characterization is based on "Little Hymie"; the plot itself is pure fictionÂ   When Cagney, in his striped pajama, sat opposite Mae Clarke at breakfast and decided he had had enough of this boring broad, he wasted no timeÂ He picked up half a grapefruit and planted it full into Clarke's faceÂ It was a piece of screen action which has lasted down the years as the ultimate in violence from the gangster to his mollÂ   Of course, it isn't Â it just seems that wayÂ Since then gir1s have been slapped, kicked, beaten up, run over, shot, stabbed and raped, all in the tradition of mobster violenceÂ   But at the time this scene was daring, and the more daring because it was totally unexpectedÂ We remember Mae Clarke in "Public Enemy," yet forget that Jean Harlow was in it, tooÂ There may have been good reasonÂ The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1934, commented: "The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the role of a gangster's mistress."
Crawford's singing voice is dubbed by an emphatic singer named India Adams, not the worst offense at the time since such lip-syncing was pervasive.
(Crawford was 49 at the time.)
The use of "B" list actors and borrowing computer equipment that was old at the time doesn't really detract from the story.
A classic of science fiction and the paranoid political thrillers prevalent at the time: chilling in its implications and persuasively presented, the film makes for intelligent if demanding viewing.
Lots of familiar faces too (Marion Ross, William Schallert)although at the time it wasn't exactly a big-name cast.
Notably absent is the crummy acting and gags that have marred many zombie movies...I was 17 when this one was made and I don't recall it playing in theaters at the time.
But what is so radical in the 1990-version is the character of Barbara (played-wonderfully by Patricia Tallman), who is assertive and a genuine-survivor, a big-step even for-Romero at the time.
Not in who the killer is but what he does when he sees that his act as a fine and upright German patriot and General, the youngest in the German Army at the time he committed his horrific crimes, is about to be exposed!
And what happens with crimes that are government policy at the time.
His appearance adds nothing to the story, and the only reason for him being here at all was presumably in order to employ every great British actor alive at the time.
I saw the film when it was first released, and although I was rather young at the time, the story stayed with me for decades.
i remember thinking , and starring Vincent Price of all people, who at the time I could only recall from the somewhat silly "The Fly".
James Addison Reavis (1843-1914) was an obscure veteran of the American Civil War (on the losing side) who drifted into the Southwest at the time when whites were settling that region, displacing Amerindians and Mestizos.
Korvo is not implicated because he was undergoing gall bladder surgery at the time of the murder, and eventually Dr Sutton and police Lieutenant Colton (Charles Bickford) work together to determine who was responsible for the murder.
Standards and practices in psychiatry and psychotherapy have changed considerably since "Whirlpool" was made and anyone watching it now will need to make allowances for this and also suspend their disbelief at a couple of the plot's more bizarre twists which come over as much less credible now than they may have seemed at the time.
It presents the popular ambivalence felt at the time about psychoanalysis, with one "good" Doctor and one charlatan.
*** Rich amateur chess player murdered six months previously, at the time to the utter bafflement of the police - Charlie has less than two days to research the case and solve it.
Interspersed between the hostage situation and the romance of the star struck lovers is a socially conscious message that mocks a rising fascism with a buffoonish para-military local group and raises questions regarding other ills plaguing the country at the time.
"The Petrified Forest" at the time of this review is 71 years old.
Bogart's and Davis' performances are just average in this film - although at the time of the release, this was Bogart's best film.
The period, incidentally, is mid 19th century Russia at the time of the Crimean War and not Britain as stated in the plot outline.
- My chief complaint at the time (& still) is the Mr.
I saw this movie in 1979 (I was 20 at the time, and I actually thought that I might be a bit beyond this particular movie; ha!
I don't know what it was, maybe cause I was 18 when I saw the film and a Letta us guys had girlfriends (or were in love with girls) that were a fies years younger and it just didn't fit in back then (mostly with the fathers) and the movie kinda made it feel better for us, made us all feel like we were OK and that the feelings were real and OK, I was overwhelmed at the time, being in a relationship with a girl that was 16, it helped me sort it all out.
Boys, kissing, love and everything else was sooo new to me at the time, and this romance b/w Michael and Jessie became the fairytale that I dreamed of.
Nonetheless, it is about a 13 year old who pretends she is 16 to gain the attentions of a 17 year old high school student who aspires to be a singer Rex Smith, who was a minor teen heart throb at the time is fine.
But usually my first judgment is right, at least at the time, and so an 8 it is on this viewing.
This is where I realized that the times, they are a-changing: sweet, blind (in more ways than one), sheltered Zooni is so consumed by love that she permits Rehan to bed her before he weds her, a phenomenon that is exceedingly rare (or used to be) in Hindi films.
It was the stench of the upper middle classes offering advice to the great unwashed that was the Craddock-style (and the BBC at the time) and an hour and a half remembrance of a thoroughly dislikable and untalented Daily Telegraph writer is a total waste of British taxpayers money.
She was so tall in person at the time.
This was followed by a wave of disbelief, a hope that this was a spoof, then the fits of embarrassed laughter took over and I can honestly say that every film-making mistake and cliche that I could think of at the time was being paraded on screen before my very eyes.
Later she even becomes a murderous fanatic to get the "feel" and "state of mind" of what Belle Gunness was in at the time she murdered her victims.
Of course, at the time, people obviously considered Hollywood a smart career move, but if we now take a look at Petersen's Hollywood films, I really think he should have stayed in Germany.
BTW, film of the Bush strut is shown in the documentary more fully and more embarrassingly than the nightly news dared show it at the time.
I was five years old at the time (1957) but, what higher praise can you give a movie in this genre?
The outfit makes this movie a little cheesy but they worked with what they had at the time on whatever budget was allowed.
We are straight as flipping arrows and watching the cruise families emulated the behaviors and family dynamics that we practice was so much fun that the time went too fast.
Thsi is one of those movies that was at some point in my earlier childhood that i was obsessed with.I mean this was my favorite movie at the times.Now ill go back and look at this, and obviously I don't love it as much as I did, but I still like it a lot.This film is just so good, and so enjoyable that I can see why I liked it the way I did.Well, now that i understand the film more, i realize that there was some stuff that was not really necessary, and it was a bit to long, but its still a good movie.This movie is just so much fun, and good that its very lovable that anyone could find at least something they liked.Every now and then ill watch this, and remember why I fell in love with this great and funny movie.Overall its a good movie that can be enjoyed by anybody, and is worth a viewing from.
The story of a diverse handful of survivors adrift in the Atlantic after their ship is torpedoed, it represents one of the technical and narrative challenges that Hitchcock at the time was beginning to impose on himself.
As for characters, the one cast member with any name recognition at the time was Tallulah Bankhead, who portrayed the journalist Constance Porter.
This is a great one for given it to you both as a straight-ahead melodrama, And as a kind-of symbolic deal for where the nation (and the world) was at the time.
Usually, this annoys me; but here it's done really well, and the propaganda is actually worked into the story instead of just being there to rally the allied population at the time.
The film is set in World War IIÂ An Allied ship was sunk by a German U-boat and a mixed bunch of survivors got away in the lifeboatÂ The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboatÂ   At first they were prepared to throw him overboard Â but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took commandÂ Unknown to the others, he was stealing their rations to keep up his strength, and directing them towards a rendez-vous with a German supply shipÂ  Tallulah Bankhead, incidentally, dominated the acting of the whole fine cast except possibly Walter Slezak, as the NaziÂ As the woman journalist, keeping close to her material possessions, and only emotionally more friendly, she gave a performance with the power and the pain of a thirty feet salt waveÂ  It is ironic that the film's propaganda message, which I believe weakened and over-simplified it, was widely misunderstood at the timeÂ Hitchcock intended to show at that stage of the war that the democracies should settle their differences and unite forces against the common enemy, who was disciplined, strong, and knew just where he was goingÂ Instead, a lot of people attacked the film for showing the strongest character as the Nazi!
He is arrogant, brash, and at the same time tired of being put down and treated as second-class (like the United Kingdom at the time).
Berry plays a lot of his classics - he was still an amazingly agile and robust performer at the time.
Chuck continued through his music to invent many of the terms and lingo of the youth culture taking shape at the time.
As Michael Kinsley noted at the time, critics assailed Stone for making a hero of Garrison, whom many considered a shameless self-promoter and a man of shaky morals, at best.
It was unfortunate that the series was not picked up at the time, but it has left the door open for the remake that is currently in production in Canada/Germany.
CITIZEN KANE it may not be but no matter - I dug the humor and the atmosphere at the time, and even then was aware of how much work this must have been.
I still watch this one on occasion, and it is the rare comedy that has held up very well with the passage of time - critics at the time seemed to write it off as a stunt, but I've noted that at least a little reevaluation of DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID has occurred over the years.
The photo is also very nice, this movie remained me the spirit of the 60's, how the teens were at the time.
I remember seeing this when i was a young kid and even though i didn't totaly understand it at the time, i thought it was so cool.
"Teresa de JesÃºs" is an 8 hour mini-series, and Concha Velasca's "aging" (she was about the same age as Teresa when she began her reform at the time this was filmed) with the character seems both effortless and natural -- what talent.
Apparently, money was saved by using the very, very, very, very cheapest film stock available at the time.
Living in New York City at the time of this film, and doing more than a few performances there, around the corner from my apartment at 4th & LaFayette Streets, I often wonder how films like "Old Enough" get made.
What the medium at the time was NOT showing, was that things hadn't changed since the First World War: when the troops come home, they are not the same people they were when they went away.
All the glowing praise for the histrionic "performances" in the other reviews here ignore the message force fed a war weary population who knew well at the time, however much their heirs have forgotten, that European wars, if not all war, is nothing but procurement profiteering by peerage, the scenario presented so gushingly positive in this poisonous treacle.
Like basically every period movie at the time, it's a fine looking movie with some impressive sets and costumes.
Being a slightly big comic book fan at the time (even bigger now) I took a peak at these weird looking comics.
Robert Crumb became an idol among hippies in the 1960's because of the psychedelic comics he drew at the time.
for this film, I think she does a perfectly credible job going from a teenager to a young adult at the time of execution (the queen was supposed to about 36 when she was guillotined).
Her virtuosity as the fated widowed Queen is all the more poignant when one realizes that at the time she was Thalberg's widow in her last husband-approved venture and that the Hollywood suits were rapidly closing in on her.
The casting of Norma Shearer in the title role -- one of the perks of being married to Irving Thalberg who had had this movie in production for more than a year before its release in 1938 and was in many ways the person above Louie B. Mayer -- is a bit of an irony since she at the time was considered the Queen of MGM, now its Widow, at the height and end of her acting career.
Urban squalor, violence, apathy, and fear permeate this movie, and were big political issues at the time.
This is an underrated, sublimely realized black comedy by the (at the time) struggling Scorcese.
Having no patience to go looking for cats at his age Ira changes his mind when he finds out that Harry was on the case, in finding Winston, at the time of his murder and feels that Harry trying to find Margo's cat may have had something to do with his untimely death.
It just so happens that "The General" is a history lesson as well, and scholars at the time felt that this movie was about as authentic looking as a Matthew Brady photograph of the Civil War.
Like all young men at the time, the film's main protagonist John Gray (Keaton), a railroad engineer tries to enlist in the army but is denied entry as he is deemed more valuable to the southern cause as an engineer.
The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time, and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public.
I really enjoyed it at the theater and so did my parents at the time.
The Bergen (Norway) Cinema director in 1995 had the sense - at the time when this ghastly film was first (and never again!)
This was only interesting because I worked for someone named Frank Lewis at the time I watched it.
Overall an entertaining, bit of underrated comedy, that is fun to watch, mainly thanks to Martin and Moranis who were both in top shape at the time of this movie.
There's a fine balance struck between what one would see in countless other Allen films involving the neurotics in relationships, the mockery placed on the 'normal' people who just cannot connect with the Allen persona, and also with a side of the wacky comedy bits that one sees in Allen's writings at the time (lots of homage, parody, self-referential dialog, etc).
The only problem with Futurama is that it was released by the same people who created The Simpsons and at the time when The Simpsons had just finished their best years.
I felt the most successful person in this regard was Sabrina Harman whose letters home documented what she was experiencing at the time and indicated a sympathetic personality.
I agree with another comment stating that this movie was unfairly dismissed at the time of original release.
And the zippers in the backs of the monsters were not bothering anyone at the time since it was such a marvelous improvement to have the puppets on the screen speak in real voices.
Maureen O'Hara looks lovely but gives a surprisingly bad performance--but she was only 18 at the time so she can be forgiven.
Payne was a popular actor in the 40's but I didn't appreciate him at the time.
I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since.
It's an attempt to retell the story and show how the movie must have been like, also with the help of persons who had actually seen the 1927 movie at the time of its release.
Whoever had the bright idea to turn the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play, The Front Page into a boy and girl comedy ought to get a Nobel Prize for comedy if such an award had been available at the time.
Most were youths at the time, easily manipulated.
The fact that we now know that the real threat of invasion had already passed by that stage no one knew for sure at the time that such was the case.
It vanished so quickly from memory that I forgot to write a User Comment at the time.
Despite ninja mania in full swing at the time, the show curiously lasted for only one season before disappearing as quickly as......um.......well, a ninja in fact.
The movie "Che" tries to be neutral in what it wants us to think of Che but comes across a bit disingenuous in overlooking, or air brushing out, most of the serious accusations of lynch mob-like show trials and summery executions, of members and supporters of the now ousted Bitista Regime, by Castro & Che's out of control guerrilla army that-in early 1959-were floating around at the time!
It is a matter of record that he was alive at the time of his capture, and that he was subsequently shot and killed to ensure he would no longer be able to foment revolution either in Boliva or elsewhere in Latin America.
I was a student at Wesleyan at the time and was already in awe of the "aura" of the Soong sisters.
I first saw it when it was released in 1976 and, at the time, I played little league (well, the Canadian equivalent).
I had the PS2 at the time and spent a lot of time playing Tekken Tag, Devil May Cry and the GTA games.
Being eighteen at the time when I started to replay FFVIII I was more intelligent and had a better understanding of how all the junctioning worked (when you're ten years old and just looking for fun this can prove to be the most confusing thing ever).
Unlike 1988' The Decline II: "The Metal Years" disaster while a big deal at the time, it still remains a brutal "cringe-fest" from start to finish and focused on predominately one style (Glam)one era (The 80s) one location(Sunset Strip) and barely covers the period of Heavy Metal that is STILL alive and well: thrash, black, speed,etc   I would have never guessed that a film about Heavy Metal would take serious the attitudes, styles, individuals,genres and provide a clear history time-line unlike Decline and any others of that ilk.
The level of sophistication of the electronic tools used in the intelligence community was surprising then and made me wonder what kinds of things were really possible at the time.
Bishop (whose name back then was Brice) was outside the building at the time and has been wanted ever since.
Back in the 70s I really loved this show but that mainly had to do with there not being a lot of sci/fi shows on TV at the time plus I was only 6 years old and didn't know any better.
To see Danish Brigitte Nielsen in a big budget movie was also some sort of weird attraction to me at the time and I thought that I could at least have some fun seeing some banter between her and Murphy, but the expectation was far more attractive than actually seeing it.
They do share scenes but there are only lame suggestive remarks from Murphy and Nielsen's character is so devoid of humour that you have a nagging suspicion that she was only cast as some sort of deal with Stallone (Nielsen's hubby at the time), since he was to star in the first movie.
Was it because being in an Eddie Murphy film was so popular at the time that you just had to do it?
Is it possible the Hermits popularity waned because at the time of this filming most rock groups has gone beyond the squeaky clean, suit and tie, short/mod hair Herman and the boys were sporting?
Which co-starred Sly Stallone's wife at the time.
It has never aired on any major national cable channel to my knowledge yet it was a major Paramount film and a big hit at the time.
I was about 12 at the time.
This fact, along with the economic situation in Russia at the time would seem to mitigate somewhat Danila's propensity for killing.
I was living in Moscow at the time this movie came out - I saw a matinÃ©e at the Pushkinsky theater in the center of Moscow.
If nothing else, it was great fun picking out the hilarious 80s pop culture references, some of which were light-hearted jabs at the competition, such as the posters for First Blood Part II and Rambo in Rosewood's "stress-free" apartment, and maybe my favorite, Bridgette Nielsen's (Stallone's wife at the time) earrings, which were these bizarre little metallic arrows that made her look like a Klingon.
Mason Gamble was one of the more talented child actors to grace the screen at the time- if you're able to see more than a 'cute kid' and listen to his inflection, he's actually pretty funny.
The only good thing about it was the box it came in which had a holographic effect (at the time this was unusual).
The film itself has the bad acting and ridiculous plot you would expect from this kind of movie but it is pretty entertaining and pretty original compared to a lot of the horror at the time.The Neon Maniacs themselves were pretty interesting as well.It even has a few parts that will probably make you jump.If you can find it and want some pointless entertainment I'd recommend this one.
Teo Georghiu plays Vitus at age twelve, he was about twelve at the time of the filming and is stunningly talented.
Given how difficult travel was at the time, and the distance to be covered, it was not clear to me how Alyosha ever figured he could make it home and back in six days.
garret morris at the time of production as a member of Saturday night Live and had a famous catch phrase = "Baseball's been very, very, good to me.
I was a young kid in grammar school at the time, but I do recall how funny, original, and unexpected the humor was.
Now, we're used to all kinds of camera tricks but this shot was truly novel at the time.
This trial and error process nestles in with the overall study, while Alyosha's naivety will see him, in a gleeful and euphoric mood at the time following the granting of the six day leave, happily take on the extra burden of delivering a gift from one soldier to their partner along the way; something that we will eventually come to realise merely delays the lead as well as put his life at needless risk.
It had a really bad feel to it on a made for TV movie level, so I kept it in the background so I could get some snippets as this looked really really boring and it's all that was on at the time.
The lack of emotion is amazing, but if you were "in the business" at the time, I can't imagine how thick-skinned a madam would have to have been.
Ariel Besse (16 at the time and a terrific actress) strips fully naked a couple of times, but all the sex & nudity sequences are elegantly presented and not the least bit offensive.
Politically Family Ties is the great liberal voice of 80s television and from that point of view plays in a different league from its arch rival at the time, The Cosby show.
This the kind of movie, popular at the time, in which a protagonist who is possibly a murderer is befriended by a girl/woman who's never met him before - for example Alad Ladd and Veronica Lake in The Blue Dahlia and/or in which a street-wise gal like Guild here, has to have the expressions 'private eye' and 'shamus' explained to her.
There are better cartoons (some even by Avery himself) and there are cartoons that I personally like better, but in terms of what Avery was attempting to do with the form, in terms of what animation was at the time and had been in the past and what its potential was for the future and the impact that Avery had and would have on his artform, this is the first truly successful Avery cartoon on all terms, both Avery's and animation.
I saw this film in 2001 on cable but did not catch the title at the time.
Maybe it was because it came out at the time when punk had just happened.
To me the book & the movie were such a break from the usual stereotypical pro-authority nonsense we were being regularly served up at the time (and sadly we seem to have gotten back to these days).
The film Shake Hands With The Devil is based on the book by Canadian General Romeo Dallaire who was head of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Rwanda at the time of the genocide.
The film smugly claims there is an inherent shallowness in the American public because at the time of the Rwandan killings we were more interested in the O. J. trial to pay attention to anything else.
The suggestion of homosexuality and cross-dressing must have been outrageous at the time.
Grant and Scott happened to be pretty good friends and they shared a house at the time this movie was being shot.
Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "Dr. No" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character.
Both were just 2 of the best and most successful genre actors at the time.
Dr. Knox was definitely aware at some point that Burke and Hare were murdering human-beings for money (this all paid-handsomely at the time), to provide him bodies.
Abe seeing this in the TV news, no one in the news or police knows who killed Lisa at the time,and realizes that this is Joe's Modus Operandi.
The act that Joe's basketball team, the San Francisco Condors, were playing in SF at the time makes him a prime suspect in the murder.
Though Deever claimed that Joe knew about the shipment, he wasn't believed - Joe was home sick at the time the cylinders were sent.
Robeson was over in the United Kingdom at the time because he could not get the kind of film roles he wanted in the USA with America hung up on stereotypical blacks.
)But Weire always makes sure that the characters are the centre piece of the film.The other thing Weir did great and was very different (at the time) for getting a really good,serious performance out of Robin Williams.
Though it was probably not Fairbanks' intention at the time, this line was a prime set-up for a sequel if there ever was one.
The vignettes in this movie were all scary, and at the time, our local residents were trying to claim the frat brothers' vignette was based on the old Oregon Institute of Technology -- several buildings that were abandoned and haunted.
The movie offers a lot of clichÃ©d lines that were probably fresh at the time, take Ferguson's command to the paranoid Rico (Ted De Corsia) the day before he's set to testify against mob boss Mendoza (Everett Sloane) - "He'll die, he's got to die, and you're going to kill him."
This concept, although very familiar to audiences today, was something very topical at the time of the film's release and also a matter of great public interest.
He was not a man to rush lightly and foolhardily into a decision for war, knowing far more than TR at the time of what war can cost.
That said, true believers are reported to have been a far more common breed at the time.
I would recommend it to anyone interested in Teddy Roosevelt or Bucky O'Neil or in the Spanish-American War and the economic (and idealistic) American view of Cuba at the time.
Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr.
It would be interesting to see what technology there was at the time.
This is a poorly thought out mess designed to cost as little as possible & to cash-in on the recent (at the time) King Kong remake.
DUM,DUM,DUM,DUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadful,horrid,and poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the film,probably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmaker,Mr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interest,but hey, at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent Trap,The Right Stuff,Dreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brody,who with Martin Brody out of the film,is the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?
A disastrous production schedule and Chaplin's personal turmoil at the time has much to do with the diminished stature of this film.
I first attempted to watch the film mid-way through last year, but, being terribly ill at the time, and having to wake up relatively early the following morning, I barely got half-way through the Tramp's antics before I had to turn off the DVD and go to sleep.
Steve McQueen's role seems like a pale imitation of his former work, until one realizes that he was dying of cancer at the time of its making, and that the character he portrayed was SUPPOSED to be worn out and past his prime.
While this work has become dated, it was filmed as a pseudo-retrospective at the time, so it was already "dated" the day it was filmed.
I've given it a 9 because that's what I would have given it at the time - if only I could see it again through more adult and educated eyes - maybe one day?
Many of them were junk, some were imitations of Hollywood hits at the time, and more than a few were excellent films.
Although this film is rather long (2 hrs 47 mins), I was so provoked by it that the time flew by.
However although it was a rare treat to see them nimbly treading around their props, it looks sadly like two old men going through the motions as Fred and Gene who were at the time 77 and 64 respectively, have neither the speed or agility they both once had, although if I could perform even half as good at either of their ages I'd know I was wearing the years well.
I suspect that was for two reasons: One, it didn't mean that much to the straight media at the time; and two, there was a lot more money to be made off of the dream than off of its failure.
This is all the more remarkable acting, as they were actually already married in real-life at the time of the shooting!
), Guillaume Gallienne of the "ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise" (from 'Monsieur Ibrahim' which won a prize at the Mostra de Venezia with Omar Sharif and introducing Pierre Boulanger...), a small but very funny part for Gilles Lellouche's girl MÃ©lanie Doutey as a girl who only sees half of things, a funny part for Lellouche himself as one of the bounty hunters/ice-skaters twins next to LÃ©a Drucker (who has played in each of Aurouet & Lellouche's two short-films...), FranÃ§ois BerlÃ©and is good in this kind of cynical roles as always, Jean-Pierre Cassel (yep, Vincent and CÃ©cile's father...) is coming back stronger than ever with both this movie and the great but under-rated "Virgil" in which he was even better...etc...  Oh and don't blink to catch Guillaume Canet's 6 years wife at the time (they're not together anymore) make a small kind of cameo appearance as a nightclubber at some point in the movie...LOL  Just go see it!
FOR THE BOYS might just be a "Better Midler" film today, in a period of another middle east war and albeit a more tragic and unpopular one with a far more critical and on going media focus than the first 1991 war.....This exceptionally well made musical drama, made for about $70 million in 1991 and really a protest musical parable, did not reach the intended at the time and the first Iraq war was over before this film had a chance to make an impact.
Caan's character of Eddie Sparks is said to be based on Bob Hope and God only knows what Hope must have thought of this film at the time it was out.

He employs just about every item of transportation known at the time to arrive to break up the wedding on time.
Of course, the storyline reflects the Cold War thinking that permeated much of the world at the time, and it's a bit quaint to see the mistrust between American and Soviet bodyguards to both chess players.

It revolves around the Coroner Dr.R.Quincy(Jack Klugman)and how each week he does an autopsy which will lead him somehow to take on a particular hot topic at the time.His list of one man wars include alcoholism,mugging,punks,Vietnam vets,gangs,medical insurance as well as diseases and murders.
Completely outrageous and no doubt what actually went on at the time.
Louise at the time was nowhere in sight being that it was her day off from her job as Pauline's nurse.

Roman Bohnen, astonishingly aged only 45 at the time (and he died aged only 54!
Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event.

I was a film student at the time, and Doug Raines played it for a few of the students in a small auditorium in Flagstaff, Arizona, where he is an alum.

My wife and I rented this movie just because we couldn't find anything else at the time, and did we get a surprise!
Familiar now, because we've seen Joan spackling her angst all over movie and TV screens for decades, but along with *Mildred Pierce*, *Queen Bee* and *Torchsong*, *Harriet Craig*, at the time, was a new dimension in Joan's personal psychosis committed to film.
Aside from the fact that most of the Afro Americans was living in the big towns back than, there were never any small all black communities back than, and I'm pretty sure there where not to many black outlaw gangs at the time.

Some of the scenes between Encolpio and Ascilto, both astonishingly beautiful men, are so erotic you can't believe this movie was accepted at the time.
The movie kicked up something of a fuss at the time (1954).
I don't know what exactly the message Lee wanted to give was, I don't know what was going through his mind at the time, just as I didn't know what was Ice Cube thinking, so he could end up showing "The players club" in flames during the first frames of his movie.
The plot unfurls - and boy, does it take its time - in that familiar device that enjoyed something of a vogue at the time, the flashback, so we begin with Teresa Wright - Mitchum's wife and longtime 'sister', given she's the biological daughter of Anderson and has grown up with Mitchum - riding out to join Mitchum, who is holed up and being pursued by a gang of what we don't yet know.
Niven Busch wrote the script for this unusual western and he was married to Teresa Wright at the time so apparently Warner Brothers bought them as a package.
Of course history tells us that the president named Eisenhower at the time never was an assassin's target so we know Sinatra's efforts will fail.
It's not even just that the above is shot in grainy black and white at torturously slow art-movie pacing (and I couldn't figure out, even at the time, if that made it better or worse).
As with "Lady Snowblood" (1973) which I put in my two cents recently, they might be at the vanguard of their respective genres at the time, but now, 30 odd years later, they haven't age well at all.

It looked so fake, I don't even think the director of this film cared about it at the time.

Templeton is understandably shocked to find himself transported into his past, and succumbs to the obvious desire to get alone with his wife who, at the time we had met Templeton at the beginning of the episode, had been dead for many years but remained very much alive in his memories.

He looks like he was only 38 even though, at the time, he was actually 68!
Okay, the film gets a 3 even though it's duller than dust because back in 1898, ALL the films were duller than dust--having NOT AN OUNCE OF PLOT--consisting of people doing mundane stuff that thrilled audiences at the time but would hopelessly bore people today because films are so omnipresent.
Maybe it's just me, but by around the 100th time one's heard the word in such a span of several minutes, the word has already lost all of its power (albeit given context by a scene of coitus on a music stage, a very controversial story at the time, among others), and there should be even more dirt available, aside from the usual historical asides.

Even though Teri was at the time married to Jon Tenney, who guest starred on Lois and Clark for a few episode as a kinda bad guy however is character was hard to define.

It is true that the gym teacher is under-developed as a character, but at least he isn't shown as a two-dimensional bad guy; children who are victims of abuse often like the abuser, and it is brave of the movie to suggest that Neil actually enjoyed it at the time, not knowing how it would affect him later in life, or what was being done to him.

Anderson's Magnolia), and it was certainly more compelling than most of what was being produced by Hollywood at the time (in spite of the fact that this WAS a great time for film, most pictures relied on very conventional and often contrived styles to achieve their popularity).

Jeffrey sleekly tells him, he loves the story -- and he's even shown it to Gus Van Sant (who at the time was at his peak).
Even so, the fulcrum here, online chat, holds itself well being that at the time there was this innocence about chat rooms.
The premise of a society with boundaries on conception is not a new one, infact at the time when this film was released, China was very much in the news for limiting couples to one child only.
As a child who had quite a bit to go towards teen-hood, watching these teens interested me as adults did at the time.
I think "Antropophagus" is very similar to Fulci's works at the time(..from "Zombie Flesh Eaters" into his more sadistic 80's gore flicks)and just as willing to push buttons, repelling weak-hearted audiences.
It may have been the "implied" vampirism, as we were big horror fans, or just that at the time we were into war films ("Platoon", "Jacob's Ladder", "Full Metal Jacket", that sort of thing)  I have been wondering if I could get a copy of it from somewhere.
I disagree with another poster's assertion that Minnie Driver was cast for her "star power"; at the time of this film she was mostly known for CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and (somewhat) for GOLDENEYE, and was still part of that indy-film group of actors that included Scott, Tucci, etc.
He was right that at the time the armed services use of air power and the safety of the pilots was criminal, the number of Air Forces bases named for the people that died during this time can attest to that.
While many of Billy Mitchell's claims may have seemed absurd at the time the showed quite an insight of how air power would develop over the next 50 years.
However, at the time, the services were faced with budget cuts and narrow thinking.
What could have been brought to light was the complacency of the public at the time, roaring 20's, etc.. Also the public's isolationist outlook.
As a side note, it's interesting to note the similarities between McKenzie's epic production of Salome and Peter Jackson's real life epic of The Lord of the Rings, which was four years away from filming at the time of Forgotten Silver's release.
Little did nearly everyone know at the time, and apparently even today, the photograph depicted the 2nd raising of the flag.
Couple these pluses with the importance of revealing a true and important story to the mass audiences and the obvious comparisons with American war efforts at the time of print, and you have a film that will undoubtedly become one of Eastwoods most talked about films.
My mother was at a girls' school at the time - and the whole class listened to the abdication speech in tears.
The hold of the story at the time was intense as that other Shakespearian tragedy in our times of Diana.
Given Winston's anti-Nazi views, Churchill surprisingly had supported the intended nuptials, but maybe as he was still in his "wilderness years" at the time, could have had his own agenda in mind.
To be fair,this was a mildly interesting idea at it's inception,and would've been just about acceptable for one series.But such has been the dumbing down of UK TV,and indeed seemingly British society as a whole in the new millennium,that the powers that be at CHANNEL FOUR have elongated this woefully thin concept to at the time of writing,an eighth series.What is disturbing is that this has led on to other tawdry reality shows springing up on other UK TV channels (I'M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE,LOVE ISLAND,THE FARM,CELEBRITY WRESTLING,even CELEBRITY DETOX,CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER,etc,etc,etc...)like unplanned illegitimate sprogs,with the British viewing public acting as unprepared,unwilling parents.The aforementioned programmes are virtually as tedious,dreary,lazy,banal and pointless as this one,but BIG BROTHER is wholly deserving of the lowest possible vote because it is possibly the main cause of the shallow brainlessness pervading most of UK popular culture in contemporary Britain.For example,the only so-called "celebrity magazines" at the turn of the century were the highly resistible OK and HELLO!,whose sickly,ghastly and vomit-inducing sycophancy to various public figures (most with very minor talents) was initially mocked by comedians,satirists and journalists,but even this mickey-taking soon became passÃ© as it didn't seem funny to mock something which was already too unintentionally amusing to begin with anyway.
Geoffrey Unsworth provides riveting Technicolor images to go with the painterly action effects work, wonderfully different than the Hollywood norm at the time.
If the jungle looks familiar, The Purple Plain was shot in Sri Lanka, Ceylon at the time which was for a brief period, a most popular place for film locations.
The plot is almost nonexistent, although I must admit naked breasts were a real treat to find in the early 1980's and I did appreciate them at the time.
It also mentions that the show was up against 2 very popular TV sitcoms at the time, Sanford & Son and Chico & the Man.
The music is typical of the period, rather sugary for today's tastes, and the "Gabby" character introduced in this movie isn't nearly as funny as they seemed to think at the time.
When CBS chose not to air any of the specials one year I sat down and wrote a personal letter to Roone Arledge, CEO at the time, profusely thanking him.
If I have one complaint about the show, it would be the lack money spent on many of the special effects, but that is understandable considering the budgets for TV shows at the time.
My drag-appearance was outrageous, as you'll know if you saw the film "The Rose" - I planned it that way, because that's the act I was doing at the time the film was shot.
The range of (at the time) operating medical and CB radio procedures and terminology, the open identification with real-time Los Angeles and the range of rescue situations faced by Station 51 and their paramedics showed how thorough Jack Webb's research and commitment to authenticity was, pushing the benefits of the paramedic program in the face of a skeptical California state government; as a concerned West Coast citizen with an eye on the Big One he probably knew this was an important step forward in public health that would save many, many lives when that day inevitably arrived.
I was eight years old at the time, and would watch and tape it every Saturday morning, and I wouldn't find out I was seeing all reruns until about a decade later anyway!
This is as good a treatment of the pains and pleasures of the bisexual life as seen from the French 21st-century standpoint as, at the time, was John Schlesinger's very English (1971) "Sunday Bloody Sunday"; but as a movie it doesn't carry quite as much weight and clearly like some wines it does not travel well.
Since this is reality TV it is always different with no contiguous consistent plot or continuuity apart from reality itself, and so its enjoyability depens greatly on certain variables at the time.
Taking advantage of this sick sorry a** of a human being the out of work and always drunk Frankie Paterson, Timothy Hutton, Tony took his $1,100.00 bet on the Dallas Cowboys, who were behind by almost 20 points at the time he took it, knowing that the poor slob was in no condition to make a bet in the first place!
It's evidence of the naive yet self-centered people we were at the time.
If the directors wanted to make a feature length documentary they could've expanded their scope to other erotic artists at the time such as James Bidgood (of PINK NARCISSUS fame) or Wakefield Pool (TAKE ONE, BOYS IN THE SAND).
It gave me such nightmares at the time that my mother refused to let me see any of the genre films until I was in my teens.
Well at the time in 8th grade when I saw this film on AMC I thought it was good but didn't think much of it.
Another aspect of Behemoth that makes it compare favorably to most of its contemporaries at the time was the direction by Eugene Lourie, and the elegant, understated performances.
Although I did not know who "Sun Ra" was at the time - I did enjoy working with him.
This dark view of a future world was meant to show where things were heading at the time with the crime rate rising as we were heading into the 1980's.
The Western was the dominant dramatic form on television at the time this came out, so people had a regular diet of them.
i did not know, at the time of viewing, that the director had made 3 or 4 other of my favorite films, On Our Own and Italian for Beginners being the most recent.
Running at between 65 and 70 minutes, it was billed at the time as the longest film ever made.
The rest was hilarious as well especially with the title animal causing havoc with the boys and scaring an African-American porter played by Dudley Dickerson though one may pause a little bit before laughing since that was a stereotype of that race at the time.
Fields has a field day sending up a style of melodrama popular at the time.
Nobody liked it at the time.
It's also a redemption for David Fincher who was only known at the time for the disappointing "Alien Â³".
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis did a remake (called "Living It Up", though I somehow remember the title as "Homer Flagg") and I remember at the time thinking that that version was MUCH better, but what did I know?
With the amount of gore and violence on hand, it goes without saying that this film won't be for everybody, and there was some uproar at the time of the theatrical release that Canadian tax dollars could be going towards making this kind of film.
All in all Stray Dog is a very stylish movie with some incredible shots and some ground breaking (at the time) film effects.
The writer clearly ripped off a lot of his material from movies that were big in that genre at the time.
There is probably more comedy in some of the off-stage scenes, particularly the courtroom repartee, than the stage performances which seem designed to demonstrate why he irritated a lot of people at the time.
I was so excited when I saw it was coming to television (I was in my early 20's at the time) and I watched every minute of it and taped most of it.
Here was a look at the Holocaust and the events and decisions leading up to it that was unprecedented at the time that the series debuted in 1988.
But for those without a vivid imagination, the CG is (or was at the time) the best.
It's not hard to believe her as a fully professional, modern woman (surely female judges must have been very rare at the time?
Valerie Perrine, also a young actress at the time, was immaculate.
This is a pretty good Western, from an expert in the field (Hathaway) â immeasurably aided by its star cast (Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward, Richard Widmark, Hugh Marlowe and Cameron Mitchell), a compelling plot line (three adventurers help a woman save her husband, trapped in a mine, then fight over her and the coupleâs gold), the pleasant Widescreen photography (the format was still a new fad at the time), and a magnificent score (courtesy of the great Bernard Herrmann).
I'm sure that at the time, this movie was quite educational for many people like the two main characters, who thought that you adopt a baby by going to the nearest orphanage, picking out the one you like, and walking out with it.
It was also an interesting insight into how a couple struggles to raise their first child, which is something many people can relate to, no matter what the time period.
The cast are good, less well known at the time of course.
A year later, a girlfriend of mine at the time told me about the movie and how much she loved it, so I told her what had happened in that little town down south.
It is claimed that at the time this movie was released in Norway, half the country went to see it.
Strangler's thematic and stylistic subversiveness was part of the fresh air in Serbian cinema at the time, inspired by the New Wave movement: a wide front of artists and critics based around Belgrade's Student Cultural Center, involved in alternative rock'n'roll, literature, arts and the movies.
Tragically, at the time our story is set, carnations are out of fashion and Pera's flowers are often refused by women, sometimes rudely.
There was a point - as the film was starting - that I felt that maybe I had had low and unjustified expectations of this film over the last couple of years: forget the bad reviews and box-office sales at the time of its release, and instead concentrate on the actual film itself.
Bunuel's movie was released in 1974, thus just at the time when Pier Paolo Pasolini started to film his last work "Salo", in which (amongst many other marvelous events) there is the famous or infamous scene where people are forced to eat faeces.
Let the viewer see and hear more about his guests than other talk show hosts at the time.
Top billing went to Marlena Dietrich--who at the time was the bigger star.
Novarro looked more convincing as a student than some of the other players, and yet was thirty-three at the time.
It gives the movie character bad and good sides at the time.
At this point in the movie, one begins to try to make ties between Don Andres and Franco, Spain's oppressive dictator at the time the film was made (and also the reason that the movie could not have been made in Spain in 1952).
I defended it at the time, and said they just didn't appreciate its subtleties.
But at the time, in those social circles, divorce was a taboo that would lead to being ostracized from all the hip parties (and possibly your family).
While I have of course heard the name Mizoguchi Kenji, the only films of his that I have watched are Ugetsu (1953) and The New Tale of the Heike (1955) and while I did enjoy both of them, mainly the former, for the most part I did not have a particularly strong interest in watching Mizoguchi's films because at the time I was embroiled within the filmic worlds of Kitano Takeshi, Iwai Shunji, Miike Takashi, etc.
Bela, a graduate of the Budapest Academy of Theatrical Arts, plays his role absolutely straight here and maintains his dignity; he may have been addicted to painkillers at the time, but this particular film is surprisingly painless!
As I was a female young kid at the time, and "women's lib" was supposedly established, here Lear brought it to fruition.
After all, no-one should really expect such a short program to truly represent a series that was - at the time of filming - 20 years old.
Items that were curiosities at the time but are now part of everyday life: A flat-panel big screen TV, TV news hype, and, alas, crazies that for no reason shoot patrons who are total strangers.
I remember watching Emmanuelle with all my friends when I was 13 years old and at the time it was so hot.
I first saw this film back in 1976, and only remembered that it was fiercely arousing to a young man at the time.
Not even hardcore was proposing anything as offensive at the time, and it was all in the novel, then believed as being a woman's own autobiographical account of her road to sexual awareness !
This film was exceedingly popular at the time it was released, and has lasted the test of time, even if some of the clothes have not.
Part of the fascination is how the Taliban managed to be so primitive and backward (basically anything that didn't exist at the time the Koran was written was verboten, with the exception of weapons and vehicles for them to get around in) and the peculiarities of Islamic attitudes and practices that distinguished the Taliban from, for example, the Khymer Rouge in Cambodia or the Nazis in Germany, although there are also parallels.
Surprisingly great acting, I think, as well--from a cast of, at the time at least, relative no names.
I do recollect enjoying its slightly quirky idea at the time.
This adaptation also had the biggest TV role for Anna Friel at the time.
in fall of 1994 i went to the theater and sat thru several hours of what i believed at the time was complete nonsensical garbage.
If you were there at the time the film makes sense.
When I first watched this film in 2005, I loved it, although at the time I was perhaps ready to agree that the second half of the film stumbles in a lot.
This game was made by LucasArts (at the time they were known as LucasFilm.)
I must have been in the mood for an action flick at the time.
Though most of the audience didn't know it at the time, the large part of TV performers were second-rate, washed-up, or suffered with substance abuse.
I like how the romance changes which was something new at the time.
It was sort of daring, but it failed at the time.
Obviously intended as black comedy at the time, "Pretty Maids All In A Row," is certainly no "Dr. Strangelove," nor was it meant to be.
His performance is so over the top, that we can only imagine what was going on in his personal life at the time.
Films, no matter low-budget, high-budget, no-budget need to have one essential element to ensure that the time dedicated to the characters, emotions, and themes is not futile.
Seeing how withdrawn and sick he looked here suggests he wasn't doing too well at the time of filming.
When I was about 11 years old, at the time of Blair Witch came (not being able to see it though), I was drawn into the hype as I didn't fully understand how the world worked.
I was 15 at the time and interested in nothing but golf.
The only other reviewer at the time of my posting states that the quality of his VHS transfer was excellent, while my 'remastered' DVD print is about as second rate as they come.
He was only 49 at the time, despite looking much older than that though.
First he won't reveal where he was at the time of the murder because it is a professional secret.
No one has seen him in Run Ronnie Run yet, because at the time I'm writing this review, that movie has yet to be released because of it's extremely vulgar content (much of which involves a song performance by Jack Black), but I seriously hope they get moving on that.
But he kills Persoff (who was typing a letter to the FBI regarding Cassidy's past at the time).
i saw this a very long time ago, in the theatres, and i had never heard of Sam Raimi at the time.
It is an enjoyable and fun movie by no means in the realm of excellence, but a mix of English actors doing a decent job as well as some early ILM and Pixar effects sequences at the time that were pretty high-end.
It also deals with intercaste marriage, which at the time was not heard off due to the fact that when the Mughals invaded India, the Rajput Princesses and Queens became Sati when their husbands, the Kings were killed in battle so as not to be captured and, or, forced to live with the Invaders.
As some critics pointed out at the time of the film's release, the scene between Micallef and John Singleton (Micallef's fake political ad) is just about the funniest thing I can remember seeing in an Australian comedy.
In addition, for it to be the only screenplay that she has ever written, Suzanne DePasse (who was a Motown A&R executive at the time and was the first and remains the only Black woman to be nominated for an Oscar for writing) created a great story even if it presents a slightly less gritty portrayal of the troubled singer's life.
Ross was at the time, it is stunning.
Not quite reflective of the Depression gripping the country at the time this film was made!
She tells me that Ann Harding was a big star at the time.
I watched this movie because there was really nothing else on at the time, but I found myself enjoying it.
This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released, misguidedly enjoyed at the time, and now find I have major issues with.
It is shot in live action (much was made of this at the time, but what does it add?
I don't think a composer alive or at the time of the movie's release (1981) could have created a better original score for the movie.
Made almost 60 years ago Sunset Boulevard was a marvel at the time of release.
Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is.
She was outrageous and girlish (she was approaching 70 at the time) and delightful, poking fun at herself and her "character's" career.
How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time.
The Next match featured the much smaller Rey Mysterio facing off against the MUCH larger Big Show,the match quickly took it's pace.Around 4 minutes after the match started it was Big Show who stepped out the winner, after the match was the worst bit Big Show carried a helpless Mysterio who at the time was on a stretcher was slammed straight into the ring post.
In a move considered unprecedented at the time of its original showing, Rankin/Bass decided to depict this climactic showdown graphically.
I guess at the time this movie was made, this was Hollywood's attempt to offer an explanation about something about racial tolerance in America.
Oscar NOMINATION: The only reasons I can think of for this movie being nominated for Best Picture in 1935, (before there was a limit placed on number of nominations) are (1) the groundbreaking nature of the subject matter vs the times, (2) this was a vehicle for the popular Claudette and (3) that it was based on a highly regarded book at the time.
It's hard to believe Colbert was barely 30 at the time.
With this film coming at the time of Bananas and Sleeper one could not ask for a better time for Allen to make this film.
She was at the time at the best moment of her career.
Yet no one knew at the time.
Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello.
The whole thing is centered around a guy who was popular at the time, Paul Whiteman, and his orchestra.
I rate this film as about average for the genre at the time of production, although its major failures are from its adherence to the premise of the 1950 Stewart Granger version of King Solomon's Mines.
If you have really nothing better to do (like me at the time) then watch the film if you must.
I'd only just arrived and so my norwegian wasn't up to much at the time, however, I knew that what I was seeing was something special.
I remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure .Although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way Chinese people were making films at the time .
Especially when he was supposed to convey some sort of feeling at the time.
In the past the Nameless Ones were consulted as an oracle but not at the time of the tales.
The directing: I think there was no director present at the time of shooting.
Directed by the person who brought us the underrated House On Haunted Hill, many horror movie veterans (Dorff, Combs, and Kier), and at the time a fresh concept (released just before the Ring and all the other "ghost uses everyday thing to kill you" movies), and a dark atmosphere.
I seriously feel for the person that mentioned in his review of this film that he paid to see this in the theatre in 1987 (he bought two tickets which at the time totaled $10.50).
The only reason I went to see it at the time was I loved Madonna and her music and wanted to see her on screen.
She was terrible and so was Sean Penn(he is so damn ugly) how could they cast him as a romantic lead.Guess because they were going together at the time.
Penn and Madonna, who were married at the time this film were made, are obviously uncomfortable with the material and do little to justify the film's existence.
Of course, the women are in the car at the time and their road trip ends in their untimely death.
Was Hailey a brunette at the time and the script called for a blond?
Her horrible warbling is exactly what the producers were looking for and back in 1934 it would have gone over quite well at the time--after all, she could sing, though in a style that is so out of style today that many will find the singing quite painful (my ears are still bleeding).
One must wonder what made it a hit on Broadway at the time.
Supposedly according to the gay author, Harrison and Burton did it only for the huge paychecks of 1 millions dollars a piece which by todays standards would be the 20 million monster paydays you see the big stars get.Also,Harrison supposedly was disgusted with some of his dialog and left for Italy -only to come back when he was threatened with a lawsuit from the movie studio and Burton also only stuck around since his lover Elizabeth Taylor was filming a movie close by at the time.
It is true that Aborigines were generally considered inferior at the time, and that there was some racism going on.
I was in college in Laramie, Wyoming, at the time of the Matthew Shepard tragedy, and will always be ashamed that such a crime could have taken place in my community.
And not just the fastest either, the Italian movie industry, especially in the late 1970's and early 1980's, was probably also one of the most prolific and could churn out seemingly hundreds of films on any given theme (the theme being usually dictated by what happened to be successful in Hollywood at the time) Take for instance the success of George A Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (which was released in Italy as 'Zombi') Within no time at all, enterprising Italian producers had released a whole slew of cheaply made (but often rather watchable) virtual copies of the film.
I dunno, maybe "Sixteen Candles" was, at the time, a step up from previous teen movies.
This movie about what at the time was considered one of the most horrific murders ever because of the circumstances, was a waste of time.
I was only 10 years old at the time.
These were great films that I felt had thought put into them plus had a social commentary that was valid at the time of these films releases.
After all it has a great cast based on a provocative novel at the time.
So yesterday afternoon I was looking at a blog about faces that are begging to be punched, and while I didn't think too much of it at the time, I kept coming back to it later that night as I watched the latest (and my first) episode of TBS's sh*t factory otherwise known as "My Boys."
Mesh, not realising who he was, said "I picked the one I had stronger feelings for at the time!"
That's because there isn't any, or for that matter any evidence that the level of birth defects has gone up in affected regions (with the exception of babies of pregnant women who actually worked on the cleanup at the time).
The "special effects" are the real eye candy here: most impressive is the Chromatic Radiation, which changes the film's color from blue to yellow to green to whatever gell the cameraman chose at the time.
I was surprised to see Jean Sorel among the cast members; as one of the better known European actors at the time, I'd have expected him to have a bit more sense.
And this was the most expensive movie produced by Warner Bros. at the time?
The novel I thought, unaware at the time who wrote the screenplay.
I'd filed it under "raffles" since, at the time, I didn't recognize any of the actors in it.
episode why Fusco chose the worst possible direction is beyond me (maybe he was hanging with Jerry Stahl at the time of conceiving this project)   I say to anyone who in later years discovers the Alf television show to stay away from this movie- it is lame unfunny and a pile of steaminess.
For example, Henry was 40 when he met Anne Boleyn (20 at the time) and pressed to produce a male heir to secure the continuation of the young Tudor line (he was only the second Tudor on the throne.)
And to think that this was hot stuff at the time.
We still had miscegenation laws in most states at the time so the message of sticking to your own kind was in keeping with 1939 mores.
Again, maybe 1930s Hollywood thought it was okay to say pretty much ANYTHING or ANYONE was Vietnamese--after all, who in the audience at the time would have known differently?
I use to watch this show only because there wasn't anything else interesting on at the time.
I know that this show was so controversial at the time that it was canceled 10 minutes after it was aired.
I think Forrest of Fear is a clear example of one of those films that the BBFC & Police simple stuck on the nasties list most probably due to the outrage at zombie flicks in general at the time.
Julius was my hoops hero at the time (still is in some ways), and I was major-league embarrassed for him.
We called it, "The fish that ate our $3.50 (which was movie admission at the time!)."
Whoever decided to cast the blond girl as the part of the pirate who had killed 17 men and was supposed to look like a boy, must have been doing some serious hallucinogens at the time because this girl was so bad, she was the epitome of the word 'suck.'
I was taken aback as that is exactly what I was thinking at the time.
For the record, I believe both sides of Italian politics to be about equally bad (at the time of writing), for very different reasons; but, contrary to Moretti, I don't think that Italian politics is worse that that of some other European countries.
It filled in 90+ minutes of screen and gave the night-owls some video background to accompany whatever their real priority happened to be at the time.
It seems my boss at the time (Fred) felt so bad the next day he went back and killed the deal, much to the dismay of the head of MTM (and Mary's husband) but being that he actually managed to sell a Joey to an Aussie nothing was said about it... No other network through 88 worldwide bought it to my knowledge...
Being a 16 year old teenager at the time, it bugged me, because the movie in no way represented my generation.
Like the guys I hung around with, we all felt that it was just an older adult's impression of what they thought it was like, to be a teenager at the time!
Hot Rods and Roadsters were popular at the time, but no teenager trying to be cool, would be caught dead driving a Chrysler Imperial Convertable as his car of choice.
Apparently the screenwriters unwisely chose to base this one on a small section of dialog that was spoken between characters in the first film which most people --myself included-- didn't even bother to pay any real attention to at the time due mostly to the simple facts that it was just plain trivial, and not exactly pertinent to the plot.
The "Power X" premise is a rather obvious reference to the Cold War arms race, but that was pretty typical of science fiction movies at the time; it's no more heavy-handed than "The Day the Earth Stood Still."
Badham decided that disco fever would carry the movie alone, and at the time, it was a most shrewd decision.
I remember comedians and friends at the time making jokes about "The Mommies," always with the implication that it was the type of show- and they the type of women- that would send men screaming in the opposite direction.
I will confess I never (though I lived in NYC at the time) saw this on Broadway--and despite quite a few protests that the stage version was better, while it certainly couldn't have been WORSE, I can't imagine much improvement with those craptacular songs.
Ironically, I would've been Bohemian-ish (at least somewhat) at the time this was set and I would've have nothing but contempt for a group of pretentious slacker junkies who couldn't be bothered to do SOMETHING to support themselves ethically.
I also hung out in the East Village at the time...11th and Ave A was fully gentrified at least 6 or 7 years BEFORE this silliness even takes place.
I saw this movie at a screening at a local AMC theater - they were at the time considering whether or not to pick up the movie and show it at some places in their chain and randomly invited people to come and see it.
Even though I was just a dumb kid at the time, I could still tell the difference between a good piece of film-making and and a film so bad it hurts, but what is it about the movie that makes one hurt you ask?
The only actor that I recognized at the time was a TV actor from a rip-off of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
I don't believe that John had an affair with Astrid, he was in love with Cynthia at the time.
George Harrison, 17 at the time, looks about 25.
It also never portrayed the conflict of Rock 'n' Roll music: jazz music was still popular at the time.
Sometimes it's hard for me to believe that this was the image of the future held by many Americans and Europeans at the time.
I believe this movie is created at the time in our history to bring all families and churches together.
After all, who is going to buy his story since he was on drugs at the time?
Nearly forty years old at the time it was made, Tongolele still possessed a knockout figure and sexy aura.
But whereas the MK film was made at the time that part 2 was yielding to part 3, a lot changed in the extra couple years it took for this film sequel.
I don't know how well it went down at the time, but I guess it wasn't that well, as I can't recall any other Hammer sci-fi projects.
I figured with Ted Danson in it (who was popular from 'Cheers' at the time) it couldn't be bad.
I was their age at the time of this film and I am ashamed that this is the best example of juvenile delinquency Lewis can muster.
As a final assurance that the time spent watching this was in vain, every character remains within the same relationships they were in at the beginning of the movie, shrugging off the previous sub-plot romances and character development.
We made a load of spare cash too, since the movie makers were exploiting the currency exchange rate at the time and paid pretty well (for us at the time anyway).
I've been on the lookout for this film for over 25 years, since it was given the honor of inclusion on the first (and at the time, only) bad movie book, Harry Medved's The Fifty Worst etc.
The industry at the time, which was even before 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), was still struggling even to attract middle and upper class women to theatres.
Their interest is, however, scientific, except for the legionnaire buddy who is more interested in gold statuettes accidentally getting lost in his greatcoat pockets (Having mentioned the legionnaire, I must say that I admire the courage of the scriptwriter, who reveals to us -for the very first time- that Egypt was at the time a French protectorate, and not, as we've been led to believe by the official history, associated to the British empire)  The bad guys stick to the old, slow, boring system of studying the terrain and excavating carefully according to old Ieroglyphs, while our hero and his friends discover the tomb the legendary grave by happily throwing dynamite sticks at random: a new path is opened thus for archeology.
The fact that this movie has never to my knowledge appeared on any sort of great films list, not even for the 80's, is just proof of the fact that it was over-rated at the time and now has largely been forgotten.
How dare anyone try to compare this with the other Italian zombie films at the time.
It just happens to be that at the time that Lou & Alex got to the house a major storm hit the island and knocked out all the electricity and telephone lines leaving the two women alone and cut off from the outside world.
Lucy was almost 30 at the time and even with "extreme" soft focus and minimal close-ups can't remotely pass for 18.
After all David Niven was already seriously ill at the time and also died shortly after shooting.
At least Niven was alive at the time, and signed a contract to be in this film.
Even worse is that Niven, who was gravely ill at the time, is dubbed by C-Grade impressionist Rich Little.
The only thing going for Hallie is that she looks closer to the age Helen actually was at the time, and she has a slight resemblance to Helen's childhood pictures.
A little research revealed that he was based in LA at the time the movie was shot and returned to NY where he lived and worked the rest of his life.
but i wanted to talk a little about 'Ghost', played by 'young' Tatiana Maslany, i have written young in lines because when i watched the movie i thought, about 11 up to 14, not older, no way, but she was 19 at the time, unbelievable!!!
I heard about this from someone who was drunk at the time, and expected some sort of satire.
By the way at the time this was being filmed, Howard Hughes was panting after Janet Leigh the same way he'd earlier panted after Ava Gardner.
I had no inkling at the time that it had been based on a comic book, but I didn't care; I didn't read comic books then.
Wanting to be sure about that here, I showed it to a friend who, at the time, was working on her psych doctorate (with a Lit minor).
as Rikki Lake and Jenny Jones had been long gone, it only left those two super powers in the talk show industry (at the time).
I wasn't as hysterical as Rita and her friends, but I thought it was all pretty funny at the time.
The list of equally as nasty sights and sounds just goes on and on from there I'm sorry to say these, however, were just some of the more shocking and severely stomach-churning things that viewers should probably be made aware of before watching as they are sure to horrify, if not psychologically scar you, depending on the fragility of your mental state at the time of viewing.
Reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore, I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci's earlier "giallo" period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but, even on the latter, his commitment was arguably unquestionable.
I was a small child when this ran during its one season in 1970, and it had a profound effect on me, although at the time I had no idea why.
About the only reason I went to see it was because it had been promoted heavily as a karate movie, and martial arts films were quite big at the time.
One would like to think that Branagh approached this as an assignment with a big paycheck, which could cut him off from some of the blame, but from his blustery, overstuffed interviews at the time, he took it, and himself, very, very, very, very seriously, and I'm sure he thought he was adding something profound to the great cannon of the Frankenstein legend.
All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by Miss Monroe proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time.
There were bilingual Japanese actors at the time; the fact that the Japanese were not even allowed to represent themselves immediately sends a superiority implication.
Non Ho Sonno feels like a commercial attempt at making a film that utilises what Argento is best known for but at the same time he was under pressure to make it a success, while this is undeniably a Giallo I felt that it tried to incorporate elements from American teen horror that was proving very successful at the time like Scream (1996), I know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend (1998), Final Destination (2000) & their various sequels & imitators.
I wonder how many drugs this guy was on at the time??
Individuals singing Raimi's praises will have you believe such was the best thing Raimi had done at the time.
These might have been meant to be funny though at the time I was expecting a serious Woo action film.
If this was the type of movie the cast were being offered at the time you can`t really blame them and I guess everyone involved had a great time , just a pity the audience didn`t
There was an article written by a woman named Celia Thaxter who lived on the islands at the time of the murders and personally knew all of the people involved.
"Eyes in the Night" was supposed to be the beginning of a series, of which there were a number at the time -- "The Falcon," "Dick Tracy," "Joe Palooka."
It doesn't matter, for this is a vehicle for Allyson and Van Johnson (movie favorites at the time), and the script treats their characters like human bumper-cars just to keep star-watchers on their toes.
British man Brian Roberts (Michael York) comes to Berlin to teach English in the 1930's, at the time the Nazi party is rising.There he meets an interesting singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli).The bi-sexual teacher becomes very fond of her.In between there's the handsome and rich Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem).In Berlin he also meets people as Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and (Natalia Landauer).They're both Jewish and attracted to each other.Joel Grey is the eccentric Master of Ceremonies.The cast is absolutely fantastic in this Bob Fosse's musical drama.I read about two years ago Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, which this movie is based on.This week I saw the movie and they're both great.In the movie you can hear the songs being sang and they're all marvelous.I truly recommend this movie to a whole bunch of people.
Of course, the film does contain one dramatic highlight that caused considerable controversy at the time, but has since proved revealingÂthe intentional shelling of civilian refugees by American forces.
Though not publicized at the time, we now know from proved incidents such as No Gun-Ri (There was more than one eye-witness, and the only dispute is over the number killed) that such atrocities did occur on our side as well as the enemy's.
Outside the of intermittent use of Grey, our writer - Jay Presson Allen Â tried to incorporate what was happening in Germany at the time with the Nazi movement, with the chaos of a cabaret show.
"Money Makes The World Go Around" is a perfect musical number, and so illustrative of the horrendous financial state of Germany at the time.
And I was only 7-years-old at the time!
(Little did we know at the time, how great a wait people would have.)
Maybe this is how the author felt at the time of this happening, but it doesn't make a film.
This could be outstanding if only it mentioned why these propaganda films were made, what the state of world affairs was at the time, how truthful the propaganda was, how effective it was, and/or any relevancy it might have to modern affairs.
I suppose Red Dawn tries to tap into the fears people had at the time, fears about Cummunism, about Russia, about World War III, about nuclear warfare, about increasing legislation in owning a gun which Red Dawn repeatedly says owning a gun is every American's God given right & the whole survivalist movement.
I actually recommended it to my best friend at the time because i told him that it was the worst movie ever made.
I was in high school at the time and I have not been TOO emotionally scarred by the experience.
In the first movie, the producer actually cared about the outcome and therefore sunk a large sum of money into the best special effects at the time.
Yet, I understand the series was popular in Italy at the time.
This overwrought over-zealous over-polished Faux attempt at the famed British whodunit genre would have swept the house at Hollywood's Razi awards but since it's Bollywood, an industry that does not (well at least at the time of this review) have an award show that gives out accolades for the worst performances like Hollywood does the night before the Oscars.
Animation was the biggest thing at the time.
Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time.
This is a solid *A/B* List cast of actors, all in the twilight of their career at the time this movie was released.
Justin Lo, who was 23 at the time, and played a 19 year old in the movie wrote a script with dialog that read like a high school play.
Examine their union records, dictatorial management and abuse of rights at the time if you don't believe me.
History wise, at the time that this tale takes place, the English were at war with the French.
Considering the technology at the time it came out, it is still the foundation by which other "sim" rides attempt to duplicate.
Albert Schweitzer was very much alive at the time and running his mission in West Africa.
So it's not all McCormick's fault: she delivers a performance of a headstrong, evil child in a perfunctory, overly-rehearsed manner and probably deserved the accolades she received at the time.
The people who lived there were driven out with all the force and firepower that the British state could muster at the time.
In May 1916 she accepted the payment of twenty thousand francs (for services delivered, as the prosecution would later claim) which at the time was a small fortune.
Of course the story of Johnny Lingo is one of the classics for Mormon children; the message it conveys is true and probably much more important today than it was at the time it was made.
Donald Pleasance looks exhausted and uninspired and I suspect the main cause of this being that he has been given bad material to work with (so not necessarily his age at the time).
Joe Dalessandro and Sylvia Krystel were top sex symbols at the time "La marge" was made; the former still had the infamous Warhol trilogy stamped all over him , while the latter had found stardom a couple of years earlier with the legendary "Emanuelle".
So when i saw this movie on the shelf in the video store a few months ago, they had just re-released it on DVD due to the remake being in theaters at the time i quickly picked it up.
The action scenes are greatly orchestrated by action maestro John McTiernan (known at the time for "Predator).
Since the conversations between Scott and Amber weren't public at the time, the writers tried to write out dialogue on what they thought Peterson might have said on his cell phone to Amber.
Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's "Moonlighting" and 1987's "Blind Date," which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.
It's a silly comedy and I got a few laughs at the time.
Considering that Medved was only 17 at the time and that video and cable were only in their infancy, it was a truly amazing book.
In an unforeseen tragedy, Bart was not in the car at the time.
There are a series of meaningless sight gags thrown into the movie as the boys set out to search for gold in the desert of California, setting off on bumpy dirt roads in an old jalopy (which I suppose may have been brand new at the time) on the sides of which are such crudely scrawled handwritten phrases as "Chickens Ride Inside, Roosters Ride Out," and "No Good on Dirt Roads."
It was somewhat of a hit at the time because roller disco was a big thing in the late 1970s, but this film came at the end of the decade and was a critical failure.
The only known photographic evidence to exist at the time of impact only shows a large mushroom cloud halfway hidden by some forest.
That call was reported by the enormous Verizon corporation, which just happened at the time to have a $1.5 billion contract with the US government and the Pentagon for high-level communications systems.
The music, dancing and ending were so goofy and portrayal of the "young people" almost insulting that it is no wonder an anti-establishment movement was flourishing at the time.
I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana , N.W.A , Public Enemy , Soundgarden etc .The movie like this will be just as cheesy as The 60's and I gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .Next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
I watched this when it was first broadcast, living at the time in Washington DC, where the press was harrumphing about what a dangerous, subversive, anti-social act it would be to watch this paranoid fantasy.
Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in grade school.
I do seem to recall that at the time of The Titanic going down, there was no cold war.
The CGI is completely horrible, although back at the time this was made (1986), I suppose that this could have been looked at as some high-quality technology.
I am a new father and have a 3.5 month son who happened to be with his mother at the time.
Barbra, who was 26 at the time, taking on a role meant for an actress in her 50's.
I would have given this movie a higher rating if it actually induced sleep, because at the time I couldn't.
How on earth did this get an average score on IMDb of over 6 (at the time of writing)?
80% of the, thankfully short, running time is made up of badly choreographed sex scenes, which begs the question was this made as a short intentionally, or is there a longer hardcore version floating around that was made for international distribution, as at the time, here in the UK, there were almost Draconian laws governing what could and couldn't be shown on screen in an adult movie.
Again as a sex film, considering what was going on in the rest of Europe and the USA at the time, it's light years behind the times, but again, that can only be attributed to the laws of the land at the time, but on an exploitative level it very nearly works, it's just the right side of sleazy and cheesy to make it worth trying to track a copy down, if for no other reason than to pick fault with the way certain pieces of music have been put to bad use.
If you think I`m apologising for the Serbs I`m not , try and track down news reports at the time , go into a libary with a large archive and look through newspaper reports from 1992 to 1994 , read accounts like The Fall Of Yugoslavia by Mish Glenny , talk to British soldiers who were there and you`ll find out little of the crimes ( And they were crimes ) were done by Serbs though they were guilty of terrible crimes elsewhere in the region   This annoyance is not only down to ignoring facts , it`s also down to director Peter Kosminsky trying to set some hidden agenda .
But for anyone who wasn't younger than 25 at the time of its release, this movie's popularity is an enigma: As a comedy, it's not very funny.
Sarah Polley being a young actress of 20 or so at the time, must have been thrilled to get the role and isn't pushed very hard on the performance scale.
During the war years of 1941-45, Hollywood was tightly rationed on use of Technicolor, which was needed at the time by the war effort.
It's been remarked that at the time these weren't clichÃ©s, they were fresh ideas.
Despite ninja mania in full swing at the time, the show curiously lasted for only one season before disappearing as quickly as......um.......well, a ninja in fact.
The Mayor at the time, Cedric LaFleur really did make Morgan City look like it was a haven for Cajuns with his thick accent.
She was trying at the time to escape playing the crinoline heroine to Errol Flynn and other stars.
These story tellers say that at the time they weren't sure what was happening and that they let it occur.
Certainly this is a movie that seems to have been produced with the same market trend for erotic thrillers that were being made at the time , with the worst one being that one with Madonna and Willem Defoe   The plot revolves around a murder and a senior DA is brought in and the main suspect is a femme fatale with dubious sexual tastes .
Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones.
Harry does hide the Half-Blood Prince's Potions Book in the Room, but not at the time that is stated in the book.
HP:OOtP was his first HP movie and, at the time, was my worst one.
Lew Grade was trying to make world class films at the time, but this one like his legionnaire film is an utter disaster.
I think most of the 'Carry On" cast were still alive at the time & would have been a great help/support in bringing a giggle to this long slow movie.
While at the time this was an important film for the career of Katherine Hepburn, today it seems incredibly stilted and dull.
Those kinds of special effects were revolutionary at the time.
Let's seeÂthe grad student throwing herself at the middle aged professor is a bit much Â and her 'you saved my life' remark made no sense at the time.
There are reports she claims she was sick and tired of the character and the commute(she was living in AZ at the time).
Rutger Hauer turns in a rare poor performance, was he ill at the time?
No doubt she was cast because at the time she was still Hollywood's flavor-of-the-month, but we are asked to suspend disbelief and accept her not only as a New York police officer, but as one who would be selected to go undercover and infiltrate the Jewish community and live with them as one of their own.
The Poltergeist series was perhaps most famous at the time for its spectacular visual effects and this film is no exception.
I told my sister who was with me at the time, "I think that is the BEST Bollywood film I have seen so far".
I was always curious about Darby because I grew up in the late 70's and early 80's and I saw and read about him in many magazines I read at the time.
I was also a skateboard freak at the time as were a lot of the punks.
Dick Powell is the one brought in to look over the business and falls for his Uncle's secretary, Ruby Keeler -Dick and Ruby were married at the time - and snoop out the golddiggers.
I did the same with "The Grudge" and it was a great experience; my friend and I (23 and 21 at the time) were so scared we had to watch "Finding Nemo" to calm us down.
I must admit that I rated Kickboxer 1-4 higher than I normally would due to my nostalgia at the time, I would get home from my gas station job and plop down on the couch and that would be on TV much to my delight.
Tom recently had casual sex with a woman (Virginia Madsen) whom he met at Adam Ant's club (it is later revealed that she was a prostitute, but Tom did not know this at the time).
Henry Fonda, on Broadway at the time with Mister Roberts is a nightclub waiter, Marlene Dietrich was an entertainer, and John Garfield as a local tough.
The reason they must have put David Niven on top of the billing must be done for commercial reasons or perhaps they were just being kind for him, knowing already how terminally ill at the time of making this movie he was.
Oh well, he probably was too expensive at the time to cast him for further Pink Panther, plus he of course at the time was still committed to playing James Bond, so no way they would had allowed him to play a different 'cop' in a different comedy movie series.
Boring, made no sense to me at the time and I could see no hope of redemption, so I left and waited in the lobby with a magazine for my date to finish watching the film.
It could easily have been a radio play, still popular at the time (1951) or a live TV show from Playhouse 90.
X may be an incomplete manga series at the time of filming, but that doesn't mean you can release an incomplete film.
Which makes some sort of sense, but there's nothing creepy going on at the time, so it's hardly effective.
Hijacking planes (or "skyjacking" as it was called) was in the news a lot at the time as there seemed to be a rash of them going on.
It's funny how whenever there is an animated movie in the works, the studios always seem to find one or two actors who are hot at the time: Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, and one or two actors who are basically begging for work: David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett.
Or did they all think it was a good idea at the time?
He dies a horrible death at the end of this movie, like every villain at the time.
Zsa Zsa Gabor turns up as Mata Hari which says a lot about the film and the state of Gabor's career at the time.
I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles).
These three guys (the director, writer and star) came up with enough money to take RoboCop, The Terminator, and Judge Dredd (which was merely in comic book form at the time) into one completely awful masterpiece.
This show was so sad, however it really upset me because it was "ripped from the headlines" and at the time, the headline it was ripped from was my school.
The reason Gedrick didn't make this movie is because he was busy making the Oscar-winning movie "Rooftops" (note HUGE amount of sarcasm here)at the time it was made.
Of those films that surfaced at the time, the most imaginative and out- and-out frightening of them all was PHANTASM.
I remember my mother telling me about how much "Phantasm" scared her when she was a teenager, and she rented it one day and I watched it along with her (I was about nine or ten at the time), and it was genuinely one of the most bizarre movies I've ever viewed.
Billy Grey is not, though possibly he was at the time.
Maybe if I ha been a little boy seeing this at the time I would have identified.
This is a sad fact since it was nominated for an award at the time it was released but failed to receive that award when the truth came out.
The first time I watched this, I was so tired at the time, nothing made sense.
The heteronormativity in "boys beware" is just a testament to the hatred felt at the time, as is the passive heteronormativity shown through todays use of stereotypical Gay characters that are hardly ever made to connect to audiences on a meaningful level.
I didn`t know this at the time but later finding out it was made sense .
It's another one of those films that was wildly overpraised and, I suppose, at the time of its release it was revolutionary.
Watching Pernell Roberts (the airport administrator), Clu Gulager (the airport security chief) and Van Johnson (a newspaper columnist who happens to be in the airport at the time) try to assemble the clues, figure out what's happening, and scramble to thwart the bad guys before the bad guys can 'get away with it'...is mildly diverting in the same way that the 'caper plots' from "Hawaii Five-O" used to be.
But as a young 22 year old Austrian Bodybuilder's first film it's not his fault at the time he couldn't even speak full English.
Another technical novelty in the film is its final shot, which was probably a crane shot, as zoom-outs weren't in use at the time, as far as I know.
Iloved this movie at the time.
Put it this way: about twenty minutes in, realizing that I was trapped in the middle of the row, I *willed myself to go to sleep so that the time would pass more quickly*.
Anne was in love with and betrothed to Henry Percy at the time of her first meeting with Henry.
Irene Dunne who was 52 years old at the time and approaching the end of her movie career was poorly matched with Fred MacMurray who was 10 years her junior, which might also explain perhaps the lack of chemistry between the two stars.
Bernard, who was in space at the time, finds his way to Earth, and tries to track down his friends.
You can safely assume they took these parts because, at the time, these may have been their best offers.
We have another sequence where the commentator talks about aircraft from other visiting nations, yet fails to mention the Israelis, whose F-16s we are viewing at the time.
It was a real biological find at the time and much in the news.
I remember this as I was in college at the time,, and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the Security Hospital....
I think much of people's adulation of this show comes from the fact that at the time it was on the air, cable was still quite a luxury and being able to watch it was one of the bragging rights of elementary school.
Maybe the answer lies in the fact that Howard Hughes who was not noted for his wise decisions was the head of RKO at the time.
The film is shot in the spectacular epic style against some striking scenery (actually in Utah; presumably political considerations precluded filming in Mongolia, at the time under Communist rule).
I didn't know if this was happened elsewhere at the time, but I didn't expect to see hand-held camera work in a 1959 Russian film, let alone the kind of early spinning, impossibly-filmed shot that appears early in the film.
I don't remember reading any reviews at the time, but feel it coiuld have developed a cult following.
(Being on Melrose Place probably seemed like a good idea at the time, but not in retrospect.)
She, most of all, knows that at the time of the killing only her and the valet have been in the house and are thus suspects for the crime.
I remember reading at the time a industry insider (who remained nameless) saying that if the film did not do well, the Italian film industry was in big trouble.
I lived in French North Africa during the first half of the 1960s...and I was 8 to 14 at the time....I identified with the vintage cars a lot more than with the not too smart would be hood who was the hero.
The end-result is a mess of interweaving actors, all being voiced by Kelly, and by the end of chapter 22, the landmark attained at the time of this review, you are left upset, confused and slightly irritated.
It inspires me and makes me yearn today for such a milieu, in a retrospective way that was not possible for audiences at the time of the film's release.
As Roger Ebert pointed out at the time, it was completely wrong-headed of the screenwriters to delve into the history of Casper (revealed to be the ghost of a dead child!
Cue lots of bordering-on-domestic-violence, but acceptable at the time, altercations; and gauzy close-ups of big tears rolling down Miss Oberon's (facial) cheeks.
As a British adolescent at the time this film was released, I was very grateful for it.
This movie seemed to be almost constantly when I was around seven, and at the time I remember it being totally scary and engrossing.
Pretty much at the time this movie was made the actual golden age of movies had already begun.
But it's unlikely at the time of this writing that there's any better source material.
This film show us that, for a movie to be really good, a large budget is not necessary, not even a bunch of stars (at the time they were pretty unknown, I think), just a great filmmaker and something important to tell, 'That's that.
Made at the time when video shops were appearing by the dozen in high streets all over the UK "Gregory's Girl" was a definite "must hire" for any schoolboy who had ever gazed longingly and hopelessly at some unattainable figure in the playground whilst she totally blanks him and chats unconcernedly to her mates,not knowing she carries his heart in her hands.It is at the same time an evocation of the sweet pain and joy of adolescent love and a grand comedy of young manners.
None of the cast, however, were famous at the time, and few others went on to stardom.
Maybe I was too young or it was the events of my life at the time.
I come to them hoping to get a clearer understanding of themes and concerns that I would have had no idea about at the time.
(I had nothing else to see at the time I was there)This movie is so much worst than I thought possible.
I didn't know it at the time when I rented the video, but frequent fade-outs to black and someone credited with the teleplay soon made me realize I'd rented a TV movie that was inexplicably (and erroneously!)
It is also curious why Victor was cast as the chief villain in a Bela Lugosi type role when Lugosi himself was probably available at the time.
Both he and Boris Karloff were making "B" movie quickies for Monogram at the time.  
Oddly, the studio heads even placed Laurel and Hardy in a few of these musical monstrosities--they were that popular an 'art' form at the time.
The original Freaks movie was great because it had all those genuine circus freaks in it and was very controversial at the time of conservative film making.
I was a cinema projectionist at the time of this release and it came out at the end of the 'disaster movie' era in the seventies (in the UK).
This movie was encouraged to be filmed at the time because Irwin Allen still had one film left on his contract to be directed and the film studio wanted to get their money's worth while they could.
Holden, already a heavy drinker at the time this movie was being filmed, abruptly walked off the set many times during the filming process.
The period, incidentally, is mid 19th century Russia at the time of the Crimean War and not Britain as stated in the plot outline.
Admittedly if I knew more about American politics at the time, fewer events would have passed me over but as a European, my interest in this particular part of American politics is limited - and even had I myself been a US citizen, I would never never have voted for a Democrat !
It was actually when I watch The Warriors on DVD with some mates that I decided to exchange an old game for this which was about Â£15 at the time, and in true cult style surrounded in controversy.
Three stars because it's probably the best job they could have done with it at the time -- sad to say.
his vision does not extend beyond the end of his nose, or Miss Arquette's cleavage, whichever is closer at the time.
Mia Farrow who was married to Allen at the time is recovering from a nervous breakdown and she's in Vermont at the old family homestead to sell the place.
Barbara Stanwyck, while possessing a hot figure for a 50 year old woman (at the time), was definitely pushing the borders with her looks.
I tried very hard to fall asleep during this movie so that the time would pass more quickly but failed miserably and had to endure it to the end.
Just let me tell you this: the director, the producer, whoever was in charge of the actors at the time, wasted away the presence of Armin Muehler Stahl as Doc, Morgan Freeman as Geel Piet and Sir John Gielgud as Sing'n'Burns with such tiny little useless appearances.
Hey, we all loved 'Rudy' and gladly accepted the sub-par acting due to the fact that she was so young at the time.
There's a story here, of course, but it's obvious that the main intention of the project was to showcase the talents of the stars and some very mediocre songs by Irving Berlin, and to dazzle the audience by filling the wide screen with brilliant, colorful images (CinemaScope was the latest, greatest rage at the time, and the studios wanted to make the most of this revolutionary technological advancement).
I realize he was just an up-and-coming director at the time, but surely he must have taken one look at the script and realized it didn't have a chance.
However, this is because of the censors at the time.
Nowhere is the question posed, (nor evidently entertained at the time) as to whether it was time to downsize into a domicile consonant with her income.
Taft at the time was located one block from the Grand Concourse that hadn't even begun the long slide to become the notorious South Bronx.
Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello.
It's a truly awful movie - risible in execution, and not in any way memorable - except for it's bad acting etc.....but it appeared to start a trend in Hollywood at the time for cheap Dickens rip-offs.
Another commenter in this section states that the lighting was authentic in that the Cornish locals at the time figured that as they had never been attacked before, there was no reason to assume that they ever would be attacked then or in the future.
She looked every bit the 40's she was at the time of filming, and I have to say that she came across less funny than she did when I envisioned her character in my mind while reading the book.
Woody Allen's wife at the time, Mia Farrow, appeared in several of his films in the mid to late 80's and this one finds her in terrific acting shape.
This was a unique storyline - a character comes right out of the movie screen to join the "real" world - at the time.
I remember, at the time i was watching it, i felt there were such major problems with the motivations within the story that completely undid its narrative structure.
It's too bad YouTube wasn't invented at the time this came out.
It has gorgeous pictures of a tropical paradise, far better acting, and you won't feel dirty and guilty by the end of the film because the actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, were both in their thirties (though they look like in the their twenties) at the time of filming.
There were all kinds of films from that era (I just watched "Nine to Five") that at the time we thought quite funny.
There really is very little point to "Kickin' it Old Skool" beyond providing an opportunity for us to laugh at all those pop culture trends and icons that we thought were so cool at the time but that seem merely quaint and funny to us today.
The Freudian version of psychoanalysis was the canon at the time.
Well, that's how Michael Douglas feels in "The Star Chamber," a film about an underground society of judges who are able to convict felons based solely upon what they did--and not on whether they were unjustly apprehended at the time of their arrest.
This mess just reminded me of one of those 70s pan European co-productions that were so prominent at the time.
Reflecting mainstream America's discomfort at the time, most of Frisco's inhabitants are weird and sleazy, and the detectives by voice and acting show their hatred for the job and society.
I'm not sure if they were married at the time it was filmed, but in listening to Karoline recall during her interview how/when she and David met, it was on a plane to NYC in 1975 so it seems like they at least had been in some type of relationship for several years before this movie was filmed.
Spending precious minutes on-screen wearing nothing but turtle-necks and begging Mia Farrow to 'come back' to him, he looks quite ridiculous in a role that was intended for someone in their 30's as Mia Farrow is only about 33 years old at the time this movie was made.
"Carry On... At Your Convienence" was a huge loss-maker at the time of its cinematic release for mocking the unions, and this factor probably also had some effect on the success - or lack thereof - of "Wildcats".
At the schools I went to at the time, we took our politics and social issues seriously, but our academics no less so.
I can only assume that studio chief Darryl Zanuck must have been insane at the time or under the influence!
Sure, at the time they were employed by a different studio (MGM), but they could have really given the film a needed infusion of anarchy and goofiness.
I can understand if, at the time you made this movie, perhaps you badly needed to make a quick buck to pay rent and bills but, at least you could try to do it with the style I (and many more) know you are capable of.
If the police did their jobs and didn't convict whoever was available at the time for trumped up charges, then, they wouldn't need technicalities of law.
The Indy scenes feature the (more nearly "stock car") two-seaters and "poor man's" engines that were mandated at the time to reduce costs and break the high-tech/high-buck, Miller stranglehold of the late '20s.
It was in two parts on Sunday nights on "The Wonderful World Of Disney" or whatever name the show was using at the time.
Mainly, that the gang kill and rape indiscriminately, just because they can and depending on their mood at the time.
Connery's career was in one of its troughs at the time.
Bud was 56 at the time and Terence was 46.
this movie was the first ever i saw at the drive-in and even if i was 7 years old , it was an exceptionable film.even if it is an 80's,you have to look further than special effects to like or love this movie.the acting is simple , so is the storyline , if you saw the first one , and the fight scenes are human.it's the best of the film of the duo,and no one should destroy them before seeing the rest.you have to accept the fact of the budget they had and also the music in wave at the time.the in sync of the fight was a choreography to make ballet cheap.and do not forget that it was shot in Italian first,they had to transcript all of the scenario.i just think it was a gem.
I can NOT understand why this Show was cancelled it was the greatest Show on TV at the time.
Half of the seemed to be written by members of the Brian Austin Green Fan Club and not surprisingly those comments had a rating way above the 6.1/10 average this movie has at the time of writing.
And at the time of writing, he's done just over 40 roles during or after BH90210.
Back at the time this movie was released, it was interesting because it dealt with social issues that were then current.
And I was into Theatre at the time and knew a few things about production.
So a local hypnotist, in New York at the time, gets him to briefly become the world's champion steer slinger.
Like most anime in the US at the time, it was solely available in a grainy, much-duplicated VHS.
He was only Captain at the time and only made Admiral prior to Wing Commander III.
It wasn't even a concept yet at the time Blair was a rookie.
The cloaked "phantom fighters" that made their debut in Wing Commander II would still have been in development at the time of the movie, let alone well known skipper missiles for the first movie.
I remember this being the first movie I ever felt like walking out on, and only stayed because I figured at the time that there had to be some redeeming value to it.
This film is indeed a testimony to Lucie and Raymond's relationship, but in my mind, the film serves equally as an insight into France during the occupation and the political state at the time.
The locations and sets seem very authentic, and the dialogue is evocative of the way people spoke at the time.
I must profess to loving the fact that the issue of expenses over Mulder and Scully's investigation was left untouched until what at the time was considered the final episode.
Also Artisan was in turmoil at the time of delivery and gave Bluehill a very limp release.
Maybe the one reviewer was not about to get drafted at the time as I was, and I faced going straight (no pun intended) to Nam.
Although the film was very successful at the time, it has been totally forgotten, and can be found at a handful of video stores ("Video West") in West and North Hollywood.
Since I had been a big fan of both vivacious Jill Clayburgh and the manly James Brolin at the time I went to see it.
Third, and perhaps most inexcusable to me, was having Gable in uniform at the time of Carole's death in a 1942 plane crash returning from a war bond rally in her native Indiana.
(There's also been conjecture that Gable and Lana Turner, who were making "Somewhere I'll Find You," were having an affair at the time of Carole's death, and that Lombard decided to fly home because of her suspicions.
Superior crime/movie with a stand-out performance by a young, 34 at the time, Yaphet Kotto as Let.
Miranda warnings were a new thing at the time and Quinn is an old timer who really doesn't believe in them.
Deeper than that, though, is the ending, which draws a clear comparison of the "medicine-man" tactics used by all those aforementioned enemies and the McCarthyites, who at the time of this film's release were in full swing.
It's quite a contrast to the more adult roles she was playing at the time.
If you want to find out about what happened to the ship since it sank I, would suggest the A&E movie "Titanic: Death of a dream" with Dr. Robert Ballard, Walter Lord, The living (at the time) survivors of the shipwreck and narrated by David McCallum.
(Little did we know at the time, how great a wait people would have.)
They try anyhow and crash land a bit later, at a rather extreme "flying circus" just as some of them actually were at the time, with flyer's who lived passed their expected time and definitely are ready to die for the glory...  Before they landed, did the spot a HUGE air ship in a cloud and that valuable information, plus the fact that they happen to shoot down a very impressive Gotha Bomber (forgot that part) just before they saw the girls...
Also gone is the fact that Henry witnesses his own death and also speaks with Claire's father and brother at the time, and Claire having arrived shortly afterwards having just missed the death too (actually to be honest, the way his death happens in the movie feels entirely avoidable).
It's this last program where I first saw "Deathmaster," and at the time, I was too young to understand why it would be considered a bad movie.
This is because in this version alone are the two competing spouses portrayed as equally worthy, charming, and attractive by actors who were close to one another in those qualities, as well as in their respective levels of stardom at the time the film was made.
Or perhaps it was because I am a fan of the majority of the movies that Scary 4 spoofs and I took them a little too seriously at the time.
it may have been for rating reasons at the time of the release of the 'Gladiator' big studios movie, I am just speculating.
I remember when I saw it first in the early nineties that it got bad reviews at the time.
I was struck at the time by Hugh Grant's hilarious portrayal of the twit of an Englishman.
Why it didn't get greater exposure at the time or since baffles me, particularly as two of the principle characters have since become "famous" , Hugh Grant and Kristan Scott Thomas.
Like Shields, Selznick had been retired for some years at the time of this film, but was lurking, maybe ready to make a comeback.
I liked the way this film merely touched upon characters in Hollywood at the time instead of pointing them out so blatantly and giving them cameo appearances as 'Sunset Blvd' did.
Purportedly this was an accurate portrayal of what Hollywood was like at the time--I have my doubts.
At the core, of course, is the producer who at the time had as more creative say than anyone else on the set.
The cartoon was a pretty action packed, the dialog at times was corny and as the show progressed it got weaker, but that is really a lot of cartoon shows at the time.
This is a solid TV movie look horror movie from Universal who specialized at the time in good strong B movies made in Technicolor and released into drive ins and crumbling weekly change houses.
Eventually, I recognized Steve from an episode of The Nanny (as I'd never watched ANY soaps before this...) Then I followed religiously the Shawn and Belle escape from Phillip (who I couldn't stand at the time) and Sami and Lucas's wedding triangle.
It offers no context whatsoever, and like so much propaganda out of Hollywood, the movie completely ignores Marxist revolutionary violence in Central America at the time.
The movie only hints at the role "Liberation Theology" played in the thinking of some Catholic theologians at the time.
Like many countries of Latin America at the time, the nation was ruled by a brutal regime run largely by the military.
The Doctor and Rose land in 2012, at the time of the London Olympics, but children are vanishing from an ordinary street and a mother is trying to hide her daughter Chloe's powers.
Clearly, the filmed clips were taken at the time the events were ready to 'take off,' and the devices were at the final stage of development.
Arriving at the army base Hank realizes that something isn't right with the way he's treated by Michael's fellow GI's in what exactly happened to him at the time of his disappearance.
The badly blotched murder thus eliminates a local Mexican drug gang, who would have done a much better job in covering up the crime, that was the #1 suspect in Michael's murder at the time.
In retrospect one can see within the film a vision of Beat's state of mind at the time.
Far from it, the ending only illustrates the working mind of Kitano at the time.
Another of those fans at the time was Billy Crystal who grew up to be a comedian of some note and on the 40th anniversary of that season and the home run chase for Babe Ruth's seasonal record of 60 home runs, sought to bring back that season and what it meant to be a Yankee and a Yankee fan that year.
It was so held sacred that former sportswriter Ford Frick who was baseball commissioner at the time and former Babe Ruth ghostwriter decreed that it could only be broken in the first 154 games, that if it was broken in the new 162 game schedule, separate records noted with the asterisk would be in the books.
Mantle at the time was the darling of NY Yankee fans and was probably the greatest player of his day, Maris was a small town boy who played the game only as a means to an end, to provide for his family, and cared little for public opinion or the press.
Natwick's character (she says she's 42, but Natwick was about 55 at the time of release of the film) appears to have never had a sexual experience before, and now with this Captain, played by Gwen, who we learn has distorted his past accomplishment, love might come to these two people.
Even though Natwick does claim to Gwen that the only reason she has invited him over, is because of the convenience of Gwens presence at the time of Harry death.
The film was a fairly massive box office flop at the time (audiences obviously felt from the movie poster that they were going to see a murder mystery, and were disappointed to actually find themselves experiencing a bizarre, off-kilter black comedy).
Actually, it's 5000 years old.....Becaaaause, we even had writing, laws, let alone a king at the time?!
I would recommend this film to people that, at the time that they leave the theater, really want to think about human nature, rather than thinking if it was an erotic or violent film.
I still can't believe a film with this many fine actors could be this poor, I had a fight with woman I was dating at the time.
After Fred went back out with his friends to relieve some tension, he ran into an old friend that he worked with who explained that the company that Fred and him worked for was out of business obviously meaning that Fred had no job and really no way of giving money to his son at the time.
Inevetibly, my brother bought the game but I was left out as I did not own a PS2 at the time.
This is a horrifically dark adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's story, set in the oppressively religious society of Spain at the time of the Inquisition.
(colin welland, who plays willie,in an interview at the time said that the play challenged the actors as well).it could have foundered instead it draws you in until you only see children.children who are by turns nasty,nice,scared,brave,stupid, clever,bloodthirsty and imaginative.one of the best scenes remains when three of the children play mums and dads-adults playing children playing adults-pure genius.
The movie is a haunting view of city life for a youth at the time.
Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on .
Of course, he's been in the Scorcese's previous hit "Raging Bull," but didn't get a hell of a lot of recognition at the time.
Marc Christian was painted in a more favorable light than the press did at the time of Hudson's death and the lawsuit.
The old communist Sergiu Nicolaescu, nowadays senator in a communist leftover party , who used to swallow every dime the poor, state owned movie industry Romania at the time had allocated for movies(usually one or two per year)has made patriotic/historical/war movies for all his communist party sponsored career.
When her estranged(..and very rich)mother dies(..ruled a suicide, though it's obviously not), teenage Nancy(Jenny Tamburi, twenty at the time, but succeeds in her portrayal of a coquettish Lolita-type of teenage girl who might not be the dense, naive simpleton they at first suspect)returns home from years of various boarding schools to enjoy life on the wilder side, living with lothario step-dad Marco(..the handsome Silvano Tranquilli)and successful photographer Gianna(..the sensual Rosalba Neri, so divine you can't take your eyes off of her).
This movie is powerful on many levels...the character development, the plot, the acting, the special effects, the scenery, the music...it is uplifting and "on the edge of your seat" exciting....you are not just watching this movie..you are involved in it because you are carried away by the story...you are so affected by the plot and the compassion that you feel for the characters...I was especially touched by the development of the friendship between the two boys and the influence of the grandfather and the uncle in this story....and the truth revealed that good things can come from life experiences that, at the time, seem too challenging for words!
Watch out for a cameo by Gary Oldman as Pop (He was married to Uma Thurman at the time.
I was a broadcaster in Toronto at the time and it was frightening to realize that for a time freedom of the press did not exist in Canada.
The film was banned in many countries because she was only 15 at the time.
The cast is first rate and included Richard Widmark (who was pretty disgusted with the film and threatened to walk out on it), Christopher Lee (of horror film fame), Honor Blackman a renown actress at the time in Britain (known to American audiences as Pussy Galore of the James Bond "Goldfinger," and Denholm Elliot as the German bad guy in "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
The Wraith is one of the few movies growing up in the Eighties that l found truly captivating from numerous reasons.Most enduring as a young male at the time of its release were the unique cars,race sequences and a mysterious plot.
Dynomutt was hilarious as the mechanical Dog Wonder who although being a state of the art (at least at the time) crimefighter, Dog Wonder always malfunctioned.
Aside from the fact that Franco was in power, I really don't know anything about Spain at the time that this was made.
Cannibal Man reflects life in the country at the time, but to be honest; whatever social study there is really gets lost under the murders and putrid atmosphere of the film.
The most fascinating aspect is probably the back-story: Kevin Smith sold his comic-book collection to finance it, shot it in the convenience store where he was working at the time, and cast his school friends in the various roles (two of them wound up playing three or four characters each).
It was called Paris Nonstop at the time.
I even had to make out with my boyfriend at the time on the front lawn of the school....good times!!!
This movie also gives you an idea on what life was like during the 1950's including a village fete which were popular at the time and still are today.
Plus lots of people (the public) didn't like her at the time; she had a reputation as a wild one.
I have the trading cards that were sold at the time, I've visited the Eden Prairie Mall where the movie was filmed (it's in Minnesota).
Read the reviews of the professionals at the time (Ebert, Maltin, and others) and you'll see that it was more or less expected to bomb (although I think in hindsight many more people found the film to their liking).
Fascinatingly mannered early talkie adaptation of a semi-classic Somerset Maugham story, Rain starts wonderfully, with a rainstorm, then declines into a lurid drama of the sort that was considered shocking at the time (1932), and scarcely raises an eyebrow today.
Two things made Rain such a big hit at the time both as a book and play.
He's George Muse, perhaps the least servile black man in the business at the time, someone who would go on to earn a doctorate.
Though through it all Knots and Conway shine the brightest as they try to make heads or tails of the investigation interrogating everyone in the house at the time of the death and so on.
Even though at the time I wasn't old enough to get all the jokes, It still had a magic around it that was clearly evident.
I remember seeing this film on late night television when I was a young lad and I instantly loved it for life Â or at least I thought I would at the time.
It was more serious than any other children's cartoon on TV at the time.
It has a great story that flashes back to just before Bruce took up the mantle of the bat and the woman he was involved with at the time, then skips forward to an unknown assassin killing Gotham City's mobsters, and we see how the 2 story's meet.
I first saw this TV movie on late-night British TV in the late eighties and was thrilled with it's simple, yet effective sci-fi edge; obviously, the film was made for a prospective television series that never happened - Which is a shame as the end result was far better than many of the series' that were approved and syndicated at the time.
I never liked Cinderella - I accept it as a timeless classic; I know it was groundbreaking for both animation and for film-making at the time it was made, and respect it for that.
She gave Streep a run for her money, and I'm sure she shocked a lot of people at the time of the release, showing that she really can act.
I think at the time she probably received a lot more recognition for this role because it began to show her range.
He has the talent of drawing the audience into the role he is playing at the time and that is a rare thing indeed!
What Hammer didn't know at the time is that not only Holloway was interested in finding the long lost, or hidden, Venacci Jewels but a gang of murderous jewels thieves lead by Frenchman LaRoche, Peter Mamakos, were also looking for them!
Well I have one and for good reason, because I played a minor role in the making of this film and was given a copy by my late Uncle, Jack McCafferty, whose bus company which I worked for at the time, was featured in several cameo shots.
My Uncle was overseas at the time and, left in charge as a Company Executive, was approached by the Producer on a tightly fixed budget,for a deal where we would provide free transport of equipment and personnel to the filming sites at Emerald and Rubyvale where we ran regular bus services.
This film from director Michael Wadleigh, with the assistance of Thelma Shoonmaker (editor of such films as Goodfellas, Gangs of New York and The Departed, see the connection) and Martin Scorcese, this basically had footage from all sides (on and off stage) at the fields of upstate New York in 1969 of the biggest gathering (at the time, Live Aid probably beat it) in history for a big music festival.
Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!
The first confrontation is it's best overall scene, as it's inside an exceptionally creepy location with some great action scenes and a fantastic conclusion that is far ahead of the types of attacks generally shown at the time and becoming quite violent and brutal.
Though it has been reported they were estranged at the time of his death, I have no doubt her daddy is looking down from heaven and is mighty proud of his little princess.
I was flipping channels on a boring Saturday afternoon and I came across it because there wasn't anything interesting to watch at the time.
I was in high school at the time and every scene I was watching, I thought, "Yeah, no sh*t."  I mean, I know it's supposed to be a satire, but I felt too much like I was watching what I already knew and thought and what has been said too many times before.
As the viewer, I felt transported back to 1992, having been 25 years old at the time this movie was released with no idea it even existed.
There were moments of transcendence and many others of what, at the time, seemed like tedium.
This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while "Home Alone 2" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.
Rather than a formal documentary style, it seems indeed that the more looser, almost experimental, style of production was en vogue at the time.
John sings but talks very little; he was into 'non-verbal communication' at the time, which basically meant staring blankly at other people and not answering them.
Little details that appeared random at the time popped out of the woodwork towards the end to make it a cohesive whole.
Though it doesn't match the captivating staging of Vincente Minnelli's Meet Me in St Louis as a nostalgic period musical, both this charmer and its sequel By the Light of the Silvery Moon, based on Booth Tarkington's delightful Penrod stories, are very much in the same mold as the Minnelli classic; both films provide ideal vehicles for the multi-talented Doris Day, seen here at her most fetchingly tomboyish with her frequent on-screen partner at the time, Gordon MacRae.
I wasn't born at the time that is depicted in the series (the year 1956), but it is all very convincing.
Its central situation - that of a stranded group of people fighting the elements (in this case, the plague) and a dangerous enemy (the vampire-like Vorvoloka who saps their energies) - has been done to death since, but at the time it was still relatively fresh (and may well have been inspired by John Ford's classic Western STAGECOACH [1939], especially in the way the heroine is shunned by some members for her 'corrupting influence').
Unusual for horror films at the time - but typically for Lewton - special consideration is given to the feminine roles: the afore-mentioned Drew and Thimig, but even more so Katherine Emery (playing a character suffering from a particular 'ailment' and who comes to the fore during the climax, lending it unexpected irony - especially with Karloff's final remark, "I've seen the Vorvoloka!").
I first saw this movie on late night BBC (I was living in England at the time) a couple of years ago.
Such a film would have been difficult to make in America at the time, as the U.S. production code of the period so demanded clear villains and heroes and swift and sure punishment of the villains.
Todd was 41 at the time this film was made.
Nobody knew what the outcome of Garbo's career would be at the time.
I was a kid at the time.
It's quite possible that viewers at the time were prepared to put up with sloppiness like this if they were caught up in the plot.
Shannon doesn't bring her A game but does enough to keep us interested, I recall years ago reading a couple of bad reviews for two of her movies at the time and I think this might have been one of them which might have put me off a little before viewing this?
The soundtrack on most broadcast copies is rather poor,but the quality of the music score is beyond question.The composer ,william Walton was commissioned at the time but his music was not thought particularly noteworthy .It was not until the 1960's his music was accredited rightly in my view as a work of sheer brilliance.
We didn't throw up, but we definitely couldn't breathe, it was that good at the time.
Also we heard from the media that there was 20.000 people in the building at the time of the collapse, or at least it was speculated within the first 24 after 9/11.
Set in a New Brunswick college town,our heroes are a pair of easy going roommates named Luke and Roger.After sneaking into a sorority girl's room to return some quarters,Luke spies the girl sprouting tentacles in front of her friend-who's casually huffing liquid nitrogen.Luke reasonably comes to the conclusion that the two are aliens-though none of his friends believe him(he was drunk at the time).After a pair of suspicious deaths,Luke becomes convinced he's right and begins investigating.
Gwenyth Paltrow, who was offered Kate Winslet's part in Titanic at the time she committed to this project, devles into her role as the unsuspecting fiancee with grace and down to earth affability.
Adapted by no less than Ring Lardner Jr. from a hit Broadway play, it may have had resonance at the time, if audiences were willing to overlook pedestrian direction, absurdly melodramatic music, and Homeier's undisciplined histrionics (reprising his stage role, he's sort of a Nazi Dennis the Menace).
But the script, like so many at the time, takes the goodness of Americans, all Americans, so for granted that it starts to sound smug and patronizing.
I was following Scott Jacoby's career at the time and thought he did a great job!
I had first seen it as what now called a "questioning" young man in 1972 (the son's character was 14, I was 13 at the time) and remembered it being very important to me as the first sensitive, non- judgmental portrayal of gay men on television.
I was only 18 at the time, but the Holbrook/Sheen/Lange movie stayed with me for all these years.
The movie seemed so serious and rather dark at the time.
