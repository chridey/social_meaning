James Cagney was a villain of Hollywood by shark eyes and voice to send for audience the core of badness and evil characters as his profile in cinema.The producer choose previously Ava Gardener to be the hero of this film in-front Cagney but Cagney refused this choose because he said that Gardner not familiar with his role and he cheesed Day in it because of her fantastic abilities between singing and acting and she succeeded in it with Cagney.
This isn't exactly a musical, but it almost seems like one because there more singing than much else, but this is obviously one of the hooks.
Cagney is great as the controlling and abusive hoodlum and paints him with most unflattering strokes, yet generates a bit of sympathy because he is so pathetic as he clings to Day in desperation.
That's a great pity, because this film contains one of the two extraordinary dramatic performances Day delivered in the mid-fifties (the other was in 'The Man Who Knew Too Much').
After Judy Garland was fired from Annie Get Your Gun, the first person that they wanted to play Annie was Betty Garrett, but because of her an-gent she lost out having the role of a lifetime in the movies, and after this happened, Betty Garble wanted to play Annie in the worst way, but 20th Century wouldn't lend her out, so finally after seeing Betty Hutton in The Perils of Pauline, she was hired to play Annie.
If you don't agree with that statement, you may have a hard time taking in Love Me Or Leave Me, because Cagney's character is about as unlikeable as leading men come.
One of the things that struck me was that while Joaquin Phoenix had a much tougher job because Johnny Cash was performing almost up to the end and had a distinctive sound that I didn't think anyone could match, Phoenix did a very good job in capturing him.
Kaufman also plays an overacting janitor, supposedly has the biggest case of homophobia on earth because he thinks, I'm not kidding, that a man being eaten by another man is totally normal, homosexual behavior.
There's a few other things, I could mention, but I'd like to skip to the ultimate fight of good v. evil: Good cop is supposedly a warrior of God, because of his blood line.
Cagney's performance is less remarkable than Day's, because he had less road to travel.
In the beginning of the movie, director Uwe Boll tells us not to watch this movie, because its bad.
Dark comedy is one of the trickiest genres in movies today because if not done right, you have an extremely uneven film on your hands.
The awfulness of their relationship culminates in Meryl stealing away Goldie's husband--just because she COULD!
Goldie is back to rub in her good looks and also to steal back wayward hubby Bruce Willis--not because she even wants him but because she CAN!
Well, Meryl is worried about losing her man but she's much more upset because Goldie looks so much better than her!
When Medeline is tired about her looks, because she getting older.
And Robert Zemeckis, I never knew he did such a great movie because he's a head producer for Dark Castle Entertainment and he's done some pretty bad movies from there like Ghost Ship and Thir13en Ghosts.
I rented this movie because it has Tom Savini listed at the top of the credits and had kung-fu zombies.
Two emasculating she-wolfs battling it out - they think - because they want one man, but really, it's all about ego and oneupmanship, and with two equally established actresses such as Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, both looking exceptionally beautiful in their mid-40s, DEATH BECOMES HER is a visual treat that throws back an unintentional but hilarious reference to the aforementioned divas who preceded them.
I never saw "Death Becomes Her" when it first come out because of a review I had read somewhere.
If you are a fan of the actors who appear here you will be disappointed, too because their appearances are much too short.
I have read a Fesser interview where he said he didn't enjoy the first live-action AstÃ©rix movie because no matter how good the lookalikes were, it didn't respect the essential of the comics.
Benito Pocino is the perfect actor for Mortadelo because he is Mortadelo, and we can't forget Filemon, a great Pepe Viyuela who makes a great performance too.
Mortadelo & Filemon's first film (and may be not the last because it's going to be a success) is just great.
However, whether you know them or not, it doesn't matter because its fun for everyone, all ages!
I never had a problem with the Waters exercise in 'poor taste', because there was a message about it, this film, was just stupid.
As I said before, there might be people who don't like it because it has the humor of "Torrente", but the film is exceptional, especially because of the visual effects.
Just because an individual is right doesn't mean that they are morally justified to perform their deeds.
I bought Rome Total War (short: RTW) because I was interested in the add-on Barbarian Invasions.
This period holds my special interest because I am fascinated in last days and falls of anything.
Only the roman emperors could, because of their vast wealth and power, slightly influence economics, but even when they applied drastic policies these would general fail or backfire.
A transforming rock shtick that was probably done because Tonka running a bit low on ideas.
Maybe it was because I was a preteen and I really didn't care or it could have been because I was getting into other things.
But the real reason I'm writing is because I would really appreciate some help to find the name of another vampire film I can't stop thinking about: all I remember about it is that is was in B&W (or maybe it was just my TV, I can't remember) I recall only two scenes: one, there was like a parade and there was this woman who looked very much like a nun, and the vampire grabbed her and sucked her blood inside of a car, and everyone who saw them laughed 'cause they thought they were making out.
I really wanted to see this movie because of Bug Hall.
I found myself constantly trying to find something wrong with this film through the duration of it because I knew better than to be liking it so much - but i couldn't help it.
Pulp Fiction's influence can be seen all too often through this film; but what The Criminal doesn't realize is that just because it worked for Pulp Fiction, doesn't mean it will work here.
Be prepared to pay attention very closely from this point onwards because The Criminal is not a movie for those suffering post-MTV attention deficit disorder.
I give this movie an excellent rating because it captures not only a way of life, but also great acting by well-known celebrities whose characterizations bring the story a sense of reality.
I only say little because my mother and I are the only two fans of it that I actually know of, but I'm sure there are hundreds of fans out there who love "Rachel and the Stranger" as much as we do.
Young's acting tends to be underrated because of her later work as a television hostess but even her film work as a teenager was extraordinary.
She was an especially good casting choice because the repressed Rachel needs to subtly convey a depth and dimensionality early in the film to make her later transformation plausible.
SPOILER  ALERT: When the Native Americans tell the priest baptize them  because he loves them and not because baptizes them for their  conversion or because they believe it is a magical ritual that would  cure them.
I feel that this film should have been more acknowledged amongst the "society" because it shows what a film really should be made of.
The F&I War was pretty dang big, cost enough money to cause the American Revolution a few years later, and ended in a gargantuan battle where the British won because the kill ratio was 3 dead French/allies for every 2 British/allies.
That's a shame, because the film is actually quite remarkable.
That said, I'm probably overcompensating for the film, because it really doesn't show Natives as savages at all, especially not the Algonquins.
We cannot identify with the characters because their loves and ideas are shown to be misguided.
This film is brilliant, because it defies conventional stereotypes of European settlers and American Indians.
So, if you are avoiding this film because you hated Dances with Wolves and fell asleep every time you tried to watch Last of the Mohicans, try this film instead.
", but rather "I did this this way because... and I am pleased/disappointed with the results, so I will do it again/try something else next time".
The First World War is an usual subject for comedy, especially because of the massive lost of life and the first time many countries suffers the affects of total war.
Reason why it isn't known better is I think because of "Turks fruit" from 1973.
After that movie people expected this movie to be a sort of "Turks fruit 2", also because it was once again directed by Verhoeven and had Monique van de Ven and Rutger Hauer as the two main leads.
But it all works well because it serves a purpose in the movie and it's obviously not only put in it to simply shock the viewer in a cheap way.
The movie however is quite short and it didn't feel that the movie covered the entire story and the ending is abrupt and not entirely satisfying because it still leaves a bunch of questions unanswered.
The acting isn't always top-class but this is more because of the simple dialog, rather than its the actors their fault.
This forth and final series is perhaps the best of all the Black Adder episodes; it is also more of a tragi-comedy than just plain old slapstick perhaps because at the time (1989) the events of WW1 were very much in the minds of a lot of people, whether it be surviving soldiers or relatives.
However, in retrospect, this isn't strictly true because even with Episode One there is a tangible shift in tone from previous Black Adder series.
For those that know their 20th Century history, WW1 was seen as a complete disaster for all and sundry, especially for the British soldiers in the trenches, primarily because they were being commanded & told how to fight a war by the most repulsive upper-class morons that call themselves Generals that ever wore a uniform.
Melchett is a complete buffoon but only Captain Blackadder realises this; everyone else thinks the General knows what he is doing purely because of his rank & social standing.
So it is no wonder that Blackadder wants to mutiny because it's a hard choice deciding who the real enemy is - the Germans or his own Generals.
No longer did the critics argue this series lacked any respect because come the final few minutes of Episode Six we were treated to the sad demise of all those soldiers fading into time and replaced by the infamous poppy fields that strewn Northern France.
Although the female lead is very beautiful, and manages to get undressed frequently, there is always a tension to her sexuality...she is forced to rely on it only because the audience is clearly made aware that on the other side is the penniless abyss.
Like other reviewers, I was going to avoid this movie within the first few minutes because of its austere quality.
Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare.
Due to this I almost passed this film up, but I'm glad I didn't because I've finally found a haunted house film that I not only liked but also could sincerely call horror.
After saying this, even though in my mind this is possibly the best haunted house film I've ever seen it is still just that, meaning do not expect to watch this film and see it completely redefine horror because it doesn't.
Due to this fine beginning everything in the film works much better for it, the scares have greater impact because we care what's happening to Laura and unlike some films they don't come at you in rapid succession.
But the reason why you care about her and feel so connected to her throughout the film is because she plays a mother perfectly.
There is nothing more important to her than her son and she displays this so convincingly that when the end of the film hits, the affect of the conclusion resonates that much more because you feel the emotions that Laura feels.
I have read many reviews in where this movie was very confusing but this is not the case because this generation of movie viewer has to have everything explained to them because it hurts to think.
The movie is about a nun who's harassed by the devil all because of her purity or desire to be chaste.
That's because it's a classic story.
I was not impressed in the beginning because the film seemed a bit derivative to me.
I think it was obvious that the orphanage was haunted because of some terrible past event involving children (why else would you call it "The Orpanage"?!).
However, there's no reason to panic because even if the script is bad, at least the characters and dialogue are very well done, right?
I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else).
But I went to see "El Orfanato" because I gathered that it was more of a ghost story than a horror film, and that it was more of a thoughtful reflection on The Unseen World, like "Don't Look Now," or "The Sixth Sense," than a movie whose main purpose was to scare the bejabbers out of the audience.
A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure.
I had to get to the cinema because I could not say no to my girlfriend.
So usually I only see the big horror classics, and that is because I've read enough spoilers to confront the movie in a laid-back way.
You wouldn't see Attack the Gas Station winning any Oscars or sweeping any film festivals, because that's not the aim of this film.
This says a lot about Korea, I guess, in that most people don't want a full tank of gas because it's so expensive, and a few other things that flicker by that indicate that the economy isn't exactly booming.
Obsessed, not possessed, because Satan is an external force in this film.
In ATGS, the third and most successful film from Korean director Sang-Jin Kim, four young Korean punks, well, attack a gas station obviously (twice, the same station both times), because they are bored.
They push people around because they can, not because some gun gives them that power.
As for Pierre, he falls in love with Marie, mainly because he doesn't succeed in finding a job again.
Her performance must have been good, because other producers noticed and she had a nice supporting role in "The American President" and a recurring role for 3 or 4 years on "The West Wing."
The films ending is rather prolonged and is also somewhat weak, this is particularly noticeable because of the strong meat which preceded it, but Zalman King does deserve credit for ensuring that it was not made glaringly obvious long in advance.
I believe WO-2 deserves a far higher rating than it has currently been given by IMDb users, this rating seems to be the victim of what appears to have become a double standard, the upgrading of any excessively violent films (even those showing scenes of torture) because they display the freedom of film to uncover aspects of society which are normally kept under the carpet; but the downgrading of any showing intense sexual situations because they might unduly influence young people.
Many Mexicans tend to easily "scare" with plots like the one in "SatÃ nico Pandemonium" because it deals with two restricted topics in Mexican society : sex and religion nastiness.
If you speak Spanish you might enjoy it more than if you watch it with sub-titles because most of the words have no exact literal translation.
For example, the afro American nun that cries all over the convent because of her depression for being black is something that may seem random; you just watch her cry and suffer.
Also, the convent is very creepy mainly because of a great art direction.
I praise the cinematography because the movie is visually stunning.
The acting is not that good because most of the main actresses were amateur, except for Pezet who delivers a brave, solid performance.
She was perfect for the role because she's extremely pretty, has an angel face; the perfect prey for Satan.
MÃ¨xico created this interesting premise which sadly, in the 80's and 90's was heavily banned because of a censorship campaign against violence in cinema.
First, we only know that the movie takes place in the inquisition times because of the tombs of the nuns.
The scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun "like that" would seduce you, and later, it grosses you out.
Give a try to "SatÃ nico Pandemonium" because it offers blood, gore, a scary plot (for us who respect the religious factor), and a dark atmosphere.
The only reason I bought it was because it was on sale for $5 at our grocery store.
I gave it a 9, because it makes me cry sometimes:-)
It's one of the best TV series of 2005 in Turkey.Nazli;a Turkish girl from Gaziantep doesn't want to marry Kadir(her childhood friend)and run away from home and goes to Bodrum where she will meet Niko who she will fall in love.But there's a huge problem because Niko's Greek.Greeks and Turks do not get along well generally but their big love won't be ruin by this problem and they decide to get marry.Niko comes to Gaziantep and meet with Nazli's family and the comedy starts.The cast of the series are all experienced Turkish actors and actresses except ÃzgÃ¼r Ãevik(Niko)but he acts like he's an actor for years.They are all very talented.Sumru Yavrucuk(Nazli's mother) Erdal Ãzyagcilar(Nazli's father) Arif Ekin(Nazli's grandfather) and Binnur Kaya(Nazli's elder sister)are the most funny characters.Probably Anna and Kadir will fall in love and maybe Memik and Niko's grandmother too!!
I Give 9/10 and not straight 10 because of the poor Greek Language the actors speak.
I really hope that the reruns are going to last a long time, because The flying doctors is really a one-of-a-kind great show.
You might say that, in a way, I went to Australia because of the Flying Doctors.
The studio may have been testing him in different roles because the same year he was in "The Easiest Way" playing the decent, hard- working and quite moralistic husband of Anita Page - an even more "blink and you will miss him" role.
That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation.
The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end.
If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in Harry's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there.
The episodes come and go without leaving much of an impression, partly due to the fuzzy soundtrack (which renders much of the dialogue inaudible) and partly because of the thoroughly uninteresting main characters.
In one of the last scenes we know for sure her husband is dead because they found his body.
In that scene, we see again that she just can't accept it because the body that is found has all the characteristics of her missing husband, but she still denies that it is her husband.
Even as Marie tries to accept a new lover but struggles, because her husband is still very much with her.
Under the Sand (2000)  The plot is simple, almost too simple, and because very little happens, it depends on mood and deeply serious thinking about death to survive.
And it works, overall, because of just those two things: heavy subject and Rampling.
Even though the main event in the movie happens at the start, I don't dare mention it because it's surprise is important (I didn't know it was coming, and liked the way it was handled very much).
A film that will remain with the moviegoer long after viewing because of its painful emotions and its visually powerful final shot.
I disagree with a few comments below: first, I believe it 'is' appropriate to switch back and forth between French and English because the character is an english literature professor in Paris and has bilingual friends; second, I feel it is unfair of anyone to characterize the main character as elderly, she is sensual, attractive, and tentatively has a good life to live in her future.
I would recommend this movie because it manages to tell a story of vengeance and human frailty without sacrificing either of them.
Boy, I must either be really bored or completely out of other material to watch because it's generally known that Miss Delaney has yet to deliver a decent film.
the absurdity of the premise is acceptable because this is a horror film.
Peter Weller is always a great actor, and he stars in this film as Bart, a man who wages an all out war with one hell of an angry rat while the rest of his life begins to fall apart because of it.
It's only fitting that J-stew portrayed a member of the paprazzi because surely he is going to be hounded by them for the rest of his natural life.
The power soap operas like Dallas and Dynasty used sex with far more effect than these producers because they knew the audience could fill in the blank between the bedroom door and next morning themselves.
Apparently whoever did the costumes wasn't alive then, because there was no attempt to find any clothing for the actors that actually resembles the fashions of that era, and sorry, but Cyndi Lauper and Blondie were not hot singers in the late 1980s or early 1990s, in fact, their careers were dead.
However, I enjoy watching them because Charlie Rose seems born to interview and to interview correctly for the person across from him.
The film makers pull out all the stops to elicit a carefully directed emotional response from the audience, but IMHO it fails because their efforts are so blatantly obvious.
I don't usually watch HBO because I don't like the programming, but I am glad I tuned in to watch.
They are taught to fear the unknown, to trust their leaders implicitly (because they use nice words in speeches like 'freedom' and 'family') and not to question motives.
The diplomats also seem to be carrying information mighty sensitive to the CIA, because Dutch and his team are going 'in country' under the authority of a guy named Dillon (Carl Weathers).
That is a pity because they could have had for once a documentary about kids finding their way rather than losing themselves but the filmmaker went rather with the caricatural: -the genius overachiever (the good) -there's the tortured teenager (the bad) -the 9 year old twins who would not know what a beat (or singing in tune) is if it came up and hit them in the head (the comic relief) -the school director who spends his time screaming and berating these kids like it's boot camp time in full metal jacket (bare in mind these kids are between the ages of 9 and 17)- (the ugly) - Even after their triumph at the Zappa fest you don't see him once high five a kid or give him or her a compliment.
The film works because of it's multi-genre definition.
I only stayed for a year, because I learned a lot of my guitar teacher Nate, and enjoyed playing with the other students who didn't hate me.
But Dutch's are more effective than any other instances I can think of because they are so believable and unforced.
Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor; but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence, not his acting ability, that makes his performances what they are.
`Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool.
I enjoy watching his movies just because he's such a watch-able guy, even in his bad movies (which are many), but I think the thing that really makes Predator stand out is its simplicity.
It is truly a fight between a group of predators, which we understand because they are human like us, and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown.
It's not Oscar material, needless to say, but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.
because Cassie died mid way here and from what I read, she was there for the first 2 seasons.
To assume that Hex got its ideas from already established shows does it a disservice because in the end, Hex is nothing like them.
Those who like shows such as Buffy because of the action might not enjoy Hex as much and might find it slow, but Hex is not the first show to carry the story through the characters and their relationships.
They grow and change and even the Annointed One has various depths to her character rather than being the typical self righteous do-gooder, whining teen who just wants to be normal or rebellious adolescent who either gets out of control or does what she wants because she can.
I came because I heard it was a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer (The Seried) and Charmed, I stayed because it was something so very different.
From the very beginning, this show made it self stand out from the current supernatural shows simply because it's so dark.
i started watching this show when bbc America started airing it here in the states i watched the pilot because i thought it looked a lot similar to buffy the vampire slayer(my favorite show... rest in peace).
i ask that you try out this show and give it a chance because it really is worth it.
it might also be a good show to pick up the season for because that way you can watch it at your leisure
I like Cassie because she is just a typical teen in school.
I like it that the bad guys won, they just were not clear enough about it, probably because they wanted to have some room for a third season, fir me just another 20-30 minutes to end it properly would do.. maybe just showing a scene of angels and demons battling each other in front of the burning school and Leon and Thelma hiding in the forest where we left them, crying of fear and failure over Ellas dead body.. and then suddenly meeting old friends (Cassie, Amy, Max, Roxanne, Tom, etc) and everybody then slowly goes away to heaven(or maybe hell) together (a semi happy ending, at least for our main characters getting the chance to meet and be together in the afterlife at least) A scene where Azazel, Raphael and Mephistopheles having a last drink together sitting quiet together seemingly contemplating their bitter and unhappy fates, of course with a close up on a tear falling from Azazels check before everything erupts into light/chaos, could be a kind of fitting/funny final scene   anyway I really enjoyed this show.
We have also been trained to never believe a characters death (I'm looking at you "Alias"), and because of that this show had the ability to legitimately rattle me, in a good way.
If I were to find one theme from this season it would be that it sucks to be a girl in modern society because you are exploited for your body.
And because Cassie gave in to him she had to pay the price.
watch it because it would be like nothing you've ever seen before.
My personnel comment on the best character in the show would have to be Telma, because she doesn't care what any one things of her.
I think that the producers of the show should make another 5 to 6 series because at the end they just left you hanging with the characters, because almost anything could happen to them even though Malacky(sorry about my spelling) has taken over the school.
Maybe because he chooses quality independent films and not the big money movies?
Samuel Jackson has to crack you up when he says to Tommy's new-found drinking buddy: "Your wife likes the city because she is a city girl, and you are too!"
If you are one of the people who is down on the movie because "I wouldn't let him do that to...", clearly they don't belong there.
Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge.
Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi.
The film is depressing, and therefore I'd recommend everyone watch it, especially those who were born into their own perfect little worlds and became what they are because of their parents' money.
you ask , well I think you`ve hit the nail on the head with that question because there`s nothing really compelling about TREES LOUNGE .
To say that Tommy is a `loser' would be too much of a simplification, because the character is too complex for that tag alone to be accurate.
I guess I would ask those who attack the film with low ratings (because of the man) if they have ever had crowds bow down in front of them in a foreign country after performing so well?
Rock School is extremely entertaining and very interesting and compelling because of one thing Paul says early in the film... "It's easy to be a novelty act, a bunch of kids playing rock, but the goal is to do it very well..." The kids can indeed play.
I rate one star just because it is not possible to write "rating does not apply".
As I watched this on Fox Movie Channel earlier tonight I wasn't laughing -- because my mouth was hanging open too wide.
Initially I was hesitant about the purchase because I wasn't sure if he would enjoy the movie, plus it was long considering he'd never watched anything that for that length of time.
Probably because it makes the horrors of war slightly more meaningful - and thus bearable - if they are construed as 'obstacles', which the 'hero' must overcome in order to achieve his ultimate aim.
In summary, the main achievement of 'Savior' is in making tangible the viewpoint of Thomas Hobbes, who said that war must generally be avoided, because in war, human life is 'brutish, nasty and short'.
There have been few other films I've seen that made caused me to weep (big, macho guy that I am ;-)), particularly those that are often mis-labelled as "war movies" -- "The Killing Fields" being another of this ilk -- when, in fact, they're really (if we're labelling things) human interest films that come about because of a war or conflict.
The dark odyssey of the soldier (Dennis Quaid) begins in tragedy--the death of his wife and son, whom he has been neglecting because of his military duties) in an alleged Muslim extremist cafe bombing--and leads him on a rocky, suspenseful chase to redemption.
Are we now asked to ignore it because Serb civilians have also suffered?
**possible spoilers** Dennis Quaid plays an unbelievable protagonist who goes to a mosque and shoots a bunch of people who are praying to God because he lost his family?!!
I'm glad nothing good comes out of this film because nothing good came out of a war that destroyed a beautiful nation and turned brother against brother all in the name of fighting an ethnic war left over from ancient history.
because I don`t recall any news reports about it .
I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict .
The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use, so spamming powerful attacks is still possible, however, this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat, with more strategy and tactics necessary, among other things because of those archers... arrows in general are present in this, and they are very welcome.
I'd say the past ten years or so it has been discouraging because these video games are so difficult to learn and play.
They could show you the most boring office cubicle on Television because of the drawing style.
Don't turn it on in the middle of the show and expect to enjoy it like you would a Family Guy because you will have no idea what Tim is talking about.
Usually because he puts his foot in his mouth.
I know that cartoons aimed towards adults generally don't get the attention they deserve, because they get written off as childish or don't capture interests as quickly as attractive/famous real-life characters can.
So before you write it off simply because it's an adult cartoon, watch just ONE episode.
The only reason the theater screening matters is because of crowd reaction.
He said it was impossible, but all of a sudden realizes it's not because they're 10,000 feet in the air?
But in the end, I just had to, because I'm an absolute science fiction lover- so I took the risk.
The only reason, therefore, that this movie isn't an 8 is because I LIKED the movie - but I'll probably have forgotten about it tomorrow.
It was of special significance that a Georgian has made such a film because Stalin even until now possesses a status of icon in his home country.
I was interested in it because of Sean Astin.
Anyway, because I had never heard of it, I thought it would be one of those movies that had good actors but a bad storyline.
And i love movies with unexplainable holes, exaggerated gags, unmotivated behavior, unsophisticated dialogs, clicheyed punchlines, clumsy acting, because they are SO funny you can laugh yer ass off!
The only one who saves face is Vinnie Jones, because, after all, he's Vinnie Jones and lends his natural ferocity to any role he's agreed to take on, including this crap.
probably the best part is, when the time-travel-ipod-like-gadget gets hooked on via USB to a laptop, because it's screen broke.
Nevertheless in retrospect this doesn't turn out to be too much of a problem because of how the film ends.
This is the kind of movie that could be decent, but becomes unwatchable because the director's so in love with his/her techniques.
He's had the good fortune to be in a few good movies in his career, but, left to his own devices, he will pick insipid little things like Slipstream simply because the script uses the phrase, "String Theory."
I registered with IMDb because of it.
Duane has really aged since the original that was made 8 years prior to this sequel and because the film is supposed to be set immediately after the events of the original, the way he looked just felt wrong.
Many people hated this movie, because they felt the big budget and intentional laughs ruined the campy spirit of the original.
Others loved BASKET CASE 2, because they just couldn't get enough of that cute little monstrosity Belial Bradley.
If you saw the first film first you would see that Belial tried to kill Duane because of jealousy but in this film they just brush it off like nothing happened and they tried to say it was an accident.
Definitely support Henenlotter, simply because the guy is awesome.
I gave this flick a 10, because I'm a big fan of b-movie "train wrecks".
Godzilla movies(not the Japanese ones), Ultraman and old kung-fu movies are enjoyable in much the same way as basket case 2: so bad that you sit there laughing hysterically because someone actually took themselves seriously when writing something completely asinine.
Supriningly much better than the first movie, due to the fact it was made with more money and people involved and because the movie luckily doesn't take itself serious at all.
I don't understand the whining about plotholes and other negativity because this is simply a great film with a nice reference to Invasion of the Body Snatcher, with Donald Sutherland in optima forma!
I wish more sci fi fans would know this movie because it deserves a lot more fame than it got.
I love this film, because I do.
Some people say that this is a theatrical film because of its dialogues and locations, and i think itÂ´s true, but whatÂ´s the matter?.
Martin (Hache) is one of the best films because the plot is about feelings, about the relationship between humans.
That happened to me today when I saw MartÃ­n (Hache), commenting on movies is a very subjective thing to do, you can like a movie even if it's a flick just because you needed someone to tell you what the movie is saying in that exact moment.
Aside from frothy romantic comedies like "The Awful Truth," people just didn't get divorced because they were fed up with their spouses.
Ignore the negative reviews about what a disappointment it is, because the people who write those reviews don't have their own opinion, it's nothing but people repeating the Coppola myth of losing his touch.
And because he focuses on perfecting his art and not making millions of dollars.
Maybe because the film bombed the two actresses never became really big in American movies.
The argument that kicks off the split is atrociously written and just as badly acted Â you've seen more vicious spats on The Dick Van Dyke Show Â and because we never buy it for a moment the film is handicapped almost from the start.
Hollywood can never get the idea that a book is famous because people read it, because the author got "it" right the first time--in published form.
It was critically blasted when it was originally released because of the "high" cost at the time.
Still it's a shame, because the movie had all the potential to become a science-fiction classic in the style of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".
The 1982 release of One From the Heart was universally considered a disaster because, supposedly, its theatrical run closed after only a week.
That's why foreign films are good, because they are not bound by the formula.
In the original version there's very little dialog needed in the beginning because the song lyrics perfectly describe what's going on.
He created an entire world on set, something that resembles Vegas, but that I feel, extends a bit beyond that, someplace where love does exist (and Frederic Forrest and Terri Garr are great, because they do represent the average man and woman that want to surpass their mediocrity and have the dream, represented by the late Raul Julia and the gorgeous Nastassja Kinski).
I think it was because the writer wanted to end the story, but didn't know how to end it logically.
Before this, one of the key sequences is the one when the four protagonists are together in the hotel room because in this moment, the persona of Jean Marie and especially Nicole is well construed and defined.
Is it because he lost his closest human being in the world (Marilyn) that he settles to Nicole and Jean-Marie?
The film succeeds because of low-keyed acting (Merhar and Miou-Miou), the sombre yet mesmerising music and good mise-en-scene.
Disney better continue to play this film, because if they don't, I have no idea whats going on in their heads.
It is one of my favorite Disney Channel Original Movies because it has a plot that you can follow.
It also has a lot of people in the movie, making it a movie that all people can relate to because there is lots of different types of people as well.
I liked it also because even though the family cast may not be the best of actors and actresses, they put together a family type of feeling that makes it seem like they are a family, even though they are not.
They are the typical type of a younger brother and sister that nag you and annoy you mainly because they are bored.
I enjoyed the movie because of the slight comedy, mystery, and some suspense.
This is a shame, because while his films aren't for everybody, psychotronic fans will love them.
Hopefully this will get a DVD release or replay on TV, because I keep telling people about it.
Jury justice in a world that is so deeply cut in small antagonistic pieces does not work in any sensitive delicate case because of any kind of un-namable bias having to do with race, wealth, age, sex, sexual orientation, and any other parameter you may think of.
I am not sure though that the conclusion of "Romeo and Juliet" is the proper one here: "They are all Punished", because in Romeo and Juliet's case there was no trial, and especially no jury trial.
It certainly was not to add information about a homicide because the witness had never met Peterson face to face nor had any direct contact with the defendant or his family.
(I suggest you read this after having seen the film) I don't know if what I'm gonna say can be regarded as a "spoiler", because after all, this is a documentary and maybe a lot of people know what happened.
I won't even go so far as to say that Michael Peterson didn't murder his wife, because after all I wasn't present at the trial (and even that isn't always a guarantee for justice) and I've only been offered this material in the form of a documentary (by French film maker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade) of about 6 hours.
Not because the prosecutors showed he was guilty, but because he's bisexual, quite rich and white (a majority of the jurors and the judge were black), and because, well, let's face it, the juror system simply doesn't work.
Arkin claims he is impotent because of the tyranny of his father and the fact that he is the hated high school basketball coach whose team can't even win one game.
I really related to the teens in the movie primarily because most of them were dealing with and going through problems that I had.
Though it loses momentum at times, the movie never loses my interest because of it's strong characters, great musical numbers, and its fanciful--though a bit unrealistic--depiction of this teen-drama-summer camp world that I barely knew existed.
Kudos to the editor (Lawrence Maddox) because this thing moves.
Show this to the kids at USC, because this film is a primer on how to get it done cheap.
The program does not include interviews with Germans who were involved in the war and occupation in Russia, although this is to be expected because of the focus of the documentary.
I lament the days of "Arthur," where you missed some of the jokes in the theater because the audience was laughing so hard, "Night Shift," and "Seems Like Old Times."
Even at a "crappy movie night" because there just isn't any entertainment value whatsoever.
Decided to view this film simple because of the title and I was probably thinking about Lon Chaney and his many faces of Horror.
Don't believe that just because you're a "comedy fan" (as one reviewer put it) that you'll somehow be rolling in the aisles at this.
Since you'll probably watch this at home, expect to walk out of your house, because the whole thing will be poisoned.
It is a mystery to why I bothered even watching this film because I knew perfectly well that any film shown at 3 o'clock is not going to be remotely entertaining.
Kay The Master of Disguise was funny the first time I saw it because I can take kiddish humor.
I wonder if this looked good on paper because that cherry pie man was a little childish even for this movie, not to mention stupid.
I have friends who are my age and love this movie and I can't believe it because it's so stupid but they adore it and think I'm crazy for not liking it.
I am only giving this movie a one out of ten because it actually finished before I ended up a drooling mess in the corner of the room .We found this 'comedy' on TV and thought we would give it a chance cos it had Dana Carvey in it and it might have been entertaining , how wrong we were .
I have to think the caretakers of those who enjoyed the movie wrote the review for them because nobody with a IQ higher than 50 could have thought anything other than this movie was an incredible disaster.
However, I hope he gets another chance in the next few years with a supporting role in a better movie, because "The Master of Disguise" is so much of a disappointment I feel embarrassed for Dana Carvey.
I was hitting the pause button just because I *had* to look.
I guess so, because it happened over and over again.
By the way, not many great comedy movies make sense or adhere to logic all the time because they need not do that, they are just suppose to be funny.
Word must have got around, because we were the only ones there, but on the other hand it was one of the smaller theaters in a multiplex cinema on a workday.
Actually it added to the whole experience because we could laugh as loud as we wanted.
Sitting through this movie is completely worthless because everything that appears to be funny is in the trailer.
I gave it a '1' because I couldn't find the zero button.
However, I think this film has a strike against it from the outset and that is because the CARS characters aren't as endearing or timeless as many of the other Pixar creations.
Big Bad Wolf is an OK way to pass 90 odd minutes, I can't say that I overly liked it because of the talking Werewolf & an all to predictable & obvious plot which feels padded.
Not because of the violence, which was as over the top as one might expect, but because of the implication that sexual violence against women is somehow humorous.
OK soi found this in wal mart ...and for fathers day i said hey get me that ...lol... and im glad ... it was a good change of pace for genre ....cursed was cool and a good film because of the changes they made to the idea ... and this film was the same ...a funny p issed off wolf guy ..making jokes while killing people and the gore was pretty good .... better than expected ... im saying a full 10 here it had it all ... a funny bad guy ( not cheesy to much), good gore, naked chicks (can never go wronge there) story line was pretty good and the acting wast bad .... so i say if your into the whole angry wolf guy killing maiming and "touching people in the bad place" ....lol..then check it out (4), vocalist - GOD IN A MACHINE
Sadly, the girl in it is closer to Bree from Neighbours during her goth phase than a convincing looking tough girl but I'll let that slide because it made me laugh.
Since they're all based around a centuries-old legend, there's generally not much room for originality without fans crying foul because "that's not what werewolves do!"
Rating this 8/10 because I had a good time watching.
Just because some of you will want to know... the girls are cute and all but one have real breasts.
Hunters Blood is a great movie with plenty of action, some really gory images along the way and the cast do a fantastic job, Mason is my favourite, he's played by Clu Gulager but i'm being biased because he was great in "Return of the living dead".
His girlfriend thinks that Tommy Dommasi is difficult and he doesn't get along with his grandfather because he doesn't believe all that spiritual and superstitious stuff.
The gunplay is excellent and the guns themselves are different because they are alive and very different to earthly guns, mainly because he is aboard a alien spaceship.
The gore is very important to the game because without it the atmosphere will feel dull and pedantic.
Defying gravity was one of the fun things in this game but it can get weird sometimes because you have to shoot in a way which would make your brain dizzy and fuzzy.
Prey is enjoyable and somewhat stupid because when the enemy is about to throw a grenade they call out, "Grenade" and then you can easily avoid it.
I enjoyed Prey because it was not hard or too confusing.
I usually don't consider graphics when playing a game because I'm one of those people who prefer game play over graphics, but Prey had me astounded.
The voice-acting in Prey is also brilliant, which is good because bad voice-acting can spoil a game (Final Fantasy X-2 anyone?).
The storyline is terrific and really drags you in, and at one point in the game actually had me not wanting to click my mouse to fire my weapon, because of what would happen.
Of course quite easy and pre-scripted, because Prey doesn't wish to come across hard to get or sophisticated, but, lo and behold, simply fun.
I always seem to get hooked on programs that are canceled early on in the season and I know it is because I am the only one who watches the show.
Unfortunately, because i really liked it.
Well, I initially saw this movie because I am a major Carrie fan and I wanted to see another movie with Amy Irving when she was still young.
I always thought that john Cassevetes is a little overrated because I've never seen him display a personality that is incredibly enjoyable(even with Rosemary's baby) and in this movie he was his usual negotiating boring self.
Overall I thought the film was pretty good, 2 1/2 mainly because of the acting, special effects, and the way some scenes just looked so cool!
I always laugh out loud at this transition--because of course the director is just softening us up for the greatest horror climax in movies.
I actually found this to be more of a Comedy, but that's OK because it was highly enjoyable, and I think this should be higher then 6.0, plus the ending is absolutely hilarious!.
He is so much of a threat that he causes a section of a ferris wheel to crash into a building because the guys were Middle Eastern (A trigger for what happened in Israel to his father).
So basically, Robin had committed a "hate crime," killing them because they were Middle Eastern men.
Thus, "The Fury" suffered because it was not an inspired choice for a man who knew better, but for whatever circumstances decided to go ahead with this project.
Because it won't sell overseas (see some of the comments from the colonies on this one) and because it's hard to categorise by dull marketing types the show got next to no advertising and was thrown on at something like 11pm on a Thursday evening.
I first watched this show about 4-5 years ago, I had bought it on DVD because I had heard such great things about it.
(Garth Marenghi) says:  You know what Sanch, you can dissect a heart, but you'll never know what makes it skip a beat  This programme, for me is pure genius, because Matt Holness, has really nailed the genre on its head.
That's too bad, because I'm sure they could have come up with another set of six fantastic episodes.
I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea but well worth trying because if it is you're in for one of the funnier half hours of television you'll see all week.
This movie is great because, there's two Jackie!
8/10 stars, only because it is a feel good movie.
I tripped through the hallways with everyone else singing "Let's Hear It For The Boy" because it was on the radio eighty-four thousand times a day.
My beloved husband won't watch this with me because he can't quit cringing at the 80's music.
First, I wanted to see the movie because I missed it in the 80's.
So interesting to see all the ways the film was almost scuttled, including the "wrong ending" the otherwise savvy director insisted on giving it, and the studio executive who said she would never, never approve of the casting of Kevin Bacon because he was not ****able enough.
The only thing I have to say is that it is so SAD that Chris Penn Died who played Willerd in the movie when I found that out I almost cried because he was found some were in Hollywood and it was i heart attack and he did gained a lot of weight since the movie footloose it you got to his name on this site you will get all the info about his death.
Just because it isn't "Doctor Zhivago" or "Lawrence of Arabia" doesn't mean it's a bad film.
I saw it 10 years ago, several times because of its watchability.
Having said that, this is one of my favorite movies because of that good message and, more importantly, because of the way in which it is presented.
Usually, the kids have no apparent concrete reason to be battling the adults and the adults merely want to be obeyed because they are adults - they don't appear to have any desire to actually do what's best for the kids.
In the end they are willing to consider change not because they are convinced the changes are necessarily right, but because they respect and trust their kids.
They do so because they respect and trust their parents.
Most people like this movie because of Kevin Bacon & the great soundtrack.
I love Kenny Loggins because he performs great music.
Its also funny because lots of people fainted because they thought they saw Jackie Chan twice, one after another.
It really is a crummy movie, but oddly engaging... mainly because it is so incredibly surreal and laughable in how it takes itself so seriously.
While this film is not as inherently horrible as say, Xanadu, it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously.
Let's pretend it's not because Kevin Bacon isn't there in his stupid outfit to scream "Let's Daaaaaaaance!!!!!!!!
But in reality because the song playing is the Loverboy guy and Ann Wilson's "Almost Paradise."
Who should see this film:  -- Teens with nothing better to do on a rainy day  -- People reliving the 1980s, you won't be disappointed to  see this one again  I'll give Footloose a 9 out of 10 because it cheered me up on a day I needed it.
For me, Sidewalks worked because the characters worked together.
Pulled from an earlier release date because of 9/11, this film couldn't have made you feel more at home in New York than actually being there in person.
My thought is that Tucci stood out because nobody else was reaching the bar.
That television program was exciting to me because of the city and because you believe anything can happen in that city.
It's not one of these pretentious, "Blair Witch"-type projects where we're watching a big old mess, but we're supposed to give it acclaim because it costed below a million bucks.
It was a snowy Sunday and I went to see this film because I am missing New York so much out here in Reno, Nevada.
I have no idea why people wouldn't want to see this film because of what happened.
I wonder how much of it was scripted and how much of it was ad-libbed, because there was a very natural feel to the way the characters expressed themselves.
I personally believe these films can be liked by everybody because their films that everybody, at some point, will relate to.
Tommy is miffed because he gave up his own digs to move in with her, at her request.
This is very effective because it bring us closer to the characters and helps set the scenes with a more direct approach.
Still wondering if we need to compare this film with "Beautiful Thing".I guess because they're both british and coming of age?
However, Get Real with all it's faults, saves itself because it gives you good insight of how others feel being alianated, estranged and how to deal with society for being themselves.
From the beginning it is not to compare with "Beautiful Thing" because it addresses somewhat older characters and its humor and dialogs are less general and more mature.
The settings make this movie look "real" and might tend to make people uneasy about the story because it seems people don't really get their way - no matter how they try.
That makes for good comedy because this is how life is when you constantly overreach: You make a fool of yourself.
!- already seen in The Browning Version...) The screenplay is so interesting, a lot more than Beautiful Thing's, we can feel Johnny and Steve's emotion, the fear of being "discovered" because of the reactions of all those stupid people... Johnny's difficulty to admit what he's...
I find that the character, John Dixon, is the most fascinating of the two boys because he is living a double life.
I found it to be a much more recognisable film for me than Brokeback Mountain, Not to that films detriment, it is a masterpiece but I may feel closer to this because I have regularly been to the Odean in Basingstoke, but have never herded sheep on a snowy mountainside with Jake Gyllenhall.
But if you try to take it any deeper, then you'd have to consider the internal struggles of John Dixon, the object of Steven's desire, because that is one of the few places in this movie where something is at stake.
And that is a shame, because if there ever was reason to give up everything for love, Ben Silverstone would be it.
This movie will stick with me forever, and no doubt moved up to my top favorite movie of all time because of its similarity with my life and my own homosexuality.
The two main characters of this film struggle to maintain a relationship, because they are in love - yet ultimately the homophobic attitudes of the world force them to part.
Christmas movies are supposed to be kind of cliched, they have to be because Christmas has become a cliche to most people.
I say mystery son because it is never explained if the son is from a bad marriage, out-of marriage, widowed, etc.
Sound simple enough because we also got a dolphin-sophomore who is belemic and a professor with a 9 foot hairdo.
Reviewing this movie is hard because it's meant to be bizarre and there is tons of imagination and moments where the humor works but it's just so weird.
His impersonations remains vividly embedded in my brain because besides the look and mannerisms, I perceived the soul of the characters in question.
This is a prime example of just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
If someone says, don't watch the film because....!
Loving Evangeline did not have the marriage resolution and I would not have pegged our hero as a typical Mills and boon man but the film did keep me going because of the competency of the actors and a none too taxing storyline so I did like it!!
It made little sense to me, not because of a complicated storyline, but because I could not bear to pay much attention to it.
I would give it 1/4 of one star it is that bad, and I only give it that because Stephen Baldwin was so good in "The Usual Suspects" and his brother Alec is so good on the show "30 Rock."
First of all, because Susan Sarandon is so unattractive in this film (yes, I know she's supposed to be unattractive) I had no rooting interest in seeing these two characters get together.
I actually tuned in because of James Spader... having just seen him in "Secretary" renewed my curiosity.
I just bought the movie because it has James Spader in it.
I know I don't watch movies because of people's looks but if it wasn't for Spader I'd have never seen this one...
Susan Sarandon's performance as the waitress is a winner because she shows her as fearless, dynamic, and flawed..but she doesn't ask for pity and accepts that life doesn't always deal everyone a great hand.
I do NOT think Sarandon looked unattractive here as people have said but if she did, it really doesn't matter because the focus of the story has little to do with physical attractiveness.
The reason why I watched this movie was because I'm truly one of the biggest Susan Sarandon fans.
I bet you do"and Nora answers: "And I bet you don't" You must see the look on Sherri's face  I think it's a great movie because normally hollywood is afraid of a love story about a young man and an older woman.There should be more of those movies because some people think it's strange when a older woman has a love relation with a much younger man.
If you haven't seen it yet you need to because it is just wonderful.
I nearly gave this a miss because of its inane title, poor reviews, and unknown (to me anyway) actors and Director.
He does this because he believes it can be done to save the lives of those young Americans dying needlessly in an unjustifiable war in Vietnam.
There are moments in the film that remind us of things you will recall or be fascinated to know because you didn't really know the truth then.
And it's as appropriate now because we are again locked in a front page war that was so similar.
I could go on because I really liked this movie.
In short, this was an excellent movie, mainly because of Tierney and Brody.
I only watched this movie because of Adrien Brody and Moira Tierney of ER fame.
You want to save her, but you know, even if you had the possibility to get to know her in real life, you couldn't, because in a sick way it fascinates you to just watch.
If you can, you shoud get the DVD because It has director commentary along with the two lead actors, Maura Tierney (who is amazing) and Adrian Brody (also amazing).
Just because a film has big stars and is pushed as a "hot new release" in a video store doesn't mean anything (goodness, haven't you learned that by now, folks?).
Never heard of any of the rest of the cast except for Melanie Shatner as the receptionist, and that's only because she's Bill's daughter.
My rating of 3 out of 10 is extremely generous, mainly just because David Gale was a cool dude who never got the good roles he deserved, apart from once in "Re-Animator".
Where the whole world is holding its breath because of the upcoming 2004 election, it is refreshing to watch this TV series.
Not only because of the superb acting of Pamela Reed & Michael Murphy and each and every one of the ensemble (something we almost take for granted with Altman pictures, which always give sublime acting) and the great writing, but also because it gives non-Americans some insight in Political USA.
I don't know why it took so long for someone to pair "Doonesbury" writer Garry Trudeau with Altman, because in retrospect, it seems like a match made in heaven.
On the one hand, they're of supreme importance, because they determine who will be the leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world.
It is often said that these early Lumiere shorts are primitive because they have not yet mastered basic film grammar, such as camera movement, editing or the close-up, films like these being a simple, static set-u;, the camera pointing at the scene from a middle distance.
Basically, never watch this movie because it wastes time.
I'm glad Ms. Arquette, the actress, got to interview her because only an actress can say, "It is a honor to meet you" to Yoko Ono.
Many folks 60 years old and older may want watch this because many of these musicians interviewed are musicians/singers/songwriters that generation grew up with and may want to know how they're doing these days, be surprised they're still alive, may want to know how they felt about working in the industry in their day, and how their kids turned out when they weren't even home to see them grow up.
i only really watched this film because i was on holiday in boring Yorkshire with nothing to do what so ever.
It was sad because of Casey's mother, but it made a great story of friendship.
It should have been put into theatres because it is SO much fun, and you can watch it with Family, friends, Anyone...and it NEVER gets boring!
RENT the film, actually, BUY the film because whenever your bored or feeling low, this film has enough comedy to make you feel better again.
Tyra Banks also stars, which is good because it's great to see an actress who had higher aspirations take roles like this to show they are humble and don't take themselves too seriously.
Why, because Catholics are taught that the only way to God is through the priest and other Christians are taught that believing in God, his teachings and the teachings of Jesus Christ is what gives you salvation.
I gave this movie a 4/10 only because I loved to see black actors working I only wish they could find some other films to exhibits their crafts.
I have only just seen this movie and it really touched my heart because some of the things that Michelle went through I went through.
There should be no compromise because that child is in the world because of your choice.
Negative commentary about it for me is hard to do, because the choices the characters made in this film aren't always good ones, but it's what the character would do in real life.
i only purchased it because corinna harney is in it, but she doesn't even get naked!!!
-- The star going AWOL for two weeks and being allowed back by a sympathetic manager because of a "woman."
I guess so because she grew up in Vegas.
As it happens, Neel is condemned to death, but can't be executed because the law requires that he be beheaded and there is no guillotine on the island, nor is there an executioner.
Do we do good because that is our nature or because we are fulfilling a desire to be good?
While yes, I do question the artists that are complaining about the $$ they are losing because of downloading, etc.
More than anything it gave me hope that some artists of the past/present are still trying to make contact and teach those of the present into the future because they care about where the quality of music goes.
He must wait because the town has no guillotine and must get one from Martinque.
Her husband is the warden of the penitentiary (Daniel Auteuil) under Paris headquarters but technically has jurisdiction because they are not in Paris so he allows the condemned to be at his wife's disposal because he supports her and they love each other, which is seen as signs of weakness by the ferocious Paris French Republic putting pressure on the local Republic making such questions arise: do humans make the law or does the law make us?
The film is very interesting and gives us insight into life on the isolated island of St. Pierre (a French possession near New Foundland) and because the story, it seems, is based on a true story!
I liked the film because it dared to be different, had something to say and featured excellent acting and dialog--and this combination definitely doesn't happen very often.
I could not but think of such works as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment or such films as Schindler's List, because I am fascinated by the portrayals of seemingly ordinary people put in situations of fundamental moral choice.
I thought this movie was phenomenal because it expressed the best of human nature in such real ways.
A mix of the cowardice of civilian authorities and the pettiness of outposts officials who stick to "principals" and decisions just because they do not want to loose face... killing becomes a way to wash the humiliations of their crummy existence and low wits.
Moreover, they prove to be unscrupulous because when a new inhabitant settles on the island, they entrust him the role of the executioner without taking care of his opinion.
Buoyed by a more than palatable cast with a special mention to Emir Kusturica who was a discerning choice because he could convey vulnerability and fragility to his persona of great strapping man, "La Veuve De Saint Pierre" may be derivative if we consider the theme of redemption and the thrust quoted in the fourth paragraph but its treatment is a far cry from Hollywood's formulaic conventions.
A beautifully crafted somber film, "Widow..." is recommended for mature audiences because a measure of maturation is required to appreciate all this austere film has to offer.
The actions of two men on a drunken spree turns out to be fatal for the man who is being harassed because he dies as a consequence of a fight with his two tormentors.
The film works because the brilliant performance of Juliette Binoche, who as Madame La, makes her mark in the picture.
She has come hunting it because it will wipe out the human race.
I like it principally because of Ta'ra (d'Abo's character).
This is partly because Maryam d'Abo is absolutely gorgeous, complete with her catsuit and beautiful voice, but more to the point because of the depth of the role she is given and the skill with which she pulls it off.
I love the film ASOKA because it was a very special film!
Originally, I am from Kerala India and I really enjoyed watching Kallari because I haven't seen any films with Kallari since I have moved to Alaska.
If Jackson looked bored it was because his character was bored -- alive but not living -- and Jackson pulled it off very well.
Then there's Kareena Kapoor (credited as Karriena Kapoor, in her first pair up with SRK and looking more voluptuous than her skinnier self now) as Kaurwaki, the princess who together with the king-in-waiting Prince Aryan (Sooraj Balaji) and their trusted general Bheema (Rahul Dev) are in hiding because of a plot from someone in the democratic senate out to murder them to take over the throne.
The film paints a very emotional Asoka that Shah Rukh Khan excelled in bringing out, especially when three women in his life played an important part in his life-changing decisions, such as his mom's involvement for him to see the outside world, Kaurwaki in being his first true, and unattainable love that he yearns and pines for, and his eventual wife Devi (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a Buddhist who would be instrumental in his embracing of the religion after coming to his senses in the aftermath of his most brutal war waged just because of his insatiable appetite for more territory, though of course done in the name of uniting India.
However, the story flaws because Asoka's story has been made for a movie which is the only problem I have with the movie (More on this later).
That sucks because this movie was so good, but that flaw always interferes whenever I see the movie (even though the movie states it is not a true story).
Overall Thoughts-  The film's greatest trademark are its Cinematography & Art Direction which hold really strong from start to finsih, and this was easily expected from this film because you have two masterminds working on it side by side.
The first half of the film is so-so because of its poor film editing.
He inherits a sword (with a thirst for blood) that was cast off into the stream by his grandfather who was tired of seeing battle and war, and from that day on Asoka becomes the envy of his stepbrothers because he trains himself to be invincible on the battlefield.
Personally, I am biased towards commercial Indian cinema because it holds much more of a mystique.
Sadly, because of the image that commercial Indian cinema holds in the USA, it may never see the wide audience that this film so deserves.
Because of the need for Indian cinema to appeal to as wide an audience as possible (the "all-India film"), and because film-going in India is a family experience, films try to appeal to all members of the family.
This means that violent scenes can turn into comedy, many genres are often combined, and there is neither sex nor nudity, not even kissing on the lips, because of a puritanical society.
He didn't kill his brother because he was so vicious but because of how he was treated.
Brigitte Lin is a masculine, abusive, violent cop, who picks a high paid gigolo because she can control, beat, and threaten him to behave.
I suppose a modest production budget made this film look like a typical gritty English crime thriller, with the hand held camera bringing the audience into the thick of the action, either slowly drawing some sympathies from the lead female characters because of the lack of options made available to them, including being on the run, or presenting a sense of clear and present danger up close, especially when pimps Derek (Johnny Harris) and Chum (Nathan Constance) become inevitably close in catching up with the duo for an event they committed, kept closely under wraps.
We see how Kelly takes it upon herself as the surrogate guardian of Joanne, but I suppose only because of the immense guilt that she brought to the table, for having again out of desperation, introduce a young girl into her dark underworld.
We don't know what made the characters into the people they are - and I found myself increasingly detached at the end, because of the clear impossibility of a happy ending.
Though it is sometimes hard to watch because of the graphic violence, the film conveys a sense of humanity that shines through the despair.
Once we got to the scene in the field, at the end, we knew that he wasn't going to shoot Joanne, because of the heart-to-heart they'd had in the car.
We also suspected that he wasn't going to shoot Kelly, if only because she'd been so sympathetically portrayed throughout.
So we assume that he's going to shoot the pimp (because he'd been portrayed as thoroughly unsympathetic throughout).
Kelly asks Joanne to stay there because she will raise some money for them to travel to Brighton.
If there is a distinct shrill ringing throughout us as the film plays out, it's because while conforming to gangster genre conventions, we see most of the world and most of the film unfold through the eyes and ultimately with two females: a very young girl and a middle aged woman, two people we feel are under threat and will have harm come to them if they're caught.
But as the story unfolds we grow to like both the key characters because they have been forced into their predicament, and while they will be helpless for much of their plight their spirit will hold and eventually ring true.
Films like this make me cheer, because it is rare that a film aims so high and hits all of its marks.
Sometimes they don't get the credit they deserve because we love to hate them, but without them, you can't pull as hard for the good guys as you would, and Johnny Harris in particular pulls off the sleazy, evil, slightly thick Derek with remarkable effectiveness, wearing the characters immorality on his shirtsleeve and fairly stinking up the joint in the best possible way.
Perhaps because no American director today could conceivably do anything so lean and mean as Paul Andrew Williams' 2006 feature, US critics have been quite insensitive to what in 2006 a Guardian critic called "the British film of the year."
It's like becoming an emergency room doctor because you are fascinated with suffering and blood.
Lorraine Stanley, Georgia Groome, Johnny Harris, and Sam Pruell, your names, I hope, will get to be known outside of England, because you all excellently realised characters that reminded me of people I have encountered during my life.
Kelly asks Joanne to stay there because she will raise some money for them to travel to Brighton.
London to Brighton is notable because it places a 13 year old actor in one of the leading roles.
The plot is left best unspoiled because it is gradually unfolded through well-positioned flashbacks, arguably the goldmine of the film.
Other than the perfectly-cast Groome, the director told us that he applied no seriousness to finding the 'perfect people' for the respective characters: the guy in the green jeep, for example, was cast because "he had a green jeep".
Maybe I am biased because my favorite actor is in this movie, but let's face it, this is a role that was practically custom-made for him to play, and the supporting cast (Twinkle Khanna and Johnny Lever) have great chemistry with him.
I feel these are not overdone (though they had the potential) because of the clever lines also sprinkled in between scenes.
Am I biased because I'm a Shah Rukhaholic?
The title song was a sadly unnoticed song because it's awesomely presented.
I love watching this movie because it's just so funny.
Sharukh Khan was fantastic in the film and so was Jhonny Lever.My favourite part in the film is when Sharukh Khan lies to Twinkle Khanna about being blind and Sharukh Khan and Jhonny Lever and they partners pretend that Sharukh Khans house is the hospital.I also enjoyed the fighting parts because it was well put together.
These dopes actually change their mind about going back home and decide to continue fighting just because some Jap taunted them over the radio!
The story "God is my Co-Pilot" actually begins in the summer of 1942 with USAF ace Col. Scott, Dennis Morgan, depressed and heart-broken because he can't be part of a major air assault against Japanese forces in China.
this after he was rendered useless as a combat pilot because of his nerves being shattered, from the combat missions he already flew, and the tropical illnesses he contracted in China.
At least it got some well-deserved recognition outside the Netherlands, although I'm not sure how the movie performed across the pond- but I guess it stirred things up quite a bit in the US because of its daring content.
This film gets lost in its own pretentiousness because of its lack of content and genuine emotional depth.
Her real dream is to be a writer, but because of her mother she never had the self-confidence to become one.
was a real strange one, that was because of the director Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen died just two days before the premiere.
I had a real double feeling about it because I'm a big fan of him so it was difficult the give an objective judge about the movie right away.
I wanted so much to see the film especially because of Monic Hendrickx, but the film was not subtitled yet for English.
I hope this film is more widely recognized because it was perfect in every way.
This film is a delicate and thoughtful celebration of life, not only because of the beautiful rendering of family-life in its highs and lows but also because of the uplifting message director Van De Sande Bakhuysen leaves with his audience.
I'm going to see if she has done comedy because she was the lead in two very dramatic, soul searching but sad roles.
In fact, because of the studied character development and believable reactions, the film actually earns every single melodramatic moment and so the one truly emotional moment has a lot of potency going for it, despite how simple it is.
The DVD was re-dubbed because a few seconds of episode 2 where nagisa gropes shuns younger brother were cut out in the dub but left in the sub VHS.
And at that point you conveniently omit that one odd session out, because it was that unenjoyable.
The Elf mage was interesting but underused, the female barbarian was there solely for eye candy (though she did a pretty good job with her lacking part), and the cleric was there because someone apparently thought clerics were useless.
I'm giving an extra half star for the effort and genuinely noble intentions of the filmmakers who did try to make it closer to the rpg and because I've seen worse.
What is nice about this movie is that it is simply trying to be itself, and the "feel of D&D" comes through nicely because of that.
He was very happy to have D&D well represented in the movie, was pleased with the over all effects and the fact that the cleric didn't use edged weapons, that the elven wizard couldn't cast everything just because she was a wizard...and more things that I can't remember off hand.
If you never played D&D but you are a general fantasy fan, get this movie because it's the most fantasymovie you have seen since Lord of the Rings.
The first D&D movie was largely hated by D&D players, partly because it wasn't a good movie, but also because it was not very much like D&D the game.
Perhaps because of the cool reception of the first, this was changed dramatically in the sequel.
The first movie also suffered from this problem, but in this movie, it's probably because most of the actors are new, this generally being their first film.
I have to admit that Johnny Yune is a talented comedian, who once had a thriving career in South Korea, but he comes-off almost as bad as Garrett Wang (the dysmal, one-dimensional Asian ensign on "Voyager"), because he is shown less as a human being, and more as a degenerate foreigner struggling in a thriving western world!
There is no reason to take this movie seriously, because it is just a straight up comedy with a very action parody style plot.
Get set for all the zany fun in this hilarious comedy about an Asian immigrant that everyone calls "Bruce," because of his resemblance to the legendary Bruce Lee.
I mean this guy is unique in the way he represents the dumb guy, because he's genuine!
I think this duet, Samuel L Jackson and Eugene Levy, worked out very well, because they are both excellent actors, and they represent very well the tough and the dumb guy respectively.
I liked this movie not just because it shows an important part of our history, but because it helps others (non Hungarians) to understand us better.
Agent Vann thinks Andy is robbing the store, because one of the bad guys gives Andy a gun.
Sometimes, I don't like historical movies, because I know what comes next, but here, I never knew what can come in the following spot.
We love the smooth lines of Kata Dobo's face, and we are a fan of her not because of her talent - so no complaints here... however, Ivan Fenyo excels throughout the movie and I'm looking forward a lot seeing his next title.
He died because he was killed by a machine gun".
Maybe therefore our present post-communist government is not so pleased with this film because they feel that their predecessors played a very brutal role in our history.
Maybe I have a soft spot for this movie, because it scened in my mother country.
I never appreciated her - never saw any movie where she didn't pose in lingerie - but after this I have to say, she has to run around in lingerie because in clothes, there's nothing touching in her, nothing that makes you believe what she says, no emotions on her face whatever.
Jackson suggests they get a burger, but Levy doesn't want to, because red meat doesn't agree with his stomach.
That's a pity because photographically it's one of the finest things ever put on celluloid stock.
However, far from having to be persuaded to join the rescue attempts, Amundsen had immediately volunteered only for Mussolini to specifically insist he be excluded because of his earlier public disputes with Nobile in the aftermath of their previous expedition, leaving Amundsen to finance his rescue attempt privately.
This is possible because of the storytelling device of having everything unfold in flashbacks by the main character General Nobile (Peter Finch).
Ultimately, things happen (both good and bad) not because of the challenge of man versus nature, but because of the placement and misplacement of human resources (i.e.
Good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes, usually those were given to B westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic.
In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war.
Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot.
Doug Jr. as Nikita Krasnoff is perfect, probably because he was the only actor on the Warners lot in 1932 with enough sex appeal to get away with what he got away with in the movie (i.e.
However Eastwood finds it hard to be a police officer in the red light district because his urges get the better of him.
And 'Tightrope' is exactly that kind of movie, although atmosphere is a bit darker than usual in Clint Eastwood's detective movies, which is a very good thing because the more darker the atmosphere in these kind of crime-mystery-thriller movies gets they get more exciting to watch.
This time we are supposed to believe it because the killer was a cop.
It's maybe nothing new (and been repeated quite a bit) in its genre, but because of first-rate performances and it being sinisterly edgy.
This is because most of the picture takes place during the nightlife, amongst the sleazy locations of New Orleans with indistinct lighting and prowling figures hanging around in the shadows.
This is because the more he gets close to the killer, the more he slowly learns they have much in common and the sleazy ways start to get the better of him.
The more conventional opening section of TIGHTROPE is distinctly misleading, largely because about half way through, the film's most interesting character (played by the truly excellent GENEVIEVE BUJOLD) comes much more to the fore.
yes, they sell the liquor, because on the left of the monk using a laptop there is a letter in French from a Wines and Liquors company (seen for 5 seconds).
Your friend's video would be better than "Into Great Silence" because no friend would make you sit through three hours of a bad holiday video.
I am devastated that this film didn't do better because I would have loved to see a sequel even though it never would have matched this one.
It's just plain and silly fun and worth seeing because it will make you laugh.
And because there is no attempt to explain the Carthusian vocation/way of life, viewers are left to learn this on their own.
I wouldn't call INTO GREAT SILENCE a documentary, because the film INTO GREAT SILENCE is an experience.
Sublime to its very hushed core, Into Great Silence does take some getting used to, specifically because the monks hardly utter a word; the beginning of the film is a four minute opening shot of a monk praying in his solitary room.
When Vann abducts the shocked Fidler and ingratiating him into the operation at hand well insert the laughter here folks because this is when and why it is supposed to be funny: a fish-out-of-water white tight-ass with an angry black street-smart cop team up to get the bad guy.
The message is simple and repeated over and over again because the contemplative life is simple and they spend their days trying to "grasp that which cannot be grasped": "Grace" and God.
Strangely, it made the animal rights people angry because there is a scene with Madonna's boyfriend bull fighting.
And you're beggars with moldy bread because of it.
The soundtrack features a lot of decent hard rock tracks(I'm not writing heavy metal, because of inane debates by metal-purists (mostly with ugly goatees) that these are not metal-songs.
Even the animation was a disappointment because it was so sub-par--more like a bad version of those forgettable Saturday morning Transformers cartoons that started running in the 80s--Warner Bros. and Disney did it much better decades ago.
I rented this because it was refereed to as one of the first adult-orientated cartoons.
It was fun because it was a cartoon with violence, gore, aliens getting high and naked chicks with big boobs.
That's probably because none of his lines are remotely funny.
I know that because it isn't funny (unless you think really badly handled fart jokes are good humor).
Anyway, I wonder if it was previously rated x in the very late 70's because the thing came out in 81.
I only know the name because when I change the channel to the channel it's on, it'll show the name) I'm gonna call them and ask them to put it back on direct TV.
That's because the frame-rate of HEAVY METAL is very, very low--resulting in an even jerkier and less animated style of animation.
I can't say the movie was a disappointment because I got what I expected from the trailer.
The villains were typical Cannell with mobsters to motorcycle gangs, but these two heroes made the endings, for me, much more satisfying because of the clever characters.
I only started watching again when Collin showed up because he brought humor once again.
This episode is my favourite because it best demonstrates the potential the show had to offer.
John Rhys-Davies was one of the original reasons for me watching the show because I saw him in "James Bond 007" "The Living Daylights" and "Indiana Jones".
I have watched all the series only because I stayed loyal to the show.
I saw the cartoon 'Page Miss Glory' on TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES for the first time in about 10 or 15 years and it brought back for me good memories of when I was a kid and a rushed home because I knew that the 'good' cartoons were going to be on Channel 5 here in New York.
I found Mughal-e-Azam beautiful because of Madhubala and the way she was presented.
Suchitra shows what we are missing because of that.
Their married life was not very successful, was it because of Indira's father's political ambitions (that Feroze a respected and righteous politicians interfered with) or because of some personal reasons is hard to guess, though several speculations do exist (especially from pro RSS historians who use any means to tarnish the name of the politically influential Gandhi family), and Feroze & Indira started living separately.
I love the movie because of the strong performances by Sanjeev Kumar and Suchitra Sen and the direction of Gulzar.
I can't say that this movie is a statement on the realities of life because the characters' circumstances are so specific that many would have a hard time relating.
3 out of 10 only because I like Q Tip.
I generally avoid films about politics, because I find that most of them are stereotypical and one-sided, but this one is directed by Gulzar so it can be nothing but excellent.
- The prison guard who sold out his own soul in desperation to support his family - losing his construction job to slave-wage in-mates because the operator chose to squeeze more greed to line his pockets.
Abbott and Costello join the army--mostly because they are running from the cops.
No kidding but what chance did the Japanese and Germans really have - sorry for identifying who the enemies were in these socially inclusive times, because they weren't in the film - to pit themselves against all this?
Director Arthur Lubin said that he pioneered the use of two cameras to cover scenes mainly because Costello was so off-the-wall and bounced all over the place so much that one camera simply couldn't contain him, so he ordered up another camera and had it trained exclusively on Costello.
But because of that the film doesn't drag for a second.
She likes the surfer boys because they're cute, but Menlo forces her to act as a lure, part of his insidious plot for revenge.
I love this movie because of the dialog.
You cannot find many movies of this genre that are worth seeing, usually because either the screenplay isn't that good or the actors performance is bad.luckily, in this movie everything works like a clock.Peter Ustinov gives us another great performance as he did in "EVIL UNDER THE SUN".The rest of the cast are not bad but some could have been a little bit better.
That's a bit of an inside joke because Peter Ustinov made his screen debut in David Niven's The Way Ahead and in the British army he was Niven's orderly back in the day.
When I first watched it, I thought that maybe Mia Farrow was the daughter of Maggie Smith (maybe because of the red hair) and somehow conspired.
Director John Guillerman let his great cast have fun with their characters partly because veteran thriller writer Anthony Shaffer wrote the screenplay.
I have always loved Agatha Christie novels because she never cheats in her mysteries.
This movie would be good if you like plays because it reminded me of one.
Quite a few misspelled words and I'm sure I missed the gist of multiple things because of the poor subs.
It is endlessly watchable because it understands what makes a film great.
Often overlooked by the general audience, this film probably should have been the action/comedy of the 80's, because in my eyes it is.
It stars Robert Deniro as Jack Walsh, a bounty-hunter who sets himself apart because he thinks that he has something that the people in his business usually don't have: "principles".
But what he does here is brave and courageous, and it pays off big time, as he ALLOWS the character of Walsh to GET THE LAUGHS based solely on WHO THE CHARACTER IS, because there is no change in the way he utters out his threats in this movie, from the way he did it in movies where he was far more scarier (i.e.
It provides Robert De Niro with a chance to show his comic side (don't worry if you like him mean and moody, because he gets to be that too).
It also provides Charles Grodin with one of the best roles of his career, mainly because this is not a simple-minded one-dimensional farce but an intricate mixture of gangster thriller, road movie and comedy.
However, Walsh realises that bringing the Duke in is not necessarily to his advantage, because the Mob bigwig from whom he embezzled the money is called Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), an old adversary of Walsh's.
There's a heck of a lot of swearing in the film (it might even set a record for the most bad language in a "light" comedy film) but because the actors deliver their lines with wit and relish, the abundance of cursing is surprisingly forgivable.
It's great that they choose Robert De Niro to play Jack Walsh, because he adds a great sadness to the character.
I gave it 10 out of 10, just because I couldn't find anything that was missing in this movie !!
Set pieces though are gloriously handled, and the helicopter sequence is quite as good as anything in a Bond movie -- a genre that has managed quite well without spraying profanities everywhere because it knows, and we know, none of it's real.
9/10 then for 'Midnight Run', because as an exercise in how to develop a movie, to establish characters and plot trajectories, to bring 'em all together in a final wrap up and still leave space for a minor plot twist, it's of textbook quality.
Someone please explain why this didn't clean up when it was released because I can't see anything else that came out in '88 that comes close to Midnight Run.
Not because I'm perverted you understand, but because it's so...kitsch, and seems to be indicative of the silly hedonistic LA scene of the early 1980s.
But I guess the real reason I liked this movie is because I decided two months ago to get into shape.
(We know he is good, because in the end he goes to jail for protecting a source).
Although Griffith directed more than five hundred pictures, almost all of which survive, he has a vast corpus of works that are rarely seen, because so many people concentrate on his best features and perhaps a dozen of his best-known shorts.
It's a drama that fascinates so much, because you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next.
He loves his wife Tess Ellis (Kate Hardie), but maybe because of his physical condition, she cheats him with the writer and her colleague Alex Madden (Rhys Ifans).
And that's not even because it's poorly executed or something.
In the 5-minute-long opening scene, this movie promises to be an action-packed (because of several guns at display) B-movie with an international software-smuggling plot.
Must have been because of Ironside, Madsen and Gruner's funny accent.
Its called Matador because that is the Danish name for the board game Monopoly.
I don't want to call it the WORST movie I have ever seen because I fear you will want to see it just to see how really bad it was (you know, driving by an accident, but slowing to take a look).
"La Fille seule" is an absolute gem of a film that is particularly fascinating because its structural simplicity belies a complex, multi-layered character study.
But everything that happens to Valerie is so very real and so very urgent because the film is shot in real time.
The lack of plot hardly mattered to me, because it's compensated by Virginie Ledoyen's radiant presence.
I strongly disagree that people say this film is rubbish because it is my favourite film.
Maybe it's just because I like Dan Aykroyd: I have never seen a movie with him that I did not enjoy.
I will admit that I didn't check this out because of Jay, but really instead because of Randy Quaid.
When I went to see this film I wasn't so sure, because I didn't know anybody in it.
The movie starts out with Andy, a complete and utter gambling addict, walking to the convenience store to buy a lottery ticket because he's feeling lucky.
After the movie movie ended, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it...which kind of stinks because I don't know anybody else who has seen it and I can't talk about it!
Indeed, one "genius" says that Hydrogen fueled cars won't ever work because the technology might not be fully ready for 30 to 50 years.
If you actually watch this POS (which I do recommend, if only to question it and learn how politically motivated movies can be) I'm sure you'll find dozens of other factual inaccuraciesÂ   Canada's extraction of oil from oil shale: One guy tells us it must only be happening because of growing desperation.
The public is taken for fools once again because of the actual shortage of intelligent people out there.
I won't begin to tell you about the ideas, opinions, and facts that this film brings to the screen, because you should see it for yourself.
The great thing is that these men and women talk about how vital oil and natural gas is to our financial existence, simply because it is so cheap.
It has impressed me so much that I have started going back to review history because of all the questions it has raised for me.
You totally feel how much Cary's character must want to jump her, because you so much want to jump her yourself!
The Awful Truth is an old-time humorous-type movie picture what your grandparents like to watch on the old-time movie channel because it takes 'em back some sixty years.
I especially loved the movie because I was not expecting such a movie in the thirties.
It looks much newer, mainly because of the jokes.
The judge grants a divorce with a waiting period of 90 days, during which they can't stay out of each other's lives, in part because of their shared custody of Mister Smith, their dog (who classic film fans will recognize as Asta from the Thin Man series).
I think we were a successful team because we enjoyed working together tremendously, and that pleasure must have shown through onto the screen," and Grant compliments her with "(Irene) had perfect timing in comedy and was the sweetest-smelling actress I ever worked with."
Overall this movie was fun and entertaining, although I personally think that the movie's success was rather exaggerated, because the story itself isn't all that great.
I'm surprised to read a recent post about the poor film quality on the DVD release, because this film showing in Paris was absolutely pristine!
Was this done by the director because of the Hays Code and how did the public react to all the innuendo about infidelity in the film at the time of release?
Irene Dunne and Cary Grant were wonderful together in this film as well as MY FAVORITE WIFE because the writing was so exceptional and the chemistry between them was terrific.
However, because of the chemistry, writing and excellent direction, it's almost magical.
It is also one of the simplest in plots and screenplays, because it does not require any attempts at conspiracy or hidden identities or mystery (say as in the comic mystery "The Thin Man", or in "His Gal Friday" - which also co-starred Cary Grant and Ralph Bellamy in somewhat similar character types).
The scene in the nightclub is funny because of how Compton's act embarrasses Grant, but he watches Bellamy jitterbug Dunne off the dance floor.
Jerry and Lucy Warriner (Irene Dunne & Cary Grant) are a married couple who get a divorce--their only point of contention appearing to be the custody of their dog "Mr Smith"--because Jerry thinks Lucy cheated on him with her vocal coach Duvalle (D'Arcy).
She doesn't clear up the misunderstanding as most sensible adults would because then the film itself wouldn't exist.)
More brutal because Pickens meets his demise.
Um, it was actually pretty sad if you watch it, because of the music, the most.
Then again if you enjoy watching badly conceived shows of old music, that you won't understand for the most part because of the foreign language, for one and a half hours then I guess this is paradise.
The idea here is that a police station is threatened to shut down, because in this smalltown there hasn't been a serious crime for ten years.
DonÂ´t crap it down people because it was a long time ago that i had such fun at the cinema!
She was cruel to Missy and her kids, she was using Missy just because she didn't want her divorce settlement to be worth peanuts without the dog, and based on the fact that she threatened to kill her babies, Missy should have bit Regina's rear, especially when Regina carried her away from her babies.
I'm glad the judge turned down Regina's claim for the dog because she really didn't deserve Missy in the first place.
This was because he saved Ryce (Nicholle Tom) from being raped.
In my opinion it was practically a miracle that the song got honored by the three biggest award firms because the movie is nothing special and a lot of times brilliance goes unnoticed when it is contained in a sub-par film.
It includes all of the best highlights from the film (the aforementioned cute dog scenes), you'll hear the incredible song and get glimpses of the stunningly cute Ashley Hamilton and not end up hating him because of the schmuck his character ends up being in the film.
I did it because when the wife is out, I watch stupid movies; it helps me to realize that I don't like stupid movies.
A very 70's show because of the music, cloths, social message, and characters.
Chiara Mastroianni, looking more like her father every day is also on hand to remind us what we lost when her father died and if she bears only a passing resemblance to her mother that's not so important because mum Catherine Deneuve is still very much with us.
It's doubtful if Chiara will ever achieve the iconic status of her parents but she gets acting jobs because casting directors and producers know she can deliver rather than because of her genes.
I think that every boys/mans and women in the world should watch this film...because it 's quite true...and you will learn a lot about the opposite sex;) it's also quite original in the way it is filmed, the interviews...you have a lot of different point of views which are quite representative ...I'm speaking about women's point of view, of course...and i wonder if it's the same for boys.
Here two people say what they mean and mean what they say, and what they don't say they don't say because they're not sure yet that they feel it.
Buy this movie now, you will not regret it, but watch it with a lover because watching it while you're single will make you jones too much for the real thing and that could be depressing.
But, eventually emotions come into it because sex is more than just the release of biological urges.
It's a paradox, because the filmmakers definitely want the viewer to like Dennis Quaid's character the most, yet there's little effort in developing him outside of his professional life.
I'm still reserved about him as a director because I saw nothing new from this movie.
another part i didn't like was the subtle clue to who was involved in the plot(quaids partner or whoever.dude from party of 5) because it made me automatically point out that he was involved nearly an hour and a half before he was actually implicated.
i gave it 9 because Its one of those action packed thrillers where your dad goes " Oh it was him !
This is because most people cannot guess what will happen because the movie is ingeniously clever.
Again I respect the fact, that the reviewer didn't like the movie, but he was angry at the movie, because it was shot in Mexico, pretending that to be Spain.
I just came back home from seeing this movie and I wanted to share my thoughts right away because this movie was disappointing.
Later in the movie you'll learn that the attempt on the presidential life was a vendetta by the terrorists because they failed to smuggle a dirty bomb out of Morocco.
However, I can't really complain about that because the entire concept of the film is false advertising.
It is a real shame because the plot and conspiracy going on are well thought out and planned.
Maybe they cut all the backstory, because honestly, there is absolutely none on display.
I can't disregard the work completely, though, because this cast is amazing.
Ultimately VANTAGE POINT is half the film it could have been, it lacks sufficient character motivation or back story, the characters are caricatures, the script is diluted to the point of meaningless and while it sports a great climatic car chase, the final scene is as implausible as they come-----a highly trained band of ruthless conspirators, toting the latest in high tech gadgetry, killing co-conspirators as they see fit, assisted by an inside man, successfully pull off TWO intricate operations and on the road to getting away scot-free, only to be undone because an irrelevant character JAYWALKS!
the story is pretty much over, so they add some action scenes and car chases because they're all out of ideas.
I think the writer or director of the film forgot because of so many flashbacks.
They hint at it long enough to actually make you wonder if they're stupid enough to go through with it, so you may doubt what they're going to do, because it's set up so poorly.
because it had to be really precise.
Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and kloncks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly!
I liked this film because it had no pretensions.
I really enjoyed this movie, because of it's editing, wonderful actors and full packed action.
It gets a little annoying because each time it stops, the audience is left on a cliffhanger which carries the film's tension into the next character.
This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.
So I'm going to go back to giving my full attention to Shanks because I don't want to miss one priceless moment..
It was such a brilliant thing too because Brooks made a silent movie for (then)modern cinema.
Babies often stolen from their mothers are offered for a price, a phone call from an orphanage will end in bitterness because another (usually American) couple have used large amounts of cash to jump the queue and have taken the child.
Whatever, i am a real male, this movie is telling us how to give love with pure heart not with anyelse, we should give love because we should not because anything..
I cried because i remember someone (not me) i know closely, like them, oh..
Photography as an art form is really beautiful because it captures the little memories - of things that may seem simple to people but are in fact meaningful to us.
The actress, Aoi Miyazaki also played one of the leads for Nana 1 ( They changed her for Nana 2 because she was shooting tada kimi wo at the time) The third one is the perfect girl.
I still can't help but feel slightly frustrated because of what I think is a missed opportunity of character development....
There's something missing and I still think it is because of the ending that happens a bit too fast and is not as intense as it should be.
Hiroshi Tamaki stars as Segawa Makoto, a university student who shies away from people because of an unknown illness.
Yet it works because the movie has engendered so much good will along the way and it shows just enough restraint.
But I recommend it, mostly because of the performance of the female lead.
MST3000 was a very very funny show, precisely because it would take a movie out of context, in some cases edit the movie extensively, and then exploit any incongruities and flaws that turned up in the process.
The only reason that it's even worth talking about is because "MST3K" once showed this drudgery.
You would think that if you were making a filmstrip about why you should take a string of classes that offers ridicule, that you would make your spokesman some what attractive and less dweeby (I used the word spokesman, because everyone knows that girls should not take shop classes, that's why schools offer home economics).
I really liked him because I was also in the same frame of mind for may be two months.
The answer is YES, and this is only because of Shah Rukh Khans performance.
Not because he's a Caucasian portraying an Eastern man, which was par for the course in the seventies, but because he has all the charisma and latent acting ability of a turd.
So she can scar another woman because that woman is bad?
You can see the lights on the other side of the door because the door doesn't close all of the way.
The "robot" pilot that gets blown out of the broken bridge window because of decompression?
Were the humans kidnapped because earth was destroyed, or because it was going to be destroyed?
Maybe I've got a more "nostalgic" view about this film..its because I'm not looking for academy award winning material with this kind of film, but it does its job of...entertaining...and if you have children and want them to be children for a tad longer, this may be the film fare for them.
As her mother walked away, weeping, telling Young-ju that she will be going to the restroom for a while, Young-ju told Victoria that everybody hated her because she is not Korean.
Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...  You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.
I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 only because I got to see a lot of Adam Baldwin, and I do mean, a LOT.
Average road comedy that has average production quality and nothing original or new to offer as all presented here have been done better in other films of the same genre.Although still funny at times and big fans of the lead actors here will be entertained because they will see that they still have their talents in 1999.Goldie and Steve are certainly the main attractios here and they did a great performance.Very funny scenes at the last 20 minutes involving a drugged out Steve.Not a big fan of road comedies and the lead actors?Stay away then.....
One comedy that is so American that you may have problems sleeping afterwards because of the jaw pain you will get due to too much laughing.
They get lost because they don't know how to read a map, and then their rental GPS gets stuck in some kind of French sounding neighborhood and they end up in a fish-market or something like that with crates and fresh squishy things.
At the hotel they are kicked out because their credit card has been overdrawn by their own daughter.
I definitely liked this one because I actually laughed a fair bit and I like it that the film doesn't overstay its welcome or go TOO far over-the-top.
I didn't like the ending because that's not what I expected.
I did wanted to see it because i saw the other tow, but sadly i should have known that it will not be better then the second part.
The first part was really the one which had it in it and think they though that people will see this one because of it.
Partly because the storyline seemed so short-lived.
Either way steer clear because you'll be disappointed no later than halfway through the film.
The beginning of this movie starts with the girl, who is the alien in this film simply because of a slight resemblance to the blonde alien in the original (not because of ANY acting skills), is a college professor giving a lecture.
The reason why I don't like this movie is because it's way oversexed, the plot was rather pointless, it was weak, decadent, and played out period.
It makes less sense than you might think as the only alien seen to get down and dirty with the humans is the one who wants to kill them all because her faction is opposed to the interbreeding thing.
The IMDb rating of 4.1 of the time I am writing this review must have been given by those who were sexually frustrated because the way the movie was marketed (The Cover) it was for those who were perverted minded hoping they will get a full on alien soft-core flick which is not at all.
This movie should have went to theatres because it was good as the Alien series with Sigourney Weaver.
After seeing the second and third one, I thought I was convinced that they couldn't make another one that would match up to the original with Natasha Henstridge but I was wrong because this one came very close.
I was really entertained by this one because I watched it at like 3 in the morning and I watched it all.
Overall I give it an 8 out of 10 because it was the best since the original and it is a great thriller.
it was a pity that IMDb didn't have the ability to rate movies as 0 because that is exactly what i would have given it.
It's as if the crew of "Days of Our Lives" borrowed the studio's gear for a weekend and went and shot a "Sci-Fi/Thriller" because those are popular these days, so we should be able to make some cash with it.
This is one of the best martial Arts films I have ever seen, mainly because of the 1st rate skill of all the main characters.
I gave this movie a "10" because I just thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
I won't go into details about the story because there are plenty of other comments that do that.
In fact, I need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it I don't think I've caught yet.
I can't tell you how many times where I've walked out of a martial arts - or even action - movie, and been immensely disappointed because the fighting and explosions were great, but the rest of it simply fell short.
I gave it a two because it's almost harmless, and therefore not as bad as a lot of what passes as entertainment these days.
This film is 10 out of 10, because it gives us many implications.
As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot of parts that I found so funny that I was either finding myself almost lightheaded from laughing so hard, or finding myself obnoxious because I would struggle to recoup in order to read the subtitles in time to not miss anything.
But since the good outweighs the bad exponentially, I highly recommend "Kung Fu Hustle" to just about anyone because of both its action and comedic elements.
I suppose it's because he looked so dim, he therefore had to be a kung fu master in disguise.
Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different, the overall result is hilarious.
On the DVD he enters Queens, NY, the "home" of Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson and leaves without a scratch on his face because it seemed like 50's own hood doesn't respect him.
This is one of the best documentaries I've seen since Farenheit 9/11, Game exposes the truth about this lousy piece of garbage name G-Unit, game delivers one of his best performances as he exposes the lies, the deceptions and the evil surrounds this horrible group and pop rap group Pistol Pete from Terror Squad also delivers here as the person who exposed tony yayo as a coward, you know people always say you should listen to music like G-Unit, because it's good for hip hop's soul, it's not good, it is hateful, disgraceful, shameful and truly unbelievably tasteless, I Bet these stupid stans don't even know what real hip hop is, all they listen to is garbage like this, it's a shame that tupac and biggie & big pun turning on their graves and probably laughing at how pathetic the mainstream hip hop has become and especially for someone like fifty cent that is ruining it.
Basically, the film chronicles rapper The Game ( I will call him Mr. Watkins from now on, because that's his real name) as he goes on his "world tour" (now that I think about it, I don't think he went anywhere except for Norway and the U.S., but what do I know), and tries to find 50 Cent, so he can try to get him to explain why he ratted out a member of the group (I think that's what it was).
He may get a bad rap because of his narcissistic and childish demeanor, and he may be a very rich person, but he loves his work and the people who respect his work, and personally, I think that's the only thing that matters.
I don't even want to tell anything about the rest of the film, because someone might be surprised about the turnaround in the plot.
I personally could not watch the whole movie because I started feeling nausea.
In retaliation David's gang begins killing a bunch of girls because they are dressed in long black robes and running around in the woods at night with sharp objects.
In retaliation Seth's gang sacrifices Samantha (Jennifer Lyons) because she speaks with the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel and they figure she must be a virgin.
But you can't be sure because they come back in one of those moronically tacked on endings.
I gave it a 2 because the actors were OK, the actresses quite pretty and they seemed to make at least a half-hearted effort.
And it met these expectations, primarily because of the dreadful acting.
If you watch the TV version, then this movie is very very boring because all you can see are bouncing fuzzies.
Maybe because of the big breasted teens?
Just rented this on Netflix because a friend had recommended it.
Thankfully, something like NetFlix exists, because otherwise, I would never have seen either picture.
I'm not trying to make it sound like this is a film full of big twists, because it's not, but what it is, is a film of moments, key moments that define the film, it's story and it's characters.
I don't believe many people will walk away from this film saying, "Gee, that one guy was so awful because of such-and-such."
This line demonstrates the seriousness of causality and its potentially detrimental effects when children are raised to hate others because of an unforgiving heart.
The aforementioned film has experienced a Renaissance precisely because everyone wants to know where the Mike Hammer theme originated.
Yeomen of the Guard is especially fine because Joel Grey is such a superb actor who conveys the sadness and folly of loving someone who fails to return your love.
If you enjoyed Satya and company this movie is a sure go for you.Don't expect any mercy from Varma productions because there is ample of on screen violence and tension like the previous two flicks.
Also because the story is so confusing and distorted, you never really connect to anything that happens in the movie.
I'm not sure which, because by then I was giggling at McGoohan's mischievous performance.
We know Macauley is dead because John Cassavetes checks his corpse in the next scene, in the Mortuary.
He was recalled to the US and was due to go home imminently and had already been stripped of his executive powers but Patton's enemies could well have thought that they needed to get their pay-back time in quickly before he did get back to the US and start to interfere with their plans against post-war Germany because of his high-status in the US despite their incessant campaigns to undermine his credibility.
Most aren't great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying.
Today I watched "Hidalgo"... that's how I needed to start because for me it was a real event.
I hate it when I saw the guy who lost the race killed his horse just because his horse couldn't take it anymore!
Picked up this movie because the trailer's looked good and was not disappointed.
The plot is strong to keep the audience guessing, but is weak because of the repeated foolish decisions of the lead character.
This one has a cowboy whose specialty is long distance races going to the Middle East to race there because they do not like the claim that he is the best long distance racer there is.
Though you know a Mustang has to be a rather fast and strong horse because they named a rather good car after it.
Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy."
I saw it because the description of the plot on my guide grabbed me by the lapels and shook me awake.
You see, the hero changes his mind in the end about the fate of a two-timing outlaw because his pretty girlfriend persuades him not to sink to the outlaw's level.
I gave it a 2/10 because I save a one for bad and evil.
Robert is thrown for a loop, not only because of his own need for Susan, but because he thinks his father is rushing things.
Ok this movie was interesting slow at first but then picked up of course I had a hard time even looking away from the screen because of Nancy Mckeon being the main character even crazy she looks cute :o) The movie is about a woman who seems normal then starts to hear voices she has schizophrenia.
Somehow 'The Red Beret,' by no measure a fine film, remains one of my sentimental favorites, perhaps because in my teens it aired often on late night TV, under its U.S. title 'Paratrooper.'
I also love this film because it's one of the many that carved out for Harry Andrews his reputation for playing tough-tender sergeants and sergeant majors; in 'The Red Beret' his last-words line, "Pity the man who hears the pipes and was na born in Scotland," has stuck pleasantly with me into my sixth decade; he also gives a lovely little take when the red berets are issued to him and his men and his character must part with his beloved regimental headgear.
because of this i can now thoroughly enjoy seaweed from the Chinese, along with my fond memories.
The monotony of the scene got to me, but I think that is because I am a product of my generation.
There were periods in the movie where I wanted to cry because the content is SO TRUE.
"Still of the Night" turned off a lot of movie viewers because of it's slow pace and lack of any steamy scenes between Dr. Rice and Brooke Reynolds as well as it's almost total lack of action until the very last minutes of the movie.
I remember a couple of years ago when IFC or Sundance was running this film on an endless loop.At first I avoided it like the plague because I'd heard so many negative things like "it's boring" Or "all they do is talk"--but then I watched it anyway and saw that the great Wallace Shawn was one of the actors.How can I not watch a movie with him in it?And the other guy-I forget his name-was the evil bishop in Ladyhawke!
Andre comments that one of the reasons he gave up acting was because the average person is doing such a good job at it that he couldn't compete.
At first, being only 22, I was weary about renting it because it was released before I was even born, and thought that the movie could possibly be out-dated.
While watching this movie, I had to repeatedly rewind the movie because I would be in such deep thought about a point Andre had just made, that I would completely miss the next few minutes of the movie.
This is a key contribute for why the film works because having written the material the actors appear to know it inside and out and therefore give it that extra sense of naturalism.
Some viewers may find it pretentious at first viewing, because it does deal with a lot of hard thinking topics and at times it can alienate the viewer by going slightly overboard with how it presents its ideas but most viewers should be able to relate to a conversation similar to this at one at some point in their lives, just maybe in a different way.
The major flaw of the film is undoubtedly the camera-work, this is especially worrying with a film like this because in theory this should be one the most easiest films in history to shoot but instead of simply taking a subtle approach and showing the characters through two or three angles, the camera will suddenly jerk from one shot to the next in a very disorientated manner.
It just came naturally, because their ideas and opinions were fueled with passion and conviction.
These films enable better character development because of the intimacy of the setting.
The reason why Die Hard succeeded over Rambo is because we cared, loved and really got to know John McClane.
Not only is this film a character study, but the single-setting idea was taken a step further because for two hours while your whole notion of the outside world is erased you do not see a single house nor a single room, but a single table.
It is because this film is completely dialog driven and lacks visual interpretation that our minds create our own.
...because it literally demands all of your attention.
However, it is still a fascinating movie, but you must concentrate because the movie is pure conversation, and if you get distracted at all you'll miss something.
"... it also produces a disgusting hodgepodge of patchwork observations and half-rationalized principles, in which shallow pates revel because it is something useful for everyday chitchat, but the insightful, feeling confused and dissatisfied without being able to help themselves, avert their eyes ..." - Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (Cambridge edition, Gregor translation)
He clearly dominates what he has to say to Mr. Shawn because, after being successful in the New York theater world, he decided to give all that up in order to do what he really wanted, to explore the world to its fullest.
There is a reason why Wallace Shawn's voice was used for the dinosaur in Toy Story, and it's because, like Children during the Victorian age, he is better seen and not heard.
That's about as profound as this film gets in contrasting a quasi-scientific world view to a quasi-luddite one ("I won't get an electrical blanket because that kind of comfort just separates you from reality in a very direct way [...] and instead of living under the sun and the moon and the sky and the stars, we're living in a fantasy world of our own making" (!?)
I dragged several people to see it, including my mom and my sister-in-law, because I just thought they HAD to see it.
I am sorry to say this, because I really like  Eileen, but she is quite batty.
And I think many people will be fooled into believing that the director sides with Andre just because he speaks the most.
MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is one of the greatest movies of all time because it works on a seemingly infinite number of levels.
Yet at the same time it is one of the biggest failures in film because it only succeeds in connecting to the most insightful of its audience.
Worse, while he dumped the woman's body back on the train before it left, Mike Bennett (Dale Belding), a kid who likes to get away from his mother and have adventures, saw him Even worse, after Dunlap gets picked up while hitchhiking and realizes he can't leave the area because of the flooding, the friendly driver lets him off at the only place to stay in town, a boarding house.
The material is quite raunchy, but photographed in such a seductive way, mainly because, in my opinion, Whirry commands your attention.
because Hans Weingartner is a consummate and devilishly clever storyteller and after the first few sequences you will forget where you are, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen!
Unti the very end I was expecting a major twist in the story because I could not imagine that a such highly decorated film has such shallow characters and such a lame and predictable story.
For me this movie could not be recommended to adults because of the childishness of the characters and not to kids because of the dubious political message.
You simply cannot incur debts that high as a private person because there is a law in Germany against that to protect people from ruining themselves in the long run ("Privatinsolvenzrecht").
It makes me worried, because this film is literally perfect.
Or rather, can't live, because of low wages and debt.
Non-German speakers are otherwise at a real disadvantage both for having to tear your eyes away from the charismatic actors and because few of the lyrics are translated in the subtitles, though I presume one is translated because the nostalgic lyrics for a pastoral past gain ironic resonance when the threesome ends up in a soothing sylvan Tyrollean landscape.
She insists on entering the house because it belongs to a man she owes 94,000 Euros to for totaling his Mercedes.
This is a film that musters some good suspense and adrenalin rushes at first, but starts losing them as the kidnapping wears on because it all begins to seem more about politics and the talk than about the action, though wondering how it's going to end is still what's going to keep you watching.
You should have seen the ending coming, and because you didn't, it didn't leave you feeling blind sided like the 1953 film "The Limping Man".
At first it seemed to me this movie was the continuation of Good Bye Lenin (probably because of Daniel in Berlin?)
I'm willing to gloss over the film's (rare) faults because, in the end, there is far too much to take home from this movie.
Lindsay Frost's insecure Fay made a big impression on yours truly, mainly because of the waitress' outfit.
The plot concerns Rita fighting to help Sam keep custody of his daughter because as the state sees it foster care is better than a mentally retarded father.
I rate this a 9 and not 10 because there was some little errors that could have been fixed..but it didn't bother me so much.
It would be nice if things worked out as they have in this movie, which is why I liked this movie is because movies are aloud to be unrealistic and it's nice to leave the theater or turn of the DVD off after watching the film and feel good (that is if you're not so critical about movies).
Even with all of these problems, I still managed to somewhat enjoy the movie because of a pretty decent script, and some very good acting.
Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't nominated for this movie, and that's a crying shame, because this is easily the best work she's done since "Baker Boys".
Many people knock Sean Penn because of his personal life (myself included) but his performance of the mentally challenged man was inspiring and never came across as corny!
Although that's a positive endorsement of the film--it's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward (I usually suffer from logorrhea, which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it (verbal) flatulence instead if you like)--it turned out to be quite a problem, because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture.
But I won't bill director/co-writer Jessie Nelson, because it's not her fault that her film is so powerful and so stunningly constructed that it made me monosyllabic.
Aided by a quartet of developmentally disabled friends and his agoraphobic neighbor, Annie Cassell (Dianne Wiest), we see Sam doing his best to raise the girl, Lucy Diamond Dawson (eventually played by Dakota Fanning)--so named because Sam is a big Beatles fan.
afterward because it is a masterpiece on every artistic and technical level.
College students love to "investigate" prostitution, but they don't do it at home because they'd have to see and hear from their subjects again and that's too much commitment.
Hello together,  i was very shocked about the film, because i saw in Bangkok the same like in the film.
I saw the film a few days ago but now i am thinking about pla, most girls have nothing to change - they must work in bar because they are the money-maker for her family.
So any slice of life documentary like this one, fails completely because Thailand is like an onion (or an Ogre), it has many layers, and some of those layers can't be exposed without brining tears to your eyes...
This tends to anger the bar girls because if they aren't in the bar they can't find another customer.
The film is strange because of all Harold's brutality towards a the kid and all of the humor that shows up throughout.
Probably religious in some way, because this is so typical with these people trying to impose there moral standards and be morally upset as they've done in Africa and elsewhere.
If u need some back for the claims I will make below, Ill tell u I have lived and studied in Thailand for 4 years, I have a Thai wife and I have known many bar-girls, some of whom do the job for a lack of a better choice BUT STILL OUT OF FREE CHOICE and some who don't even want to consider different choices because they are contempt with what they do.
But they often don't want, because in this job they make 10 times the same money with less efforts.
Not because the "story" is sad but because sadly there is no story.
Not because the filmatography or any other artistic feature is so convincing but because of the lack of anything convincing.
What has happened here is that the girl got annoyed with the film maker (I would have) and the film maker frustrated because the girl didn't answer what he expected.
It's a DVD all big stars should have because the man stays with both feet firmly on the ground.
and i'd think not just for die-hard fans of j.j. cale, because it shows - as i said already - a very simple, smart, humble and loving human being.
That said, make sure you have a link to at least one page with Heroes III walkthroughs, because you WILL run into scenarios that are literally almost impossible to beat.
Well, there's some poetic justice here, because the film itself is an enduring monument to its players, and a reminder of one of racial segregation's most insidious effects: the denial to American culture - and to world culture - of the fullest contribution of outstanding artists simply because of the color of their skin.
As De Lawd, Ingram brings a human dimension to the Supreme Being that expresses his doubts occasionally because of the way things turn out.
I put "Biblical" in quotes because, if you HAVE read the Bible you know that most of the stuff in this film is hardly an accurate account of the Bible.....but it's more of a parable, I think, than any literal translations.
additionally, this film was banned in certain southern theaters because of it's theme.
I say "story," because it is a description more than a tale of one way to conceive of the "Lawd of heaven."
The Main Event Mafia in my opinion is one of the better ideas of TNA because it gets the balance right.
The matches are great and I think are better than WWE because since TNA is obviously a smaller company but a growing company then the wrestlers are going to go that extra mile for the fans and for their company.
Columbo has done far better than this, but I must admit that compared to more standard TV fare a bad Columbo is still better than a lot of other things you can pass the time with because Peter Falk is in it.
Mark, and his annoying girlfriend Lisa Webber (Kim Meyers), know this because they find her diary hidden somewhere in his room.
Clearly time for a change of underpants then, because you know you really should be changing them every day.
The only reason's to watch this movie are for some carnage and because of Robert Englund's gleeful performance.
The first movie was INCREDIBLE, probably the best in the series because it didn't need special effects or anything high-tech it just was naturally frightening.
This movie has left this reviewer and HUGE Nightmare on Elm Street fan for a loss of words because they aren't enough cuss words in the English language.
The other actors really aren't worth a mention because of the total lack of respect for their characters shown by the director and writer of the film.
You might want to put this movie into the category with other horror sequels like Halloween 3 because they go against the traditional sequels.
The effects in this movie must have opened a few peoples eyes back when it came out because they are truly disturbing.
I honestly liked Nightmare On Elm Street 2, i think it was the appropriate sequel to the first one.It had that 80's aspect that for me somehow made it more enjoyable.It was so simple in a way because they were not trying to yet make Freddy Krueger a Dream Master, or a Psycho Dream dude who was psychologically ill and all this is just making the series into a confusing wreck.Here we have a simple plot that tries to explain some stuff, but not to much.I like all the references to the first one, i basically look for that in all sequels, i guess it makes me feel cool to say,"Oh i saw that happen, i actually saw what happened".Ill admit at times it was cheesy, and there were some really unnecessary parts to it, but i liked the film.Overall you might be one of many who hates this movie, but give it a chance if your a fan of the first one or a Freddy fan than you will give this film its props for that.
It is a complete departure from the cheesy synth score of the original and because it lacks that familiar piano motif that's heard in all the films, sets it apart much like the film itself.
I think I have to watch this movie again, because it's either pretty good or pretty average.
So now i tried to post this message and i have to go to ten lines thats weird because the last post i did didn't have ten lines and it posted, so i guess here we go with the tenth line here!
I just happened to come across it on AZN cable, it caught my attention because it was going on for 1 minute without any singing or dancing behind trees.
Even though one can objectively see that the hatred depicted for him is because he is a rapist who could get away with the heinous crime, it could very easily be projected on to homosexuals in general.
And it's because of this that you are drawn in immediately and rooted for the duration.
However, Charles Durning as Senator Samuel Chapman can get annoying, not because of Durning, but because his character complains almost the whole time he is on-screen.
"Sure dad, yes dad, I'll watch your movie with you because you say it's gonna be cool."
Forget it because this came first, nor does it submit to cheese/silliness in what could've been a nonsensical premise.
It feels, and looks authenticÂ because it is.
And that was the dilemma faced; Do we change history because we feel a conscious duty to tilt the war in our favor (At least in the short term.)?
Or win a decisive victory and save all of the agony yet to come at the possible expense of destroying the fabric of space/time... or at the very least causing the U.S. and the Allies to lose in the long run because the U.S. would have delayed entering the war?
I'm really surprised that this film is not more popular, because this was a very unique and fascinating concept for a movie, especially back in 1980.
I know my sons were so effected by "Animal" because we talked about 20 minutes after the movie ended about the Willie Lynch letter and the boys asked questions and I answered as best I could.
I'd like to see more of him in the future because despite his years, he still has a lot to offer.
And Animal is only sent to prison because the police framed him.
This movie is a good example of the kind of movie that should not be done to TV because of the limitations of the medium.
Maybe it's because he still has an optimistic outlook about his life.
Later though, he begins to bond with the kids and discovers, as does the kids, that he actually really does care about them because he doesn't want what happened to him to happen to them.
Perhaps this is because his love for the kids makes him forget about his problems and worry about their well-being.
There is boy who has experienced a tragedy, not intentionally, but because of a problem he cannot help.
I will not give away what happens, I will say only this: I was pleasantly surprised because this movie wasn't just a comedy.
Bustin' Loose is not a masterpiece, but it is an entertaining, convincing movie, and it works because of the performances.
It's not a wholesome after-school special but it's touching at moments to see the outcasts look and treat upon each other as friends and family because they could have treated this film like silly film but it's a serious film about serious problems and they do it admirably.
I really felt bad for this guy, because he was a putrid, horrible actor.
I did sit through the whole thing but only because it became so humorous because it was so bad.
I may now be misleading you, because I didn't at all think this was a bad film and it gripped me from start to finish.
you can't tell if his like that in real life :) but i know he isn't... because I know him!
I can only say that he is NOT like that in real life... because I also know him!
That ending scene really scared the (you know what) out of me because I feared that the mother and daughter were going to be hurt even more, possibly killed.
I've always been a fan of European cinema, mostly because it has something more to offer than Hollywood's mass production.
She shines like the sun because she is allowed to.
They all shine because of the writing, first and foremost, and because of the Dogma rules, second.
The latter is the case with virtually every movie nowadays; and that's OK; because it's natural(or "nature"); but it's not that important(in my view) because the latter(l&d) is a local perception while the former(L&D)- is a global one.
I saw Martin Murphy's film "lost thing's" last night because I love thriller's and horror and have been wanting to see some from other countries.I was impressed and watched it twice to understand it better.The beach was beautiful and the soundtrack eerie with the background sounds.The fact that the beach was empty with no other people except an older guy who was preaching doom, and only had snakes and sinister looking birds on it was unsettling.
It's quite disturbing because it has a strong psychological basis.
When the first clues were given I thought: "well, I've seen this beforeÂ it's another "scary movie" with a predictable endÂ" And in a certain way it is, because the main topic of the plot it's very predictable and the viewer who pays a little attention to some details soon will understand that something strange happened in the past with these guysÂ But when the plot is being reveled, it doesn't give you all the complete answersÂ There are some little details that remain unclear even after the movie ends, and I appreciate this I must say!
There are some scenes really amazing because you have a parallel viewing over the story.
At first I only kept watching because there was nothing else on, and it looked a little slow for my tastes.
Most old movies are interesting to me because I feel I can learn something by observing the indirect attitudes of the media/generation of the time.
Most old movies are interesting to me because I feel I can learn something by observing the indirect attitudes of the media/generation of the time.
It is better than Easy Rider because it is not encumbered by all the hippie platitudes that really didn't age well and because Easy Rider is constantly telling you what it is about while Two Lane Blacktop shows you rather than telling you.
I guess I love this movie because it tells me a story in a way that only film can.
That's because there aren't many directors out there like Monte Hellman with the guts or patience to make something like Two-Lane Blacktop.
Just because the movie's over, it doesn't mean that any of the four characters have finished their quests.
I liked this film because it was minimalist, and you had to get everything through suggestion.
Withdrawn from circulation because it uses the Door's "Moonlight Drive"--and you know how picky the Lizard King could be about commercial rights.
It's bad because neither Dennis Wilson nor James Taylor could act, and their entertainment quotient is zilch.
Its also the greatest road movie ever made because its thematically interesting unlike many other car films.
Mechanic tells Driver to pull over and stop because it will take him a while to explain.
But the film is memorable because of its rarity (it has never been released on video and is still unavailable, but has just been released on DVD) and its bizarre and infamous conclusion.
But we only want a little bit of drama, because that's not really the point, and too much drama would distract from the underlying theme.
Long out of circulation because of disputes over music rights, Two-Lane Blacktop, now available on DVD, is one of the most original and compelling American movies of the twentieth century.
This movie does just the opposite of what it means to do (affect a change in the audience like the one in Hannah), partly because the audience (I, anyway) don't need to learn Hannah's lesson.
What it does, instead, is to create a Holocaust in which you don't care much about the victims because you don't get to know them.
I watched the movie because it looked so bad from the start,i had to go on till the end.
The script for this film is problematic and there are gaping plot holes and scenes that will cause you to roll your eyes, but it is still watchable because of the photography, the genre and of course, Maggie Q, who will be seen soon in Mission Impossible 3.
This didn't make sense till I saw the part were she went back in time and she wasn't with Gitl and Shmuel,she was with Rivka and someone else who I don't know because it confused me.
The reason why this show is the best, is because this show is mostly about the law, not the theatrics of the Judge.
Overall, this is a good film, because it accurately depicts a true story, the reasons kids have children prematurely, and the ultimate responsibility it is of the parent (in this case, negligent Anne Heche), for the kids turning to out the way they do.
A situation that makes her mother turns a blind eye towards because she feels that this man is the one for her.
Its about a teen that has to do the right and impossible thing to keep her siblings together because of their irresponsible mother.
Don't be fooled because its from lifetime.
When I watched it the first time, I had to stop it and come back to it later in the day because it was so intense.
But anyone interested should look for this movie on DVD because it was quite good.
It's not because you claim you love your children, you actually love them.
We know this because of his inattention to junior's soccer tryouts.
I give it 4 out of 10 because the special effects are well done- the animals do seem to talk and even act.. whew!
She too is disappointing here, probably largely because the character she is asked to play, a spoiled affluent brat, is fundamentally unappealing and unidimensional, until near the end.
It's not anti-cat, as someone wrote in these pages, and I say that because the cats are decidedly the funniest characters in the movie.
I wouldn't want my kids to see this version because it dumbs the whole tragedy down so much they won't understand the brutality and scope of the holocaust from this.
Giving this movie a high mark just because its about the holocaust is like giving George Bush an A for effort in Iraq.
The cats of course, are worried about this,because the cure of the allergy would make dogs even more popular among humans,making the cats rejected.
The film itself is highly flawed, which is a shame because it had all the right elements-- great director, brilliant cast, fascinating script.
Sight as knowing and the eyes as technology opens up many theoretical discussions, especially because of the Oedipal-like scene where Roddy blinds himself for "knowing" too much.... for his shame in that knowing, as if sight gives you knowledge.
Sad, because was Romy Schneider's last film.
The only thing I didn't like was the actual town, Halloweentown, because it was smaller.
I liked all of them(except number 4) because of the originality they put into the characters and the plots.
Brown's performance because she is a great actress and very pretty.
The love interest--Viveca Lindfors--is properly stoic because she cannot get him at the end and they both know it.
I can understand the reservations of the studios because he simply did not make a great dramatic actor, but he did make a great action film.
And make no mistake Flynn was an actor.Just because he made it look easy does not mean it wasn't acting.If you want to see how an epic should be made watch this motion picture.
Don Juan is sent back to Spain because of his numerous romantic escapades and becomes involved in training the royal army in sword fighting, while also catching the eye of Queen Margaret.
I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of the TV series of the same name starring Roy Dupuis and Pet Wilson.
I probably feel the worst for the other actors in the film, because the whole project could have been better than it was.
Yes, it was a parody of the secret-agent genre of the 1960s that peaked several years earlier, but I guess the picture is so disappointing because it seems to be built instead around the person of Dean Martin, and his real life image as that of a heavy drinking swinger.
Please, I'm not completely disregarding his acting ability, because he did in fact make some pretty good movies before this one.
As he hits the grass, it compresses because of the extensive padding beneath, and a large area of the astro-turf kicks up.
She went on to say that she realized that comedy was very difficult because "you have to be so serious".
8 out of 10 because of her.
It wasn't to be because Dino frankly got bored of the whole thing and in those days Martin would bore easily.
The gimmick here is that the USA does not want anyone knowing that such a shipment was stolen because of the financial implications.
This,the fourth and last of the Matt Helm movies has a lot to recommend it and has serious credentials to be one of the most interesting films of the 60s and that is for a variety of reasons.One of these is the appearance of the late Sharon Tate who gives a very appealing comic performance in her final movie.The attractive 60s star Dahlia Lavi makes a good villainess and is a fine foil for Nigel Greene a respected English actor (who was later to die tragically) as the evil Count Contini.He had played a similar role in the earlier British spy thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE.Nancy Kwan also appears and so does Chuck Norris in a "blink and you'll miss him"screen debut.The reason Norris was in it at all was because of the movies' fight choreographer,none other than the legendary Bruce Lee himself and he does sterling work giving the many hand to hand combat scenes in THE WRECKING CREW a zest that was rare in action movies of the period that featured martial arts.
I gave this a one because IMDb doesn't offer a zero-option.
I respect this movie because it deals with the problem of landmines in Africa (Angola.
The final two stars are based on: one star simply because you can't give zero stars; three more stars for having a script, a beginning, and an end, and for not using crappy CGI; deduct one star for poor editing (quite, quite bad); and deduct one more star for the kid, as described above.
Should the Jews not be begrudged their past simply because its been "done before"?
It is graphic and heart ripping, it is a movie EVERY teen should see so that they can relay the message of Never Again, because next time it may not be The Jews, it could be any culture.
Stuck because of the melted and thawed out ice and soft earth Polleck is unable to get the heavy equipment shipped to him for drilling the oil.
The spirits of the tundra that some see in this movie are seen because that it is what their mind has resorted to in the end.
I hope the directors are happy because I understood exactly what the movie was trying to say and its saying "Burn this DVD, and go rent a some thing good.
And thank god for that, because this world could use some more Larry Fessendens to balance it out.
It starts off slow, because that's how the rest of it goes too.
It seems as if director/writer whatshisface hadn't thought the whole thing through and just decided to go ahead with filming because the topic of global warming is so trendy right now.
We don't know... but I didn't care because the atmosphere, music and beautiful pictures of the white nothingness are just too gripping.
Blow something up, two actors divorce their spouses in real life because of their co-stars, boy meets girl and boy loses girl and boy becomes hero and gets girl again.
That's because the accents were at times very hard for me to understand and there was no captioning on the DVD.
It's too bad, because the basic idea behind the short was interesting.
Most aren't great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying--it's just a shame about the captioning.
It was also frustrating because, when Dimple's character sang, I am almost certain that knowing the lyrics would have only added to the enjoyment of the film.
One of the comments (from a man, of course) asked if he was supposed to be handsome because if he was, the commenter couldn't see it.
So Colman has to take his place but they find out that his brother, Raymond Massey, has kidnapped the king because he wants to be king.
I put the Stewart Granger one a half step behind this one because James Mason isn't as evil as Douglas Fairbanks Jr as Rupert of Hentzau.
But it was super producer Selznick who hit upon the idea in 1937 because of the current media frenzy over the recent coronation of Britain's King Edward VIII who abdicated the thrown to marry a commoner out of true love in 1936!
She is not interested in hearing the stories of her relatives who survived the concentration camps because the idea is so foreign to her it's almost laughable.She reluctantly attends a passover seder with her parents where her aunts and uncles talk about "the camps" and she just dismisses the conversation.
The cast is first rate, especially because the male leads-Ronald Colman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and David Niven-are so handsome and talented, mainly Doug.
That was something that kept grating on me because of points in the film where I totally lost interest.
I wanted to identify with this movie, but I just couldn't because I am not a clod.
It leads me to believe he plays these roles so often because there is something inside him, which identifies with this type of man.
Some have said that Crowe and Hayek have no chemistry on screen but I'm not so quick to agree with that because the lines that they are forced to utter is so banal.
Personally, I rented this movie because Russell Crowe starred in it before he got huge.
I rented it because of the cast.
I couldn't turn it off because of their truly awesome performances.
So all of those of you who can't sit through movies like The Big Kahuna or Glengarry Glen Ross because "nothing happens", don't bother trying to watch this - you'll be bored.
(Yes, those were two big stereotypes, but the reason they are stereotypes is because you see them so often in reality.)
The final thing that caught my attention was the way the the movie tried to make a universal statement about love vs. happiness (because they aren't the same thing), and the best way to make it through this muddled life may not have anything to do with either, even if it is dull.
I only infer that this is because they are embarrassed.
This particular film tugged at me because of my Irish heritage, but I think anyone could enjoy it.
Let's hope so because "The Secret of Roan Inish" is a rare movie, a fairy tale, told from a child?s perspective, but for adults as well as children.
Roan Inish is an island off the coast of western Ireland from which 10-year-old Fiona's family has recently decamped for the mainland because of hard times.
The Secret of Roan Inish is a departure for John Sayles, in that his normal cynicism and mildly jaundiced eye is replaced by the completely credulous child's view, and his film is all the more charming because of it.
I saw this listed in TV guide, and watched it because the description made me imagine it would be a simple, charming movie.
One hesitates to call it a children's movie or a family movie because those are generally awful, but it is very much the sort of movie that is perfect to take the family too (although it is unaccountably rated PG).
NO i thought it was because of the brilliant script!
however it is generally worth it to see him in a movie (because he generally appears in odd films the exception being the princess bride-my sister's favorite movie) c. thomas howell (what the hell happened to him) plays the main character.
Every Madonna's fans will love it .. and the others.. you should like it because everybody loves the Queen!
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
Those who were expecting something more playful like her other documentary projects, they will be disappointed, but shouldn't be surprised because it is nothing like anything you have seen from Madonna before.
is this because a lot of people still haven't seen it yet?
If this sounds like a thin plot it's because it is.
It's wall to wall, full of eerie horror themes, cartoonish comedy sections, pop songs, strings, and sounds which are just generally unclassifiable, possibly because two songs might be played at the same time, or against a scene that is completely inappropriate.
I admit, I can see where it would be a cult classic just because it is so strange.
But you can have fun watching the MST3K version because they make fun of how terrible it is.
And they are picked off one by one... for some reason... because the house is alive... no... wait... the house is the aunt... who's waiting for her husband... who's dead... or maybe HE's the watermelon salesman... but the watermelons are really heads... or maybe it was just that one... or maybe there is no watermelon...
The only one who's even remotely tolerable is Kung Fu... because she's the only one who actually tries to fight what's happening to them.
Where else could you see a girl eaten by a piano, an upright Bear helping cook dinner at a roadside noodle-stand or a man turned into a pile of bananas because he doesn't like melons!?
But they were also told it would only take 5 minutes because with an ambulance you can go in and out of traffic with no one bothering to stop you.
However, I bought this movie because of Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman and I sure once disappointed.
Released in 1981, The Cannonball Run has significantly dated and looks as if it was filmed in the 1960s, but because it's so lighthearted and fun, it doesn't matter.
I can't really say that this film is full of great acting because the entire cast horses around through the whole movie.
And that's because I'm not all that willing to give anime the same due many others appear to.
I respect and enjoy Miyazaki's works and I'm a bit partial to those of Tezuka Osamu, the latter because Astro Boy made quite the impression on me when I viewed its American broadcast premiere.
I walked out with only like 15 minutes to go because it just got worse and worse.
So it was a relatively good movie only because of the lessons she learned alone the way, but frankly, with this nauseating emotional carousel full of let downs and betrayals, I think Jaime should have sworn off sex forever.
The witty and sensual character of Jamie Harris is credible because of the magnificent performance of the expressive and gorgeous Marguerite Moreau, and I really felt in love for her.
But, without the Hollywood veneer, she is even more real, more lovable because she isn't perfect.
Omp Puri or takhur, tries to justify the act by saying the whore never gave them any and because the were intoxicated they could not tell the difference between a 9 or 90 year old.
Tane McClure and Gabriela Hall shine on their roles mainly because they display decent acting skills.
Low key but very well written drama, about a strange man (Trintignant) who is pretending to be pursued by the police and the army, because he knows a very dangerous secret.
In another, the KGB investigated because Sasha scored a 99 on the state exam--something about science, math, transportation, etc.
Re transportation in particular, he aced that section because his aunt--who lived with them--worked for the government train administration bureau or what-have-you.
Mrs. Petrie proved to be a shrewd judge of man-flesh because it's impossible to imagine "Lifeguard" without Elliott's presence.
Should we conform because that's what people want of us?
Sometimes these films are uncomfortable because of racism.
Anyway, it is great because of the newness of John Wayne and his now famous facial antics, which we love, and Harry Carey who was John Wayne's idol in real life.
It is the best of the movies in the set but all of the others are wonderful just because they feature John Wayne.
If it wasn't haunted before it sure gets haunted after Blondell is murdered by mistake because the killer is after Landis.
Perhaps, because of all of the dissatisfied comments on this board (e.g.
The film fails because it does not engage the viewer in the upheaval in the lives of the characters.
I would say EKLAVYA is by far the best of the very,very rare number of good films that Bollywood has made throughout their existence.Why,because it's more focused and well made than any of their minute number of good films.It's got rich atmosphere,intriguing setup,brilliant visuals,impressive sets,costumes and a different vision.But,overall,it is still a flawed epic.
The story revolves around a family,that is hiding secrets that once revealed,might have deadly consequences upon them.It is inspired by some of Shakespeare's works and it echoes throughout the film.It's about one aging guard(Bachchan),named Eklavya; who has served for the family all his life.Many generations of his family has served before him and he must continue to do so,carry on their legacy.The family of the Kindom of Devigarh itself has mysteries that keeps echoing throughout the film.Eklavya has sworn to protect the family no matter what.He also protects some of the secrets that can never be spread throughout the Kindom.Until,one night,the Queen of the Kindom dies,besides her is her mourning husband.This starts the doubts and accusations within the family.The Queen's Son,Prince Harshwardhan(Khan) arrives to take responsibility of the family.But there are other things going on in the palace.Slowly,one mystery after another pops up and secrets are revealed,and as the story progresses we see more and more people dying because of the secrets.Putting Eklavya into a painful position and come to terms with the happenings and the truths about this family's dark history.
EKLAVYA is an intriguing period piece.It blends ancient settings with modern lifestyle.Giving the film a unique look.The film functions like a thriller,but focusing more on melodrama and characters,that aren't well written.And it's a well made drama that borderlines on melodrama.But the film has flaws,especially in the second half and by the time it ends,it feels incomplete.It's a relatively short film by Bollywood standards and I was more than surprised.Not only did it manage to tell an engrossing story but also wrapped it up with style with its short length.And the best thing is that it's devoid of songs,only one song throughout the film.But,I guess,because the story is wrapped around an epic setting,it needed a longer running time to develop the plot and characters more.Some of the characters were weak and not well written,some of their back stories are never told and leaves a lot to be desired.
Wayne and Carey have a great chemistry between them because next to John Ford, Harry Carey was probably the single biggest influence in creating a star named John Wayne from a USC football player named Marion Michael Morrison who earned some extra money working as a prop man on silent movie sets.
This is probably because the film has a lot of potential in its storyline, its cast, and its setting.
I am quite mixed in my reaction to this movie - mainly because of the baggage that the director's name carries when it comes up on screen before the feature starts.
But I didn't like them at all and I rented Eklavya because there was no other film that looks good to watch.
Running length is small but it was better that way because it's like a story telling film that starts to get boring after 2 hours but it was 1 hour 40 minutes, which was better.
Although it was flopped at box office but was critically acclaimed and might be nominated for an Oscar because it certainly does deserves it.
He is a 'royal guard' who would do anything to protect his royal masters because that's his Dharma.
He would sacrifice his emotions to guard a royal secret because that's his Dharma.
This contrast is brilliantly depicted in the film by the character of Pannalal Chauhar (Sanjay Dutt) - an untouchable who questions the traditions because in today's time he probably has more 'power' than the royal family and thus demands respect that his ancestors never got.
If your attention flags even for a moment, you would miss the revelation because the drama is contained and there are no high-voltage theatrics here.
All through its 107 minutes, Eklavya kept reminding me of Vishal Bhardwaj's Omkara and Maqbool because of its Shakesperean quality.
I want to punch myself in the face because this movie was so incredibly horrible.
Somehow, I kept watching because I had a sense that wherever this movie was going, it was not going in your average mindless direction.
I wouldn't technically call this a comedy movie, because it didn't make me laugh at all.
You may feel let down because the movie did pretty horrible, but if you watch the entire movie and follow the story you will find it to be a little better than the story of comedies that have made it big at the box office.
I'm sure one of the reasons this movie did not make it to the theatres is because some of it is kind of raunchy and there are a lot of nudity and sex scenes.
Some jokes made by them did just pass by me, but I did smile and laugh at some others, which I think is a huge accomplishment for a movie, because I know there are some big Hollywood comedies out there, which people don't laugh at, yet they're big movies.
Also, the reason some of the jokes aren't so funny is not because they're bad jokes, it's because they just glaze over you.
I liked the ending, simply because as the movie was getting closer to the end they gave you enough clues to guess what was going to happen, so therefore it was less disappointing than it could have been.
This is a movie that I would have probably enjoyed a lot more if I hadn't of read all of the terrible reviews, simple because no movie can be enjoyed when you know the bad bits that people have found.
So ignore the bad reviews, and try and forget about them when you watch this movie, because it really isn't that bad, it makes you laugh and smile and has a good story and good actors, which is all I wanted from it.
It is because of this incident that she becomes a policewoman and has to take a final test which is going into a burning building in an allot period of time.
I saw this movie when I was about 9 and couldn't really sit through to the end because it scared me so.
The character of the Candyman was so scary, not just because he killed people (though that had a lot to do with it), but because the person he was chasing was not believed (and actually framed for his murders).
When the Candyman begins to stalk Helen, she almost breaks down because he continues to commit murders and frame her.
And John Wayne moving from bewildered and embittered young man with a curse on him, to a man in love who can't express his feeling because of the curse, and finally coming to terms with his real, inner self for the first time in his life.
The idea of a killer coming when you call him is very interesting because it is different from what we have seen before.
Not just because it's genuinely scary, it's also intelligent (unlike 80% of all the slasher movies), it's extremely well acted, and it's serious which is always a plus in my book.
It should never be fun to watch people get butchered because it takes away any realism there may be.
In fact, I have to do an essay on a foreign film and chose to do this one ... problem is - I can't find too much info about it ... but, I feel that this film is great for first-time foreign movie-goers as they seem a bit hesitant at first when faced with watching a foreign movie - especially students ... because of "The Assassin" I feel that the comparison between the 2 movies will help other countries gain a greater understanding for foreign movies... it's a must see!
Clive Barker must have a pretty good imagination, because this is quite a unique horror story.
So, Candyman haunts the black population because they are the ones who tell the stories and believe in him.
In the end, Helen returns because the population of Cabrini Green makes her a part of the story.
But when she is falsely accused of several brutal murders, could the Candyman be out for revenge, because she doubted him?
Candyman is excellent because it is a film that I genuinely found very twisted and disturbing when I saw it at the tender age of 15.
I am going to throw in a few quotes in this review because the writing of this film is really, really cool!
The Candyman exists because people tell the stories about him.
The slow pacing of the film is perfect; there are no tedious blotches because you are totally wrapped in the story and by the delightful performances.
Neville remains in the city and kills his oponents in meaningless fights because tha's all there is left in his life.
In fact, they plan to go t "a new Eden" but there is no place for Neville, because he is -as one boy puts it- hostile.
Keith Cooke plays the last human kickboxer who competes in a tournament where men with cybernetic replacements, (Or are they cyborgs, whatever the case my braincells were lost during the transition) of course he is forced to fight because his girlfriend (Tina Cote) has been abducted and is being forced to train Xao (Gary Daniels) who is a cyborg.
Alive,thanks to an experimental drug that seemed to be the cure,he found in the waning days of civilized society, but because of a helicopter crash, too late for anyone but him.
I really believe that the films you see when you are between 12 and 16 remain with you forever, because its the most impressionable time of your life.
The movie did not disappoint me at all, but that might be because I saw so many familiar faces in it, being an avid Albert Pyun-fan, he used the same set of actors he always does: Jahi J. J. Zuri is making his film-debut as one of the fighters, and Thom Mathews is also playing a sympathetic fighter in the tournament, being forced to fight in the competition by the evil mastermind Tung.
I'm not sure why, because the writing and the directing are pretty solid up until that point.
The relationship between Black and White was awesome, but I fell asleep because I found it so boring.
It's not for everybody, or maybe even just me because my friend loved this movie to no end.
I won't spoil this one for anyone because it would be redundant.
(Rolls eyes) Don't even need to put locks on the cells because they won't try to escape.
What is even worse, is that some films that are bad at least have some unintentional humor to make them what some industry people call, "Golden Turkeys" The type of movies that are so bad, they are good, because they are corny.
But do NOT subscribe because of DWT, and don't rent a tape if it's offered.
I hate that type of back-and-forth thing because it's tiring to keep up with who you're supposed to like and hate.
I was amazed that the script was written by a man, because the male leading actors talk like women.
This movie to me is great because it shows the true ups and downs in marriage and friendships.
Tom and Beth are also semi-normal because she cheated on him early in the marriage and he found out, but they stayed together for the kids, like most parents do.
I am really surprised by the performance of Dennis Quaid, because he was more in action movie for me but he shows there a lot of deepness.
I got only one deception: as it is a indoor drama, I am still wondering if there is poor people or working class in America, because the houses or the families are always top!
Then there are marriages I know of that falter after like thirty years because there was just was nothing left.
When one day their friend Beth (Toni Collette) was being invited over for dinner with her two sons in tow, Beth broke the news that she and her husband Tom are being separated because he was having an affair outside of the family.
It seems Mr Capelli is the lead because he is banking the project.
The fact is the movie is really bad and for the most part because of him.
This film was average at best because of the fantastic, underused supporting cast.
my second example is near the end when black meets the minotaur and learning that it is the darkness in himself, with a inner journey he learns that the minotaur wants to let black use all his "dark" powers in the meantime white is freaking out because slowly the darkness (yang) is winning.
I want to thank your website for answering my prayer because I finally has found the movie I have been looking for, so please once again could your kind office send information on how I can download or get a copy of this movie into my PC.
the past few years i have tried to get a copy of it with out much luck till recently, it cost me a lot but it will always take pride of place in my movie collection.I think the combination of Sam Neil and Peter Strauss was in part the making of this mini series, they are both fine actors and played their parts to perfection, my partner would not have even considered watching something like this normally but sat through it because i had raved about it for so long and when it had finished he had tears in his eyes and said DAM BRILLIANT,he enjoyed it, and was glad that he had taken the time to watch it.
Found this film quite unbelievable because of the fact that so many men seemed to be attracted to Greer Garson,(Irene Forsyte) first met a very rich man named Soames Forsyte, (Errol Flynn) and Soames falls immediately in love with Irene and he keeps asking Irene to marry him and after many years of trying, Irene decided to say yes to marriage, however, she told him she does not love him.
I thought that because Greer Garson was such a great actress, all of her films had to be just as great.
I say unfortunately because the television versions (being multiple episodes) allowed the screenwriters more opportunity to dramatize more of the stories.
Robert Young is laughable as the "young" architect and Greer Garson too genteel by half for the role of the scheming adulteress Irene who freezes Soames out-Eleanor Parker would have been ideal for this role,but one gets the feeling MGM couldn't allow Garson to be the adventuress the role demanded because of her image.
A previous poster mentioned the fact that Greer Garson having an adulterous affair didn't work because she was just too likable really doesn't apply here because the fact that their marriage is unhappy is established.
The Stout-Wolfe books are one of the great achievements of detective fiction and if I am griping a bit here, it is only because they set such a high mark.
and chaotic because of the  condensation required to fit the time limits.
This will be brief because I'm not sure what to say.
Nero Wolfe has consistently defied a good translation to the screen, perhaps because so much of the attraction in Rex Stout's novels is the wit of the language.
You'll need a program to tell you what is going on, because like most modern actors, these bores cannot enunciate.
Which is just as well, because it is garbage by any standards.
There's a lot of killing and action, but it doesn't work, because you have no idea why it is going on, or how it is going on.
The action doesn't work, because it is just another neo Nazi idealist director and writers contriving every instance to save blonde women and butcher brown eyed brunettes.
So, I give Sharpe's Challenge a 7 out of 10, primarily because I liked the 14 earlier Sharpe movies so much.
And it is so because the makers decided to go for an epic sweep in presenting their story.
Now he's an international Hollywood blockbuster star since LOTR, but still agreed to return to TV for Sharpe, took a huge pay cut to do TV because he loves the part of Sharpe.
This is of course unavoidable, partly because the cast are all ten years older but also because the first Sharpe film skipped over the Indian books and had Sharpe obtaining his field commission in Spain rather than in India.
I have to give this movie very high marks because it maintained an incredibly high level of suspense, surprise and novelty through most of its 4.4 hour (without commercials) run-time.
I won't give anything away about the story because the unusual plot is is part of the wonderful experience you'll get from watching this movie.
The reason for the main character to do stuff is because he lost his child daughter in a kind of limbo and he has to get her back.
In large part because they were so annoying.
When you think you have caught all the clues watch it again because you will see many more that you didn't see before.
It feels like something based on a book, because it has such a complete and detailed mythology and a feeling of back story that is rare in the work of screenwriters.
Although I'll admit that even though I was worried that this would be the case, it didn't bother me all that much, because the story had good forward propulsion and a resolution that was emotionally satisfying although not intellectually so.
Since this isn't from a book, my guess would be they're considering this for a TV series, both because some threads seem to have been left loose on purpose and because it does feel like there's more you could mine out of the material.
i give it a 10 because it never bored me and was always thrilling.
Some of you may think you cant give a 10 but you some people also gave a Oscar to Cher because for a short moment she was a good actress.
and for this today i give this series a ten because in this moment i cant think of a better series in this genre.
I thought Miss Fannings performance was a little weak; but that may only be because her sister is just so talented.
Shows like Lost have failed to grab my attention simply because I felt as if the writers were trying to make a 5-show plot thread last for fifty.
When I'm sad or down I watch Dreamer because it never fails to make me feel good.
The love of a young girl for a horse, that by all accounts should have been shot because of the injured it suffered during an accident, is the stuff that makes good family movies.
Mr. Gantins created an excellent entertainment that will satisfy young and old because it shows a young girl with a firm resolution to do the right thing for the horse she loves.
I must admit that the real reason that I went to see Dreamer was because large parts of the film were filmed in and around Lexington, KY, my hometown.
And so, I almost passed on Dreamer because of the trailers with Dakota Fanning.
If you have any ability to follow how these types of movies go, then you will know the outcome long before it happens... it doesn't matter because you'll be wanting that outcome and you'll embrace it when it happens!!!
I didn't play close enough attention to the word "inspired" in the title because, unlike the story of Seabiscuit, this isn't what really happened.
This was exaggerated to the hilt for dramatic purposes, but that's okay once you know that because the story is, indeed, "inspirational."
I was suckered into paying to see this movie in the theater because of the title and because I like the actors.
Linda is not very happy to be the passenger in this race because she has has a job and a boss to answer too.
I bought this movie because of Veronica Hamel and she was a big disappointment.
Outside the race there's quite a lot going on as well, like Coy's sleazy brother Bennie trying to sabotage the most important rivals because he bet a huge some of money on the winner.
That being said, I did think it was funny - only because of the poor acting, bad plot, and that fact that it was a Six Million Dollar Man remake.
That being said, I did think it was funny - only because of the poor acting, bad plot, and that fact that it was a Six Million Dollar Man remake.
Andrew dice clay was ripped off big time for this show.people bashed him for his comedy,but let me tell you he is very underrated as an actor...his comedic moments are top-notch.Hollywood shows dice no respect,and he should get his due.id like to see him in more mainstream movies...as the lead man.if your offended by his stand-up comedy.,don't buy his dvds....i own everything dice has ever did regarding movies and comedy Cd's.i will root for him to make a comeback...because i for one love and appreciate his talent.the lack of respect the #1 comedian in history(record sales).gets is baffling.lastly id like to say diceman your unbelievable in my book.
I like it because it is different, and it shows a different interpretation of their comedy by the director and/or the writer of this short.
I went to see this movie because I read good review of this movie.
I've seen it because it was on tv at 2 am and i didn't feel sleepy (too much pepsi)Better wacht child's play if you wanna see some evil toy!!
When TV was in it's infancy, material like this was readily available on the Ed Sullivan show, the Jackie Gleason show, and many other classic programs, and for those of us who grew up watching TV in an era when they would only broadcast for about 12 hours per day because there was not enough material available to fill an entire 24-hour schedule, then you will be very happy to see this type of stuff once again.
The first segment of this film is a bit like a "coming of age" story that's probably a bit racier than most of its type, but then it morphs into Harry as a teenager, with hideous acne and wanting to stay away from others because of his horrible complexion.
The second segment focuses more on the idea of teenage alienation and sees the film take a darker turn as the sensitive young man is rejected by all the girls because of his deforming acne.
If you are interested in 'foreign' cinema (I mean non-Hollywood movies, because for us Belgians this isn't foreign of course), than you should definitely give this one a try.
Perhaps it was bad timing, because Barbet Schroeder's star-studded BARFLY was released almost simultaneously.
All the more recommended, because of Mondo Macabro's excellent DVD-release.
The problem with it, though, is that again and again, you really need to suspend your sense of disbelief because so much of the story really is super-human and impossible to accept.
The film disappoints because there is really no development of the drug dealers characters, and Richard Lynch has only a very minor part.
I can only hope that someday soon a contemporary Hong Kong director will come out with a film that does justice to the 10 Tigers of Canton, because this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably at doing such.
This seems strange at first because he kills nearly everyone he comes in contact with.
I wont go into this because of the sheer amount of what is there, and I always believe in people seeing movies blind, not looking for any particular preconceived message.
Monster because he is leaving all social convention behind and refusing to submit himself to any kind of structure.
Unfortunately, the lengthy running time tests tolerance levels because there is little emotional weight between the sprockets.
When he kills his first victim he ask him, are you so brutal because you are human or human because you are brutal?
Izo is brilliant movie, I'm not saying that everyone going to like it, because entertainment for everyone does not exist.
You have to work hard sometimes to get into what he's doing, because he often throws conventional plot points, "hooks" that grab you, and structure, out the window.
First and foremost, the only reason I didn't give Izo a perfect or near perfect score is because of the production value.
But he finds himself alive again, at first not understanding that he has taken on a demonic existence because his soul cannot rest and he must descend through the layers of hell in full consciousness.
Is Izo so brutal because he is inhuman, or because he is too human?
The boy finds himself pulled between his first love and the new girl (because she is cute and good natured).
is a big deal for me because i could express how i love PRINCESS HOURS....The cast was doing good in their role....the princess hours writer was very excellent he/she did a very nice/good TV-episode i hope that she will make another or continuation of this TV-episode...and i will wait for it.....but the most is the cast of this princess hours especially the two namely: shin the crown prince,the princess as well...I'm hoping and waiting to see them both in person....thanks
I can recommend Palace quite simply because it's easy to get into, has a lot to look at, and has a emotionally hooking central love story.
It became interesting because Chae-kyung is the only female in school who dared to go against Lee Shin.
Fortunately, I did continue watching, because as the film developed further, so did the characters.
And, this was all capped off by a dandy ending that I WON'T elaborate on because this would ruin the film.
And in spite of my stern admonishment above I don't believe that the feds have come clean on the incident, mostly because whatever may or may not have happened was "covered up" so quickly that there isn't a paper trail that can prove OR disprove the wildest of allegations -- That a flying saucer crashed, a rancher found bits of the junk, that a second crash site was found complete with alien life forms who may not have been quite dead.
The second crash site is important because, like all good conspiracy theories, it answers one of the basic problems with it's core premise, in this case the legendary "debris field" reports: Where were the working parts?
We are taken to meet Caco, a man that is being threatened by an opposing clan because his brother Mario killed one of the Caracava men, something that will not be forgotten until justice is done.
Since Mario is hiding in Morocco, Caco is a marked man because he represents his brother, the assassin.
This maybe because it lacks the two things that Friedman used to sell his other pictures - sex or violence.
I guess I can't complain too much, because for all intents and purposes, I got this movie for free.
I found this movie very interesting because besides being a very good movie, I was able to learn of the Tongan customs and traditions: what they found valuable and what was important to them.
It is an epic movie with a great plot, which is made even more interesting because it is based on a true story.
But because he refused, they were initially insulted and shamed.
He was not breathing because of the mango in his throat, and therefore by all outward appearances dead.
Once the mango was out, the boy remained in a coma because of his fall from the tree.
The father of the boy was also Mormon, and brought his son to Elder Groberg because of the trust he already had for him.
Just because it is a film about a Mormon Missionary doesn't mean it's not relatable to everyone.
I loved this movie more because I was able to relate to the people and places it represents.
of it and wanted to check it out just because Alicia Silverstone and Christopher Walken was in it.
This movie is excellent because there's action and also a good story that makes you think about how you live your own live.
I am this "mean" because I really don't like to see propaganda in films.Films are made for people to enjoy and relax, not to attract new followers.I don't have anything against loving the man next to you, selfishness and dedication to a cause bigger than you and I, but this is really bullshit.This film is not about "loving the man next to you".This film is about "You can find God, and peace if you repent.Repent and God will welcome you with His arms wide open.
".As proof of this, that I don't have anything against the Mormon religion,I'd have to say that I saw Salingrad (even though the film's made by "zie Germans" about "zie Germans", fuhrer and Nazi stuff mentioned in there, Sven Hassle style) and absolutely loved it, and I gave you another example with another Mormon film I really enjoyed in the last paragraph.So don't throw any rocks at me please.Just because I didn't like this movie doesn't mean that I don't like Mormons...I just don't like this film.
If you aren't a fan however then I would still suggest you watch it because it really is a bad movie, but because of that it's entertaining and fun so give it a go.
These are painful memories, all of them, and all the more so because the Holocaust has been increasingly downplayed over the past few decades--downplayed to a point at which some few now attempt to deny that it ever occurred at all.
We read on these people, associate ourselves with the affairs of their lives, judge them for their actions, name calendar days after them, hate them, worship them, write books on them, film biopics on their lives, name our babies after themÂ The reason we can't forget these people could be because they've either given to or taken from this world in proportions far greater than what you or me have.
Between the years 1933 and 1945 one man changed our world because he believed in something that seemed stupid at first.
We remember that man either because he took away from this world a chunk of our moral fiber, the scars forever etched in our minds, or probably because he gave this world freedom from the ideologies of mankind's vilest prodigy when he hanged himself.
And just when we thought that we knew too much to burden our consciences, comes a movie about this small group of men who disappeared off the face of the earth because of something that disturbs, intrigues and thwarts us till this day: Love, and all the stigma it carries.
Some, among them is a half-Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort; Annette Eick, the Jewish lesbian who escaped to England with the help of a woman she loved; the German Christian photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, then joined the army on his release because he "wanted to be with men" and Pierre Seel, the French Alsatian teenager, who watched as his lover was eaten alive by dogs in the camps.
While I think that everyone should see this film because of its vitally important subject matter, I feel that because of lax editing and meandering, incomplete story telling, it was much less effective than it should have been.
Additionally, one of the major points of this film should be how many gay concentration camp victims were still treated as prisoners after the war, specifically because of Paragraph 175.
Bottom line: because of the important subject matter and the live interviews the film needs to be seen.
There's a Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort; a photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, who upon his release joined the army because of the lack of men in his hometown and he "wanted to be with men."
Their stories are indeed heart wrenching, because unlike the Jews, they have forced to live quietly, unable to share their horrific experiences for so long.
I did not expect much (because usually I am not the documentary type), but the mixture of old film footage and photos (with some 20s and 30s music) and interviews of a few of the survivors (7 homosexualls, 1 lesbian) was very interesting.
The big thing about this movie is to get to know about what happened in that time, because no one spoke about this when we were talking about the second world war in history class.
I can't say that Primitif is the worst film in the cannibal genre, because White Cannibal Queen takes the cake, but I can say that it is following the same path.
This is one of those rare movies that the director should have given the celluloid away instead of wasting it on this film, and the world would be a better place because of it.
Poor Tommy is killed, and I cried at that part not because it was so sad, but it was the most unrealistic and sappiest moment in movie history.
The other two make it out on a raft with his body, and escape because the river's the cannibals' territory boundary.
I can't be sure of this, because I checked the cast list on the IMDb listing, and his name wasn't there.
(There's even more hardships because she's a MERMAID!!!)
It is great for all ages, because I am twelve!
She gets to do this because she's 'pretty' and 'vulnerable' and 'naive'.Â Yawn.
It ended in 1955 because her TV husband Jim Backus quit the show.
Her mom left her when she was a child & because of this she has a romanticized notion of her mother & a deep fear of abandonment.
( i wont say which movie - because , for whatever the reason - even IMDb doesn't have him listed as being part of it!)
Poor Porky can't share in that because Petunia's dog "Fluffnins" growls each time he reaches for a piece (of candy).
Do not watch this movie, even if it's because people say not to.
I ended up sitting through a snore fest, and I can't even tell you what it was about because my attention span stops after 5 minutes when there isn't a violent murder.
Partly because he can create movies that have good solid plots yet is able to transcend those plots to give us something else.
The film is a classic because it cambium's humor ,action & horror all in the same film.
the film is also worth watching for the performances of Bruce Spence & Chris Haywood because these actors are still working !
Its not the greatest film but it a film that will make you watch from start to finish because you never know what will happen next!
Simply a fun movie that's hardly dull, because it rambles along with many awkward situations and black humour.
Don't watch it if you think low budget is the same as being 'amateurish' because it's not.
All members of the community are basically insane psychopaths, yet you symphatize with them a lot more because the "hero" (Arthur) is such an antipathetic loser and the young generation (that eventually revolts against the town's ancient habits) are boisterous and uncanny freaks.
I know that most people wish to forget their viewing of "The Cars that Ate Paris" because it moves slow and looks dark, but the basic premise really is one of the best horror ideas ever coming from Australian cinema.
Not overlong, it still seems a little slow now at times but it's probably because unlike in the mid 70s when this was considered unique , so much else has been seen.
Saw the film last night on cable and decided to wait until today, October 30th, to post a review, because it happens to be Mark and Michael's birthday.
Twin Falls Idaho is a haunting, deeply personal story about a relationship that probably turned off a lot of people solely because of its two main characters.
And in the end, you cry for the characters, not because they are different, but because we are all so much alike.
I have to say this because I almost made the fatal mistake of classifying this movie with the sentimental, depressing, and whiny ones, based on the little I'd heard about it.
On this other hand, it is a shame that the subtler overtones of the story can easily get buried because of this very focus, and scare some "fun"-loving people away.
The Invisible Maniac, Sorority House Massacre 2 and Hard to Die are in a sense a trilogy because they all have Melissa Moore, nudity and bad acting.
I know, you want to see it because the cover shows a hot female body holding a machine gun, and because it's been out of print on DVD for years and now there's a certain level of mystique about it... but I'm telling you, there is absolutely NOTHING here that's worth looking at!
I have seen this DVD sell for more than $100 on Ebay, simply because it's not being made anymore.
I know, because I'm one of those people.
Wynorski's films win because he creates schlock that believes in itself.
In Sorority House Massacre II (which beats out HtD only marginally as the best B-movie, because it actually features a haunted house,) he used lengthy unrelated scenes from Slumber Party Massacre as back-story to SHM II.
The boys thought I was just as funny because I would tell them about my childhood days while we watched.
Just don't watch it with, like, a 4-year-old, because they'll get really really bored.
Friends weren't exited about the movie some time ago, so I went to see it myself because I finally got to read some Asimov books.
The movie is heartwarming because of all the beautiful scenes, the great detail in the progress of a robot trying to become a human being and the leaps in the timeline.
Why even view the film, in that case, because we know there will be no such robots, at least not by 2005?
I went in with mediocre expectations, particularly because I don't have much affinity for movies dealing with artificial intelligence.
In a sense, I think I related to Andrew because of my personality; I'm awkward in social situations, and am always utterly agreeable.
Watching the people Andrew loved die was probably the part of the film that touched me most, because I'm a very nostalgic person at heart - I love recalling past incidents, people I knew... and I felt Andrew's pain at losing the people he loved most.
There wasn't much fanfare about this movie when it played in theaters, probably because of its languid pace and its romantic atmosphere.
This film does have its humor and that humor is often hilarious in parts, but thats because its delivered so brilliantly by Williams who plays his character to perfection.
For most of my reviews for films, I don't like commenting too much on the plot, but here I feel the need to because it touched me so much and the plot helps explain why this happened.
As Andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them I really did feel for him like I say because I would find it incredibly hard to live if I was like that.
I felt this way because the scenes where we do have the privilege to see Andrew reinvented are wonderfully inventive and interesting.
Thank god del Toro got his role in Traffic, because this quite easily could have wrecked his career.
When I lived in Hong Kong I recorded all the episodes on to VHS and have since placed on DVD-R. Now that Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are out, rumors are that 4 and 5 will never be released because of trouble with Spelling and Robert Wagner.
But by the time Tanya came on, the ratings had dropped because of Shelly Hack and it was over!
In my opinion the best seasons are two and three, maybe its partly because when i started watching it it was these seasons that i saw, but i do prefer Kris Munroe to Jill Munroe .
I wanted to watch this movie, part because I enjoyed the easy going humor in "Clueless", and part because I like Alicia Silverstone as a young actress.
Her departure was such a loss to the show because Sabrina had so much personality and she actually had a great sense of humor and the only one who was believable as a detective.
Maybe because these were the only episodes that were focused on a single Angel, Kelly and Jill, respectively, rather than the others which were group efforts...) Kate was excellent and extremely compelling as Sabrina Duncan, Farrah was quite good (sometmes mesmerizing) as the fun-loving, athletic, charming flirt Jill Munroe (I have always thought her comedienne skills could have been tapped into more) and Jaclyn was beyond lovely and sweet as Kelly Garrett, the perfect third banana.
By the third season, the producers and everyone else involved (sans the actresses) figured that because the ratings had not slipped, then the success of the show had nothing to do with quality, because the third season's episodes were mostly not very good, sometimes pretty bad.
), the show went into steep decline, which nevertheless held attention because of the girls.
Shelly Hack was laughably bad, perhaps because she took the show too seriously.
The on screen chemistry between Franco & Milian is irresistible, mostly because they constantly argue and try to abandon each other, and whenever the action sequences are about to kick in the splendid title song begins to play.
I think Corbucci was vastly underrated because he happened to make movies in the same vicinity as Leone who seemed more likely to pick and choose from various American westerns (even though he's been orally serviced by too many people, I still do like his stuff) whereas Sergio Deuce pounded out some westerns that I think truly compete with the best of Mr. Leone.
Some of the dialog is in Italian with subtitles because it was taken from a Euro print and was never dubbed into English.
I like it a little more than "The Great Silence" because of its eccentric style and storyline.
This Western-Comedy film was directed by Sergio Corbucci, the number #2 Italian director of all time for Spaghetti Westerns, after of course Sergio Leone, for the entire Spaghetti Western genre, which is saying a lot because there were hundreds of films in that genre alone!
It is no doubt a crime to have got so far into my review without mentioning Jack Palance's performance in much detail, because his performance as the unhinged, marijuana smoking John is scene stealing.
They were called this because during a period before 1935 or so, the Hollywood Production Code either didn't exist or was pretty much ignored.
FORBIDDEN is definitely a case of an adult Pre-Code film because its main themes are adultery and an illegitimate baby.
As for Stanwyck according to a biography about her, she was involved with Capra because of her abusive and jealous first husband Frank Fay who literally terrorized her on the set of his film.
Lulu alone and almost homeless has Bob's baby, Roberta, whom she at first refuses to see in the maternity ward because the child reminds her of him.
Fortunately he didn't because although the story is "soggy and 99.44% pure soap opera", using his own words, it still retains powerful moments and excellent interpretations from its main actors: Barbara Stanwyck and Adolphe Menjou.
Benicio del Toro's performance was all right, even though (or: because) he seemed to think he was in a remake to the 'Usual Suspects'.
- a 10 out of 10 because the real life cats were boxing and it was really awesome!!
Lee and his work fall into the latter; he does not have the touch to do effective satire because he is too close to the subject matter.
I only got this movie because I collect movies that are related to the beer and brewing business as part of my breweriana collection.
I can't tell, but I ask because a friend of mine told me she had watched a little bit of this film and then stopped because it was bad; and I found it truly entertaining, funny and charming.
She is faking a kidnapping an hides in the trunk of a car waiting to be found; he is a car thief and steals that car, takes it to his garage and discovers that someone is making noiseÂThis scene is fantastic because the thief acts like he doesn't understand, and when he discovers it is only a girl, he gets scared.
She is portrayed by Alicia Silverstone as a grown person who hasn't really grown up and does mischief to get her millionaire father angry; because she knows he can spend any amount of money to find her anywhere.
I'd like to add that Silverstone's had a short career and she was discovered because of Aerosmith (she looked nice in that video); but she's got it.
But the best development is the relationship between Emily and the thief; they start with the wrong foot because neither of them understands how they ended up in the situation they're living, but soon they have to deal with the fact that they look good together and that probably each of them is the part that's missing in the other one.
As this movie went along, I was observing his performance carefully because it appeared similar to something I've seen before; but I couldn't discover it.
Is it because there were some Black leaders greater than Whites.
Is it because most of our history might be tainted with a lot of lies and cover up?
She thinks she's come into it, but she finds she's inherited debts beyond belief because dad was borrowing and living well beyond his means.
Her road was much harder than Jimmy Stewart's because Miss Dove never married, she instead devoted her life to teaching history and geography and never getting to see the faraway places with strange sounding names that she only read about.
jump at the chance to watch it if you like classics, because this is one good classic.
The film is so good because it depicts what schools are supposed to be.
Under the fine direction of Henry Koster, Miss Dove succeeds because it's a slice out of Americana.
It is a scene which could have been cut out, and was not because of the sexual appeal.
I'm glad I can fast forward at 16 times normal play speed, because it got used often.
I'm glad I can fast forward at 16 times normal play speed, because it got used often.
I was reluctant to watch this film because I have never enjoyed films about men in prison.
In the case of Marie/Audrey/Robbie/etc., all three systems failed for a long time, simply because it seemed so hard to believe that a woman would kill her husband and try to poison her own child for insurance that was no more than modest.
Well, she was able to do it precisely because she estimated just how extensive the parameters of normal behavior would be under these conditions.
This story is all the more intriguing because it is based on truth, and apparently John Homan (Hilley's beleaguered husband) was also murdered in a bizarre robbery incident in 1989.
I'm quite surprised this movie hasn't made it to IMDb's top 250 list, because this should be a movie that is recognized as the best performance from Meryl Streep in film history.
This movie was given an 8/10 purely because of Meryl Streep's forever amazing performance.
This is true because some of the things in the world are just too difficult to imagine.
It's a commendable acting job, most especially because nothing else in this vehicle quite comes off.
Someone once saw it for the first time, and commented, "I didn't think I would like it, especially because it was such a downer at times.
Could it be because he's a psychopath?
Probably, but we never find out for sure, because the filmmaker never goes beneath the surface to explore anything.
The murderer gets only 2 years in prison, according to the subtitles--could that be because the courts of Japan would consider his crime "justified"?
I gave this a 3 because of the cinematography and Stingo.
Still gets four stars because Streep is just so good.
And this is where synchronicity starts: because all the form is just equally inept, unable, clumsy, luke warm, unwilling, closed-off, just as the world it portrays.
...all of the characters in this astounding book/movie were as good or as unimportant as viewers/readers found them to be, simply because William Styron developed them that way: Stingo WAS an unexperienced nerd, having lived an idyllic life in the South with nothing happening in his life, yet aspired to write the Great American Novel; how perfect for a virginous male to so fortunate to live with people who educate him what a horrendous journey life can be.
McNichols was perfect for this role, because he was the opposite of Sophie.
The end of the movie, however sad it is, is not at all depressing, because somehow we felt throughout the whole movie, that Sophie was doomed from the start, that there was no other solution than this and that it's probably more peaceful for her than to go on and on.
It beats out "Stagecoach," "Cimmaron," "Once Upon a Time in the West," "the Magnificent Seven" and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" as my favorite Western only because it seems so effortless and modest.
There are already too many comments on this one, but ... As usual, lots of people seeing this movie were looking for characters to "relate to," and feeling jaded because not only is there a dearth of such characters, but the film also forces the viewer to re-evaluate his or her personal belief systems.
If anything, his character is more repellant because his personality is not the overblown, cartoonish behavior of Chad.
we try to find a concrete reason to their evilness, but we can't, we want to leave our seat because that's too disturbing but the questions we're asking ourselves can't let us leave it.
It makes people feel bad because they got used to feeling good.
During the viewing I wished that the director had bothered to show us what exactly the main character spoke to his eel when they two communicate, because the eel seems the only connect he had and mean a lot to him.
His real motives seem to be to manipulate people just because he can.
What most viewers miss is that Howard has a chance to live on his own terms and goofs because of a misguided need for male bonding.
I was so utterly disgusted and horrified (mostly because it was billed as a "comedy"), I never wanted to see it again.
The pacing was tight, the six weeks seemed to fly by because we were glued to the results.
But Christine chooses Chad over Howard, clearly because Chad was more cute and charming in her eyes.
I think I agree with an interview I saw with LaBute where he said he thought Howard was actually the more despicable character, because Chad is only in it for the game, where Howard starts to take those feelings seriously.
Without that explanation, he'd still find reasons to be cruel, because his pleasure comes from seeing others in pain.
Worse, he can get away with his cruelty, because he is charming, charismatic, and effectively manipulative in his dealings with people.
He's more chilling because he doesn't have a clear reason for his badness -- he just enjoys being cruel.
And just because you're black.Joel Katz' documentary from 2002 is very touching, very moving movie about one stain in American history.There are Abel's sons, Michael and Robby, talking about the song, about their father.Pete Seeger sings a piece of the song and plays with his guitar.Again your eyes get wet.Amiri Baraka, Don Byron, Abbey Wilson and Cassandra Wilson are also talking there.This movie makes you mad, it makes you sad.There is a stain you can't clean.
I'm sorry if I'm not being very clear about why I didn't like it, but I wouldn't know where to start: could it be because there is not a drop of originality whatever?
I gave this movie a 1 out of 10, only because 0 is not an option.
Disposable twenty-somethings, each a stereotypical self-absorbed kid with designs on winning a cool million on this reality show which is a cross between Survivor and Real World, find themselves in quite the dilemma:the producer of the show they represent is a deranged sicko, his psychopathy a result of his dismissal on a "Bachellorette" type of reality show, using his equally nutty brother, who hangs on his every command, to carry out a massacre, because you see once a contestant is eliminated or "voted off", they really are ELIMINATED.
The film's sole novelty is seeing Edward Furlong as the nutcase producer, who opens the film stalking Jaime Pressly(..I guess she was friends with the director or something, stopping by because she owed him a favor, I guess), successful in getting revenge for how she duped him in front of millions of viewers for another.
I'm a girl, but have to admit that Jaime Pressly looked hot ;) I'm trying to find out who did the music at the end, because it sounded like someone famous.
Part of the reason people seem to think it is terrible may be because, whether intentionally or not, the film sets about mocking Reality Television (which is a major part of the film), so while you may watch the film and think that it is rubbish, perhaps that is what the creators want you to think.
I was excited for the film, but because of the lack of updates - I just expected this movie to be released "one day".
Cruel World is a slasher film you don't take seriously at all, because it is a movie that is pure, slasher fun with a lot of humor involved.
The movie gains intensity because of the challenge Keiko presents to Yamashita's crumbled self, and some of his scenes of self-questioning are rewarding, but in the end I think movie is too sloppy and inconsequent.
Which makes me wonder: did he imagine the adultery as well, and killed his wife only because of his frustrations with himself?
I did not expect much of this movie at first knowing it wasn't john woo who directed it, but after just the first 5 min i was totally into the movie and had forgotten who directed the movie, because it was equally great, and i couldn't ask for more  get this movie!
Apart from these there is nothing else in this film, so for those who don't like dialogue don't bother with this film because you'll be bored.
sorry- but this is my story:   When I first saw this ground-breaking film- truly outstanding among the early documentaries- (possibly the first depiction) of: lesbian (hidden) history & culture, I enjoyed it immensely, but I had difficulty understanding any speech in the film, because I am deaf- I rely on captions!
I love watching movies, and often times, I ignore documentaries, because I feel they're too dry.
It is almost non-sensical because of it.
"The Doomsday Machine" gets a "3" from me because it was at least always coherent.
I feel especially bad for Grant Williams, a fine actor, who was likely blacklisted because of his sexual preferences, not to mention a well publicized feud with Jack Webb, then director of production for Universal.
I bought the video because the plot sounded like an adaptation of a great mid-1960s comic book I own, one of my prized possessions.
All the more unfortunate because there is precious little of Sondheim's work that has been preserved.
While Elizabeth Taylor really tries with her role she doesn't quite get there and any scenes with Diana Rigg she may as well not try because Rigg steals the entire show as the strong willed Charlotte.
The male cast members are pathetic and you can tell they are from the stage because they act dreadfully.
Okay, so lots of people thought this stunk because Elizabeth Taylor couldn't sing, it missed the magic of stage presence and it is not really good movie material.
Many different leading men were considered, and in the end Cariou was only brought in at the very last minute because no one else had been signed.
Then, the next hour or more of the film is watching both Melvin and his wife, Lynda, screw up their lives again and again because they both have the wisdom and intelligence of tree shrews.
Melvin divorces her, takes her back and she's off again mostly because Melvin spends like a drunken sailor.
Don't be surprised if you have never heard of "Melvin and Howard" because most people haven't.
The fact that he is a Communist (McCarey and some of his apologists seem to suggest) means that those goals must be evil because the methods are evil.
Some other reviewers say the last 3rd is spoiled because of Walker's death.
I don't like to review the politics of a film, because every film has a political viewpoint, however subtle, and I have an open mind.
What is horrible is the culture that produced the "need" for this propaganda, and that was never able to know or tell the truth because of political institutions.
That was a great idea because there are some huge musical numbers that completely fill the wide screen.
Audiences of today may not appreciate this movie because of their lack of familiarity with the comic strip but I feel that `older' viewers (who enjoyed the comic strip) will like this movie a lot.
That is a long time and you know why that long, because it was a great show.
I realize that Bette walked off the film, some say because of her failing health, others say Bette (as sick as she was) knew that this steaming pile was beneath her.
Whatever the reason I am glad that we can at least say that Bette walked off because this STAIN on her glorious career is as bad as I have ever seen!
Her speech is slurred because of one of the strokes she had and wears a terrible red wig.
I only saw this because it was Davis' last film.
What she seemed unable to understand that this sort of demands which she had been known for back in her prime was supremely out of style by now, and for an actress of her stature to assume she could throw her ego around just because, was pushing it a little.
You could say it's a guilty pleasure of mine, but I wouldn't say that because I don't feel guilty at all for loving it!
The cable broadcasts deleted a few scenes (not because of content, but because of time) and it makes the transition from one scene to the next a bit bumpy unless you know what's missing.
How can a mother do such thing to her own daughter only because she loves another woman?
I gave it an 8 out of 10 because, as a TV movie, it wasn't quite as high quality as a theatrical movie on the same subject would be.
But with a same sex relationship it is more because of the difficulties and decisions needed to create the new life.
I kept waiting for someone to stand up and declare the obvious - that it was wrong to deprive a loving, caring mother of her child simply because some bigots don't approve of who she loves.
So it was appalling to me that even though there was no basis in law for granting custody to Jody Ann's appalling mother, simply because of a judge's personal bias custody was granted.
Both of whom betrayed her and lied on the stand, simply because they were angry that she had chosen to love another woman.
Nigel Bruce and Frank Morgan are of course both priceless in this movie, because you could ask either of them to read the list of ingredients on a cereal box and they would still exude their own striking personalities, and Powell has a few moments, but his character comes off as stock and flat, just like Crawford's.
I give it 10/10 not because it deserves 10/10, but because it deserves more than 4.3 (which is the current rating as I write my review).
This is because one of the characters that doesn't shut up is the Great Prince, and he's voiced by Patrick Stewart.
Sure, "Bambi II" is not better than the original, and that's OK because it doesn't try to be better.
It was mediocre music and it didn't take away from the movie itself because the animation was so true to the majestic original.
But don't take that as meaning that this film is bad because it was actually a pleasant surprise.
I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!).
Bambi 2 is a definite recommendation, it's a different Disney sequel than I've ever seen because it seems like this one could have been in the theaters.
I was so afraid to watch this movie, because Bambi is one of my favorite cartoons ever, and I was afraid that this sequel will spoil it.
That's because the basic premise and acting were very good.
Unfortunately, I assume the original writers must have died or suffered massive head injuries because the witty dialog and fascinating story completely lost its way midway through the film.
So my dislike for this film is not because I hate older films.
Perhaps it's because there's a legitimate gap in the original story for this to fill (Between the death of Bambi's Mother and his return as an adult), or maybe because of the creative details that were added (Several ideas and sequences were taken straight from the book, which was a nice surprise), but I found myself genuinely enjoying this movie.
It is not a thriller because it is so lacking in anything interesting for me to be thrilled about.
It is not a comedy because it is not funny.
But I have a feeling that she still remembers this film because we both had a great time watching it, and we spoke of it for years afterwards.
I say that he was "set off," because if he did in every apartment what he does in Jill's then he would have been locked up a long time ago.
I'd argue this is even more successful to me than Wave or Paris were, perhaps because it's main focus was on two individuals.
I enjoyed this film very much because I am a history teacher and love realistic war films.
Unfortunately, while this film was big on realism, it also will probably seem a tad dull to the average person because it did stress realism and not huge name actors and unnecessary action.
The actors were surprisingly good (too good for this film anyway), but us as the audience didn't really empathise with the characters they played (probably because most of the characters had the annoying factor, this was probably their intention, but that only works for likable B movies i'm afraid), which is kind of important in a film like this.
Having the characters come together gradually was also clever, I like it when films do this, because it shows that all the characters had a life before the event, and not just the main character.
That said, I still enjoyed this film, especially because of the acting and dialog between Karloff and Lugosi.
Don't know, because half of them are killed by accidents, while the Bog Man is killing innocent bystanders in the nearby town.
This usually had me ready to pee my pants, because you just knew whatever he was going to do would blow up in his face.
It was easy to dismiss "Lobo" as a Dukes clone because of some similarities on the surface.
It was of course a failure in Korea because despite some good films coming from that country most Koreans enjoy formulaic sappy love comedies.
That said, you could dismiss the story as just another slice-of-life piece because it does boil down to a simple tale of two old friends getting together for a visit.
I suppose my primary issue with Woman is that, because of its rambling nature, it doesn't fully cohere in the end, especially with a coda that spins out of the original setup and while I'd be surprised with any sort of total closure in a Hong film, the strands thematically go a little far out, leaving the viewer is left grasping for more strongly tied together story.
That is because that kind of film, which for instance aside from this film includes Nil By Mouth, No Country For Old Men, Brick, or any given John Cassavetes movie, is not clean or neat.
Unlike the two men, she has no buried intention to compensate for or hold on to days gone by, not just for the reason that it's upsetting, but also because she is altogether here and now.
I don't find it to be a discouraging element to making the decision to see a movie, because that is a reaction that is highly unusual.
It is not a sign that this is a bad film or that it's a profoundly brilliant film, because really it's neither.
There is a number of scenes of ungainly sex, perhaps because of a forlorn lack of communication.
I have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...  What about the movie?
;nbody, really, to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks,the grandmother who might be locked up because she's a monster, but no, her worst fault is smoking.
I give this film 3/10, because, God help us, there actually have been worse movies made before.
In my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as "The Mummy" because of the success of Brendan Fraser`s film.
I always found the movie vague, as you can read in an earlier comment on the movie, although this has changed recently because I decided to watch it again for a report I had to make for religion class (I recommend you to also watch this movie if you need to make a similar report).
I figured this couldn't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops.
He must have done this because he was bored and needed the money.
There may be clues in the many spin-offs and remakes may provide some clues - because none of them are remotely close.
It is unfortunate because these probably could have been avoided, and the film would have approached perfection.
Mr. Durning plays a World War II veteran who has been suffering in silence because he believes he killed his best friend on Okinawa in 1945.
Which is a shame, because even here, at the start of his directing career, there is a wonderful flair for drama, set design, light, and effect.
This was an unusual role for Ladd to play, and it adds a lot to the film, because you don't quite know what to expect from him.
That's because almost every film in the genre seems to consist of only about 5 or 10 plots (or less).
The problem is that although Ladd is a hothead with a checkered past, he's too decent to keep up the ruse--though Keith is now angry enough to eat hornets because he was counting on this big payoff.
Of course, the movie's success is largely because of Cagney's vibrant and mesmerizing acting: Cagney brings a certain irresistibly devilish charm to the role of Tom Powers which in turn makes the little nasty sociopath more of a strangely appealing anti-hero than a totally hateful full-blown villain.
The whole segment feels much more violent than it actually is, because of the effective use of camera and sound (which was in its infancy, but which Wellman uses superbly).
Most of the other actors come off poorly next to Cagney, because his style of acting was so different from the conventions of the time.
Instead of just telling you that Cagney is a heartless jerk or showing him do some "sanitized" violence, he is a cruel man who is vile enough to slam a half a grapefruit in his girlfriend's face--just because he's bored with their relationship.
Compared to Mervyn LeRoy's "Little Caesar", "The Public Enemy" is a little more -- well, I don't want to use the word "sophisticated" because it's anything but that.
Also, she looks, well, BIG in this movie, maybe because she's paired with Cagney, but it's not just that she's as tall as he is but that she's zoftig too, a bit more broad of beam than has been noticeable in her other films.
Tom Powers inspired violence because he was ruthless in the way he wanted to do things.
Oddly enough in The Roaring Twenties Cagney is a veteran who enters the rackets because he can't get a legitimate job and its easy money.
It is also of great historical importance because it is the first movie that paired Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, the two most venerated iconic figures of the horror genre.
"Public Enemy," however, was a bigger-budget production, directed by William Wellman, and it contained all the elements of successÂ It is the story of two brothers who become Chicago booze barons in the Twenties... One was Cagney, the other Edward WoodsÂ   It is sometimes claimed that the story of "Public Enemy" is based on that of "Little Hymie" Weiss, leader of the North Side Chicago gang after the murder of Dion O'Banion by the Capones in 1924Â What is more likely is that the Cagney characterization is based on "Little Hymie"; the plot itself is pure fictionÂ   When Cagney, in his striped pajama, sat opposite Mae Clarke at breakfast and decided he had had enough of this boring broad, he wasted no timeÂ He picked up half a grapefruit and planted it full into Clarke's faceÂ It was a piece of screen action which has lasted down the years as the ultimate in violence from the gangster to his mollÂ   Of course, it isn't Â it just seems that wayÂ Since then gir1s have been slapped, kicked, beaten up, run over, shot, stabbed and raped, all in the tradition of mobster violenceÂ   But at the time this scene was daring, and the more daring because it was totally unexpectedÂ We remember Mae Clarke in "Public Enemy," yet forget that Jean Harlow was in it, tooÂ There may have been good reasonÂ The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1934, commented: "The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the role of a gangster's mistress."
Good for me, because I think I need new glasses.
The grad student that Russell played was (although annoying in the beginning) the one saving grace in this movie, because the character acted as a device that separated the viewer from the actions taking place.
I put 2 stars instead of 1 just because i didn't change the channel and made me stay and watch how bad a movie can be.
i gave it two star because i actually couldn t wait to see what bad acting would come next.
Maybe this will be a future cult film ....who knows,  The ending brought you to your knees as well because you couldn't get up to actually watch the credits.
Okay, I simply had to see this since I saw it's "sequel" first (about two years ago), UNSEEN EVIL 2 (aka ALIEN 3000), and I immensely enjoyed it because it was truly one of the worst movies I had seen in a very long time.
This movie is interesting because it features a very well made and elaborated cinematography which contributes much to overcome the script and acting shortages.
That she can't sing is obvious because it's immediately apparent that a professional singer is doing the songs (India Adams).
It's too bad this is such a silly vehicle because Crawford, hovering around fifty at that point in her career, seems determined to make something substantial out of it.
This is a great romantic story because when Tye was able to see, he viewed Jenny Stewart in a show where Jenny sung the song, "Tenderly" and he never forgot her great performance.
I am going to do some snarking because this movie deserves it.
I am guessing Joan Crawford made this movie because she missed MGM and wanted to take a last look.
I guess the filmmakers realized his utter lack of importance, because he disappears halfway through.
I must confess I get a kick of out her lines like that, because my name happens to be Jenny.
Or maybe the hairdresser was incompetent, because I ended up with orange hair for that exact reason one time.
I think she does very well with the scene mainly because of how she reacts to her failure--she's appalled.
She's bothered because she's in love with a man who doesn't know what she looks like, but her mother recalls a connection that Jenny and Tye had before the injury that left him blind.
I love that scene because it's strange.
At first she is resistant to his music and dislikes him because he is not intimidated by her.
We're asked to believe that because Mike Wilding as Tye Graham can't "see" his hot blonde fellow musician (because he lost his sight in WWII), that he could never love her (even though she's younger, prettier, sweeter and a BILLION times better for him than "Jenny").
We're asked to believe that because Tye saw Jenny in a musical right before he left for the war (which even she admits she wasn't that good in) and reviewed it for a newspaper, that, somehow, seven years later, she will find it in her big charcoal black heart to "love" him.
And to add an extra cherry on top of the sundae, we're asked to believe that even though he was a journalist, went to war, then came back blind, now he is suddenly a brilliant pianist who knows every note of every song Jenny is going to (lip-synch) sing, even though it's a new show with new songs that the public hasn't heard yet -- songs that he already has memorized (because Jenny's former MD, who could not STAND her, "teaches" Mike the songs).
Probably the most exciting scene is when Jenny decides to throw a party on a Sunday night after a week of grueling rehearsals because she has her eye on Tye and wants to get to "know" him better.
It was well worth purchasing this movie because I watch it on a regular basis, like once every 6 to 8 months.
There are rumors about the film having originally a runtime of 80 minutes, where it expanded on several parts of the plot that were left unexplained in the final version; but that this scenes ended up cut because they were considered too disturbing for its time.
The last chapter of Asimov's "I, Robot" presents a similar issue, and the way it's written suggests that we'd better let the computers guide us, because they're programmed to have at heart the good of all mankind.
Worth a look!I rate this one a nine because of the dated look of it.
I have managed to watch a widescreen version, and I must say that it still adds up,despite the dated technology.The film has no stars in it, which is good because you are solely focused on the story and nothing else.What is refreshing is that this is sci -fi that refuses to dumb down-hardly any violence,flashy effects and no sex.
To watch him slowly crumble in the face of what he has created is frightening because he seems so implacable for most of the movie.
We put our faith in him because he reacts to each twist in the plot with a knowing smile.
Of the three, "Le Chaudron infernal" (or "The Infernal Cauldron") is the most well-known, mainly because this film followed MÃ©liÃ¨s' interest in the horror genre.
However, there is a reason for this considerably shorter runtime: it's short because the process of coloring the film was lengthy, and MÃ©liÃ¨s wasn't able to make longer colored films (and as written above, that's why he only made 7 colored shorts in his career).
Despite this problems, "Le Chaudron infernal" is definitely one of the most interesting movies done by the legendary French magician, not only because of its inventive use of color as a special effect, but also because of its place in the history of the horror genre.
The reason why I don't watch this anymore because Im too busy playing "Mario Power Tennis".
Also, I usually don't like children television shows because it's lack of cussing, violence, etc..
For a cartoon that has been produced on the cheap, I like it, because it is funny.
For example: Cooper hates Ben, because he is a natural leader and he had good ideas to survive, therefore they were fighting every time and they shoot each other when the daughter of Cooper one became into a zombie.
(sorry if my English is regular or bad, because I speak a little of English)
The characters aren't very likable but we do begin to like to them because they do whatever they can to stay alive during this tragedy.
The feminists may complain that the original was to sexist because it portrays women as weak and defenseless.
It almost hurts to say that because of the fact that it is a remake, but it's true.
Sometimes characterized as a scene-for-scene remake, those critics should open their eyes a little wider because the end was completely different from the original, as was the beginning -- also taking the second paragraph's points into consideration as well.
This is only due-to the constraints that faced the original--mostly because it was treading-virgin-soil!
You can never top the 1968-version, it will never be done, because it was so revolutionary (still is) and original.
Barbara and Ben, their world turns upside down, because these strange people are trying to get in the house.
In fact 30 to 40 % of George A. Romero's Screenplay wasn't filmed, because of Budgetary Reasons.
2/10 and that was only because the beginning was funny!
And because of an obviously bigger budget for improved makeup effects, the zombies look even better.
Rather it's because they failed to HAVE an intelligent ending because of what happened next.
Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but "Night of the Living Dead" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise.
I found this a little slow but that's because I've seen the first multiple times in the past.
The murderer is not killing because he is a  Nazi, but because he is insane.
it would have been up for the Golden Boy Oscar come Spring, but that year between 1966-1967 (in films anyway) changed because of (what the great critic Stanley Kaufmann coined) "THE FILM GENERATION" was born.
Was it because he was usually on the a British officer?
And Philipe Noiret as Morand, who doesn't care that Grau is a Wehrmacht officer, any more than Grau cares that HE'S in the French Resistance, not just because they're "colleagues", but because they're not just colleagues in a "grudging" way, the way it is in many similar stories.
I do however understand why it's there - it's because by attaching the "good" German generals to the plot of killing Hitler, they let the audience not feel bad for rooting for them.
I'm not going to go into detail on the story, because if you haven't seen it, you should.
I am Russian and I just checked this movie out because i heard so much about it.
When i first heard that this film is similar to "Nocnoj dozor" i was disappointed (when i finished watching "Nocnoj dozor" i was really very mad, because i didn't like it), but when i watched "Tureckii gambit" i understood that only thing similar in these two films is special effects (sure special effect were nice in "Nocnoj dozor" but surely not the plot").
It seems so, because most of the watcher actually do not expect that from a Russian movie.
This movie is inspired from Italian movie Desica's Girasoli, I (1970),neverthless no complaints because i don't believe in originality.The movie is worth watching because of good story and flow of the story.A.R.Rehmans score and P.C.Sreeram's camera is beautiful.The movie has romance and patriotism.Good natural performance by the acting team also.Maniratnam was in great form during this period,he gave continuous hits of Mouna Ragam,Nayagan,Agni Natchathiram,Geethanjali,Anjali,Thalapathi.There were many cute scenes in the movie.It is also visually stunning.
Even Vittoria Desica might have been happy watching this movie because such a solid,positive enhancement of his work.
This is by far the best directed movie I have seen by Mani Rathnam (even better than Iruvar), mostly because the story flowed so smoothly and the subtle details that were present, especially when Rishi Kumar (Arvind Swamy) was kidnapped.
This movie gets a 10/10 simply because of its uniqueness but that does not mean that it is not without flaws.
Well he might have actually done more than I can remember because I saw this movie more than a decade ago.
However, it does not last for long, because it is soon revealed that Verdegast has come back after 15 years to claim his wife and daughter from the clutches of Poelzig.
We want him to succeed because he wants to succeed, but we want him to fail for his own good (and that of his very sympathetically portrayed wife, not to mention all the settlers in Arizona).
It is interesting that in spite of the damage done by Reavis, the film is sympathetic to him, creating a happy ending, which was not even true, because Reavis died alone in a shack.
This is mainly because the characters, and in particular the German soldiers, are more than just the kind of cardboard cliches one expects from this type of low-budget movie.
I only use the word surprising because I happened upon this movie very late one night a long time ago.
In fact, this is a remarkable and hugely improbable drama, made even more remarkable because much of it is true.
In silent films and well into the 1930s, Rossitto was cast in movies purely because of his physique, and he was a wretchedly bad actor, being especially inept with dialogue.
Of course it does appeal to Indians, because these are their films, but I mean can't you at least come up with something better.
not all is wasted though because if nothing more we learn from mr preminger that women wore hats back then to disguise the fact that they were beaten up pretty often.
It causes you to loose interest, because you don't care what happens to her.
However, here she seems to have been cast on the grounds that she is Gene Tierney, as opposed to because she fits the role.
Korvo is not implicated because he was undergoing gall bladder surgery at the time of the murder, and eventually Dr Sutton and police Lieutenant Colton (Charles Bickford) work together to determine who was responsible for the murder.
Alas, because of some "childhood neurosis" she is a kleptomaniac and is afraid to tell her husband about it.
He coaxes all her symptoms out of her -- the headaches, the thievery, the insomnia -- which she's been afraid to reveal because it might damage her husband's reputation and, presumably, his income.
Ferrer is off the suspect list because he's been in the hospital recovering from gall bladder surgery.
I don't think I want to get into the plot more than that because medical discretion forbids it.
In this case, it's worse because the Americans and the Germans are both dubbed and have no accents what-so-ever.
It may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire is supposed to be challenging, and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media, just because it's a delicate matter.
Everyone says this movie is bad because of the plot.
I had to see this film twice because the audience was so disruptive the first time.
As for the film's visuals, I will say nothing about them because they speak for themselves when you see them.
Some kids were had to stop watching the movie and turn around because they were afraid!
Also, younger kids may have trouble to focus their interest on the movie because there is a lot of dialogue.
It is pointless complaining about the dinosaurs talking, because the totally marvelous animation makes up for it, the animation is so great that you will not mind the fact that the dinosaurs and animals have voices!
But this movie, in my opinion, has more points because of the animation then the story itself.
this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.
It's just a pity I'm not nine years old because I've certainly heard all this before many, many times over.
I say almost because despite the shortcomings Dinosaur is a good movie; it's at times thrilling, exhilarating, touching and surprisingly intense, for a movie with a such a routine story.
The only reason I give this movie a 9 and not a 10 is because Bogies hand position is distracting.
The film works chiefly because its characters are so well defined, and this pays dividends later in the film when their insecurities and motives begin to surface.
It doesn't last because Alan Squier is a wanderer with no money, and hitches a ride with a wealthy couple, Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm (Genevieve Tobin & Paul Harvey).
But that's because it isn't an action picture, it's a literate exploration of the end of the frontier.
It seems as if the musical cues that lead up to these big moments (like when Paul first attacks Ron) lead up to nothing because the tension is lost when important events happen.
Could the reality of the film be that he is a spiritual envoy taking her soul somewhere because she in actuality died?
This is just a thought because otherwise how the heck did she get out of that situation alive.
Hate it, though, because Jeffrey Donovan definitely should get better uses of his skills than this wreck.
Over the years, comedians have tried to guy the show, but come away looking rather foolish because they made the mistake of sending up what they think the show is.
Another point is the continuity where the Doctor gets his hand sliced off but is able to grow a new one because several hours after a regeneration a time lord can do this which sounds like cheating and I don't believe for a moment RTD envisaged the severed hand as a plot point for season three of the show .
I wouldn't spend the two hours of viewing time to sit through this again because it seem's to have been directed by someone with the emotions of granite.
Pity because it's so pretty and romantic in a visual sense.
), but I think it shouldn't have been part of this movie, because the situation of the woman, her husband (if he lives), her child and her lover is far too serious to just pop up for a moment now and then as a side story.
However, some people will be fooled and mistake it for poetry... for those I recommend the insightful audio commentary on the film fest DVD that reveals absolutely no useful information - not to let room for interpretations - just because the directer himself doesn't have the slightest idea why he did certain things.
I'm pretty sure that "deep inside" this german equivalent to Mark Borchardt (I clearly prefer "Coven" to "Dolphins" by the way) is aware that he is actually an untalented filmmaker...even (and much more because) he thinks he has created something wonderful and unique.
Don't blame the British just because the film is slow and boring!
We are given a situation here shows us a young woman, the daughter of a somewhat eccentric and vulgar princess, who is the center of attraction among the vacationing Muscovites because of her beauty.
Zinaida, being loved by young Vladimir, is separated from her young lover because his mother sees the danger in a relationship that is clearly below the young man's situation in life.
(***) The director should be banned from making films until he learns the rule; show don't tell - or at the very least do not show *and* tell, because that just insults your audience.
The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie succeeds as a great piece of cinema because its lead character is one of the most realistically drawn characters in film history- he's a thug and a killer, yet one who is explicable.
'Chinese Bookie' makes its impact because of mood, character, Ben Gazarra's performance, and an attention scene to scene where people are in the lowest common denominator (a strip club, a gangster's office or car, on the run).
He should be just another shady character among the lot of them, but as he gets in deeper with the gangsters, and subverts his conscience (probably another strong theme here, as well as demeaning oneself because of people putting one down), the audience can suddenly have some sympathy for a man who should have none.
This is a shame, because it's one of the most daring and original films I've ever seen.
The acting helps this out a lot, but film buffs will be unsurprised because of the great character actors involved.
It's a set-up from the get go because the mob never believed he could pull it off, and was hoping that he would be killed, and then they would inherit his club.
Nevertheless after he returns to his club, they lure him away, and attempt to kill him regardless, at which point the hard ass muscle man decides to opt out, saying he wont do it because Cosmo is his friend, and hes the only one who listens to him, which is another ridiculous spiral to be led down, since the 2 have absolutely no meaningful conversation prior.
Watching Cassavetes makes you a little nervous, because you know that if the lead actor is off, everything's going to be horrible.
In fact the reason I am writing this at all is because I wondered what he had done since (I saw this years ago) and found to my shock and dismay no one has given him a project.
The majority of mainstream cinema is structured to deliver an escapist experience to the movie-going public because that is likely the primary reason why most people go to the movies; to see, hear and experience escapist fantasy.
What I love about many korean movies and this one shows it especially... the female lead character is played by a beautiful woman (one of the most pretty actresses in the world I would say) which is a nice change because besides Ashley Judd and Angelina Jolie American actresses are either pretty old or just plain ugly compared to 50ies to 70ies Hollywood era.
Not because of the gore scenes but because of the riddles it offers to the audience.
Watch this film with the intention of being surprised because you will be and you won't regret it.
I'm certainly going to go back and watch it again, probably several times -- because I'm going to have to live with this movie for a while before I can say I've come to terms with it.
Just because he could have two good chances to let the killer gets away.
All very messy for Cho, and increasingly so, because he appears to be attracted to the sweet Chae Su-Yeon, a complication he can do without, you would think.
For Tell Me Something, the problem is how to understand the mystery because, as I said, the killer's motivation(s) is the key.
The names do not stick out because they are all almost the same.
You see Eastern film is so uncompromising because they do not have to deal with a disturbingly PC Hollywood community.
I don't want to give away ANY of the plot, because the less you know the better.
I have no idea why none of the Hollywood studios have yet given this film a theatrical release, but like the equally brilliant Japanese horror film RING, I'm guessing it's because they are first planning an American remake...so before that dark day comes, experience for yourself the film that I consider the Best Movie of 1999 (besting even The Matrix), and one of the Top 5 Horror/Thrillers of the decade!
In a way, it even tops both American movies, even though it's not really comparable to them, because the story goes in another direction as the movie proceeds.
Someone who directs these pieces must believe that eye-popping is part of acting, because Miss Marple and the main characters do a lot of it in in this "Ordeal."
This is the third series of Miss Marple and if you have watched the previous seasons of Miss Marple, you have probably realized they're not that faithful, I don't mind that at all, because they ( and this one is no exception ) are great entertainment.
The only other episode of Miss Marple that I have seen so far is Towards Zero, and I personally preferred this one, because every moment was so enjoyable.
But I suppose those that oppose this new series also didn't appreciate "Kiss Me Kate" as it wasn't the original Shakespeare, or the miniseries "Pride and Prejudice" because new aspects to old stories had been added.
Again, the "mystery" does not engage the watcher because the characters are not developed enough to show any remotely interesting drama.
Again, the title is misleading from the start because this is not Agatha Christie's mystery as she wrote it and it's unrecognizable to the book.
If you watched "Bertram's Hotel," you'll know this is a truism, because they actually pushed Miss Marple aside to let the young maid do the detection and summation of the crime.
Political preferences or social concepts are introduced because, I GUESS, they can.
Not necessarily taken off the air because i don't know its ratings.
Whether readers today are "sharper" or not, with these new Marples it's not a matter of reading "between the lines," because in all too many cases the lines have been totally rewritten!
I tried so hard to like this series because Miss Marple had always interested me.
Hey....that's not a problem because the plot does not exist.
I get emotional when I watch the dance because it is so beautiful.
I am so glad they decided to put One Last Dance on the market because I have been trying to purchase it for quite a long time.The dancers in the film are very good, too.
I won't rave about how good it is because you'll discover that yourself one you see the DVD.
My ONLY gripe is some of the language-I'd like to show this movie to some young people who are just starting to dance, because of the focus on FEELING the dance.
If that sounds like a TV movie it is probably because it should be only I think even the Lifetime movies of the week are above this.
This must've been after numerous bottles of vodka, because I don't see how you ever can earnestly even give attention to this product.
Don't get me wrong I watched this show a lot, I hated it with a passion but I watched it a lot because it was like watching a car wreck I couldn't believe this show was being broadcast night after night, and the interviews weren't much better you could practically see in their eyes that every guest was thinking about standing up and walking out and shouting "what the flying hell is wrong with you!!"
The Comedy Network needs to fire everyone who is responsible for these shows if they haven't already because the average person could make a better and funnier show in their basement taping it with their cell phone and I am not kidding.
His main fault is that he lets style overtake story, but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting.
The rest of the case should swim alongside it, because they don't even deserve a seat in the boat.
Anyways, this show is a complete waste of time, I don't like people who compare this show to the daily show, because that would be a huge insult to the Daily show and Jon Stewart, even though its obvious the stupid correspondents on pop cultured are trying to emulate the correspondents on the Daily Show, but they promptly fall flat on their face every time they try.
I'm Boycotting this show in protest of the comedy network assuming Canadians are dumb enough to enjoy this piece of crap, and because the Canadian government has given this show close to 1 million dollars in funding of the Canadian tax payers dollars, Screw Pop Cultured and Screw the Comedy Network.
And Karen, although she is not in the book, is a good addition, because she adds a layer to Michael that makes him more adorable because he resists her and holds out for Jessie, his true love!
I felt like Jesse because sure enough put on a little makeup and some cool clothes and he was following me around.
If you were a young woman in the 1970's even more so but it holds up beautifully as well because it rings so TRUE.
It's because of what it was about and when we saw it, I'm guessing!
Maia Danziger as the relentless flirt with Michael gives a wiggy, stoned-out performance that just makes you laugh Â because we also all knew girls that acted like that.
In summary, (guys) don't view this as a chick flick just because it involves a love story.
During those moments when the world is spinning around, I have to laugh because they look like those old "newspapers spinning towards the camera" shots showing a series of headlines, e.g.
Now "Snoopy Come Home" is not as good as the first movie, but it is memorable not because it completes the feeling of the Peanuts world as the first movie did, but because it's arguably the most saddening.
The Lucy vs. Snoopy boxing scene has deservedly gone on to become a cult classic iconic scene because not only is it well animated, but it's really funny.
But in the end, my few gripes aside, I very much enjoyed "Snoopy Come Home" and I've found it a lot more fun than a lot of modern day movies, animated or otherwise if, ironically enough, because it made me feel very sad.
I never saw "Snoopy Come Home" at the theatre,probably because I felt that I was getting too old for the Peanuts gang.
Im guessing that the later movies are probably even weaker, because the later specials would suffer, especially following Guaraldis death.
Charlie Brown states that Snoopy is lazy and "everything (Snoopy) has is because of (Charlie)".
Snoopy tries to cool off at the beach and at the Library with Chuck and Sally, but gets booted out because he's a dog.
He gets into a blanket war with Linus, breaks a date on the beach with Peppermint Patty because of the "No Dogs allowed" signs and boxes with Lucy to cool off.
I actually had to stop my tape once when that scene came up because I was crying so much.
This melancholy entry in the Peanuts quadrilogy stands out among the four, simply because of the difference in tone from the other entries.
"Snoopy, Come Home" is the most memorable because of its unusual depth, as well as the bittersweet themes that it touches on: friendship; loyalty; and partings of the way.
Then Snoopy is thrown out of the beach because of the NO DOGS ALLOWED sign.
Turns out to be a freak and beats Snoopy because of the tea SHE spills out on his dress.
This is the last sad part in the movie thank God, because when I'm watching it I cant manage to watch the whole movie with dry eyes.
I would recommend this movie to everyone because its beautiful, but warn children with weaker soul( I just cant find the right expression), because it can leave serious marks in a child's life.
The journey of America's favorite Beagle and Woodstock to visit Lila at the hospital is admirable, as well as everything they go through because of all those "No dogs allowed" signs (including one that forbids both dogs and birds, which is discrimination against animals).
I say this because it is sequenced a bit differently to the original film version that I saw on television many years ago.
The only favorite character I like to play as is Dieter Stark, because you get a gun and shooting dinosaurs is fun!
The behavioral features of the characters made this really fun, because by standing still for a bit (as a dinosaur) your character would look around and move its' body in amusing dinosaur fashions.
One of the advantages of a novel (this is based on one by Graham Greene) is that it can go in many different directions successfully and work very well because the written word allows for a much fuller depiction of what's happening.
He and Ms. Fenn should make more movies together because their chemistry is right.
The status quo is important to him because he realizes that the inevitable change he is denying will not be to his advantage.
It is not a spoiler to tell you that the title character dies, because the film begins with his death and tells what leads up to it in flashback.
Fowler collaborates in the American's murder because he is a rival in love and not because he is evil.
The Quiet American has a lot to live up to, because it is adapted from possibly the best book that Graham Greene ever wrote.
"The Benders" is definitely the most effectively unsettling episode of the first season because, let's face it, there's nothing scarier than flesh and blood human beings.
Dean can go from making fun of Sam's love of the remake of "Godzilla," to begging Kathleen for help because Sam's been his responsibility ever since the fire in Lawrence, to threatening to kill the entire crazy if the touch his brother.
Really there's a lot of people attacking others because they pose a threat to their family in this episode.
Dean threatens the crazy family for Sam, the creepy father threatens Kathleen for his family, and Kathleen kills the father because he murdered her brother.
I had no clue that this episode will be the one about deranged sick family who hunts people for sport, because its title 'The Benders' would suggest that it's about some supernatural beings who can maybe change their look, like shape-shifters or something like that.
However, the acting (besides Woronov.. and possibly Murdoch, the boss - just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck) is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied.
Flanagan is, of course, familiar to any Milligan fan because of playing GURU in GURU THE MAD MONK.
I watched this mini-series because I had seen Paul Gross in Due South and Slings and Arrows.
I thought it was most interesting because I live in Canada and that's probably the only Canadian Politics movie I've ever seen in my life.
A real stinker and why not 1/10, because I've actually seen worse, can you believe it!
On this I'd like to quote my fellow country man and comment leaver Karl Hem "because I've actually seen worse, can you believe it!"
Having 2 kids walk around at the school, trying to escape the mutated cockroaches just wasn't a great idea because you just know that they are not going to get killed off for the obvious reasons.
It was not expected, because the first Emmanuelle simply did not possess this level of quality.
I suspect that the other reason why most folks are rating Mimic 2 much lower than I is because writer Joel Soisson and director Jean de Segonzac couldn't care one whit about making the film "realistic".
Films like Mimic 2 do not tend to have their odd differences because of incompetence.
I am a great fan of this series and I usually root for Dean but today I'm rooting for Sam because something BAAAAD is gonna happen and Sam got all to do with it.
because if you pay attention to the different points raised during the season, we know that GOD, LIFE AFTER DEATH, Sam and their mother, their dad too and obviously HELL and the Yellow eyed demon will be key factors in part 2.
because even though Dean is tough he is no match against a possible 'demoniac Sam'.
The yellow-eyed demon finally found her and corrupted Sam because he was an infant, Jared was older and more self aware.
We all know he was going to be brought back to life because you know, whats supernatural without dean AND Sam?!
This is actually my favorite Supernatural episode of season 2, and it has to be because of the wonderful performances put forward by the actors and actresses, not only Jared and Jensen's, but those of Katherine Isabelle as Ava, Gabriel Tigerman as Andy and Fredric Lehne as Yellow-eyes.
I guess he is stressed because he is pregnant.
I strongly believe this is one of her best performances, and was quite surprised because I have seen a lot of Kajol's movies and I have never thought she'd play a blind girl with so much conviction.
The music is worth it that you can't even comment because it's from the soul.
This is hands down the best romantic film since .....well in a long time , all the people i know who haven't liked this film is because its got impossible situations in it and its slow in the 2nd half all i have to say : stop watching Hindi films then and continue watching 25 sec ads which have diminished your attention span .
More so because she was blind and her mother always encouraged her to look forward to her Prince Charming the day he arrived.
OR they really didn't like horror because they scared easily, this would be a recommendation to see - as there is nothing scary, nothing gory or horrific about it.
I did like this movie because it was different from other movies that I usually see and I understand about the way it was shot.
I would have been her friend because she seemed like a nice person.
I got it from the local library because it was about a young teacher.
Fortunately I watched it on my own first, and decided that she would probably find it very disturbing because of the realities depicted, but frustrating because of the inability of the young teacher to do what was necessary to help herself.
I was turned off, in the beginning, by the shot-on-video character of this film, because by default it seemed to mean a dispensing with classic film language, and a less articulate camera.
And were all of the actors just placed in this movie because they had no lines as johnny depp's or Angelina Joli's stunt doubles?
It's a good thing too, because her husband took that "please secure your own mask before helping others" too an extreme.
I know the movie was terrible, but it could have been 100 times better (and I only say that because anything times zero is still zero)without the Sahara sound-effects.
It would save them money, because there is no way they actually made a profit off of this movie, and they could continue on the theme of cutting and pasting footage from other movies.
People who loved this movie will also love:  ~Open Water II (make sure you watch it on an old TV, because will be throwing things at it) ~Shark attack 3 - Megaladon (contains one of the most amazing pick-up lines ever)  I will give it a 3.
we watched this film because we had nothing to do else, though we knew that this film must be cruel.
Maybe people wanted more nudity from the girls and that would of been cool, because sex never goes out of style.
Lovecraft excruciatingly cultivated sinister and dark atmosphere with climactic punctuations of visual action, almost the opposite of current films that are visually heavy to create the deep and dark unease (something they seldom do because ... perhaps ... they are running a formula in reverse?)
I'll stop here, because my BAC is approaching critical.
2 of 10 - above a 1 only because I like Vanessa Angel, though not one of her better films.
To add to this because I have to write at least ten lines of waffle, her cooking was pretty gruesome too.
Whether you admire Madame Fanny or not, and preposterous and obnoxious as she seems, I rather do, she was a pioneering female, very much of her time, and the world is a more interesting place because she was in it.
she gets robbed by two hitch-hikers, she's put into prison because she ain't got a passport anymore, a policeman rapes her and she kills him after that and escapes with a prisoner...
Watch just the pilot was a shocking experience because: this was the first time in my life couldn't watch more than the first 5 minutes of movie or Tv show.
I shouldn't really because only 4 people came on the two nights it showed.
The point being is that there is a bit of a surprise here, a difference between this and other Ron Howard acting vehicles, because here Ron Howard actually plays slightly against type, not entirely the innocent lad we usually see.
There are few pauses in a Fleming picture, and sound is particularly useful to him, because we can hear the actors to spit their dialogue at each other or punctuate the drama with gunshots and slammed-down whiskeys.
Real western historians in fact are still trying to separate truth from myth about all these people because of these stories.
I'm not such a great fan of Hindi movies mainly because their story lines are so repetitive and speak of love, which is great, but this movie IS a hit for sure.
dixit has come back with great style... one wud expect otherwise because of the years spent abroad and the difference in culture, also influencing a person over time.
she apparently is still Indian, and I'm glad :) i'd give this movie a ten out of ten, because the acting is great and also the dance..
im not going to start on the Movie because i don't want to Spoil you guys but this movie will do good unlike Other Yash Raj Films!
but master ji manages to torture by means of a video he leaves behind where he tells her that Ajanta the theater faces demolition because MP (Akshay Khanna) wants to build a SHAPPIN MAAL there.
11 years later she comes back to the village because her dance instructor is dying and wants her to save the local theater, which is going to be demolished and a mall built in its place.
Well anyways, this movie is awesome because it's not over the top emotional, its very light - hearted and the music and the performances are TOP-NOTCH.
However, Madhuri if possible should return to films but accept small supporting roles as well (such as Rani Mukherjee's character in Saawariya) because there won't be a great shooting load and she has aged and no longer can carry a film judging by Aaja Nachle's failure.
I am not commenting on the story, because I guess its already available, am here trying to just share the treasure.
The first thing my dad did when the credits were done rolling (do stay through the end of the credits because they don't tie up a storyline until then), was to pat me on the back and say thank you for pushing him to come see Aaja Nachle because he hadn't seen such a good film in a long time.
She's surrounded by the stalwarts of Hindi parallel cinema- Raghubir Yadav, Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, etc, and I won't even bother saying anything about Akshaye Khanna because I'm just too damn biased.
It's cute and inspiring and it appealled to me more than Chak De India because of the dance/theatre aspect of it.
As I was leaving the theatre, everyone kept saying how wonderful it was, and that oddly made me feel proud because I think this a truly non-conformist film and if it does well, which it should, it does completely on it's own merit, not because of star-power (Madhuri excluded), gimmicks, or because it's part of some trend.
It was a script she approved because she felt it was most like her life now.
This because in "PINK FLAMINGOS", Divine, is supposedly in hiding from the FBI, for murder.
He steals the show and improbably manages to provide some genuine soul to a contemptible character, perhaps because he looks positively saintly compared to Divine.
It's just so gorgeous and couldn't be duplicated today...just a strange feeling is captured here, amplified because it's populated with so many hedonistic weirdos and perverts.
Of course, these slight perks only exist because Waters and his crew were completely inept in the technical ways of cinema.
I watched this with my family when I was 12, because we lived in a town with one theater that showed one movie, and only on the weekends.
That is because I am a sucker for a good romantic comedy.
People tend to be hard on films like these when writing a review because they think every film must be deep and intellectual.
For instance, one of the boys is a neat freak because of his father, who unknown to him, has real issues.
Okay so it is a story about a young kid trying to set his father up with someone because daddy has been lonely.
I say "some" with weight because Pretty Woman is a classic.
It is a wonderful film about living life and enjoying the days we have because we don't know what tomorrow will bring.
I would encourage every one to see this movie because I learned a lot from this movie.. Life is beautiful guys so live it the fullest!
I ended up getting a bit disoriented because at times they were showing serious stuff but were laughing behind the scenes and at other times, they took their own script too seriously.
They also have the poor girl married off and going to India (Some traditional family from India will ask for her hand) which doesn't make much sense because it seems to defeat the very purpose of uprooting the entire family from India.
It is hard to take them very seriously because you get the feeling that the director and the writer are chuckling behind the cameras even as they are filming these scenes.
Indian star Shahrukh Khan does his best to bring the girl he secretly loves together with her best friend, because he's going to die.
I feel bad because I always say to people even if you have a gut feeling that a movie is going to be bad, just try to have an open mind and enjoy the film.
I notice that Kareena Kapoor was originally offered the role of Naina and I must say that I am glad she asked for too much money because Preity Zinta completely changed my impression of her with this film.
The film was a wonderful comedy/drama about NRIs, which makes it very special, because none of the Indian films about NRIs in the past have done it as convincingly as this one.
Cinematography is terrific, editing is good, sound is superb (mainly because it's live sound), and acting is natural throughout.
The main reason I like this film is because it contains modern elements in it.
It's because the film talks of love , hope and goodwill and the characters and packaging is very much KJ-style .
Naina is heartbroken but now Aman embarks on a noble mission of bringing Naina and Rohit together .. because Rohit loves Naina and Aman wants to make her happy .
And yes the movie leaves a message as Aman says, "live every moment of your life fully , because there may be no tomorrow" .
You've got to cherish whatever you have because who knows...tomorrow may never come.
This character is very real and you can really sympathize with her because of Mrs. Bachchan.
Nikhil Advani must have a real talent for comic scenes because they were terrific.
I hope we get to experience many more of his wonderful stories that are hopefully made with SRK :) because they are the dream team.
It would be easy to describe this as a cross between Brief Encounter and Le Boucher because it displays elements of both, the former inasmuch as it features a young, fairly unremarkable wife and mother who enjoys - if that's the right word - an unconsummated affair with an equally unremarkable medico, the latter because there's a serial killer on the loose and Claire (Isabelle Carre) slowly comes around to suspecting her medical friend.
In this particular one, a nice sweet girl, an insurance company employee, meets a strange vet who is quite mysterious ans fascinating, while a serial killer with a scalpel kills women in the area : we are just like Isabelle CarrÃ© (perfect as usual), because BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is a pure magnet.
She's a bit proper and a bit pushed around, as we come to see as her co-workers unload their work on her because they know she won't say no.
She is married to a somewhat unambitious photographer husband, played by the yummy Jonathan Zaccai (I bought a ticket for this movie because of him, I'll admit it) and has a daughter, aged around 5 or 6, who is afraid of the dark.
Yes, she knows it and she can't bring herself to leave him alone, because she starts to feel- alive, which begs the question, does she like him for him or because he's a serial killer?
You may have Celtic blood, but may be lacking some of their recessive DNA markers and only have Anglo-Saxon DNA markers because you had relatives in what is now England from 800 years ago.
Just because someone has a degree or is on T.V.
Mother's ambition and daughter's resentment become quite clear, and not only because Mona's a pushy "stage" mom.
So the actress has stopped her medicine, in spite of Mona's worries, because she wants to capture the spirit of the role she is playing.
There's some implication that this is in part because she's not taking her medication.
Most of the movie consists of the serial killer movie -- not as it's being filmed, but as it plays in finished form, which is odd because it keeps switching back and forth between the serial killer movie and "reality," when the movie isn't finished yet.
I liked it not because of Elizabeth Hurley.. but Wesley Snipes.
Jacks affair almost had him lose his wife Bethany, Hanna Yellard, because of it putting her, Rebecca, into such a deep depression over the whole mess that she hadn't made a movie since.
Jill tells Glenn that he needs to go to the toilet, he says he doesn't need to but she replies that she can smell him from where she's sitting... she asks Don to go in with him because he wearing a nappy, Don goes in after him, both look awkwardly at each other.
I can understand why some people review this show here and call it "rubbish" because it is not easily watchable.
But, it fails harshly in writing because of clichÃ©s and weak characters.
Trust your instinct and never watch or mention this film because it does not deserve any recognition.
If they happened to put this show on with star gate it probably would have the an audience to support it because thats the sort of show it was.
I gave it 8 out of a possible 10 stars only because they show did not have enough time to develop the characters and plot of the show.
I recommend this show to anyone who likes Drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing, because it doesn't get any better than this series.
But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season.
I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you'll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it.
Tony has mistress problems, and a wife (Edie Falco) who puts up with a lot because she loves him, all the while keeping ties to her Catholic religion.
She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business, yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey.
I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it.
Brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang.
They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio, and Paulie, because they need to get their revenge.
Despite a dry-spell, I still found it (season 4 of "The Sopranos") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately I've been noticing a trend in good new television shows.
Even when you hate a character, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way they do.
Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see.
It is almost unavoidable because it is so true.
Who are the Dr. Callahans who travel to yet another location once their camp is shutdown - perhaps because of reparation or funding cuts?
I went to see this movie because I really enjoy watching Angelina Jolie perform, despite the distraction of her oversized lips.
I'm so glad someone's helping," and then deep down, you'll be ashamed to realize that you think that just because you elected to see a movie about Relief Workers rather than The Texas Chainsaw Massacres, you deserve some sort of gold star.
I'm not surprised that it bombed at the box office because most people are, as is said in the movie, "operated on compassion".
I think most people didn't like it because they don't know what it is to be hungry and poor and left alone.
Perhaps that was due to "behind the scene" budget constraints (maybe some transition scenes were cut before they could shoot them) or perhaps some studio executive was pushing the film out to theaters before the cut was ready because the investors were crying out for their ROI.
I thought this movie was great, not because of our favorite "Tomb Raider" hero, but because, the message that this movie sends.
I think it is a fine tribute to relief workers and others around the world who both in the present and in the past have risked their lives (and I am sure many a time their sanity) trying to lend a hand in hopeless, horrible places and situations (where people are starving to death, or are displaced because of war, or are dying of preventative diseases, etc.
I thought that the movie was very real and the fact that there was a love story made it even more real because I'm sure that there are many real aid workers who have experienced the same things.
There's no separating the love story from the relief efforts, because she falls in love with him because of his commitment to those efforts.
We are also introduced and/or reminded of the ugly side of humanity as to why certain countries will never be able to have peace because people are just too selfish fighting out their own agendas to spare any thought for another person.
Even if you do visit these places to see for yourself what really goes on, you have a choice - you can leave whilst these people don't so unless you are in that exact same position, I think nobody should ever try to comment about it because it's something I don't think none of us in developed countries can ever truly understand.
That's because it is -- but then again, so was "Blade Runner," with its replicants' difficulties grappling with a conscience.
What you come to find out is that he is helping the enemy because he has no choice.
You'll see sequels of The Matrix, but you will not see sequels of Dark City, because it is art.
The same people who will not attempt to think about (I don't mean "like," I just mean "think about") the second two movies in "The Matrix" trilogy are going to hate this film, because it is truly a science fiction film and not an action movie or a "sci fi" movie.
The things people are missing are because of the fact that they don't want to pay attention.
No, clearly they can't because, if they could, they wouldn't need the doctor for his work with humans.
John is comfortable with his power at the end of the movie because he has grown comfortable with himself and who he is.
Bumstead and Emma seem distant at first because they are only just introduced to those lives when we first see them.
It is a different from Blade Runner because the plot is more a picture in the puzzle than the puzzle itself.
A great film anyways, i gave it an 8 because it tends to drag in some spots, but the end makes up for all doubts.
Did he just get this job because his dad knew the producer?
A mood of inconvenience, because you become one with the character John Murdoch, mostly thanks to Sewell's acting.
Maybe it's because when I've seen this movie, it's always way past midnight, but I guess it's part of the ultimate experience from it.
Not because you're tired, but because it's dark.
It's alien nonsense stuff about peoples' memories taken from them so that the aliens can learn enough about earth beings to eventually take over their souls because their own race is dying, blah, blah, blah.
Even a therapist that Murdoch has been seeing because of his wife's infidelity is searching for him as well.
Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does.
Despite(and maybe because of) Matrix sky high hype right now, my thoughts drift back to this overlooked classic...but a little on Neo and gang first below...
The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him.
I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak.
Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.
I had to write all this because IMDB no longer accepts four-line reviews.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record,this film is more or less a remake of Die Hard,only the skyscraper is replaced with an airplane, and our ordinary tough guy cop is replaced with the leader of the free world.Knowing this fact,it's still a good film.Harrison Ford makes a very believable president,and Gary Oldman a very convincing baddie.Although you know where the plot is going,something about it compels you to continue watching.The very fact that they are thousands of miles in the air grips me personally because I am not very fond of heights,and I found myself gripping my chair arms very tightly as a result.This is basically a "run of the mill" action flick,but still good nonetheless.
The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady.
There's one scene where Gary Oldman as the terrorist aboard the plane says to the president's daughter: Do you think your father is a better man because he's wearing a tie and a suit and because he uses smart bombs?
**Warning** Possible Spoilers **   I gave this a 1 because IMDb wouldn't let me give it a zero.
The senior Bush pulled up short of deposing Saddam Hussein because keeping him in power was considered in the best interests of the United States.
But, is he flirting because he wants something to happen?
The half loco Brandon has the part necessary to repair the Navy's damaged helo -- a "push-pull rod" -- but he's hoarding his equipment because he wants to trade what they want for what he wants, namely the shapely Shawn Smith.
I love this sort of movie, but in good conscience cannot give a it a score much higher than 3 because it really is a BAD movie.
'Memories in the mist'by Dasgupta artistically and metaphorically inter-wovens the memories and fantasies of a man of his beloved and lost father.Set in the backdrop of North Kolkata,the story paces to and fro between past and present,between reality and imagination,between innocence and lucre!Amongst the numerous metaphors used in the movie,the one which cant be helped mentioning is the reference of the piper which beckons the man to his past,his childhood and his unfulfilled dreams.With this movie,Dasgupta has also endeavored to find the base of our relationships.At the end of the film,the man reveals himself to his father and thus to the audience,and thus forces us to remind of Apu who would,despite hostility as conferred by fate,love and wonder!That is probably the reason some critic has mentioned it as'the closest modern equivalent'to a Ray movie.But whatever international applaud it gets,it may not get along too well with the Bengali audience because of its sheer lack of bangaliyana(Bengali traditions and customs)as compared to a new wave cinema by Ray or Ghatak.
But most don't because they know better.
I popped this in because I had read that it was a good parody of a great film.
I wish they used the part where the boss tells Red "You don't have to tell me everytime you have to take a p**s," because I would have just lost it.
I think another reason I like this so much is because I find Shawshank to be somewhat cliche and extremely manipulative (for creating loveable prisoners and for that sappy closing monologue).
He is denied, and is miserable because of that and because of his crappy cubicle job.
The Glass House is so wonderful and all the bad reviews are just totally bogus because the movie was good.It was fresh, and highly original which is what a good thriller needs and the Glass House was able to take all the elements a good thriller needs and put it into it.I love how it does not just immediately jump into conclusion or the big climax, but sets up a good story and reasons that the characters might suspect something bad going on.To anyone who has not seen this avoid all the bad things you have heard and sit down and watch this movie you might enjoy it, and you hopefully will so don't let other peoples reviews and a bad box office performance already ruin this movie for you.
However, after reading the comments of Hunterdu below, I'd like to offer my own two cents -- not because I think he's wrong per se, but because I think he's unnecessarily nasty and unfair with his comments.
I've received hundreds of e-mails from people who have worked both in Hollywood and in other jobs, all of them able to relate to the oppressive conditions and the abusive bosses who think they can get away with murder simply because they make a lot of money.
That's EXACTLY why I think this concept is so good, because it is so simple: working in a bad office job is like being in prison.
You want to break free, but you can't because you need the money/security.
But most don't because they know better."
That said, we just landed another film because of it (the entire purpose of making it in the first place) and HBO, the biggest cable movie network on the planet, liked it enough to fork over a good chunk of money to buy it, not bad considering they only buy a handful of shorts every year.
When I was a younger woman and gay women were attracted to me I would pump the biblical premise as well because it worked for me.
Interesting because plenty of years later I became a minister and my teacher is a married gay woman.
Not because we were in it but for a very important reason.
This documentary educated me as well, there were so many different sides of the gay community that people just do not get to see because the media usually portrays the GLBT community just in one light from our gay pride parades and you never see the families.
Probably because I stopped paying close attention after ten minutes.
But hold on it was the film's revelation that left me stone-cold because of the ridiculous motive and it goes over-the-top in its daftness.
I am rating this film based on my memory of it through the eyes of a child who enjoyed it and who loved little Volkswagen Beetles, possibly in part because of this film.
I love ANY film that takes place in San Francisco simply because it, like the little car in this movie, has a ton of personality to it.
Simply because it takes place on it, the wacky "suicide attempt" scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of my personal favorites in the picture.
I got a little bored and uninterested with it at times, but The Love Bug managed to pull me back in sometime or another, and I thought overall this was a nice movie, that I'm surprised hasn't been watched by more people than it has, because it seemed like classic material, but I guess not.
On the one hand, you're never sure whether you can always trust Ruby because even she, too, arrogant most of the time, seems like trouble.
In a nutshell, we have a 40-horsepower VW bug that wins auto races because it's "alive," complete with a personality and - get this - a soul!
One criticism I have of the later movies is that I would like to have seen Herbie stay with his original owner Jim Douglas, and follow his adventures with that family rather than see him owned by lots of different people - partly because Jim, Tennessee and Carol are great owners for Herbie, but also because how does the poor little car feel being passed from owner to owner?!
Just don't take it too seriously (because you can't) and let yourself be a kid for a while.
Jim is about to return it when he's caught in a drag race because someone makes fun of the VW.
I had to give this movie a 10 because it has so much going for it.
You won't spoil you evening waiting for some juicy nude shots of Sandy, because that's the only marketing they put into this film.
I bought this dvd for $4 and because it's a movie Sandra would rather forget.
It isn't even as good as "Anaconda" because at least you could laugh at that whereas this (somehow) manages to keep a straight face.
I will say that I did stick with it to the end but only because I didn't have anything better to do and I hoped for some grand unveiling of the villain but alas, it was not to be.
Maybe because there really is not much of a plot at all.
The last 15min are sort of exciting, only because you know it's almost over so you can do something else.
I believe that Sandra Bullock wanted to block Roger Corman at New Concorde (formerly New Horizons) from releasing this title NOT because of the nude scene (which really isn't, just shadows and hints of nudity) but because of the thin plot.
But don't rush to the movie store to rent it because of this.
My anger was raised when the Canadian general Dallaire who saw all this could do nothing because of the political stance of the countries mentioned and how he wanted to do something but his hands were tied.
The story gets complicated because a number of random characters are introduced through the creative editing of the classic film clips.
You want to hate the film because it displays such a level of horror; the hellish reality of the Rwandan genocide is clear in this film.
This doesn't get much attention and I'm not sure why, because it certainly deserves more.
It's ironic that the question should have been raised because before the war, Steinbeck, the author of such modestly leftist works as "To a God Unknown" and "The Grapes of Wrath", was accused of being a Commie.
There are a couple of shots that no other director would have employed because no other director would have thought of them, and they're not necessarily dramatic or suspenseful.
As more survivors resurface, we meet a whole group of them including a nurse, a radio operator, a crewman and a German who is immediately ostracized by the rest simply because he is from the boat that sunk the survivors' ship.
On the boat, they've got more than a few surprises awaiting them, namely because of the men who torpedoed the ship is on board with them.
This film works like a charm because it parodies the noir that it spoofs in a lovable and respectable way.
Supposedly he jettisoned Steinbeck's original treatment because it was too propagandistic.
He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge.
Its really a minor quibble anyway because it doesn't diminish the entertainment value at all.
The camera work is extremely effective because it conveys the hard voyage these survivors undertook after their Trans Atlantic ship was attacked by a German U boat.
But it makes sense because subconsciously almost every decision we make is based on sexuality.
Its funny reading that the studio tried to dub over Hoskins dialogue because they feared American audiences wouldn't understand it.
This I think is where it risks losing its audience, because everything turns out to be so pointless.
In the event yes, because rather than going into hiding (like Michael Corleone in the first Godfather) Shand's feathers get ruffled even more and, the irony apparently lost on him, he kills two IRA agents for real and is tracked down and captured within minutes.
Probably because its best not to think about it too much while watching DMDWP.
I can't really say anymore, because its such a wacky investigation.
It works very well because of how basic the initial concept is.
The audience gasps at the word IRA, because now he has to confront a powerful and well organized rival.
On the next level, this movie is called The Long Good Friday, because it is also a religiously symbolic movie.
It is also very interesting to observe him as his grip upon his gangster empire on brink of creating a partnership across the Atlantic slips through his fingers because of a mistake.
She believed that Ho Nam would pick a person that resembled Smartie over her because she had started like Ho Nam because he resembled her ex-boyfriend that died.
Bo Diddley tries to keep an open mind about it all, for example, saying that Dick Clark couldn't showcase a mixed dance crowd on his "American Bandstand" because the producers wouldn't permit it.
", when everyone knows that Chuck wrote about what his fans were interested in, because Chuck himself was mostly interested in making money.
- This film, to me, is excellent because of its "extreme" ideas and content.
The previous poster had a real disdain for this movie because it was superficial and insulting and not considered 'art'.
It's not even considered a 'no-brainer' because there is actually a lot of wit packed into the screenplay.
"Desperate Housewives" (another guilty pleasure and a national hit) almost didn't make it to the airwaves because Marc Cherry was selling it as a farce and people did not know what that was.
Sad, because Shakespeare did very well with the genre.
I don't see people bashing the "straight community" because married men cheat on their wives left and right.
Truth be told, I wasn't keen on viewing Eating Out 2 when it played at the Portland Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, mostly because - not to put too fine a point on it - I absolutely abhorred the original and thought it was an coarse, overrated, and excruciatingly dull hunk of vitriolic idiocy.
(Hey, just because it turned out to be a good movie doesn't mean they forgot the eye candy...)   I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a funny, sexy movie to spend some time with.
"The Insider" is a masterpiece.I only saw it because Al Pacino was in it;the theme really wasn't very interesting for me(I though that was the usual "political-correct" film against tobacco),but then came the big (big!)
;because it's all;the performances, the dialogues,the locations (with incredible shadows and lights in everyone),the direction,etc.So, if you want to see one of the best films (if not the best )of 1999,see this masterpiece.
Why they decide to destroy the life of Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway.
When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut.
My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: "You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious."
Al Pacino plays great journalist looking for the big story, but gets personal when Russell Crowe loses his job as a researcher for a big tobacco firm, and starts to come loose at the edges because of some damaging information he is aware of.
Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor.
I think this movie was a marvelous tribute because John Wesley was an educated, cultural person.
This is a movie that I was on the fence about seeing, simply because it seemed like just another movie about a whistle blower.
It is so much more than that, and it is a movie worth watching time and again because of its complexity.
His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.
The Insider is the only film I remember having seen where I walked out of the theatre with a headache because of the intensity of the story.
Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers, a major tobacco company.
they think that if we show the violence in a different way we will be more creative ...but they do not respect to mother identity..and they don't want us to watch all the film because we couldn't stand it only one hour.... everyone left the place... No human being can afford to stay meanwhile those guys are having fun with the girls that will make you think if they were your girlfriends or anyone you know.We should not make producers think they are on the way to win with this film.We must think clearly that anywhere anything may happen to anyone but the way to be more conscious is not the way on this movie to watch.People that will be conscious by the help of the film are not much more than ones that will probably make those behaviours unconsciously or consciously on another people so this way is wrong to be object lesson
While watching the movie, i realized that 7 or 8 couples left the cinema because of its irritating violent scenes which reminded me Haneke's "Funny Games" but Barda is really bloody and realistic.
That was because of moral catharsis that the director made his fatal error by finalizing the film like this.
Some of the patches are funny; Martin is constantly correcting people when they get his name wrong (because they're talking to other characters in other films) The two best comic moments involve a unique way to make coffee, and Martin's hopeless, post-rejection assessment of women.
Martin gets drugged and offers to put on his pajama top (over his suit) because it's needed to match the schmo he's doubling in the next vintage clip.
( because these kinds of things happen in world ) Watch "Barda"..Also if you like it you can watch " Gemide " and "Lalelide Bir Azize" too..
You have to be stabilized and strong when you are watching this movie because it contains rapes,cutoffs,beating apparently.
This movie depicts human relations.It shows the inevitable gaps between people and like the movie "Babel" it also shows how important communication is; because most of the things throughout the movie happen because of lack of communication.
"It's only after you lose everything that you are free to do anything" (quote from fight club) Selim and his gang have nothing to lose, so they are free -actually they think they are free to do anything; because what else they can lose?
I was really interested in seeing this movie, because I like film noir and I like Steve Martin.
My favorite character is Daniel because he is really cool.
They should keep making more episodes because it is very kool.
He and Busy Phillips are devastating in their portrayal of two kids who don't stay together some much because they like each other, but because they need each other desperately.
I've read the articles and this show had so much competition including a few times it was canceled because of Superbowls and other such stupid reasons (I'd rather watch this show than the superbowl any day)  IT's sad too because the show had character depth and was good... really good...well thought out , great plot great writing.
Not only that, because I am smack in the middle of Generation X, I am very very rarely the target demographic, making times when I am the target demographic extremely special.
I just "discovered" Freaks and Geeks and I gotta admit that at first it took me some time to get into it because I was kind of expecting a more broad, punchline based comedy but the more episodes I watched, the more I started to really dig this show AND to love the characters and I really mean LOVE!
Paul Feig still is active in comedy and has been overshadowed somewhat unfairly because of the juggernaut that is Judd Apatow's career.
The role she returned to NBC for, Samantha Taggart on "ER", was only worth watching because she made often silly plots truly believable with her brave and intelligent acting style.
NBC used to have the best stuff around and now...I don't make a point of setting an hour aside anymore because one thing in the lineup is that worth the time.
The actors were great, the scripts were great, it got rave reviews from critics, the only reason this show isn't still on is because NBC never gave it a chance.
If NBC was complaining because no one watched it, they should've tried advertising it more and keeping it in the SAME timeslot instead of shuffling it around and weakening the small fanbase.
Seriously - this show is popular because the demographic it's meant to be consumed by have money and want to romanticize a past that never happened.
I loved the Geeks because I identify with them the most.
And the music was always appropriate - because it was a period piece they could avoid network executives telling them to promote the latest band like most teen shows.
I'll make it short because most comments here will already tell you how great this show is in detail much better than I could and in adding a lenghty review I would only repeat much of the other reviews.
If he is wide-eyed, its because he's staring into headlights.
But Nick isn't simply sad because bad things happen to him.
This Charley Chase short has a rather silly plot but because the film was written so well and Chase did a great job pulling it off, the whole things works very well indeed.
All because the writers were angry at the fans' reactions, angry that they didn't love Keller the way they did.
But because they did put it out there for other people to see, they should have taken into account their feelings as well.
I could go on and on, but I will finish here, because I'm getting tired already.
Eric has decided to make a documentary about the village because it has a long history of bizarre occurrences.
There's not too much to put into words about this one, mainly because not a great deal happens.
The story is of Susan, a woman in her late thirties/early forties suffering from cancer who moves with her daughter from Chicago to California because she wants to be close to home and her parents when she dies.
Basically that movie was totally ruined because of those two things.
And then it hits you that the story is not bad either, because its never meant to be that kind of story that tell some events, its a story about life that everyone (more or less) can relate to.
So, mostly because of the acting (and in some part also the fun to see well-known actors in the beginning of their careers)   8/10
The plot is not always easy to discern, and it's doubly difficult because of the constant "interruptions" with the classic film scene inserted in the story.
antonio baderas is high in my list of today's most promising directors and this film shows the perspectives he has as a director.. any way you should go see this movie and don't let its rating stop you from watching it because it almost did it to me and now i realise how i would have regretted had i not rented this movie instead of an other
Nowadays, I simply believe that if I don't get the point of the movie is just because the director didn't explain it correctly.
I rented this movie not expecting much, and that is a good thing because this film is a real stinker.
It Is a lot of fun to watch, it has a a lot of funny moments, a few sad moments a few scary moments and even some dramatic moments but the main point of the film is to entertain, people are really hard on this film because they expected a masterpiece but if you just want to have a fun time enjoying a movie then this one should do!
anyway, Bones was a good horror movie because it did the job of a series of movies in one installment.
Maybe I'm slightly partial to this film because it features Katharine Isabelle from one of my favorite horror films "Ginger Snaps".
The reason I like other cheap films so much is because they are just that - cheap.
Unfortunately, not many people will appreciate it because the satire can only be understood by a gay audience and gay men typically have little or no sense of humor.
Then maybe he could just think about what he threw away, instead of suddenly thinking he was a jerk because screw arounds are in for the short haul.
The film's premise Â the brunt of the "hard-hitting satire" - is the fact that Christopher's boyfriend is supposed to be the opposite of what we've been "conditioned" to find attractive because (gasp!)
It's a real shame that, because of the religious beliefs of a small minority of people (who could simply elect not to watch), the rest of the TV-watching audience are deprived of excellent programming such as this.
It has been suggested that it has been kept under wraps because of the risk of facing the ire of the Christian Right.
There's a detective or something and a scientist or something..that doesn't really matter if you're just waiting to see a bare body in a following scene because that's all there is here.
Too bad, because the actresses were good looking (especially the brunette) and the idea was solid.
)goofy and rather poorly executed because the costume isn't the least bit scary..more likely, seeing it will give you the giggles.
The scene with an elderly Carradine, attempting to speak his lines(..and obviously reading from cue cards), looks to be on death's door..it's kind of hard to watch knowing that he wouldn't be with us very much longer and seeing him struggle with his lines, barely being able to breathe, kind of brought about sadness because I'm such a fan of his.
The rescuer advises the victim in a none too tactful way that he was essentially a victim because his actions displeased God.
The physician treating Craig assumes that the two men are lovers because of the way they treat one another, i.e., fawning, finishing one another's sentences, etc.
Craig makes one last effort out of many to entice Gary into a romantic relationship that fails miserably because he thinks he has convinced both himself and Gary that the two of them would be great together.
i don't see any itallien people getting upset because they are being steriotyped by the sopranos... i thought that this show was very accurate, but a little to graphic.
Needless to say, he gets it in the end because he's a threat to the family business.
BTW, Marlene is somewhat of a babe, but I wish she'd quit giving Miguel advice because he is obviously the most cerebral and wise of all those competing for domination of the cartel.
Maybe it was too expensive to produce, maybe it didn't get enough support from NBC, or maybe (and I hope this isn't the case), it slipped because it was not a predominantly white cast; most of the characters were Hispanic/Latino.
In all honesty because of its style and approach, the whole movie and its story was far from an interesting one.
Not really a that interesting movie to watch but still perfectly watchable because of how fine it's all made.
perhaps this is because he needn't worry about developing a story or script - that comes naturally given the genre - and so he can focus more on the editing process and capturing the humanity of the characters.
It gets one star, because I am not allowed to give it zero.
It is a good approach to such a movie too, because you start to think it's a nuclear disaster at the beginning, and then you find out it's actually something a bit worse than that, when the crust of the earth moves, the Earth's balance shifts.
But then again, some people have to believe in the future, because there is always a future, no matter how grim things look like.
I put 10/10 for Dragonhead, because of its realism, Apocalypse is not about happiness, it is boring, and everyone just needs to find the will to fight on, against all odds.
If you like something a bit different than big blockbusters, then this movie is so for you, because in Asia they approach everything from an objective point of view, that is what makes their quality.
This movie is hard to score because it excels at one thing while failing miserably at another.
And any other characters you meet are not explored to any extent, and I don't know why not because in parts this movie seems to DRAG-ON for decades!
As far as buying ... weak buy if you're into apocalypse movies (mainly because they only show what's going on in Japan and you don't know what's going on in the rest of the world ... no 'The Core', 'Day After Tomorrow' 'feel' where stuff is going on around the world).
That turns into a moderate buy if you're into Anime and want to show some other anime lovers something different, but they would appreciate (especially because the main girl sounds exactly like one of the whiny characters out of Inuyasha or something).
As I said its not fatal, but it is annoying because the film as a whole deserves better.
And this brings us to whether stars should be appearing in things like this just because the acting parts are so meaty.
I take the view that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins should never have made 'Silence of the Lambs', because by doing so they polluted an already disturbed world.
This was a timely and bold film, also, because it dealt squarely with the oncoming invasion of the heterosexual world by AIDS at a time when most straight folk still believed themselves immune.
An unexpected and truly remarkable treat, this lovely jewel is tons better than most UFO documentaries because it steadfastly avoids the middle of the road and treads down some fascinatingly novel and unfamiliar paths that are an absolute joy to behold.
But at our camp over the summer we were given the choice of watching 'A Distant Thunder' or 'Robots', basically the whole camp watched 'A Distant Thunder' because abortion had been a hot topic of the week.
If you watch this film and are not challenged by its thought provoking message, you need to watch it again because you did not pay attention the first time.
I would also recommend seeing it with a group of people, because it's very interesting to gauge everyone's different reaction right after viewing the film, there's sure to be opinions ranging from emphatic agreement to stern disapproval, but that's what's great about it.
Worth watching, simply because it is SO bad.
What's different about this is that it actually goes further, into a child's realm of disturbing imagery, which can be even more disturbing because thinking of Lynch dealing with children is kind of appalling--The Straight Story aside.
It is speculated that Ms. Goddard lost out partly because of her uncertain official relationship with her lover of recent years, Charlie Chaplin.
He's one of my favourite filmmakers because he gives me both fun AND haunting in the same frame - a feat not many can do.
I enjoyed it because there are few movies in which there is a female lead character who is a tomboy, and I could easily relate to this character, being a tomboy and seeking adventure myself.
It's a great film because it has a female lead character who is a tomboy.
The best thing I can compare it to is having a ruby but discarding it because you only prefer diamonds.
"Cue Ball Cat" has the typical violent gags of these cartoons, however it is different because, for one thing, Tom is playing pool.
Anyway, it isn't surprising when it comes to Tom and Jerry, because they were always like that, right?
The only acting that really seemed poor was that of Paulette Goddard, but this isn't surprising because histrionic and over-the-top performances of leading ladies is a DeMille trademark (see Anne Baxter's performance in The Ten Commandments if you don't believe me).
So because of a decent plot and better than expected acting, this is already a pretty good DeMille film.
If you think about it then it's a real life story and that's the real ending... well not quite actually Al got out of the prison few years later because of a disease and lived happily ever after.
De Palma also makes Ness' work seem more personal, because he has a wife and children for whom to care.
Another is the first meeting between Andy Garcia and Sean Connery, in which the latter decides to recruit Garcia's Italian character in spite of racial feuding (Connery's supposed to be Irish), and instead because he likes his mouthy, bold attitude.
Here is where the historical dishonesty interferes with the entertainment value of the film because DeNiro makes a ruthless gangster seem almost appealing as a warm and fuzzy colorful character.
I understand that they had limits because it was an account of a true story, but they still could have told us certain things and saved some things for later.
I actually perked up when I saw Ennio Morricone's name at the beginning because I loved his work in "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly".
Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph.
`The Untouchables,' directed by Brian De Palma, is the story of Ness and his men, dubbed `Untouchable' because they couldn't be bought, though from the beginning the odds were stacked against them.
These words basically summarize the entire film from my point of view of course because in my opinion (which I don't expect people to agree with) this is the best gangster film there is.
Obviously people aren't going to agree because people prefer the likes of the operatic Godfather trilogy or the ultra realistic Goodfellas but in my head The Untouchables is the best.
This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in.
I watched all the way through to the end, but it was only because I couldn't look away, like seeing a car wreck on the side of the road.
It didn't matter if anything was changed because I didn't care.
-- I don't want to pick on the FX, because I'm sure they weren't finished.
Luckily, Smallville wasn't dropped because of a poor start.
This show reads as if it were written over a weekend because the pay looked good, not as if it was a lovingly developed and nurtured work.
I watch the pilot over and over on iTunes simply because I like to imagine that maybe one day it will take off.
By the end I was furious that there were no more episodes to watch, because it is just that compelling.
Another reason why i would like to see Aquaman on TV is because i don't know how much more they will be able to do with Smallville.
OK, I recently got the pilot off from itunes and all i have to say is if the CW does not pick it up, then they do not deserve to be a network because this show is absolutely amazing.
Mercy Reef is so great because it provides us with a history of Aquaman and starts out by showing his past and talks a lot about his mother and father and how he is connected to Atlantis.
If this show is picked up, or should I say when this show is picked up, it will be an instant success because audiences love superheros and this show brings Aquaman to the level of any other great superhero rather than just being the loser one that talks to fish.
Though undeniably enjoyable, the popular poliziottesco subgenre - which proliferated in Italy throughout the 1970s - is also frustrating because one can never tell the quality of a specific title until one has watched it himself (this is mainly due to the fact that this type of film has been largely dismissed by the critics, while at the same time turned into a cult by fans): the thing is that a handful of titles definitely merit a critical re-appraisal, while many others are overrated by the aficionados.
Moschin (terrific as the anti-hero hood in MILANO CALIBRO 9 [1972]) is a credible villain here, also because the script has atypically made him a victim of tuberculosis.
I bought Radioactive dreams because of Micheal Dudikof.
Basically, Two brothers are locked in a bomb shelter all their lives because a nuclear explosion occurred.
In the interview, Mac talked about how he used to stand in the outfield of his little league games "afraid to go home" because of the beatings that often awaited him at the hands of his grandfather.
This is a remarkable occurrence because I sort of loathe television, particularly sitcoms, and most especially family sitcoms.
The only possible comparison I can make is to the Bill Cosby show, because it leaves me with that same feeling of well-being and makes me laugh.
I like the show because it really gives you a good belly laugh sometimes, its clean comedy and sometimes you can ID with him from things that has happened to the viewers own life experience.
(I only say that because I do think in general that some European countries aim a bit higher demographics and might have some shows that are better that I am unaware of).
And honestly, that surprises me because I really haven't liked much of anything that was new on TV during the 2000s decade.
George Raft, a guy with limited skills was always believable in the urban criminal milieu because of who he hung out with.
This is one of my favorite serials because it has "entertainment value"; one to pop on a vcr to enjoy and relax more than "once a year".
Powell is a shady fellow who snaps out of a nine-year amnesia spell to discover that he has become a shrewd businessman and a pillar of the community during this time except that wife Loy is about to divorce him because he's too dull.
This leads to all sorts of comedic escapades and because he now finds Myrna Loy irresistible, Powell sets about wooing her afresh as his new/old self (hence the title of the film).
It works because of the magical sparkle between Powell and Loy, which chiefly owes its magic to Powell's remarkable and humorous personality and the unique response to it which seems to have emerged spontaneously from Myrna Loy from the moment they met.
Fast-moving, well-directed and acted...but it's all because of Loy and Powell.
George learns that Kay is eager to divorce Larry because of his miserable, suffocatingly materialistic ways; and when meets Kay, whom he has forgotten, he falls for her and sets out to reclaim her love....The film's defining moment surprises us with its tenderness.
Along the way, Kay and Larry battle because she doesn't want any part of the stingy Larry.
The rest of the cast was superb in evoking a love or hate relationship for the viewer because one either will love or hate Saint Teresa of Jesus, and those for or against her strong determination to create the Discalced Carmelite Order that has flourished through-out the world to this day.
i'm willing to give Catherine Deneuve a lot of slack, because she is so beautiful to watch, but the thing that's troubling me here, in part, is that both she and Malkovich are lending their names to a film where they do little else, as also in the otherwise wonderful "I'm Going Home."
Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, and the other actors are trying their best, but inadvertently fall short, because of the poor script; however, the polyglot setting they are involved in is indeed an interesting idea, albeit inadequately exploited.
If the 7-8 ratings gets justified just because it is a script showing "reality" then it must be by people who have never seen any other films about reality, try Iranian cinema to start with, you will not see anything as bad as this and if you're lucky even some really good stuff.
The stilted monologue of the Portuguese woman who explains things to her daughter makes you feel uncomfortable, simply because you know most of the things, and don't really want to know the rest.
It's a shame, because the concept had potential.
* Feels refreshingly unscripted, which is very liberating because it lets the viewer become a part of the unfolding story without being led by the nose thru it.
I knew I recognised the face of Phillip (John Stockwell) and it was because I remembered him playing the role of best friend Dennis in the horror movie Christine, the guy playing Marlowe (Michael Dudikoff) appears to be the worlds greatest bit part actor having been in nothing of any importance.
This is sad, because I feel that Hollywood caters to the lowest common denominator in America (In Paris, for example, I do not think they would market "The Dukes of Hazzard").
We know the dialog hasn't just begun, because Joana's questions are so acute, because she's so clearly her mother's daughter.
Just the mention of a doll, I mean: not that Joana ran back because of anything to do with war.
But i liked it because it's kind of motionless, but has a sense of meaning to it - like you'll kind of know, there's someone intelligent behind it, and it's not necessarily driving an agenda down your throat.
Since we have no idea about what is coming, we remain in a state of shock because of the suddenness in how things happen.
MAN, all this pain because of chemistry class!
On the run from the police the creeper meets a blind piano teacher who isn't afraid of him because she can't see him.
I'd like to think that they sold it because the film wasn't good and the disease story makes them sound more "caring".
It may be because it has never been released on DVD, it could be the terrible music number that grinds the movie to a halt just when the excitement should be building but perhaps it is just too odd.
Perhaps that is because "The Brute Man" seems contrived to exploit the commercial successes of "The Pearl of Death," "City Lights" and "Phantom of the Opera," from which it derives some of its main story elements (including the sentimental scenes with the blind girl and the theme of disfigurement and revenge).
because never seen any movie like this before and i really liked it.
We need people to take chances and stop being scared because Hollywood has their own "way of doing things" The actor who played the cop/security guy, he needs some props and I am going to give it to him.
Speaking for myself, as a young teen-aged girl growing up in New Orleans, I could totally relate to the emotions expressed by the two lead characters, both New Yorkers, because the feelings were universal.
It's great that a channel like IFC or BRAVO has recognized the worth of this film because in my video guide they gave it the worst score possible (a turkey), which is an abomination.
As a kid, I didn't like it probably because he wasn't with Chong getting stoned all the time.
There's no way of knowing how many people have actually been detained and/or deported because the government refused to believe their documentation -- Or they lacked it; Citizens don't have green cards, after all, so an immigration officer who is determined to deport anyone without one will deport a lot of citizens.
I just read an Associated Press article about a man by the name of Jose Ledesma who was jailed for two months, because the feds refused to accept his 100% real birth certificate as legitimate.
I was being extremely annoying that day, wanting to be moved CONSTANTLY, either because of restlessness or because the Polkaroo was constantly escaping my limited field of vision.
This show was great, maybe someone can't appreciate it because they're used to nonstop crap being pummeled at them through their countries shows.
As for this show having no child actors, the toys made perfect surrogates, both because they were portrayed as childlike and because they reinforced the notion of abstraction necessary to allow children to see themselves in the same position.
It achieves this because it forces the audience to CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.
The cast was picked because the actors were SUITED TO THEIR CHARACTERS.
I despise watching an insipid actress who has been chosen because she is pals with the director.
The lead part of Cassandra is played with commitment and I believed 100% in her character because she did.
I read the book in my English class and after we had read and assessed the book we were told that we were in for a treat because we had done such great work.
Hearing the DVD commentary by the director, producer, and screenwriter explained why it was so bad but annoyed me because they didn't seem to know the book as well as anyone adapting a book into a movie should.
She frequently said that adapting a popular book is difficult because fans of the book are so devoted to the text that they are upset because their own favorite episodes are left out.
Billy Nighy also chips in as the father of the family Â a failed writer who suffers from chronic writer's block and is moody and self-indulgent because of it.
I was pleasantly surprised with the film because I thought that it would put people off the book but the casting was very good for all of the characters.
Abuse starts at home, and this entire situation escalated to the point it did because an abused woman finally lost her grip on life, she had no help, no means of support, and the state of Florida was only too pleased to step in and garner media attention during an election year.
This is interesting because of what it implies.
Some of the dialogue sounds like it was translated into the English by foreigners, because nobody would talk that way, but that's what makes Italian movies of any genre so much fun.
Perhaps it's because what was once so obvious about what "might be," to a young person (oh the evils that await us in the near future, yawn), now virtually IS.
Apparently, they did things to anger this billionaire (Who mysteriously wears a mask because he has a shrunken head, which is never explained.
Moving on..the shrunken head billionaire (Who I'll call Southern Shrunk-Head from now on because of his annoying Southern accent) orders some Chinese food (the box of food is tiny too, to match his tiny head) and gets angered at this one security guard because the electricity goes out.
This is particularly hilarious because the dolt just sits there as a puppet pokes at his foot with a freaking toothpick until he falls down, at which point a big fat Blood Doll pushes a dumb-bell off a coffee table, killing him.
Too bad he's evil (he strangles a security guard with some wire), but it doesn't matter because the Uncle Sam Blood Doll throws his toothpick knife in his eye which immediately kills him.
Blood Dolls is more Like Puppet Master.I almost even consider it to be one of the many Sequels to Puppet Master, Mainly because Puppet Master and Blood Dolls are both from Full Moon Pictures.
The clown faced and the small-headed dude were kind of silly characters, now I know why small-headed dude wore a mask, because his head is too small.
Well, I gave this movie 2 out of 10 point, because it really is a crappy one.
As many other cheap movies it entertains a lot, mostly because of the awfully cast.
I'm gonna buy the stupid film on DVD just because I heard there was a music video on it.
Not that the dolls aren't cool but trust me, you'll couldn't possibly care less about them or who they are killing at the moment because all you'll be thinking about is What insane thing Virgil or Mascaro is about to say next.
Likewise Virgil doesn't have any particularly exciting scenes presumably because his small head made these logistically difficult.
The plot innovations are believable because of Maturin's great facial expressions and delivery during his interactions with other characters.
If I ever got the chance I would love to see it again because it was most definitely worth a look.
I was hesitant to watch this movie based solely on the first ten minutes because it was so cheesy, but after a while I eased into it and found that this movie was so bad and so cheesy, it was good.
In the novel, Malcolm Brand(Randall William Cook, who looks like Noseferatu with a scarf around his face, hiding a missing nose)removes his facial features because the one he longs for found him repulsive.
Still, I can't really be too harsh on this one because very simply, I enjoyed it quite a lot.
One scene where the madman corners Virginia in an elevator is particularly laughable because of the botched delivery of the lines.
The cast turned up just to collect a paycheck, which is a shame, because it is a fine collection of actors.
We'd been through "Mod Squad" and similar 'groovy' attempts at television showing us that it was awkward to be a Vietnam vet - because ALL of them were either cops or robbers.
SWAT is crap because the actors make the notion of watching paint dry exciting.
Various Christians say they believe homosexuality is sinful and unnatural because the Bible clarifies it, but the reality in most cases is that they believe it because it is what their churches have taught them, churches and church leaders like Dobson.
I liked this documentary because it didn't take one side.
It made me pretty sad to know that people are mean to gay people just because of some lines written in a book.
This movie shows what happens because of this and covers both sides of this issue in an even handed manner.
I found nothing new scientifically in this film, but that is because i love reading about science and new all the facts that were expressed.
That tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers died or were maimed in WWI from such lucrative insanity, not least because such munitions never yield victory, only battlefront stalemate by temporarily denying enemy troops disputed territory, is lauded ever so abstractly as contribution of the homefront.
Not just due to the struggle of the homosexual person themself, but because of the struggle the entire family went through.
I only give it a 9 because all the families are introduced in a confusing manner and there's a REAL out of place badly animated cartoon halfway through the film.
There not names you know associated with Christianity or Judaism because there not on the air and in your pocket to stay on the air.
And one of them has to dress as a woman, because God knows only couples to to drive-ins).
Whoever directed Drive-In Massacre must not have been a fan of horror films because it doesn't seem like any effort whatsoever was put into it.
That's because it seems as if there is no police force--just these two fat guys that look like brothers.
Buck and John Goff (billed as Jake Barnes because he was probably embarrassed) worked together in Bill Rebane's "The Alpha Incident" which looks like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" compared to this crap.
I couldn't understand half of the dialogs because all the moronic characters were mumbling, and the other half just didn't make any sense.
You don't really care about anyone because no one is really interesting.
While they may like to think that they have made some dramatic choice and went down some dangerous, subversive path, they haven't turned away from mainstream film-making, because mainstream film-making never wanted them to begin with.
They do not see that they have nothing to offer in terms of innovation, because their perspective lacks the stipulation that someone in entertainment, or any kind of story-telling capacity, should have to have anything to offer in the first place.
I think that this movie is mostly meant for people who want to make movies because it really seems to be geared in that direction.
Two thumbs up- both of them mine because, like the others Garetano has portraited, I basically work alone."
Horror Business follows Mark as he gets started writing and filming the movie and it's a great glimpse into the world of independent film, as Mark tells his mother that because she's given him money, she's a defacto executive producer on his film, and the behind the scenes footage of the filming is informative too, when the person who was supposed to run the camera doesn't show up, Mark calls on an extra who's run a camera before to do the filming for the night, explaining that the more experience you have in the film industry the more likely it is that you'll get to work if you find yourself on a movie set, which seems to be true!
And so, until next time when I'll tell you about my documentary, I'm going behind the scenes of a bakery, not because I think it'll be a good movie, just because I like the donuts, remember that the best movies are bad movies.
Some of the film makers shown in this documentary make these movies not just because they love doing it, but because they're stuck.
Which is OK, because the film opens with it.
I am repeatedly dismayed by my fellow Canadians who champion this sort of crap just because it is Canadian.
Just because the universe of fashion reeks of superficiality, doesn't mean a movie spoofing it should be just as if not more superficial than the world it's attacking.
She is a moral imbecile but that too goes unremarked upon because everybody else in her world is one too and the only thing that is noticed about a human personality is material success i.e.
While STARDOM plays less bitterly than DARLING because it is less a poison portrait of a manipulating bitch than social criticism, a presentation of an idiotic society which finds and discards superficial heroes, the more blank the better, as a matter of course.
Jezebel was released in 1938 and also stars a young Henry Fonda who at times had to take leave from production because of the birth of his daughter Jane.
Bette Davis plays the young woman whose name in the movie is actually Julie, but because of her conniving and the hurt that results from it her Aunt Belle, played by Fay Bainter tells her that she is acting like Jezebel from the bible.
Though what we call "a gangster film" in the 1970's bears little resemblance to the classics of the 1930's, it is still a film about big-time criminals and organized crimeÂ Only the baddies have been changed to assist identificationÂ   "Badge 373" is a case in pointÂ It is a simple story, based on the exploits of Eddie Egan, a real New York policeman who also, for good measure, plays a part in the filmÂ  Ryan, a New York detective, is suspended for causing the death of a Puerto Rican dope runnerÂ Taking a job as a bartender, he learns that his old partner on the force has been killedÂ Then, with the law against him because he is no longer a policeman, and harassed also by the villains, he sets out to avenge his friend's murderÂ  The twist is that these villains are no longer liquor and heroin smugglers, big-time gamblers or bank robbersÂ They are Puerto RicansÂ Some of them are men who seek to foment a revolution on their island; others, led by a sinister figure in dark glasses called Sweet William, are the crooked element who will supply the necessary guns and ammunitionÂ Ryan, played by Robert Duvall, wages his own solitary war against both partiesÂ  It's a rough, tough and ruthless film, in which Duvall is as brutal as his adversaries; towards the end, he callously chops down a night watchman in order to gain entrance to the Brooklyn docksÂ In fact, it is very difficult to have sympathy for any of the characters in "Badge 373."
Not to mention sorry for the people who financed it because you pray they can somehow make their money back and yet you know they probably won't.
Maybe it's just because I have a big kung fu movie collection and I'm of Chinese descent...
If you want to see a good KUNG FU comedy like "Kung paw" or "KUNG FU hustle" don't see this movie because is pathetic.
I rent it because Pat Morita and Lorenzo Lamas are in this movie but this actors don't help the movie, because is very bad.
Maurice Patton was very non-original because he was imitating the good actor Chris Tucker.
First off, I recorded this because the title and info given on the cable guide made this movie sound interesting--if not for a few laughs.
I picked this up because the title seemed inane.
I had to replay the scene two to three times just to catch it all because of how hard I was laughing.
In fact, each time I watch this movie I repeat that scene several times, for the fact that laughing so hard I miss things, and because of how hilarious it is in the first place.
I loved this film because it shows life on the other end of the spectrum.
I loved this film because it was a vacation into darkness and creativity, and a vacation from the average film experience.
It's a shame that Terry Zwigoff hasn't done yet another documentary, because he obviously has a knack for the genre.
Everyone seems to come away from the movie with an idea that Robert is spared the obvious insanity of his two brothers because of his art.
Robert Crumb became an idol among hippies in the 1960's because of the psychedelic comics he drew at the time.
I have been a fan of Crumb ever since I advanced beyond Donald Duck and Marvel Comics about 20 years ago (this is not to say that I don't love Donald or Marvel anymore, because I do).
That may be because Shearer retired soon after her husband died; her final film was 1942's forgettable "Her Cardboard Lover."
A very powerful role, the part was even a greater challenge than THE BARRETTS OF WIMPOLE STREET or ROMEO AND JULIET simply because it really showcased all of her range.
Unfortunately, he had no choice because he WAS "the dauphin".
The complaint is an historical one: it was a bit too sympathetic towards Marie, and even Louis, both of whom ended up beheaded because they encourage foreign armies to invade France and put the king back on the throne.
To this horrible accusation, the former queen, "the Widow Capet" or simply "Antoinette Capet" replied with the genuine royal dignity, "If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother..."   I did not like Sophia Coppola's boring horror in pink but I truly enjoyed the older film which was released on DVD for the first time on October 10, 2006.
You get to indulge yourself in every sensory modality known to man or beast -- AND you get the sympathy of the audience too, because they know you're just being flighty out of a desperate loneliness.
Most of the cast overact, but this is understandable because it's common to the period.
I was delighted to see this at the rental store because I absolutely adore Norma Shearer and had yet to see this piece of work.
Full stars because this film truly is an excellent film and should be watched.
Which is why when he finds out that his wife has been murdered and his daughter has been raped, you really feel for him because of his superb acting.
And you're completely on his side when he turns to a life of vigilantism, killing sociopathic muggers, because he is just so believable.
Michael Winner stopped making films some time ago and became a professional rent-a-celeb, boulevardier and occasional restaurant critic, largely because his last few movies stank.
Liberals hate this film because it appeals to a very real desire in many Americans to see the streets "cleaned up."
Most people hold liberal views about criminals and violent crime because they have never had it hit close enough to home to shake them out of their liberal, hypothetical, text-book way of thinking.
As difficult as the rape scene is to watch, it is absolutely crucial to the plot because it tries to put the audience in the place of an innocent victim of violent crime.
They tell the Chief that they don't want the vigilante because of all of the publicity the he has gotten.
The movie "Death Wish" hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how, in the movie at least, one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime.
But it's probably due to the fact that the movie was not written as an action hero vehicle, and because of this the story demanded a character more grounded in reality.
It's a good thing because she's appearing opposite the master of underplaying, Henry Fonda.
I have seen the movie,In the Indian film industry the Tamil movies taking a good path, because of the creators as well as directors.The movie February 14 is simply superb, and the movie takes a beautiful love subject which feels a heart of love and romance.
that is because of the sheer knowledge of the director.. looking forward for the next creation of this great director
Maybe this is so because the director is English and chose a different approach for portraying Japanese life, but this is just a speculation.
I don't want to give too much away because this is a movie where surprise after surprise.
As "Erik Kessler," a man who returns under an assumed identity to the wife who has remarried because she though he was dead, he's heavily made-up and talks with a corny and contrived sounding German accent.
This a very special film because is just great but is not very know and maybe the reason is some films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Raging bull.
Yes, we can't say that after hours is the best of Scorsese because, well Scorsese has a lot of classics, but still After hours is a masterpiece, and a must see for all and not only for Scorsese's fans.
Is a similar case to other of Marty's films: Casino, because Casino is a masterpiece but a lot of people think that is a copy of Goodfellas......is the same.
More about the film: i love it because is a very unique story and because of the great cast.......Scorsese can't be better.
The film's protagonist, Paul (Griffin Dunne), is an unlikable character who generally gains sympathy with us only because of his grueling misfortunes.
Maybe that's why he is so good in this because he looks like such an ordinary guy.
I have a feeling that because this might be one of his least accessible films to current audiences, people just call it his most 'underrated'.
In fact, there's a reason it isn't talked about much, because it is rubbish.
Here Scorsese seems like he's built up his reputation strongly enough so he can just put out any old tosh and audiences will praise it to high heaven just because Scorsese directed it.
It seems to me that Scorsese might have seen Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because both films share the claustrophobic and suffocating atmosphere which was captured amazingly by Ballhaus.
All the rules go out the window for Dunne's character, because after all it is after hours.
She appeals for help with her man, but things go awry when manservant Malcomb tries to thwart the romance because he is in desperate love with Winnie.
Winifred tells Malcomb that she can only like Malcomb as a friend because she loves Eddie and wants to marry him once he's recovered.
This is because there just isn't much money to be made from this film and adding closed captions or digitally restoring the picture just isn't going to happen!
I really think they gave it to her because of the overall movie, not her individual performance.
"Blackenstein" is original and funny because of its ineptness, but after a while it nearly becomes unendurable to sit through.
I ended up giving this film a 4/10 because it had it's moments.
Unexpected, not because of the genre, but because of the era.
Art Carney besides having ulcers problems in the movie as Ira Wells walked with a limp, because of a bum leg, which in real life he really had from being wounded in France, by an exploding German artillery shell in World War Two.
It is a treat and pleasure to watch him in "The Late Show" because it shows a legendary and extroadinarily talented actor in full force.
The only thing this movie succeeds in doing is boosting your self-esteem; not because of the nerdy characters, but because of the miserable effort put forth by the producers.
Supporting girl, even more shallow than main girl who goes after said girl's guy because girls like that just love to be treated like sh*t (DANICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MOVIE???
I could tell it would be a stereotypical teen comedy, and in fact I only watched it because it had Winnie Cooper in it, and I've been in love with her for as long as I can remember.
Anyway, goofy film worth seeing ONLY IF you can see it for free, because of a FEW funny moments, a great soundtrack, and Danica McKeller's cuteness lol.
Considering the sacrifice that the title character makes in this film, it is fitting and proper that Davis got this role because she could have had Scarlett, but she wouldn't make Gone With the Wind if it included Errol Flynn as Rhett Butler.
I netflixed Godzilla 2005 and started to watch the movie with the Commentary on, because there was no Japanese language track.
Also they cut important scenes because they felt the audience wouldn't get it.
They felt as though Godzilla was about to lose his fans, because of this red-blooded American box-office disaster, so to make up for it, they made this movie, GOJIRA NI-SEN MIRENIAMU (Godzilla 2000: Millennium), which was a "take that" to GINO.
As Riverdancer Michael Flatley once said, "It's important to change, because if you stagnate, you die."
However, the main problem is that things were not spelled out for the viewer (mostly because production was rushed in the second half).
What astounded me, right at the beginning of the film, was that the Americans involved in the loop and re-edit of the US release had not the slightest clue that a great deal of the humor of the film develops by spoofing the wretched American "Godzilla" (-in-name-only, or GINO) of 1998; The opening has Godzilla at a light-house, not only as a tribute to the granddaddy of post-WWII dinosaur flicks, "Beast from 20,000 Fanthoms", but because "Beast is the film the American GINO was really remaking.
Let's face it - these buildings very nearly dwarf Godzilla; although technically larger than ever before in the series, he looks smaller because of the urban growth he has to wade through.
Maybe the reason Toho decided to retire the character is because they had to; maybe the era of Godzilla is over and it's time to find new monsters and new heroes.
And that is the point of this movie, to remind every one of us who grew up on monster movies that in the midst of all the ALIEN-stylized cinematic drool, that the giant UFO perched menacingly over Tokyo, shimmering with mysterious electronic pulsations while Godzilla ( with an underwater swimming scene for Godzilla that is priceless) stomps in for a classic samauri-like duel with the alien craft and its occupant, with all the Man In Suit and b-movie special effects you can stand, is the reason why many of us "creature feature" lovers continue going to the movies TODAY, because we're looking for something like GODZILLA 2000.
He was better covered when the prison sentences were handed out (because he planned the crime, and the others performed it).
It is 1850's New Orleans, and Julie Marsten (Davis), a head-strong young woman who doesn't find it the least improper to be late for her own engagement party because she feels like riding her horse instead, is getting married to Preston Dillard (Fonda).
Unfortunately, Preston isn't at the party because he is hammering out business at his family's bank; when they are married, he and Julie will be moving north, an almost sacrilegious action during this time.
Most of her late 30's to 1950 films are so spectacular just because of her performance (if the rest is good, it's gravy), and this is one of her best known performances.
A different but equally sad truth is stated when Elizabeth accuses Erik of being, perhaps, the one who killed John and he concurs because he did kill John rather than returning a lesser, perhaps unmanned, husband.
Animal lovers should beware, although not in the UK since it's cut, because there's a ratting scene where a dog attacks some rats.
I'm uncertain about whether to explain exactly why this exchange is so funny because I don't want to insult anyone who already knows.
Clearly, it didn't matter, because Bette Davis went out and gave one of the best performances of her career and won her second Oscar for best actress.
(A production note of interest: The famous `red' dress was actually black satin, which was used because red didn't produce enough contrast in the black and white film, causing it not to stand out enough.)
Brian Harding is a city guy, who works in a bank and before Xmas holidays he has to go and repossess Julia's home because she was unable to pay the loan back.
It has something that appeals to me, I don't know if its the girls (they all are so hot) or simply because is a very funny film.
But when Bingo himself winds up into trouble not only does it complicate things for him because of the crooks, it also complicates things for Chucky.
The point of this movie is to be a spoof of all the other lame ones, but to be enjoyable because it's not really one of those at all.
I mean, it is (but only because it's spoofing...SPOOF-ING!
I really enjoy this movie because, who can't love a dog with such a human-like character to him?
So watch it because it's a SPOOF, not just "another" one of those movies.
"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is an incredible pile of garbage.The script is not only awful,but extremely predictable with a totally pathetic ending(I won't go into it,but you might kick in your TV set after viewing it).The acting is really pitiful,with dialogue to match.OK,there are some nice splatter scenes(I like especially the sequence in the car when one guy is slowly gutted),but the rest of the film absolutely sucks.To sum up,"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is one of the worst horror movies ever made-bland,boring and mind numbingly stupid and gets 3 only because of some pretty good gore.I really like bad horror movies,but this is an insult.Avoid it at all costs.Not recommended.
The movie was directed by Turi Meyer, but maybe it's supposed to be Russ Meyer; because, there's an abundance of female body parts exposed for no other reason then to ...well...be exposed I guess (reviewer blushes).
The three films contain an escalating quantity of gore, which reaches its zenith in this movie; because, well...zeniths have to be reached.
Then we have a Lt. Detective Kraft, who is hell bent on putting the handcuffs on poor Donna; because, it looks like she's a murderess!
The plot is not any thing special because it is pretty much the same plot as candyman 2 farwell to the flesh but the movie itself completely makes up for it believe me.
If itÂ´s blood that you want then check this one because thereÂ´ll be lots of it.
I was quite disappointed watching this movie because in no way does it live up to the first one.
So maybe you should see it and judge for yourself because our opinions may be very different.
The Candyman played by Tony Todd was really neat because you would never know where he was going to pop up.
There are a lot of street elements thrown in because I suspect the filmmakers know some of these people.
I foolishly watched the film because I studied the book and it was probably the worst mistake I made.
A lot of people will be drawn in by the trailer, but unfortunately the trailer holds all the best parts of a film which misses the integral parts of the novel and because of that suspense is ruined somewhat.
I would call this film commercial art house because it has enough mainstream appeal and intellectual rigour to merit multiple viewings.
I was disappointed in this film, but gave it a 3 because I've seen worse.
I preferred Enduring Love, however, because i think it is more unique and has the right balance to a thriller film, and thought the actors suited the characters well, especially, Daniel Craig.
Though many details have been altered, one can see that the filmmakers have a good feel for the novel because its atmosphere is brilliantly transferred to the screen.
What appears to be an easy going relationship gets complicated because, suddenly, Jed begins to obsess with the accident.
Rhys Ifan's Jed is the more interesting part because one has no clue if he is serious enough, or whether he is mentally insane because of the way he pursues Joe.
The film is dominated by the massive six foot five noir star, Sterling Hayden, as a tough homicide cop who chews toothpicks non-stop because his doctors won't let him smoke, and who says things like: 'You're head's full of mush.'
I tried to see this film before because I remember the very beginning, but I guess I was interrupted.
What a pity though because the idea was good and it had potential.
I was particularly interested to see Albert Bassermann appearing in this film and recognized his voice immediately because of his next and last acting performance which was in the famous 1948 film "The Red Shoes" in which he had a fairly significant role - not bad for an actor nearing 80 years of age!
Unfortunately because she was at Warners, she had to take a back seat to Bette Davis much of the time.
I give this movie 10-10 because it is captivating from start to finish.
The "I hate Errol Flynn" bandwagon may have been emboldened by this film, however, because Errol is flirtatious and is as womanizing as ever.
Full review: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387563/usercomments-enter  Another review:  Some Others Also Perceive the Emperor as Naked by Kevin P. Murphy  The final Star Wars trilogy (Episodes I, II, and III) wasn't a complete waste of time, because it/they stimulated an independent, Indianapolis, Indiana, produced film, "Saving Star Wars," that does, in a low-budget sort of way, recapture the essential magic of the original trilogy.
However, Anthony and Stanton were convinced by Frederick Douglass to work for abolition, because if slavery was abolished (Douglas argued) woman's servitude would have to follow soon after.
But the bulk of the woman's movement avoided this, because they did not want their political agenda tainted by a rival one.
This film should be seen more often because of the charismatic Ms. Grable and her costar Dick Haymes.
Some elements of the original comics plot were altered for the movie version, which I don't actually mind, because Dan Clowes was one of the screenwriters and was at charge (at least to some extent) in bringing his own comic to the big screen.
Definitely it is a VERY GOOD movie because it makes you think a lot.
Having watched it for myself, I was duly impressed though I wouldnât quite place it in the genreâs top ranksâ¦but thatâs because the standards set by the invigorating noir style during its heyday were so high.
The only thing that was lacking was the ending, i found it too symbolic, because it was saying that enids life had not yet begun and her getting on the bus was the start of her life- meh.
This is because the ugly, but unique dork of the movie gets to find true love!
They aren't shown as heroines who are greater than everyone else because of how different they are and how they don't let themselves controlled by society.
But maybe the reason why I didn't like it as much as a lot of people did was because it mainly brought negative feelings to me.
She quite modestly allows Birch to take the spotlight because she knows its Enid's life story that's captured our interest.
Johansson's performance is more subtle than Birch's, but she is necessary, because she provides an effective counterpoint to Enid's role without having to do very much at all.
I think that Thora Birch is the only one who could play Enid because nobody else would be that convincing.
Plato called art and philosophy the highest occupations precisely because they are profoundly useless.
The girls feel a connection because these kids represent some form of truth.
What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for, they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is, because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times, leaves the other types left out, where do they go?
They must dig and dig under all this modern pop culture to find the real hip stuff, the real cool stuff that our mothers and fathers listened to and watched when they were kids, and Ghost World is satisfying because its so up to date with the minority and yet references so many musicians, artists and films and its striking out to those MTV kids and others, the MTV kids who don't know who Pink Floyd is, or the ones who've never heard of the film Midnight Express or 8Â½ which is even mentioned in this film.
As time goes on Enid spends more and more of her spare time with Seymour, and ends up losing her school certificate because she didn't turn up to the art show and everything for her falls apart.
Enid says to him at some stage "ever since my life fell apart you're the only one I can rely on because I know you'll always be here" or something along those lines, where as, this somewhat explains that Enid's entire world is changing, except this one lonesome man at the bus stop but once he says he is leaving this means her entire life is changing.
I will not go on and on about the ending, because other reviewers have overly voiced their 10 line opinions about how it's so good that it's gone past bad and back to good again or really "sucky and artsy".
In any event this is never brought up because of the belief that holmes is an elder statesman.
So please give all of us a break with this age nonsense.The overall production was well mounted and since the original stories have been done so well by Jeremy Brett, a new pastiche always fun because it is new.
Yes, the serial killer suddenly turns out to have a twin brother because remember, "When you have eliminated the impossibly whatever remains, no matter how lazy, crass, talentless and brainless it proves the screenwriter to be, must be the truth."
Rupert Everett's Holmes comes off as a bit dissipated because of boredom.
It's mostly because of the actor Rupert Everett who is very good in this roll.
It's not the best that it can be, but it's good, because you cannot understand who is the murder till' the end.
This movie is good because of the actors and script.
I won't tell you not to see this because if you're ever on a game show with a topic of Serial Killer Southern Women, you might be one up on your competition... but surely don't go out of your way to see this one.
If you're a Montgomery fan who hasn't seen this yet, then put it on the top of the list, because it's a brilliantly moving film, and her performance is well done.
The kind of guy who doesn't need doors because he can walk through walls, he doesn't act tough Â he IS tough.
To anyone who does feel this way I would say that these reminders must never stop until there is peace throughout the world, Firstly because there are still many, many atrocities still occurring in this world which must be addressed, and those responsible must be brought to book and the free world must jointly do everything in their power to put an end to these regimes.
What really hurts is that The Grey Zone didn't get its deserved attention, because it poignantly proved what some movie stars are capable of, given the right material: David Arquette, an actor known for light comedies, is strikingly magnetic as the most fragile, mentally weakened sonderkommando, and his scenes are nothing short than harrowing and visceral.
The acting is heavy because the emotion of the place is heavy.
You should pick a right night for this evening though, because everything, from the gassing to cleaning to burning, is shown uncensored in this movie.
But they must have known that they were going to be murdered eventually, if only because they had become the most dangerous witnesses to the cold Nazi horror.
I have to mention the giant needle sticking through the wall of the tailor shop, because it's the point of focus many times, and one just waits for someone to be skewered on it, but that never happens.
One thing I would say is that if I were a sixteen year old girl or so, this would be my favourite film for a good while because of the 'girl-on-girl action'.
There are plenty of interesting works out there, which are simply not being allowed into the cinema for people to see because there is deemed to be 'no audience'.
With this film, it attempted to steer from the stereotypical way of thinking and not focusing so much on the trials and hardship of lesbian romance within a Brit/Asian family, because by so doing, it will not be different or stand out for better or worse from other scenes.
For those who say the film is not well shot, i thought it was beautifully shot, the first kiss was magical, not because of the kiss, but because of the location.
Some people have defended this film because of the film's star Matt Salinger, giving a serious performance.
Salinger, which means nothing because...   MATT SALINGER CAN'T ACT!
It's too bad Andre De Toth didn't contribute more to the noir cycle, because on the evidence he was a natural (plus he was married to early-noir icon Veronica Lake).
If you don't remember the movie, it's for good reason, because it is an entirely forgettable film.
It's too bad too, because this one could've been okay.
Cap fights the Skull and fails to defeat him in the 1940's, only to be frozen in ice and thawed out in the nineties, where he learns that, because he failed to defeat the Skull, his arch villian is responsible for the deaths of many historic figures.
He is preserved there until the 1990's, when he get resurrected and he realizes Red Skull is still alive and healthy, because the serum has allowed him to last this long.
Have you ever watched a movie and felt uncomfortable watching it because it was so awful?
The reason why Marvel can't get a decent box-office hit is because they don't have a big motion picture corporation backing them like DC does (DC is owned by Warner Brothers).
Well, at least it isn't as bad as Steel, because they at least tried to get Captain America's costume right.
You do not sympathize with Cap because the actor is so stiff he is in no way believable.
The Red Skull is only the Red Skull for about five minutes, then because I guess they could not afford to keep making him up so they make him look stupid for the rest of the film.
In case you did not understand what I was getting at, they kidnapped the leader of the world's most powerful nation because of an environmental bill, not protesting or boycotting or writing their Congressman or circulating a petition but kidnapping a prominent world leader.
It takes a while before we understand what the hell this has to do with anything - no, it's not a scene from "The Godfather" which was accidentally spliced into the film during production - because we quickly cut to:  SEVEN YEARS LATER   (as an afterthought) 1943  World War II is running full throttle and dazed-looking Steve is mugging his way through a tearful farewell to his family and girlfriend, Bernie (and here I was thinking this was a guy's name!).
There's no time for celebration, however, because an evil nazi bastard shows up and starts peppering everyone with a prop.
), but can't because... I.P.S.M.
When war breaks out, he decides to enlist but is turned down because he is more valuable as an engineer.
He chose to represent the south because even then he knew his was a dying art form, one that was eclipsed almost instantaneously.
His girl Annabelle (Marion Mack) won't speak to him because of it.
And if you noticed the looks on the faces of the Union officers when the camera cut to them, those were for real, because they were not told what was going to happen to that train!
While Louis (Levino Jensen) is a volcano, and Leo (Kim Bodnia) is a Volcano to be - because of his feeling of entrapment by his girlfriends pregancy - they fight there inner feelings, they are hunted by them and suffer, they dismiss life itself for momentary outburts of violence.
I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and that makes this review VERY difficult, because I really can't decide which of these two films is better.
Granted, I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts, because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature, especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary, but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments.
I wouldn't dare cut those moments out of this film, even if I could re-edit it, because the space always had something going on, but at the same time, this film, if made today, would be cut to one-and-a-half, or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly.
Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War (they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer).
The General is challenging because it doesn't flaunt its virtues; like Keaton's concise and economical performance, it holds a great deal in reserve.
But for those who can see the expressiveness of Buster's so-called "stone face," who get his peculiar dry humor, who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed, these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated.
In a throwaway gag, Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack.
and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.
Its a shame he was only in a handful of movies because he could have been a big star.
This means that the movie, if looked at as a whole, seems to bounce around a bit because it is made up of several story arcs that begin and end in under 30 minutes before jumping into the next one.
( I look back at that and should have jumped ) Now a photographer saw me and said that I could not stay there because I had no passes...
Wow it is the most amazing thing ever... everyone should go out and buy it, even if they don't like anyone who was in it because it all raises money for the Band Aid Charitable Trust anyway.
People have complained about the complete concert not being there, that's only because most of it was locked away in the BBC's stores for years and years, some of the tapes were destroyed.
Also there were things like 'Rat Trap' by the Boomtown Rats was discarded because Bob Geldof ripped the microphone off the lead!
I did hear via a friend of mine Rab Kincaid that his sister Vicki got a ticket and would be going to London on the 13th of July , I did feel some self sorrow because the previous Summer my sister acting as courier wanted to know if I wanted to go out with Vicki but I turned her down .
Then it happened, the satellite feed broke just as they started My Generation, I sometimes wonder if it was because the rest of the World were using to much power at that time that the system couldn't handle it all at once.
According to the insert, Mtv dismantled their footage from Philadelphia because Geldof wanted to avoid future legal problems.
I only give it a 2, because of Lana's presence in it.
There's almost no need to watch this pseudo-Biblical film because there's nothing worthwhile about it.
I only watched it because "pusher" was entertaining.
This Classic movie is one of the best ever made.Not only does it have excitement but it also is very entertaining.I like the movie because it is similar to Bonnie and Clyde.I have several DVD's In my collection and hope one day to add this DVD also.Bobbie Jo and the outlaws is one of my favorite classics.As all movies in this era this movie was well directed and casted with some of the best actors and actresses of this s time period.Bobbie Jo and the out laws has a great plot and is a fast action movie.I recommend that any one who loves classic movies to watch this movie if you ever get a chance.You will enjoy this movie if you like gangster movies.Thank you for your time and please do watch this movie,I think you will enjoy it,I know I enjoy watching it.Thank you.
Before she realizes it she, her friend, and her sister and the sister's boyfriend are all in over their heads because the men are obsessed with the wild west fantasy and see themselves as gunslingers.
The progression of the character was a thing of desire, because it wasn't a traditional love story or good verses evil it was a well thought out script that had twisted and turns and ups and downs but it made you want to watch more and more.
For those who have not yet had the pleasure, I can only hope that Robert will release this film to DVD or make it available for download on iTunes because in my opinion, it truly is a MUST SEE work of art.
So I was very pleasantly surprised to find that "Body/Antibody" was NOTHING like that, and, in fact was so engaging and well-done that the only time I consulted my watch, I was actually disappointed because I realized that the movie was almost over.
Mainly because they stole his new car.
That's because there is no substance or importance to the close encounter - the outer-space portion of the film rambles on pointlessly (just like the aliens) and in the end it was hard not to be as disappointed as the three young heroes.
A shame really because I think it's one of Dante's best films.
I've always found Joe Dante to be a refreshing alternative to Spielberg because of his sly, irreverent style of storytelling.
Explorers was an unfinished film, because the studio moved up the deadline, so it's not too surprising the ending feels a bit chaotic.
They didn't visit Earth because they're afraid humans are really like that, and believe we will annihilate ourselves unless we change our ways.
This totally proves that the Yanks have very little taste (proved yet again by the success of Spider-Man) with this getting very poor reviews and virtually no box-office (I cant believe the amount of people who have said a film must be good because its made a load of money - two words - Pearl Harbor!
This movie is magical for me, because it reminds me of a time in my life when I used to believe in dreams, imagination and friendship.
I think this is mainly because the movie ended right after that part.
Hawke is disheartened by their incoherence, but realizes that they're so confusing because human life makes no sense to them (e.g.
Maybe it's because "Explorers" only sports three main characters, and "The Goonies" has seven (plus Sloth) ... but I'd hold this movie up with that one any day.
One of the citizens speaks of the feeling of oppression from living helplessly without electricity because the electric bill is more than a months pay.
)because it's funner and more ingenious.In Toolbox murders(2004),the tired formula of the masked killer has a thanked twist which explains the motives of the killer and the nature of its surroundings.Angela Bettis showed she's a brilliant actress on a masterpiece called May.She does a good work in Toolbox murders(2004),but her talent is beyond her role on this movie.This film has some fails(the edition is a little weak and the script feels forced on some occasions)but it kept me very fun and it never bored me.
If there is any content at all in this thing, apparently deserving the label film because there is movement on screen, it is garbage.
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't mean that this is a peak, because there are no peaks, no pace.
You have to be prepared for it, because you will be bored and at best bewildered if you're not watching it for the purpose of entertaining yourself by the ridiculously crappy lines (or lack of them), direction, photography, cinematography, edition, idea.
When Lennon was killed, J&P were on semi-decent terms -- they hadn't talked for a while, but not because of any big feud.
In interviews just before his death, Lennon said he "couldn't even talk about" things like the band's breakup "because it is still in court."
There are only a handful of movies I have evr walked out on because they were so dull they were unwatchable.
This was because she kicked Eddie in the groin.
Robert Duvall cheated on his wife and she took him back because she watched him riding a horse.
This was only interesting because I worked for someone named Frank Lewis at the time I watched it.
The only reason it gets a three in my book is because I saw it on a date with the love of my life.
The very idea that someone could actually forgive someone for cheating simply because she sees him riding a horse is simply crazy at best, if it were that easy I'd have bought a horse eons ago!
However, the reason the tag lines and previews are misleading, is because the movie is more focused on the horse ranch, rather than on her personal situation.
As for Julia Roberts, I prefer her in this kind of film rather than heavy drama, because I don't care for her very external acting.
The movie couldn't seem to decide between being a drama and a comedy, but is nevertheless more than worth watching because of the character played by Kyra Sedgwick.
It appeals particularly because it has so many elements I love in a movie -- dancing, powerful women, horses, sexy men riding said horses, humor, fighting, making up.
This is a heart-breaking movie to watch because it is so much like real life and it is played out so well by those involved.
The Direction by Hallstrom is magnificent because of the way he lets the story do the talking and doesn't hurry us to conclusions.
This is one of those movies that is one of a kind, but not one you'd want to watch very often for it hits deep within our souls(especially those who have gone thru similar experiences) and therefore I think it failed when released because the exec's didn't know how to sell it to make money but none-the-less it is a classic in my book on relationships.
The choice of the title also didn't make sense because the song really has nothing to do with the movie.
We feel bad for HIM when he makes it sound like she drove him into another woman's arms because she didn't give him enough affection.
Movies like Maria, Full Of Grace, are much more effective because they include an aspect of objectivism and force even the most staunch believer to examine the opposing viewpoint.
Patricia Riggen's "Under The Same Moon" feels like a fairy tale because it eschews reality in favor of neat drama.
The reason behind this is because the mother was trying to get papers for her son to come to America.
The whole purpose for the kid to get across the border in a week was because every Sunday, he would call his mother on a pay phone, tell her how much she loved her, miss her, and cry over her.
He has been left home with his grandma because his mother, Rosario, has gone to Los Angeles to work.
She is reluctant to let the little boy try to go North because of the dangers ahead.
Unfortunately, they are detained because they show as being delinquent in the payment of traffic fines.
At this point, the film turns into a 'road picture' because along the way, Carlitos will encounter all kinds of people.
He clings to another Mexican that started being unfriendly, but in the end he offers a sacrifice to the boy that was completely unexpected because of he sees in the boy the person he would like to be.
Adrian Alonso, who is older than the boy in the picture wins the audience's heart because of his precociousness and determination to find his mother in a strange land.
The film will please the viewer because in spite of its implausible plot, it has its heart in the right place and sends a positive message about the bond between a boy and his mother.
That's good, because it means the movie is entertaining.
The dialogue just feels so real, sincere because this story is just like the story of many people around the world.
When I went to see it I cried, many people cried I was surprised to see that even children cried because they got so emotional with this film.
This simplistic view of two "mental illnesses" gets dressed up with 1) obsessed chick arranging to meet (and sleep with, equally of course) wheelchair bound guy via the plot device of anonymously informing him of a human interest story (he is an NPR-radio-station-type reporter) 2) utterly stupid 'human interest story' (an urban legend style boffo about a bunch of people who "wannabe" paralyzed for no particular reason whatsoever) 3) "magic fred astaire shoes" (of course, again, the shoes are nothing more than a mental "crutch" the guy is subconsciously using to give himself a reason to walk... that enable wheelchair guy to walk...after falling down a lot, only very slowly, with crutches or a cane...sort of like you'd expect someone who has been working out to retard muscular atrophy but who hasn't stood or walked for years to behave when finally standing and walking... 3) a few couldabeengreat lines that came off as too silly to be taken half-seriously because of the trying-to-be-an-allegory but frankly rather silly plot.
So if that's the single most mind blowing and fascinating concept you've ever heard of, then you probably still shouldn't bother watching this because it's not like they explain it.
Carlos Brooks makes an impressive debut as both writer and director of this little independent film QUID PRO QUO, a story that may make some viewers uncomfortable because of the subject matter, but an intelligent investigation of a subculture unknown to most and a script that leads to a surprising ending - if the viewer keeps thinking after the rolling credits are over!
The film is what it is not only because of a masterful script, but because of two actors who basically eat the screen with fine performances -- Nick Stahl and Vera Farmiga.
I saw this film on the closing night of Sundance, mostly because all the other films I wanted to see were sold out.
The only negative aspect to the film is the frank treatment of the subculture that frames the principal characters, not because the treatment is unfair or poorly executed, but because it's likely to take the average viewer by surprise.
OK so Susan Walker, who basically was tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years just because her boyfriend was dealing drugs.
At the beginning you see the woman Susan trying to find a solicitor who was supposed to be better than the ones the courts appoint but her fees were too high so she declined because she can't find the money without remortgaging her house she learns she can't as its been seized-supposedly paid for by her partner's drug business which she had nothing to do with.
You see her pleading with him and finally ordering him out because of the drugs business.After which she is suddenly arrested and learns the partner has been as well but as he plea bargains for a lesser sentence she can't do that -she knows nothing.
Mercedes Ruehl is excellent as Susan Walker, a single mother who is sentenced to 20 years in federal prison simply because her live-in boyfriend and his cronies were peddling marijuana on a large scale.
The beautiful thing about Martin is that he can be absurd in almost any role he plays and still be likable and funny because of that very absurdity.
In classic fashion this movie presents situations that are so humorous because of their ridiculous nature.
I gave My Blue Heaven movie ten stars because it is a classic farce that uses quick physical comedy and tight dialogue to generate a good feeling for you.
Rick Moranis' role is a bit smaller (too small) but not any less entertaining because of that.
Moranis and Martin form a pretty good and funny comical duo, mainly because the two characters are very different from each other.
The plot you see here was expanded quite a bit because on stage the whole thing takes place in the USA where the Randolph Scott character inherits a fashion designing business.
For example, the phony minister, the jump-starting cars in the army, 25 copies of one book just in case he wants to read it more than once, he put a stolen fish in his trunk while the weather was cold because there wasn't enough room in his freezer on account of another guy he knew gave him a side of beef, etc.
The fed assigned him Barney Coopersmith(Rick Moranis,mensch)seems to be woefully unable to keep a leash on his charge,but it's alright because while Vinnie may not sit still in protective custody,he's got a big heart for those around him keeping him out of prison.
All in all, its not great but its worth watching with your kids because they will love it and you will be entertained.
Hannah is unable to prosecute Vinnie because he is a Federal Witness.
The reason this movie is so much fun is because you know another laugh is just around the corner.
I get angry when younger people talk about the funniest movies of all-time and mention Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell movies because they have never seen an Allen picture.
Well, I'll stop my review here because I DON'T want to spoil the picture.
PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM tells the story of Allan Felix, a film critic whose wife Nancy (Susan Anspach) has left him because she, plain and simple, needs excitement.
This came as a great surprise because I didn't pay enough attention at the movies for which Woody only wrote the screenplay and for years I had no idea that he made something like this, and with Diane Keaton as a partner!
This movie is in my opinion an overlooked gem, probably because many people are thrown off by the fact that Woody didn't direct it.
It is more in line with The Purple Rose of Cairo portraying a passive character with enough soul to give to others but unable to make good with people because of inhibitions.
One of the earliest works of Woody Allen I have seen, well, probably it's because of my age.
Woody is absolutely lovable, I almost choked when watching this movie while I was eating because of uncontrolled laughters, especially the scenes of his first date after the divorce.
Sam and Dean are nevertheless investigating the case, because the state of the victims' bodies indicate that the little critters weren't behaving normally when they attacked.
After a third casualty died from spider bites, the brothers Â together with a bug-obsessed teenager Â discover that the insects are revolting against humanity because of an ancient Indian curse.
He really appreciates little things, because he has such a spartan life-style.
to him, because he spends most of his life in the Impala or in cheap hotels.
Sam is bitter because he wanted to play soccer rather than go bow-hunting.
In this episode, Sam shows a great identification with Matt, because of his troubled relationship with his father.
In My opinion it would have been a good if there wasn't so damn much filth in it because the music was ok and the acting by William J. Kulzer was decent.
As did many of the Astaire/Rogers films, 'Roberta' proved successful with audiences because it consciously defied the woeful economic conditions in which the United States still found itself.
Caper movies are among my favorites (maybe, it's because I work in a bank) but this is a very mild addition to that exciting thriller subgenre Â chiefly because of an unconvincing plot also involving child kidnapping, a counter robbery from a church to mislead the Israeli police, the gang donning a series of silly disguises and, ultimately, a burglary which remains unfulfilled (again, a fashionable twist in the cynical 1970s but rather ludicrous in this context!
He's real arrogant, but he's a player.Especially because of what he says.
If you are thinking about watching this, I suggest you get it now because it's worth every penny.
Perhaps that is because the entire cast does a job I find enjoyable.
I don't see what everyone sees in Yakkity Yak because it is the worst Nick show I have ever seen and it's an insult to Happy tree Friends.
I've never heard about this cartoon before because Nickelodeon shows it at hours I don't watch TV (i.e.
The sad part is that I fell in love with this show AFTER it got canceled because I was too stupid to actually give this show a chance...
They cancelled it, which is a real shame because this show still had tons of potential left in it.
is that because i'm bored after all that hours watching the first and the second season?
To be honest, I find it funnier than The Simpsons at times, because it really plays on how society isn't much improved 1,000 years later.
For example the first known astronauts are the honeymooners because of the line "bang zoom straight to the moon" and the first people on the moon were the "Whalers on the moon."
He is a web of contradictions mainly because he hasn't focused himself in life and wants to go places, but doesn't have the drive.
It has been said about this that whether you love or hate sci-fi, you'll enjoy it, because you'll either get a kick out of the absolutely countless nods to, and parodies of, classics in the field, or laugh at all the jokes made at the genre's expense.
Futurama is probably my favourite Western animation, I first watched it because it was "from the creator of The Simpsons" and found myself preferring it.
Fry just feels so real, he is not given a crazy persona just because he is a cartoon character.
But I like (or used to like) The Simpsons more and arguably the reason it went downhill after the end of the 90's was because FOX moved the good writers to Futurama, and therefore killing The Simpsons in the process.
At that age, I had digested a lot of bad movies and television (like the Small Wonder sitcom... any sitcom... and movies like Plan 9 and Howard The Duck) but watching this movie was the first time that I had ever pressed the fast-forward button on my VCR because what I was watching was so bad and I wanted it to end.
It started near the beginning, when I pressed the fast-forward button because Andy was going to the video store on his bike and they just showed gratuitous shots of his determined face and peddling feet for SO LONG that I began to doubt that there was an end to it.
This film is an oddity because it's both a crime movie AND musical!
Perhaps it is because of the Depression Era but whatever it is, the movies were made with certain something that made them special.
It seems farfetched because many people were still struggling after the depression.
This type of comedy is usually more my cup of tea, but as good as "Lady" is, "Wife vs. Secretary" is better - mainly because "Lady" doesn't let Harlow bust loose until the end of the movie.
The film clocks in at 117 minutes, but it might as well be four hours long, because that's what it feels like.
The same MP who blames the photos claims that he lost it because a female MP had been hit in the face with a brick during a prison riot.
But of course no one has to because of the effect of "command pressure."
Unless your teenager because you are terribly self-centered and can't really help it, thanks hormones!)
But the result is disappointingly narrow and obsessive, because Morris has allowed the low-ranking Americans implicated by the pictures, the majority of them concerned only with their own fates and future, to be the dominant voices of the film.
The exceptions are a crude but more experienced interrogator, a precise but morally numb military investigator, and the angry general Janis Karpinski who was scapegoated because she was commander of the MPs.
Perhaps because Morris' mostly unheard questions were aggressive, his talking heads are always on the defensive, repeating that they were only "softening up" the prisoners as instructed.
Except, it seems, General Karpinski, because she was traveling from one prison to another, and says the ugliness was hidden from her.
It's all prefaced by a description of what a disgusting place Abu Ghraib was when the MPs and other American staff came to live there--with constant bombardment, because, in violation of international law (but we are not told that) Abu Ghraib was not behind the lines.
"Roberta" was out of circulation for many years because of an inferior MGM remake "Lovely to Look At" (1952) - the studio did not want competition between the two films.
Her lovely designer Stephanie (Irene Dunne) is having trouble with Tanka (Ginger Rogers) and because she works in a cabaret, John thinks Tanka could get Huck and his band a job.
This time he's aided by Minor Mustain nicknamed "The Cowboy" This one is easily the weakest of the series, only because there isn't enough of the crazy ridiculousness of parts # 1 and 2.
Here's a much more realistic vote: 1 (only because that's as low as it goes here at the IMDB).
I will admit that the film is a bit of a mish-mash, and hard to keep track of because it changes gears so quickly.
The character of the psychopathic Gideon Hayes played by Kevin King was thoroughly unconvincing because he looked like a 12-year old more suited to "Lord of the Flies".
Sometimes movies are so bad you sit there with that B-movie smirk - smiling because the flick stinks so much that it actually (and unintentionally) is funny.
I suspect people don't like this movie because it's not easy.
And yet these films were magic because they did not even try to look real, realistic.
That's too bad because his WAY over the top acting harms the film.
I admire the fashionable production and the team so much because they knew what they were doing to the audience too: presenting a sublime musical confection that is exquisite enough to make the viewer pass out from aching satisfaction.
I'm not sure if I can explain the low rating of this film overall on IMDb, because I thought it was a remarkable action/suspense film, full of excellent actors and unforgettable moments.
Touchingly, Sir Humphrey bids another servant to watch over Chadwick after he leaves because he's worried about the other man's mental health!
Laughton is always tough to assess because he likes to play around so much and have so much fun inhabiting the role that it sometimes damages his performance, and he was a guy with a world of talent.... so much so that it seems like he gets bored with it and does other things, sometimes things that work and sometimes things that don't.
Leslie Banks' work in the film was probably the most impressive in my opinion because he also had the broadest character to work with, and managed to make this character work as a human being.
But he did this one for Daphne Du Maurier because he wanted to film Du Maurier's Rebecca later on.
"The Third Man" is a masterpiece because it states, or rather understates, some most perceptive things about the human condition.
And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an "Hawaiian sound" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither.
To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super.
If anything, there is a strong anti-romantic sentiment here, not only because Anna has been irrevocably separated from Lime but she also will not be the one whom Cotten's Martins gets at the end.
I recommend this movie because its feature length, It has two really strong pokemon in it, one secret pokemon that has something to do with snorlax, and its a lot of fun to watch.
I liked the movie a lot because the two leads- Douglas and Paltrow look and are great.
Gwyneth Paltrow as Emily Bradford Taylor is also a great character, because although she is having an affair with another man, she's prepared to come clean with her husband before he tries to have her murdered.
But, I wouldn't think of it as a "remake" because I was stuck trying to compare the two movies together, and it made this movie look really bad.
He claimed he took the key, put it on Emily's key chain and jammed the door lock because he thought the thug was David getting in with Emily's key and he tried to protect Emily's reputation.
Why was Steven so easily dismissed as a suspect -- just because he was "on the phone" during the attack?
I have to admit, I was mostly interested in this film because of Audrey Tautou.
Compared with many war films that covered America's involvement with Vietnam, "Go Tell the Spartans' didn't set the world alight due to its very understated style and low-scale resources, but because of centering towards a steady character/situation driven story, it remained an thoughtfully harrowing and toughly grim account showing that there were no heroes, or anything to gain from this war.
Maybe for the better because Lancaster strikes just the right note as the professional soldier in what was a backwater assignment who politics has passed over for promotion.
He epitomizes the brutality of the struggle for us in a way that we can't appreciate from the other side because we never meet any of the Viet Cong by name.
He is closest to a real character because the general in charge their before Johnson raised the troop levels and put in William Westmoreland was Paul Harkins.
And this is appropriate because this is definitely a film about the film industry as an extension of The Conspiracy, stealing the slack away from the passionate, creative people who just want to make an honest film.
As for the plot, I'll put my money that many people would be disappointed if London After Midnight was found because they didn't grasp the plot.
The loss of London After Midnight is all the more tragic because it is the crucial representation of how badly the studios took care of their films in the early days of motion pictures.
The story and its plot really don't work out because of the way of storytelling.
I can forgive all this because the film is somehow charming and memorable.
Over the top John Woo action flick that works with Travolta as a devious villain, but fails miserably because of the obvious miscasting of Slater as an action star.
This is one of a long line of "idiot" movies; so called because they only appeal to morons.
If you haven't seen either of them then pay attention because "Broken Arrow" is a shocking effort from arguably Hong Kong's finest director John Woo.
Or you can watch another action film altogether because the chances are, it'll be better than this.
That's because Woo needs space in which to BLOW THINGS UP.
However, she finds a man, Lawrence Hamilton, (George Brent) who loves her very much because she works for his father's firm and he asks her to marry him after many years.
BROKEN ARROW may be required to take a deep long breath, because when it starts, it's a ripping action-packed joy ride complete with guns, explosions, action heroes, great baddies, helicopters, jeeps, chases and all under the great helm of Hong Kong action god John Woo, here having a filed day with special effects, stunts and style.
But I remember seeing the previews on TV, but not being able to see it in theaters because I was too young, so when it came out on video, I would ride my bike down to the video store to rent it countless times a month.
Mathis's role as the female element was believable(she didn't come off as a dit and one could see her has a park ranger because her proportions weren't medically exaggerated).
It is at least not as superficial as many other movies I've seen, and that's not because the dialog is in German or because it is mostly shot with a hand-held camera.
I don't think this could be a commercial hit, simply because it takes a certain level of education and understanding of philosophy to get many of the jokes.
The morality is fantastic - the cops just allow them to get away with murder and drug dealing because its "the Yakuza way"!!
OK - I bought the DVD because it was only 3.99 in the January sales and because it starred Riki Takeuchi.
In a way, this hare-brained Polnareff's double is his evil genius because he indirectly jeopardizes FrÃ©dÃ©ric's couple to make him resume his one-time favorite activities.
I watched only because Barbara Steele was in it; by the conclusion I was hungering for more.
In fact, I've heard that this film was partially funded by the State of New Mexico, and that they were very upset to see the final product because they considered it to be a porno.
Meanwhile, a police officer in town seems to have a lead as to the killer's identity, but he is discouraged from pursuing it because it would be scandalous to damage the reputation of a guy who manages a cafÃ©, or something.
Yes, it's one of those "little guy vs. big business tyrant" films, but it's also very different, because in this case, it's about a special-effects/animation geek, a character which, if it has ever been portrayed in film, would still be nothing close to this because the man playing the part is a real special-effects designer, animator and editor.
Danielle obviously saw this role as an edgy action thriller which was correct because the nudity was not pornographic.
I generally try to avoid the cheap new releases at the local discount store, because there's so many bad "horror movies" puked out these days that it's pathetic.
Nearly every review of a movie contains a so called spoiler, because otherwise it will be very hard to write about a movie beside the fact you have seen a movie.
Whoever said that didn't watch the film closely, because they are incorrect!
As the reviewer on IMDb says it confounds your expectations by allowing things and people to survive and for events to unfold differently then you thought... (Read The IMDb comments after you see the film since they give too much away) Basically this is about an old guy who was going to give his fortune away to friends and relatives because his grand daughter can't be found.
He's so funny because he plays the part absolutely straight and the humor falls around him.
Strangely, without computers and cell phones, the story of journalists working on a story holds up because the emotions and activities are realistic and still go on.
Rumors are that Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell actually asked Mike Jittlov to visit them to preview a little film they'd thrown together called "Evil Dead" because they wanted someone who they respected to give the thumbs up to their movie before it debuted!
Perhaps because of his color, his character is sometimes in the background but by the end he does become essential.
How sad because Paul Robeson was undoubtedly one of the major figures in U. S. entertainment history and if one wants to know why, one just has to watch the movie Proud Valley, directed by Pen Tennyson.
It's better done than the first one, because the first one had to be sown together a la Frankenstein when the lead actor really did die.
It's also better because it recycles footage from the first two.
The original Crow movie had me in tears at the end because the love story was so touching; The Salvation had me shrugging my shoulders wondering why I even bothered to buy the movie.
It was hard to understand this film because of so many characters, I had to rewind in a few parts to understand.
Well keep on remembering, because you'll get NONE of that in this, the third installment of sequels that should've stopped before they began.
Not even worth a watch because of Kirsten Dunst.
City of Angels....it really isn't fair for me to make comments about at this stage because, quiet honestly, it was so bad that I took nothing away from the theater.
I cannot remember much about it other than "Sarrah is grown up and moved to L.A." I only remember this because I didn't care for "Sarrah" in the first movie.
This movie was really terrible.I would only give it 2/10 but that's because The Crow 2 was even worse.The Crow's make-up job made him look like an extra in a Marilyn Manson music video.How anybody could find him intimidating is beyond me.
The first time was because Mabius' friend distracted her before losing his own life, and the second time was because her gun only had one bullet in it.
They try to deal with the matters which have no effects on the audience, because they don't belong to us!
Her younger sister Guler, on the other hand, likes Recep, but the feeling is not mutual in that case.Towards the end of the movie we see the watermelon vendor selling all of his product by telling a one-liner: If you build up your ship out of watermelon you will sink down fast.Recept cannot be together with Nihal either because they turns out to have moved before he opens his feelings.
A heartbreaking love story throws in a towel, very innocent but impossible because of the boundaries people set for their selves especially in Turkey.
It makes you think how bright minds go in vein because of the lack of support or lack of facility.
Especially Turkish people should see it as soon as possible, that is because this movie is referred to the Turkish audience firstly.
I too would like to view this film to see if it "holds up" over time or would be as laughable as "Action in the North Atlantic" which is only shown now because it has Bogart.
I'm not saying this because I'm Australian.
I watched if after 'Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason' because I reckoned I needed something serious after that fairy-tale, but I was not prepared to see what it was coming.
Perhaps this not only due to the story but also because how the story is told.
It is because of the plot that I chose the summary line "it grows on you" and I think that is a good thing.
One should remember that they were largely 12 or 13 year-olds, selected at that age because they could be easily manipulated and indoctrinated, or they did what they did because they feared for their own lives.
Men joined the Khmer Rouge because their villages were being repeatedly bombed.
The most recent Star Wars films are so poorly written they make me cringe, and this is George Lucas's only good script to date, possibly because it wasn't entirely written by him.
The only reason I didn't rank it higher was because of the lack of emotion from the little boy.
Although they are probably just a little exaggerated, we probably laugh at most of the material in this film because we know how funny it could be if it happened in real life.
Yes, but it would not be a success because it would remind people of realities best left unmentioned.
I rented it recently, mainly because of the nostalgic value it has for me, but remembered why I enjoyed it so much.
Steve decides to break up with Laurie because he's going off to college.
This period is coming to a close, for the characters because they're moving on and because of the events that would happen in the 60s.
However, as I have previously stated, the film is not merely a period piece because the themes involved are timeless.
Every student must watch this film before going to University because it highlights those qualities of youth so well and so elegantly that one cannot help feel tinges of remorse and sentiment at the sight of the plane soaring into the sky carrying the boy to University and away from his childhood.
Time is a speeding train.We must embrace the good times of our life,particularly those of our youth,while we have them,because they are gone before we know it.This is the lesson I get while watching American Graffiti.This is not just a classic film with featuring a heavyweight Hollywood line up in their youth,it is one of the ultimate lessons of life.Times change,people change,and those changes take place with a lightning fast speed that we never seem to see coming.We owe George Lucas and everyone involved in the making of this film a great deal of gratitude for teaching us this.Also,who doesn't fall in love with Suzanne Somers while watching this.We see her only for a moment,but that's all it takes.WOW!
I give the movie 4 of 10 only because the music score is very haunting and helps to keep the viewer focused.
John Milner (Paul LeMat) is the hotshot of the state who doesn't want to leave town because he is afraid that everything will change.
All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties, not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be, but also, because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...(Even Big John Milner)...
The film works because it's such a good time, and the way that Lucas shows us that ensures that we have just as good a time as the characters on screen are having.
Television has been reduced to the lowest common denominator and people swallow it because they have gotten used to it.
This view is plausible not because of the concept of reincarnation, rather for his inability to remember that he was dishonest to his wife and betrayed her.
I liked it much more than "The Edukators", because it's more honest in a sense that it doesn't camouflage it's intent, and also because it's much more satirical.
I also really loved it, because it's so different from the standard European art-house flicks.
In my opinion this show is a lot better than 'The Wire' because it has heart in almost every character and you are desperate to see life improve for them.
Initially I started watching because of Dana Delany (China Beach, Last Exit To Eden), who is not just easy on the eyes, but whose past performances put her on my "watch her stuff" list.
Don't give up on this movie just because the first five minutes are a little dull.
It ended the way it should have because who runs away with a ten year old boy and tells him you'll wait until he's 21 to get married.
It is more than a movie to me.I could really relate to Joshua as i also used to think a lot about God at that age partly because i was born in a very religious family.The feelings Joshua goes through in his search for god and how it changes him to a certain extent for eg, when Freddie Waltman-a boy who has bullied Joshua since 3rd grade has to leave school...instead of feeling happy he feels really sad for him... have been narrated on screen beyond words...only a genius could have achieved this.
- Thankfully this film (because it is more than a movie, it is a film) doesnÂ´t fall in the trap of easy joking and unnecessary plots.
i saw it because i saw a trailer for it before another movie i had rented.
I think if I had written a review for it back then I would have given the movie a 1 mostly because of the horrific ending that makes no sense what so ever.
It's really nice to watch as her world comes tumbling down but yet she doesn't realize it because she's so in love and believes that the boy is her dead husband.
throughout the movie she looks tired and bored and we rarely get to see her smile which is appropriate for her character because her world does get turned upside down.
Buying the Cow is one of those movies that you never knew existed and upon discovering wished that you could altogether forget, but can't because it is such a wonderful example of what people should not do with studio money.
We don't know who the man is, why he collapsed, or what happened to him because the movie then cuts away to the birth of a child.
The clue raises the suspicion that the boy located the box and its contents revealed information relating to the previous marriage but on the other hand, if that was what happened it doesn't make sense, because if the boy was busy digging up the box, the woman would have been long gone by the time he finished, and he couldn't have followed her.
Viewers may have difficulty recognizing Kidman at first because she has a hair style completely different than that which makes her such a vivacious actress.
Maybe this movie was too controversial because of all the jokes with underaged kids?
Jerry O'Connell is very funny here as the main lead, he has lots of charisma, is very likable, offered plenty of laughs, had a cool character, and really seemed to be enjoying himself, it's too bad we don't see him as often anymore, because I really dig this guy!
I only bought it because of Ryan Reynolds, but I must say that I will be recommending it to all of my friends and to everyone here.
I feel sorry for everyone involved in this production -- because some distributor someone dropped the ball.
Birth is a good Mystery film, because it really keeps you interested in the story.
This is complicated because the village houses a traitor.
We are not spared the horrors of war, I think particularly of the scene when the telephone operator having summoned the courage to kill her German captor is killed trying to contact someone for help, you don't see anything but because of that it is all the more powerful.
Perhaps it's because I wasn't immersed into the mythos of the chainsaw wielding psychopath and his family of cannibals.
There is nothing too brainy about the storyline, given that it's a prequel trying to explain how things came about, and because it's something that chronologically had happened before, there's no prize in guessing who survives, or not, which makes the finale a bit of a bore.
It will be quite sad if this film tanks because it's much better than the remake.
One performance that stands out, simply because in my opinion, he's one helluva actor, is R. Lee Ermey.
So if you go to this movie and you don't like it because of the violence and blood and stuff what do you expect from a movie with chainsaw and massacre in the title?
Andrew Byrinasli or however you spell it, is cool now because he is the first person ever to play Leatherface twice now, go Andrew.
I have sat through some awful tripe because I feel that, like people, everybody has a good side.
The little town down in Texas is now a ghostville USA because of the plant closing and the only inhabitants left are the deranged Hewitt clan (sounds just like Michigan under Governor Granholm-LOL).
Side note: I do hope this is the last of the TCM films because I feel there is nothing left of interest to do with this franchise that we haven't already seen.
It took a little getting used to because although it was a lot like the first one it was very different.
Although the remake in 2003 was excellent and had a tighter, more involving plot than this film, it breaks a barrier because rather than directly approaching the style of the remake and trying to live up to its success, this equally grisly thriller ignores all of the gloss, cinematography, pacing and story that it was inspired from.
Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning is a fantastic slasher film that brings us back to the classic era of 1970's slashers.I loved this chainsaw film simply because it answers all the whys and provides you with leatherface's history.Definitely gorier than the previous film and far more cringe inducing.This is first non cheesy slasher i've seen in ages which is a very nice change for me personally.
I think it is very underrated because there are so many police/romance films- the initial impression is that it follows that well trodden path but the dialogue is v good, the story is good and the characters are great.
I must say this is one of my favorite Pacino performances because he wears weariness like a badge on his face.
I went to this movie when it came out simply because it had Al Pacino in it, and half-expected some sort of cheesy love story.
And for two that a cop in love is like a whale out of the sea, dying because he is crushed by his own weight, that of his gun and badge, and crushing everything around himself like the big fat monster he is.
Sherman, among others with the movies very fine unsuspected and surprise ending which was very effective because the clues were always there for us to see but were so well hidden that we didn't notice them until the very end.
Some of my friends thought this is one of those films that is great the first time you see it, but diminishes after that because the heavy suspense questions have been answered.
In fact, he handed in one of the most convincing performances I've seen from a child actor in a very long while, because 99% of the time, the children of celebrities are precocious, annoying and predictable.
Both Pacina and Barkin have always been great actors, and here they are at their best, perhaps because of a certain tension between them Â one cannot decide if they are friends personally or hate each other, or perhaps they create the ambivalence just because they are superb actors.
But because of Kidman, it is playing in your local cineplex but this is not a film for the cineplex crowd.
Noonan hasn't had a big career as an actor which is a shame; because when you see him in this you will be thoroughly impressed.
I recommend this movie as well as others like Sexo Pudor y Lagrimas, Amores Perros and Ladies Night although this last one is more like a "chick flick" because there are male strippers, a bachelorette party, many guys and lots of fun!
Not to mention that Renata is kind of a slut because she has a boyfriend when she starts going out with Ulises.
"Amar Te Duele" is one of my favorite films because it happens in the exact zone where I live.
Upper middle class and rich class living meters away from the poor class my example is you see an enormous building and you look to the other side of the street and there are thousands of poor houses and of course they don't mix but they are all breathing the same air and the story is based in what would happen if a girl from the upper class had a boyfriend from the lower class and of course they wouldn't have a problem but everyone surrounding them including family and friends would and what happen in the movie would be really happen so what I like about it is that it could be me, my sister, my friend, anyone because its really amazing that we live in the exact same zone with the exact same places but to difference any other place in the world where it happens including cities like New York, Madrid, London or anywhere else we don't mix and this is the least fiction story that involves my life, my friends, and my family.
His only problem is being poor and coming from the type of family the upper classes of Mexico look down upon because of being 'brown' instead as pure white.
For that matter, Renata will not be able to find happiness because in her world, certain things can't be tolerated.
And her knowing at the end would turn this drama into a melodrama, because it would have shoved her back into her grief through the end, which is I believe not the intention.
This film does actually touch you with its sadness, and claims of melodramaticness will be gladly tossed aside because we are talking about Indian cinema here...  All in all i think this is definitely a gem in Indian cinema, and fit the bill of an all time classic.
The society is agrarian yet the farmers are poor mainly because of the fact that they have very small land holdings and they are unlettered.
A lot of people moved to the cities either in the anticipation of turning there fortunes or because they could not survive the atrocities of power holders.
The rider on the riksha offers Shambhu more and more money to pull faster because he is chasing (probably) his girlfriend in another rikshaw.
This film starts off with a mother and daughter traveling together and both of them are not getting along because of her mother getting a divorce and the daughter feels sorry for her dad.
I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium.
It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all.
Everyone I introduced to this movie found it difficult to watch, because although the gore is toned down, the spookiness is turned up.
I was looking for a good horror movie to watch, and I decided on this because it got some pretty good reviews and looked fairly interesting.
And if this doesn't sound like a horror film, don't worry, because Kurosawa is fortunately a skilled enough director to weave this into the slow-developing but immensely appropriate horror device unique to this movie.
If this piques your interest, don't hesitate to see it, and it's best to watch it at night by yourself, or at least with a friend who also wants to concentrate on it, because it has a profoundly atmospheric, desolate, and almost dreamlike mood that shouldn't be broken by side conversation.
These spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, I don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...
Just because it's an Asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense & it's an absolute bore means Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American production.
This, of course, means that the fear that Kairo invokes is not typical of the horror movie genre--at least not the North American horror movie genre; I can't speak for the Japanese--because it isn't really scary.
I had seen the American re-make before this film, and i'm kind of glad I did, because I got to save the best for last.
Its not perfect, even if I gave it a 10 out of 10, simply because few films have left me that uneasy.
4)Sam finally admits that he is Hunting because he thinks its making a real difference in the world.
He's such a good villain because he BELIEVES what he's doing.
But, Dean leaves the house when Sam asks him to, because he trust his brother's judgment.
Just don't go into this one looking for ghost themed movie because the focus is definitely on the violence and the social commentary.
Ichi is the best fighter because he can fight with quick speed.
Save your time or else keep heavy things out reach while watching it because you will want to destroy the TV.
Actually, there's no site better fit to host FFVIII than imdb, because that's what it is, an interactive movie.
Audie played it like that because the film-makers ordered him to do so.
America needed a hero like that, because America lacked of true heroes.
This exaggeration is self-deceit and also very dangerous, because it blindens oneself for reality which in the long run has very negative effects.
In real life, the men Murphy served with gave him a hard time because he looked like a kid.
There is not much of a plot to the film, because it shows the real hero Audie Murphy in combat.
wants to transfer the ailing Murphy out because of his poor health on the trip to North Africa (Murph had never been on a ship) and put him in with the cooks.
Nobody wants to make friends under such stressful conditions because their friends wind up dying under fire and the separation is agonizing for them.
Good thing Audie Murphy became a Hollywood star because he got to both write his own story and have Universal Studios produce the film as to his specifications.
What you'll realize about Murphy's performance is how real it is, because it's a rare moment in movies when someone plays themselves in an actual moment that changed their lives.
In my opinion 'To Hell and Back' is one of the best war movie ever made, (right next to 'Saving Private Ryan') because it was about a true story of a kid from Texas with a run-a-way Father and a dead Mother, wanted to do something for the war effort but was turned down by every other service except the Army, and the Army had second thoughts.
I watched a run of this movie on the History Channel, it was a show called, is it 'History or Hollywood' where by at the end of the show 3 Historians discuss a movie for Historic correctness, every one said if anything this movie was under stated of what Audie Murphy truly did in Europe during WWII, one said it was down played because of Audie Murphy himself, because his Army recorded as witness by others has him doing lots more, but that was the personality of Audie Murphy, imagine watching a movie were the battle's and the deeds are true, they called out a seen where Audie's best friend gets shot, he really did go ballistic charging at the German machine gun nest that killed him, picks up a German Machine gun then proceeds to take out 2 or 3 more gun sites, by using the German gun it didn't give a warning to the Germans, he saved countless American lives coming up that mountain, a brilliant movie.
I watched this movie because I was interested in seeing the story of Audie Murphy, the most decorated soldier in U.S. history.
Even though I was disappointed, I still recommend watching this film because of my admiration for Audie Murphy, and to observe a particular attitude about war that was common in 1950s America.
I hate to think of anyone seeing this as their first Fellini movie because it would definitely turn them off all his other films!  
Contrary to how it appears on IMDb I saw the film in its correct order and enjoyed this, the first half, more than the second half because it was not as gritty nor as fundamentally sad.
They conveniently forget the pabulum regularly dished out by Disney because by omitting that studio it makes it much easier to blanket the entire movie industry.
I had always thought that because South American countries, with the exception of Brazil, speak Spanish then it seemed that national boundaries would play only a minor role; but as becomes clear in part two that is most certainly not the case.
It could easily have become politicised because of the inflammatory nature of the subject matter but I believe he delivered an extremely even-handed film about a most difficult topic.
We're more than happy to reward the standard George Clooney acting genius that rivets us (Syriana, Micheal Clayton, Up in the the Air), the display of excessive violence and insanity (There will be Blood) or the Tragic Heartfelt Love that overcomes poverty (Slumdog Millionaire) But for some reason, we seem unwilling to reward movies that are superbly made simply because WE personally don't find their message appealing to our emotions.
Part1 is particularly offensive at this, because he leaves out far more story than he includes, and because he contextualizes events so poorly while intruding his "edgy" style of flashbacks and flash-forwards.
Soderbergh buries his lead because he's weak on narrative.
It's now the late fall of 1958 and Che-now Fidel Castro's right-hand man-despite his acute asthmatic condition, he's always falling behind and passing out during the fighting because of it, ends up leading his men to victory in the final stages of the Cuban Revolution.
I like this Soderbergh because he has control over his work, but it's not the only reason.
I like Soberbergh because he has style, a defined style; and because he shoots like few directors.
"Che, El Argentino" is a good movie because it succeeds in apparently everything it attempts to do, and it's obvious it wasn't a little deal.
However, the reason of the word 'apparently' is because I found it difficult to find out exactly what Soderbergh was trying to do.
It has to be said: Benicio Del Toro's performance is brilliant, but not entirely because of what you see on screen.
One could easily judge the performance as bad, because he doesn't sound Argentinean or because he doesn't sound the same in every scene; but that wouldn't be fair, even more if you know the great actor Del Toro is.
Maybe my conclusions are wrong and the second part will tell me something else, but that last question isn't worth asking because "Che" is a good movie; and that's enough.
Those who always think Che was awesome will be happy and those who always think he was nothing but a murderer and assassin will be disappointed because the movie CHE, especially part I really glorifies the man.
Not only do you see the action, you live it and it's because of the way Soderburgh has crafted the frame by frame shots of the set pieces.
Says director Steven Soderbergh, "I was drawn to Che as a subject for a movie (or two) not only because his life reads like an adventure story, but because I am fascinated by the technical challenges that go along with implementing any large-scale political idea.
That is in the eye of the beholder because to some he was a hero and a patriot, but like every conflict in history, where there is a good side there is a bad.
To view a battle objectively is impossible because there will always be someone to defend it and someone else to protest.
Yet it doesn't matter how or why you know of Guevara before you view Che because Peter Buchman does a fine job of introducing you to him here.
I always find director Steven Soderbergh's experiments interesting because they challenge the spectator and they go beyond the common.The Argentine also falls on that category.This a fascinating movie and it clearly is one of the best I have seen this year.Soderbergh made a wonderful work as a director because of the excellent performances he got from the cast and for his extreme attention to the details.Benicio del Toro brings a monumental performance as Che Guevara.He completely becomes on him and he never seems to be acting.DemiÃ¡n Bichir also brings a magnificent performance as Fidel Castro.This movie kept me very entertained and it brings a very valid and important message.The only fail I found on this movie was that it was a little bit long on a specific moment.But that's a minor fail.The Argentine is a fascinating experiment I liked very much.This is one of that movies which challenge the spectator and have something to say and I really admire that.I totally recommend this film.
Curly is deeply interested in them because he had to have one of his henchmen, Studs (Franco Ressel of "Sabata"), killed for trying to kill Kowalski.
The film is not all that well known today, and that is probably because it is rather derivative of other and better known westerns; most obvious is the climatic shootout sequence towards the end which directly 'borrows' from Sergio Leone's masterpiece The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
Your guess is not as good as mine - because I can tell You: American companies do not like truly revolutionary films.
Which I say isn't too much of a bad thing for this type of flick, because that's one of the draw cards of this sub-genre, but it's just that the characters are expendable to it, well maybe not Franco Nero's easy going character.
Sergio Corbucci direction is the key also because the story isn't planned out with any real sort of purpose but just to stage one comical scene or action packed moment.
From that point it did kind of reminded me of Leone's 'The Good, the bad and the Ugly', that was because of the buddy humour that they played around with and like another reviewer mentioned Paco Roman did have an uncanny nature to that of Taco from GTBTU.
Corbucci paces the film swiftly by making it more compelling and surprising the further along it went, without letting you doze off because of some well stage scenes like a bank heist, bombing of an Mexican town and the final shootout.
(If you're one of the very few people who would like to see it simply because of the storyline, I'd suggest you save your money for something better.)
The actress in this scene is clearly in it because she's an attention whore.
I give this film a pretty high rating because it does exactly what it's intention is to do - repel, repulse and sicken - but again, the story is pretty decent too, and even has an unexpected twist, which doesn't always happen in this new realm of Asian "super extreme" gore films.
I downloaded the end because I still havent got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.
the good thing about this game is that there are more female characters the Final Fantasy VII and the baddies are woman (Seifer inst classed as a bad guy because he redeems himself at the end of the game)  The FMV sequences are a lot more advanced than Final Fantasy VII and the detail is much greater.
Squall reminds you of Cloud and Rinoa reminds you of Aeris because of the way they are to each other and you can tell that they are desined to be together.
Laguna and Raine have a very short but sweet relationship and you feel sorry for him in the end sequence because he still misses her a lot and they were married and are the parents of Squall.

One feels sorry for Sun (acted well by Winston Chao, and he looks uncannily like the man himself), perhaps because his true vision of China was probably realised at a very heavy price, the price of freedom.
Sadly, this movie is not likely to reach a wide North American audience because it's in Mandarin with English sub-titles.
That's too bad, because it is just as accomplished as anything coming out of Hollywood these days, and well worth seeing.
The film would come up with a series that didn't last as long because the magic just wasn't there.
No, The Bad News Bears is a cut above most sports films because it helps you understand what it's like to compete at that age.
Now, this doesn't pack too much of a punch because every movie in the world does this now.
The thing was that Final Fantasy fans were disappointed in FFVIII because it was no longer set in the 'past' like the previous FF games, but I think it's a nice change and definitely an awesome change, because it set the groundworks to FFX.
It was also a breath of relief for me, because the charactes were finally tall (at least compared to the other FF characters and just down right kicked butt)  So, despite the complaints of FFVIII being to futuristic and the not so great inplay graphics; the music, FMVs, plot, and characters will make up for it and blow you away!
Walter Matthau stars as Buttermaker, an drunken former minor leaguer who coaches a little league team because his job as a pool cleaner isn't exactly lucrative.
That ticks me off, because this is a serious film.
Yes, I know it is a comedy, but seeing a Coach strike his kid on the mound, seeing players from the rival Yankees degrade the misfit Bears' players, seeing Buttermaker push away one of his players because she wants him to be a father figure, there is real drama at work here.
But only because of that.
This movie is probably rated higher than I normally would because it was one of my favorites growing up.
As for Tanner, he's a pint-sized hood who happens to decide to join the Bears only because he dislikes the self-important Turner (who keeps harassing him on the baseball field).
It always slipped my mind though when I wanted to rent it, but finally I remembered and I am so glad that I got the chance to see it, because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70's.
I think my favorite Bear was Tanner, because the role could have been over done, but the kid did it just right, not to mention his last line of the film is just classic and fit the movie just right.
It's a good story,with quite a bit serious to say about human nature and the understandings and misunderstandings between generations; it makes me mad that it never received the attention it deserved because it's "just" about kids.
I hope this gets the chance for distribution because if any doubters watch this and is not moved by the fight, the sadness from the personal stories and dedication from these people then you can't be human.
This film is for everyone--for or against same sex marriage--because it is a ringside view into how banning together for a passionate cause can change laws, and how ordinary Americans can participate in politics that change lives.
Firstly I'm a fan of this saga,and played it from the fifth installment,and I'll buy a ps3 just for this saga(and for metal gear solid too)Many people says that FF VIII is the weakest of the series.Why?Is it because it tells a perfect love story?Or is it because it hasn't got a perfect villain like Sephiroth?I love this game so much,cause Squall is a lot like me,and he gives me more courage to open up people after I've finished the game,and after that;life become more beautiful than ever for me.Just this enough for me to say,that's the best game I've ever played,but other characters,their relationships,graphics,astonishing and flawless FMV's(best opening and ending movies for a game by so far),musics("eyes on me"rocks!
I think she is Brent Huff's wife, but she's so good in her role that I don't care if she got it only because of that.
I guess this movie got killed off because of the budget, and overall it must have been braindead people being responsible for this.
It's a lovely documentary to see because it talks a lot about what the actors, directors, producers of each films think about all four movies.
It's a must-see for every movie-goers especially for the first thirty minutes, I would say, because everyone who was involved in the 1979 classic "Alien" give their point of view (and H.R.
It made me a little bit sad because Alien Resurrection is my favorite of them all but Alien Evolution was so well done and what the people had to say was so interesting that I still give it a perfect 10 on 10 because it was excellent!
Bottom Line: I am giving this a 9 out of 10, because, as it is, the documentaries featured on the Alien Quadrilogy set actually have better in-depth coverage of the same material posted here, but not everything.
There is a nice covey of bad guys who are not traceable because they wore masks during the robbery and never saw each other's faces.
He finds himself accused of a spectacular robbery of $1.2 million because the thieves used a truck like his as their escape vehicle.
None of them knows what Foster looks like and they don't know what the others look like because Foster forced them to always wear masks in front of each other.
He spent 20 years on the KCPD and he was forced to retire because of politics.
But it doesn't really matter how the movie's categorized because it remains something of a sleeper with a number of genuine surprises.
I like them because they are so gritty and realistic in their blunt portrayal of crime.
I thought "Tim Foster," played by Preston Foster, was the best character in the film, probably because he was right in the middle of everything.
He was just wasn't lucky, because he had a great plan.
Preston Foster is the former head of detectives for the Kansas City Police, who was forced to leave his post because of a change in city political structures that he did not prepare for.
He's tough, all right, but still shows the flop-sweat of fear; and he's smart, too, but because he's forced to be Â what he's trying to hang onto is all he's got.
Sure, the fans of different genres and bands may always have complaints to enter because their favorite flavor of metal or their specific band did not get enough screen time or even omitted.
Like how he always has had to defend metal because most people look down on it as a lesser form of music.
And how he just doesn't bother to do it anymore, because if you feel it you feel it, and if you don't, chances are that you never will.
I have been into this kind of music for almost 20 years, and she has never listened to it, but came along because she was curious.
When "Dr. Kessler" (Welles), a scientist working with her husband, first appears at their home, Elizabeth doesn't realize it's John, who never returned to the U.S. because of his crippling, debilitating war wounds.
I also like the fact that Sam Dunn has the educational background he does, and is obviously making something productive and positive out of his life because too many people do write off metal heads as being stupid, low class, criminal, uncultured, and most likely, introverted, out of touch, and mentally unstable.
Some say that "Final Fantasy VIII" is the weakest of the sagas (because of it's storyline), but I loved the storyline!
Some of the characters are also reminiscent of the Gilligan's Island castaways such as the character of Lucille, who starts out as a snotty yet beautiful Ginger-type then turns into a fledgling Samurai under the hallucinogenic tutelage of a dead Japanese soldier because she just happens to be fluent in Japanese (as well as Vietnamese) and managed to translate the dead soldier's diary.
I stayed up until really late in the morning.I wasn't about to miss it because who knows when it would have been on again.
I think it is fun because of the way the subject matter is handled.
However, FF8 gets the highest rating I can give a game, because I find it fascinating and beautifully made.
Others who have played bazillions of other games find things wrong with FF8 left and right, because it's different from what they're used to...
There, he finds that his dad is working himself to exhaustion because a nearby town has lost their doctors and so he now has a ton of new patients.
I had never knew that this Silly Symphony was Donald Duck's first theatrical appearance as well as for his voice-artist Clarence "Ducky" Nash too; and besides, I love Donald Duck, along with Mickey Mouse, his canine pal Pluto (which is unusual, because I am a cat-lover) and Chip n' Dale.
And it's all because of Mr. Nash that we owe a heap of thanks so thank you, Clarance, wherever you are!
To try and explain it right now is very hard, not because of a complex plot or difficult scenario: but because whatever I say will not compare to how much of a masterpiece it really is.
But the reason this is a landmark cartoon is because it was the debut of the irascible, anti-social, temperamental, infuriating & utterly lovable Duck, a character so strong he would soon eclipse Mickey Mouse himself.
movie is?, the only thing I liked about it was Farrah Fawcett, she was really good in it, she looked different, but I still loved her in this movie, I gave it a 7 because I thought 8-10 was too much, if this was a motion picture it probably would be a 2 star movie, but anyway I liked it, I even taped the movie for myself.
One scene between Farrah and her daughter is pretty shocking because of how bad the acting is.
All too often, actors just stand around or utter their lines with no emotion or conviction--because they almost universally lacked experience and training.
This is a great movie to watch because everyone needs a father, biological or not, and one often loses sight of how important the influence of a father can be.
These people are computer experts, Redfords character is blackmailed because of his past, into doing some work for the government.
All in all, it works because the math and the technology are believable, especially for the early '90s.
I opened this write up with a funny line spoken by Robert Redford because having just finished the film I feel all jolly, and that is a priceless thing after watching one of the most suspenseful films ever!
And it all works because of the outstanding script and the ensemble cast of some of the best actors in the business: Robert Redford, Ben Kingsly, Dan Ackroyd, David Strathairn, Mary McDonnell, Sidney Poitier, the late River Phoenix, and even Stephen Tobolowsky (who played the infamous Ned Ryerson in "Groundhog Day") as a nerdy tech guy.
Sad because it's a waste of a really talented cast.
It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world.
I was drawn to Sneakers because I heard the story was of my favorite genre, a spy thriller.
Whether you got to these comments because you want to know if this film was worth seeing, or whether a training shoe web-search somehow ended you up here against your will, you really should see this film.
Perhaps that idea was kicked around but rejected because of similarities to Irwin Allen's disaster flicks of the time, budget constraints, the lack of a script, or the fact that the series was about space, not earth.
What stands in my mind is how, eight to ten minutes before the end of nearly every episode, the society on a new planet encountered by the Alphans ends up being destroyed, usually at the hand of Commander John Koenig, because what it seeks does not meet with the life Alphans are used to.
Was it because being in an Eddie Murphy film was so popular at the time that you just had to do it?
It was denied the opportunity to be a hit in Britain because it was not networked.
I mention this because I am trying to be a reasonable critic to the series, and not just include all the qualities I love about it!!
I say this because I.T.C's usual concern about how British programmes appealed to the American audience led certain series to have a very short life.
I always seemed to associate it with some of the best memories of my childhood, although sometimes I wonder if those memories were so good because I had a show I was so fond of to relate to in my memory.
Season 2 was a necessitated shift away from this grimness, because without it there wouldn't have been a season 2, for better or worse.
He, meanwhile, has been having an affair with his head nurse, a noble single mother of a sick little boy -- but their love dare not speak its name because she's (gasp!)
He is injured badly, and while wrapped in facial bandages in hospital he makes the decision not to notify next of kin and drop out of his young wife's life because he feels he could never be the same man again, at least to her.
I weep for all the guitar picks that weren't made because the film was used on this horrible bit of pig vomit.
I enjoyed the film very much because it showcased one of the original 'invasion' groups, not because it was an award winner; although it really wasn't all that bad either.
Is it possible the Hermits popularity waned because at the time of this filming most rock groups has gone beyond the squeaky clean, suit and tie, short/mod hair Herman and the boys were sporting?
I don't suppose that I would have liked it when it first came out because it would have been bunched in with all of the other `rock' musicals of it's time, trying to compete for the `young' in-crowd.
I would have preferred subs because the dubbing here is beyond awful.
I watched this movie because my husband wanted to.
To be honest I didn't pay close enough attention in the beginning because I wasn't expecting much so I ended up watching it again.
While he's in Tom's world, Prince Edward gets a good look at the horrible way the English people are forced to live because of bad laws.
I think it's because the other pieces are minor or (like Wilson) full of other interesting small matters - like the business of the use of fingerprints to settle the mysteries of the plot (a first in 1894).
I don't like to bash movies because it makes me look like an idiot who probably couldn't make a better movie if my life depended on it, but I could film myself sleeping for two hours and it'd be more entertaining (and plausible) than this turd.
Mind you, we never see him lose everything, we just assume that he has because again, he's wearing dirty clothes.
Director/Co-writer Joe CastroÂOne of the effects artists at SOTA effects, a company who's work in the past has usually been less-than-stellarÂwould have been much better off handling the gore rather than writing/directing, because he shows no sense of pacing.
I hope the actors in this film kept their day jobs before going into acting because they put forth the worst effort I've ever seen.
While watching it,Got a weird sensation of DÃ©jÃ  vu and it's because of Charles Band handling of Laserblast.
I'll stop here because the ensuing massacre with everyone who comes into the warehouse is too good to be spoiled.
This starts out as a straightforward drama about a yuppie who tosses his career into the dumper because of his addiction to drugs.
One of the reasons why Beverly Hills Cop 2 is such a great sequel is because of the return of the stars from the first film.
Another reason why this sequel is good is because of the way the action and comedy scenes are balanced.
Duke Togo is the world's greatest assassin-for-hire, better known as "Golgo 13," and if you're on his list you might as well dig the hole because there is no way, repeat, NO WAY you will elude him.
I remember seeing it four times and twice I had to sit near the front of the theatre because it was packed.
The scene works because we really don't know what all that jargon is and neither does the lady behind the desk.
We are intrigued as to how these two disparate tales are related, but we DO sense a connection in due course, because the dry, somber doctors are talking about a "killer" and in that wet parallel Motel story there're KILLIN'S GALORE.
If you want to watch a horror, a mystery, a action, and a murder film then see Identity today because it has all of that in it!
In the very end they think he is OK because all of his personalities are dead, except for the girl.
The two aspects I had a slight problem with on the second go-round were one, the plot didn't quite envelop me to the same extent (maybe because I remembered the twist?)
It might be difficult to blame either Cooney or Mangold with this, however, as American film studios and test audiences are notoriously allergic to ambiguity, which is depressing, because I love ambiguity in films.
In this film, she sounds like she has congestion, but people would say that this was because of her accent.
The writing is weak, the performances by Rainer and Powell just aren't there because they're given such poor material to work with.
Perhaps because I was not very familiar with Luise Rainier performances (beyond "The Good Earth," which movie I didn't like), I was impressed by her in "The Emperor's Candlesticks."
I use the conditional because of comments by others here.
This was strange because Lesnar is supposed to be tough, mean, nasty and damn right destructible.
I just fast forward this match, because I couldn't have been arsed about it.
It's a regret because there are probably loads of excellent foreign-speaking films out there that people could enjoy but can't be marketed.
But recently we had it on the TV and I just watched it, because I heard people liked it.
Maybe I just liked the idea, because it really seemed great.
To me, this movie is special because I very much love its genre and the way it was presented.
The last sequence with inserted song of Russian rock band Nautilus Pompilius is really great, whole seeming reference to American and Western action films gets toppled upside-down,because when credit titles appear, suddenly the song declare:"Boodby, America, where I've never been.".
Of course, partly they were (as usual) just proclaimed changes, but it doesn't matter in this case because, on the other hand, Brat-2 showed nation's feelings and hopes of those days.
I hope they gonna make part three, because it didn't look that Danila's adventure is over.
Sergei bodrov is legendary in this film and it would be great to see him in a third installment, but because of his tragic murder by the American government aka avalanche we can only dream.
People were buying it, because of the similarity of situations depicted to the real life.
Just because a character makes a racist comment in a film does not mean that a movie's message is racist.
Probably that was because film's poor subtitles or translation and lack information or knowledge about real life in Russia and post Soviet countries.
Firstly Danila went to America not because of money but for revenge of his very close friend with whom he was in the army and was killed by Russian gangsters who misunderstood an order of their boss.
Russian mobster was not killed because Danila liked his son.
You can not make opinion about people because of their nationality or race.
Then there's Sergei Bodrov Jr. it is a damn shame that he died last year (along with his film crew in an avalanche) because he was a major talent.
Apparently, the English version of Dragonblade is much better than the Chinese version, because the movie was originally English.
This film should be internationally recognized, because the standard of this film is definitely high compared to other Hong Kong movies.
I would recommend this movie to everybody, especially Hong Kong viewers, because they should be proud of the Hong Kong animators, this film is produced and made in Hong Kong.
I would recommend this movie to animation lovers and mainly teenagers, because the language to quite vulgar for young kids.
I'm not sure who it was that described this movie as "Crouching Tiger meets Shrek", because that in itself sets an unreasonable benchmark in all sorts of ways.
He was well past his youthful days as a romantic idol and it's sad to think he would be dead next year because any number of parts would have opened up for him.
In the end, the whole film was dubbed because no one could hear.
She was tolerable because the actual story was powerfully near to perfection.
There wasn't time for cheap CGI or pathetic special effects, this was a human driven film, and it worked because they were all characters we either believed in or have once known.
Zanuck returned Power to his old heroic films, aged a little because he was growing older.
ABANDON SHIP is a hard film to sit through as it is so bleak - it is the bleakest movie that Powell ever made (even THE EDDIE DUCHIN STORY had an element of hope in it because Eddie's son Peter was there to carry on the family's name and reputation).
Power acts with tremendous force and tension as the "captain" here; the dramatic arc of the story is contained entirely within his decision-making process, and for a first-time viewer his key decision (which I will not reveal) will always register as startling because it runs so counter-intuitively to our received sense of ethics.
His part is important because it shows how even a really mean person (which Mr. Wilson's character is not) can be foiled by the innocent childhood antics of Dennis the Menace.
I don't know why 'Dennis' only receives a 4.7 rating on IMDb because it is a rather enjoyable film with plenty of cute/funny moments that leave you chuckling so surely deserves a few points more.
I was questioning Christopher Lloyd's role when i saw this in theaters because that almost overshadowed the fact that this was a family film and his role as a robber caught me off guard.
Why did I like this movie, because it is just plain funny, that's why!
"Dennis the Menace" is unique in its own way because it's observant.
The curator of the aquarium who want bankrupt because of him?
Hemingway (Clarence Wilson) who has just been sacked because he has been playing the stock market with Aquarium funds, lawyer Barry Costello (Robert Armstrong), Seymour because he has confessed and Gwen because she is acting suspiciously.
If you can find some little niche that you do belong in enjoy it because sometimes that fit never lasts.
The 4 main characters fit in with each other because they were temps and had that little thing in common.
Sure, we can blame it on the thief plot but in the long run relationships like that don't last because they have very little in common.
She paid Iris a compliment and also said hi but all she did was stare back at her-funny coming from those who complain about being ignored by the permanent workers because they were temps.
She stole the things from everyone because it gave her a part of them since she didn't make friends with anyone.I can really feel for the Cleo character.
That attempt failed, probably because she was not a sex symbol.
Or perhaps she was not cast more as a leading lady because she was, simply put, unsurpassed as a character actress.
California at that time was totally isolated, and would get the news from the government many months later, thus many people would be for secession, because they did not believe they could be governed like that.
Just because "Pony Express" is a western and the Indians are characterized as the bad guys, does not mean it is without merit.
Paul used to say in school he didn't need math because he was going to be like Elvis - an entertainer.
I had always wondered if this was an attempt to sabotage the World Church of Satanic Liberation because they weren't like the Church of Satan.
I give this show an 9 out of 10 because my daughter loves it.
I was surprised to see Chris Sarandon, because this role of his is very different from the one I'm familiar with;Prince Humperdink.
And I've managed to enjoy a few of them precisely because they are so bad like for example Troll II or Demon Wind, but Neon Maniacs was just too god awful.
Neon Maniacs,great movie by far one of my top 5 greatest films.The movie is so great because of the great original plot and characters...have u ever seen a movie when maniacs are killed by...water?No then check this out.I love alot of movies this definetly is one of them and its also hard to get so if u ever find it get it because even if u didnt like it its one of those movies when u cant not see it and u have to judge yourself!
Maybe they're upset because they're different.
I will not waste your time describing what kind of creatures these are, because they are little more than some make-up artists weak effort to make some disgusting monsters for a meaningless horror film and their exact descriptions are beside the point.
If you've read any of the other reviews of this movie on the IMDb, you already know that the movie sets up for a sequel that was never made (my good friend and colleague Christopher Brown makes a good point in his review, that the sequel may have never been made because Lightning Video went out of business, but he also makes a shocking miscalculation of the quality of the movie itself Â sorry Chris!).
I'm pretty sure it's because their distributor, Lightning Video, went out of business.
Shame, because her acting was rather good - as was most of the cast, to be fair.
Maybe it's because the screenplay is a bunch of unscrupulous and light-headed nonsense or maybe it's because you have a lot more sympathy for the characters here than it usually is the case in horror films, I don't know.
But you can also enjoy this on tape, because VHS copies are still floating around at used video stores.
The original Beverley Hills Cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made.
While I am no fan of the Fleischers' other series such as Popeye and Betty Boop because of their incredibly similar plots, they are far superior to the Superman cartoons when it comes to animation quality.
Poor because several of the films are very lame and are NOT award nominated, the prints are rather bad and parts of some of the cartoons are missing!
This production must have really looked cool to kids and adults 67 years ago because it still looks good today in 2008.
The voices of Clark Kent and Lois Lane were odd because they sounded so much different from all the Kents and Lanes I've heard through the decades.
This Kent voice was noteworthy because it had the recognizable voice of Bud Collyer, who became quite famous in the 1950s by hosting two extremely popular TV shows: "Beat The Clock" and "To Tell The Truth."
I think the main reason is because since the main characters acted so stupid yet nice, you could kind of relate with them and feel closer to them, which means more laughs.
Of course they would because it is based on the slapstick, pottymouth humor of the Farrelly Brothers.
Dumb & Dumber is the best comedy film that I watch ever,Farrelly Brothers are the masters of the comedy in the 90Â´s with matt groening and Trey Parker.The film has got a funny and ironic screen with a lot of gags .Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau of the 90Â´s.Lauren Holly is great because she never do a comedy role and she play it very well.THE BEST COMEDY FILM OF THE 90Â´S AND MAYBE IN THE HISTORY.
Overall this movie may not be perfect because the humor will not appeal to everyone.
The film wasn't warmly received by a lot of critics, but only because they couldn't lower their snouts long enough to realize that this was not another movie about dumb guys, but really a film about earnest guys.
... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?)
No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.
Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors.
As crazy as Jim Carrey got in some of his earlier movies (Ace Ventura, Liar, Liar, etc) he's actually lower-key than in some of the other stupid-guy roles he played, one reason because he's doesn't shout in here.
Anyway, you should get a lot of laughs out this: at least I suspect males will more than females....and that's all it was meant for - laughs, and nothing else - so don't trash the film because it wasn't "intelligent" enough for you.
It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!
The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.
If he was cast just for his musical talent, then the director of the movie got lucky, because man can he act!
That film stays grounded, perhaps because it is based on a true story.
He should be nominated for a supporting actor Oscar or Golden Globe,/ but he will not, because so few have seen the wonderful movie.
It does perhaps leave you a little flat because its feel-good finale is too fanciful.
The German tanks are actually German tanks (thanks to countless tanks abandoned by fleeing Germans during the war)--something you just don't see in American films because they aren't available.
I almost didn't go to see it because there were so many other choices.
I had a negative bias towards this movie because of the description that I had read about it, but soon after it started I was impressed by the camera work and technical quality (including the special effects) of this movie.
Watching this movie was very boring to me because it's very predictable.
I believe the only reason anyone would have seen this film is because Russell is in it.
The predominating message was that you could skip it because a particular character is annoying and whiny.
Going in to plot details is unnecessary because chances are you've heard all of this before and seen all of this before done in about half the action movies released in the last 20 years.
It's funny because we would ask people if they knew it and they'd look at us like we had three heads.I also agree it should be on TV annually.
Did they just want to get in his good books because he was a influential man in the community?
He finds himself obliged to engage in worldly matters.The more he gets himself into this the more he vacillates because he notices that the religious order rented a shop to the men who take alcohol and in another example he oscillates to take the rent from a family who has barely any money.
There is absolutely no depth in the characters (Leung, Simon Yam or others) and the film is pretty irritating to watch because it offers nothing more than just gun fires and action, which are nothing special considered this is made in the land of Woo, Lam, Mak and other great directors.
The film works well because of how little is actually stated by the principals.
But in my opinion, it's impossible not to like (and I don't just mean because of a certain scene with Sandra Dee).
I used to just rewind the tape and watch the title sequence because it really is interesting and moving.
I guess she was enchanted by CGI and dumb dialog because in mere disappointment, she said, "what is this old sh#%?!"
Needless to say, once it was cleaned, the show was on and going and I had not heard another peep of disapproval from her because the story is a great one despite it's out of date dialog and mannerisms.
I'm sure there will be many who will pick apart the movie because it's not up whatever standards that they hold but in defense of it, for its day (1970) it's pretty good.
We are not all falling asleep because we have Attention Deficit Disorder.
We are falling asleep because the film simply doesn't have any action to move it forward.
The only reason I stayed with it was because the acting was pretty good.
also i might add that at times the plot seems rushed-off, but maybe because is trying to pull the exact same dialogs-camera work-twists as in "the usual suspects"( one of the best suspense movie EVER!).
I was nearly going to skip this movie, because it was a 2005 film.
I rented this movie because of the actors involved - Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Taye Diggs, Mekhi Phifer and the great Bruce McGill.
In fact, it was stupid because it committed the ultimate sin for making a movie - it bored the hell out of its audience, and an audience that includes some "smart people" who can figure things out.
Obviously they didn't know how to shoot the city in the Punisher, because it looks like a much meaner place in this one.
In short-- I don't necessarily call the LACK of a coherent explanation a Negative: It's a Mystery because you will never really know what you were involved with, especially if you're only concerned with getting out Alive.
and it is a white-black film because there are no choices for that time but it uses that as a specialty.as a foreigner for Russian culture and i didn't live in a war and i effected by their force to win the war despite they are poor and they are defeated from 2 villages they were telling we have to work more.and in the film the people meet each other very easy only the Suraa and Aliocha in the train.he-he that shows their great love.10/10
I admit it, the sole reason I wanted to see this was because of Marlon Brando but once you see his appearance you can't imagine that this is the man from Elia Kazan-movies or Don Corleone...at contrary, he plays like an idiot...
Avildsen believed that because Brando basically improvised the scene Shagan was not happy with it.
I give this a high rating simply because of George C. Scott and Marlon Brando, who rise above muddled material and breathe life into an otherwise clunky TV movie.
Special effects oddly hold up because they are fairly inert, but the stories are either boring or indirectly have something to do with Mormonism.
The Cylons, meanwhile, attack again, but are destroyed because they're so utterly incompetent.
Starbuck impersonates everything a boy wants to be (he's so damn cool), and I still go by the codename Starbuck today, though (or maybe because) I am totally different.
Unfortunately, the special effects appeared a little simple, because they were persistently reused.
It's not surprising to see a lot of reviewers bashing this movie because of the nudity scene.
Thus he must abandon the injured soldier with whom he could have been friends; he must risk losing the love of his life because trains must run on wartime; he must leave his mother, without even time to fix the leaky roof.
If you're neither of the above, wait until somebody else rents it, because it's not worth paying for.
So please stop saying this is child pornography because it is not.
---MAJOR SPOILERS---  Anyway, I must say that most of the content, especially the first half, is disturbing because you can see how cruel was the social environment where the girl was living in.
It seems the only person that really loves her is the black pianist and you can see the indignation in his eyes during the auction, but he feels helpless cause he knows he cannot do anything because of his race.
But even though she wants to be an adult it is just like a game for her, because actually she behaves like a kid because she IS a kid.
But I give it 8 out of 10 because the plot is well done also the time scenery/clothing/atmosphere, and specially because it is a controversial theme handled deeply.
This is an exceptional film - not because most of the critics say so, but for me because I cannot think of any other film which left me with a greater feeling of having been temporarily transported to another world in a place and time with which I was totally unfamiliar.
Today nudity occurs in films for two principal reasons, firstly because it would be natural for the character concerned under the circumstances being depicted by the film, or secondly because it is being used by the director to add a little eye candy intended to increase the visual appeal of the film.
Ultimately this is the powerful message from Pretty Baby that makes it such an exceptional film; but because the Director decided to employ a totally non-judgmental documentary type presentation and to minimise any direct emotional appeal, most viewers probably only recognize it when scenes returned to their memory during the hours and days after they left the cinema, and I do not believe its rare combination of beautiful imagery and haunting power has so far been brought out adequately by the comments on this database.
I would just like to say that the film is my favorite because of the atmosphere and the way the film is shot.
We can't escape the fact that Katrina's devastation could have been slimly less grim because those who were too hard-headed to flee stayed and died.
He's allowed to stick around every day because, I don't know, I suppose they think he might bring them some fame or at least advertisement, and because they assume he's a homosexual and nonthreatening.
I would watch it again because there is so much going on I'm sure I missed something while I was fixated on the sets and costumes.
It was also a notoriously scandalous film because of child pornography issues (the setting is a New Orleans brothel), which makes it a surprising choice for DVD release in this age of political correctness - although Paramount basically just slapped it onto disc, as it's a no-frills release (with not even a trailer to go with it)!
For the most part he appears to be asexual, appreciating the beauty of Violet's mother's naked breasts but only because of how well they'll photograph.
He doesn't actively seek out young girls, and if he and Violet end up involved, it's because of her pursual of him.
The deflowering ritual that Violet had to undergo would have scared me senseless, and it is pitifully sad to think that she looked forward to it, only because then the other women in the house would really take her seriously.
The movie is sloppy and uninspired from start to finish, which is a shame because turn of the century New Orleans is a story that deserves to be told well.
Actually, I think the main reason this movie works is because it comes across as honest, it feels like being in another place and another time, and it's lovely to see.
It's that much more disconcerting because all the while you're keenly aware that this isn't based on "a true story" but on millions of true stories throughout history, including today, and in every part of the globe.
It's a wonderful irony, because the director opens with such a powerful & nihilistic statement, but then he follows with a sweet and inspiring presentation which you might even call "innocent".
I should say "girl," because she's supposed to be a 14-year-old in here who is having an affair with her 30- year-old stepfather.
His allowing himself to be seduced by the step daughter was so predictable because he was portrayed as such a weak cipher of man.
Luckily, for Mary Tyler Moore, she made it because of an outstanding supporting cast.
There was this episode when his friend dies in a car accident and Alex was supposed to be with him but lucked out because of his selfishness.
In other episodes we also see Alex so romantic in love with Elen and later hurt because she leaves him for dancing scholarship to France and then he falls in love with Lauren (Courtney Cox).
That was another funny and memorable episode because she is a psychology student and interviewing Alex to study high achievers.
My favorite is Alex being upset because "mommy, my favorite president is being impeached!"
Michael Gross stands out for me because he has the best one-liners in the show and his delivery as naive Steve Keaton is incredibly funny.
There's Nazi loot and a nightclub, and Lloyd Nolan as a chummy cop, and lots of quirky characters (including one of my favourites, Housely Stevenson), who are there mainly to distract you, because Hodiak's character is so passive that he isn't even in the final scene - a cheery wash-up reminiscent of a mild sitcom.
Despite this and because the story is so good her slightly faltering performance can take nothing from this thriller.
This is a muddled movie that still manages to be absorbing, probably because of the talent behind and in front of the camera.
The role is played with subtlety, and some stiffness, by John Hodiak, I think because he is meant to be eternally confused by events (since he remembers nothing) and yet can't show his confusion, so he draws up a blank face.
The actors drift, because Mankewicz isn't doing anything to shape the movie.
An utterly original modern-day fable with elements of "Oliver Twist," the plot normally would be considered totally implausible, but director Kirsten Sheridan makes it work -- because you root for these characters.
And because it's the driving force of the film, the sound is exceptional, as is the film's lush look.
i was extremely excited because of the amazing coincidences the story shows.
(*Spoilers*) Famous concert cellist Lyla has a one night stand with rocker Louis that produces a son Evan (aka August) who is surreptitiously sent to an orphanage by Lyla's controlling father because he believes the child may harm Lyla's career.
I give this movie 2 out of 10, only because there are worst movies out there.
They must have seen a different movie because I didn't see anything like that.
The sketches they do are awful (or I guess I should say the sketches that they did do because thankfully this show has finally been taken off the air).
It is shows like Comedy Inc that prove to me that Canadian television is really sick and the industry as a whole needs to be fixed somehow, because if this is the kind of crap that the comedy channel and CTV will turn out again and a again they clearly do not care one bit about the quality of their programs, they obviously want to just make whatever is cheap that fits the "Canadian made" bill, and in which case I think they should just pull the plug totally and we can just watch BBC or an American channel.
Wow - I really hope they publish all the seasons of Comedy Inc on DVD sometime in the future because I would really like to collect this classic comedy series.
To all those that reported negative comments about this series - either most of the humour was over their head, or perhaps they are President Bush supporters because I really don't see how you cannot find this series extremely funny unless you do NOT have a sense of humour (quite possible with Bush supporters!)
This show is easily one of the very worst shows I have ever seen in my entire life and as much as I want to say it is the #1 worst show ever made I'm not sure that's true because there have been some other awful shows but right now I can't think of anything I'm sure is worse than Comedy Inc.
If she was supposed to be a sympathetic character, it never showed and that is too bad because Hershey is an accomplished actress and this movie doesn't help her career.
this was quite a jumbled mess of a film... hershey is cast as a much too young actress, and mazur is completely wasted... this film has no idea of where it wants to go, and is turgid and confusing in many parts... clarence williams is wasted too... too bad because the cast is interesting enuff
It seems really contrived, particularly because several of the characters were absolute caricatures.
I came around during the Palm Springs hooker scene, just because it didn't go for the obvious gambit.
Even the politician/father is more complex than we think at first; although perhaps predictably, because of the career he's chosen, he moves the least of the major characters.
I appreciated the tapestry that led to the subtle and uplifting conclusion, probably because it seemed to resemble clarity.
The beginning of the film, where the young man walks away from the Anthony character's bed exists purely to show the character would be petulant because guys walk out on him after sleeping with him -- so when the Henry Kray character does it, of course, he needs revenge by messing up the Henry's entire life.
Tsukamoto Gishiro(Eiji Okada), Takemura Banzo(Noboru Nakaya), Shokei Tokuichi(Takeo Chii) & Kitahama Okono(Sanae Nakahara)were responsible for Yuki's father's horrifyingly violent demise, proclaiming him a corrupt member of government just because he wore white(..he was actually an innocent schoolteacher on his way to teach in the village the four thieves had just swindled).
Just because something is captured on celluloid, put together and provided with some (dubbed only) sound doesn't make it a movie.
I wish to see more such films from our contemporary Bengali filmmakers because we are not really only pop culture.
The "theme" is given more importance than the story, which is a shame because there are some really good things here.
I enjoyed this film very much because of its refreshing blend of drama and humor.
Dudikoff should be fired once and for all or killed by those movie terrorists...  2/10 (just because it's not that awful for a 1.)
While it isn't quite as funny as SWINGSHIFT, it is the first of its kind and because of that it still is one of the best of the era.
She doesn't want him because she has to go to her grandma.
It worked then, it works now and will work tomorrow, precisely because Avery had that most overworked and little understood word-genius.
The character herself is played by Meiko Kaji (who also took the lead role in the fantastic Female Prisoner Scorpion series) and while she is a lady of few words, it's easy to get involved with her thirst for revenge because of the interesting atmosphere surrounding the character.
But this entire film was done so well, I can't think of why they're trying to remake it again with Keira Knightly(although I'll probably see that one too, just because I love the story so much).
In the middle of this, and because the Bennets have no son, the girls stand no chance of inheriting.
Jane Austen must have been aware at an empiric form that editing can balance out a work and enhance its effect, because in putting the crisis of the action halfway she establishes that Elizabeth and Darcy will have to shift towards each other in a realistic way, the same way other events will allow Jane and Bingley to consummate their union.
Having read the novel several times, I can relate to this one best because it retains pages of dialog intact without making it too talky and that's a tricky thing to do.
While Mrs. Bennet wasn't the most agreeable person in the world, I believe that she has been represented better in the movie version because while still being a hyperactive, over-emotional woman, she was aware her daughters would be left destitute if they did not marry well.
The hero is absolutely charming, probably because I imaged him as Colin, who is soooooo handsome and cute by the way :), from the very beginning.
I ended up watching it because my wife had it on.
Maybe its because it is so much more than just a romance.
The central message of the story which I found personally educational is the moment when Elizabeth, having thought herself an excellent judge of human character, while reading Darcy's letter realizes that she has entirely deceived herself with regards to the character of both Wickham and Darcy and that this self deception has resulted from vanity, because Wickham flattered her whereas Darcy insulted her with his "She is tolerable I suppose, though not handsome enough to tempt me."
Of all the films that Quentin Tarantino pays homage to in his Kill Bill films, Fujita's Lady Snowblood might have received the most because not do the Kill Bill films have screen shots almost taken directly from Lady Snowblood they also incorporate some of the music sung by Lady Snowblood's heroine Kaji Meiko.
However, unlike many of the films made during that time period Lady Snowblood remains popular because while its plot had been done many times before, including Suzuki Norifumi's Sex and Fury which was filmed the same year and whose background plot is almost identical to Lady Snowblood, it possesses a certain style that differentiates it from many other films from this time period namely that the heroine seems to be able to keep her clothes on throughout the entire film and that while it has lots of blood and gore, another influence evident in Kill Bill, it is not too overdone.
But because it's silly don't jump to the conclusion that there isn't a point to watching it.
But the story is one of the best I've ever witnessed, and not because of the blood and guts.
She is terrified by a "popper" because it causes her to "relive" the sound of bullets, the smell of gunpowder and the sight of blood - her parents' blood.
The device of having a husband apparently die (but in actuality refuse to return home because of his "broken" condition) provides ample opportunity for sentimentality.
Yet it is inevitable to compare the two films when one has seen both, simply because Tarantino copied so many aspects of this one.
"Hannity and Colmes" a news program that most people dislike, but I disagree with them I like it because it presents both sides of the story.
While Sean Hannity I respect because he doesn't hide anything he makes no bones about it he's a flat out right wing republican!
Colmes is weak - not because he's liberal, but because he's just weak.
I've been thinking that liberals seem indecisive and waffly because they are willing to listen to reason and a good argument where the conservatives think that they know everything and that nothing ever changes.
Alan Colmes is somewhat ineffectual as a foil for Sean Hannity, primarily because his views are emotionally based, and cannot stand against vile things like Reason, and Cause and Effect.
Claiming because a show has a rightward tilt somehow it is an indication of a Neo-Nazi take over of America.
Financially I just don't have a clue what is trying to be accomplished by doing all these (Hell I won't even call it a B-movie because that would be a compliment) D movies in the first place!
I would love to know what the death toll was for Supergator, because once the beast starts eating folks it doesn't stop.
Its main problem is that the writers have apparently mistaken premise for plot - although it (sort of) makes sense that the Supergator is there (because Kelly McGillis's company made it from a fossil), and that the volcanologists are there looking at the volcano, and that a variety of red-t-shirted and bikini-clad teens are there... that's not *plot*.
It's not just because the film has gutter-level humour and is relentlessly crude.
It's not just because it's technically inept and cheap, with 'outside' scenes obviously filmed on interior sets.
And it's not just because a good cast and director is wasted on such a filthy, demeaning film.
30 minutes in I was horrified--I was going to turn it off but I kept it on because this DOES have a cast of well-known actors.
Quite how then he created such an incredibly offensive movie then is a matter to ponder over and only worth considering because of the director's fame.
I think the film promotes a stereotypical view of sadomasochism and vice in general, and because it is apologist and even sympathetic in it's approach to the immorality and more importantly extreme irresponsibility of the police officers, I would call it a truly Fascist movie.
Maybe it was because it came out at the time when punk had just happened.
I was a great Hill Street fan (still am), but it was sanitized for TV, and much less like the real thing because of needing to maintain a plot line.
it will make you want to scream and shout while your playing because it is so scary.
Definitely not for the weak hearted and if your a fan of the series well then i suggest you get a copy of this fast because it was very hard to get mine believe me.
she gets home to find her dad killed and finds that the crazy lady had something do with it so she decides to investigate what is really going on by visiting Silent Hill and also at the same time find out the truth about her "burning" past  -this game is pretty much a sequel to the first game with a lot of the characters from that game appearing in this which makes for a really great story because in it's own confusing way it actually helps the story from the first game make a little bit of sense.
The problems come in the combat...a weakness for all Silent Hill games, you often get damaged and killed less because of your skill and more for the camera angles.
I enjoy bad horror movies, because they are often funny.
I just checked it out randomly because I thought the female swordsperson angle might be interesting, but I had no real expectations.
This is another case in which the restoration job is fully appreciated because the forest colors are magnificent.
I've read that the region 2 'HHOH' looks like new because it's been remastered - unlike the region 1 release.
This is were Kill Bill was born and Kill Bill was as good as it was because it was already ripping off an truly excellent film.
I could keep this review very short really, because all I want to say is: watch it for yourself!
This movie may seem incredibly long to most of you and I'm sure that many people will never watch it, just because of the length.
Perhaps it is because I'm so interested in Italy and everything that ever happened there, perhaps it is because I'm a great admirer of the European cinema.
The reason why this is so effective is because we are as perplexed by his seemingly irrational behavior as are the loved ones who so often become the unwitting victims of it.
The final scenes of "The Best of Youth" are tremendously moving and exhilarating simply because we feel as if we have truly come to know these people as individuals and will miss them when they're gone.
On the beginning you have a man with great enthusiasm, then he gets more serious because of his job and his middle ages, an then later...
Maybe this is a personal effect because of the wonderful scenario.
because of the plot.
It's hard to make people age 40 years in one movie, I know, so, director, you have my respect for Adriana, because she really ages perfectly, although when you look carefully, you do see she's only in her 30s instead of her 70s... :)
At no time during this film was I bored, because such attention is made to character development, script, and cinematography.
There's also a bit of cheesy makeup and blue screen, but that can be excused because this is really a TV production, as I understand it, not a big movie.
After like, half an hour, I didn't want to stop watching any more, because the movie started turning out to be quite nice.
I was reluctant to go to see this film, because of its length -6 hours!
Suddenly, seemingly because Life or Time heals but maybe just so the filmmaker could resolve things for us, nearly everyone meets everyone.
Matteo's so ever-present, and all the more so as the film progresses, in no small part because of Giorgia's obsession, that that bit of magic realism offended me as a viewer.
Actually, you can't call it a movie because it's much more than that, it is a kind of mini-series.
I say the film is stupid because it reduces a very complex situation down to ridiculous platitudes.
I fear people will think it's true just because it's a documentary.
The film smugly claims there is an inherent shallowness in the American public because at the time of the Rwandan killings we were more interested in the O. J. trial to pay attention to anything else.
I've watched both previous movies on the Rwandan genocide, but this documentary hit home the hardest because, instead of showing the gut-wrenching and sensational time of killings, it brings to light the inaction of the rest of the world and the reasoning behind it.
What these men did, they did because they were human, not because the devil tapped them on the shoulder.
Like the ancient mariner, he tells his tale because he must.
Yes, the US naturally comes under heavier scrutiny than other member nations because we have so much more to offer and have so much more influence.
Whatever the reason may be - no resources or interests, an attempt to pacify mutual allies, or simple apathy because it's 'not a Western problem', it fills me with anguish to see the results.
In Darfur it's the same situation - the UN doesn't want to intervene, so they swamp their investigation and reports in red tape, mainly because China has oil contracts with the Sudanese government and Russia has sold arms to them.
In another fantastic documentary, "Born into Brothels," one of the children says something to the effect of "I like this picture, though it is sad, we have to look at it because that is the way she lives and it is truth."
This story proves even more compelling because it is between a female and a male who impersonates a female on stage.
Clarendon was a faithful and loyal supporter of the Stuart house and went into exile because of his loyalty.
Shame, because it's just great!!
I say this because the central element of the story has been described as unbelievable or unconvincing by some critics.
If I were a high school drama teacher, this would be required viewing for my students because of its historical and theatrical qualities.
This girl loved to be in the theatre, but could not, because only men were allowed.
Thoroughly enjoyable because of Richard Eyre's direction and eye for detail.
Well don't, because it also happens to make a highly successful transition from stage to screen thanks to the genius that is director Richard Eyre.
If you look at the mother in the beginning when she just finds out her son is ill and dying, you can see that she is in no condition to let go, especially because she has no source of comfort with her husband just having cheated on her.
Not because of her son, but perhaps even unknownst to him, because healing her is going to require more from him than he's ever given before.
It's brilliantly written, because it challenges what we think we know about dying, and living.
It's just as well The Pagan was shot as a silent, because it it had been a talkie, the camera would have been nailed down, the sound hissy and distracting, and the melodramatic excess of the plot overemphasized.
The reason for these two short sequences is probably because the film was filmed "on location" in the Pacific.
Physically he is more beautiful than any man has a right to be, but his beauty also comes from within because he projects a warmth and humanity that few actors can convey.
"Tomorrow is Forever" is interesting because of Orson Welles' appearance as the supposedly dead husband that returns under a different disguise.
This is a heartwarming story of the reconciliation of three generations of women come together because of the terminal illness of the 30yr old grandson.  
If you liked Star Wars, He Man and the Masters of the Universe or Queens Flash Gordon soundtrack then catch this movie on cable because they ripped them all off and did a very bad job of it.
At one scene Yor changes tactics he performs a axe block, this is very surprising because at this point the Viewer might believe with an axe swinger you will be able to conquer the whole world;) .
The sets are most of the time boring, few are good(indicates that some guys on the set knew their job ;)   I recommend this movie to all the trash movie fans out there, but even to Hollywood fanatics with their good film chatter to watch and learn, because its a difference to create a "pro made" 200 million dollar trash film or to create the one and only "Yor" Film which surely has the best trash style ever seen on screen ;)
Even more funny is the fact, that the Actor of Yor must have been very happy to be in this movie ... because he smiles like an idiot directly into the camera in nearly every stupid scene.
If you don't want to watch this movie, maybe it's enough to watch just the trailer... because everything mentioned is shown in it.
Ms. Holland's film is complicated, in that it asks the viewer to think about how Julie's actions to save Nick, her young son, stricken with a rare cancer, clash with the medical science because she goes with her instincts instead, when she takes the boy to be seen by a folk "healer" in Poland.
It engrosses the viewer because Ms. Holland knows where she is taking us.
because it's so damn funny.
I wanted to see YOR because of its title.
I say mutated, because they are quite simply like no dinosaurs I have ever seen, and react like no creatures I have ever heard of.
This one had me intrigued on the outset because I had never seen a work of Chan's before- he's won many awards but is not as well-known a cult director as the his other contemporaries here- and by film's end he had me for quite a loop.
It's surely the most depraved and intentionally "oh-my-God" type of short horror films one's likely to see in the years to come, mainly because it takes on a very basic and over-done topic, vanity, and is cooked up (no pun intended) with human beings' attachment to new life.
Mainly because, as Bai Ling's character demonstrates, it's so useful a old-age-prevention to eat aborted fetuses in dumpling form, as the main character, a former TV star who's worried about being appealing to her husband.
This probably has the least depth, emotionally and psychologically, of the three films, mainly because Chan is far more interested in getting the audience repulsed by what's going on.
It helps that the extra, played by Won Hie Lim, is great at the part because there's no real sense of humor to him, but he still ends up being funny, like when he dances to that song from one of the Director's films.
Atmosphere this time trumps perversity, though it still applies that Miike's film is a work that will be probably more haunting because of the complexities to how Kyoko faces what's happened to her sister Soko.
It doesn't work, because for the most part these J-horror films aren't so much about gore or violence.
A woman who feels old and ugly because of her adulterous husband will pay anything and do anything to look younger.
Too bad it doesn't really have much more to it than that, because honestly once you get over the initial "gut" reaction, there's not much more to care about... no spectacular cinematography, nothing really amazing in performances... no real reason to be a movie as opposed to a photograph, a written story, a bad tale told over candlelight.
Too bad that theme isn't really developed much more than just being there, because again, this film has a little bit less in terms of cinema.
In conclusion i felt it deserved an eight because of its acting, Cinematography, Direction and the conceptual aspects.
Otherwise you'll probably yawn and feel gypped because they don't scare you out of your skin.
I want to seek out more of his work, but am hesitant because it hasn't impressed all that much.
In all honesty I must admit I enjoyed "Box" the least, mainly because the complete change in tone and filming style came too unexpectedly.
Over all I give this film 7 out of 10, manly because of the first two films, they each got you involved with the characters and had a great ending, the third made me drop the score by a couple of marks, if they had 'Dumplings' as there final piece I would have enjoyed this film a lot more, a good thing about the films is the length of them, as some of the times you may not have the time to watch a two hour feature you can choose to just watch one of the stories and turn it off afterwards.
I preferred BOX the least because it was the most slow and plodding, and it was the one I could make the least sense of.
I wish I could speak the languages of the films because the English translation detracted from the emotional content and context.
Not because of gore or anything like that, but because of the subject matter.
I had to watch several parts of each movie over again after I finished the first viewing, because it's pretty hard to figure out what the hell's going on with one viewing.
I don't want to give details on the plots of any of them because I think that viewers need to experience them for themselves with no preconceptions going in, but what I can say is that "Dumplings" has the most plot and is probably the one with the highest "squeam" factor, "Cut" covers a rather familiar premise but with lots of fun moments (you'll see) and "Box" is more of an artistic endeavour with not much of a plot, but for some reason I was enthralled and couldn't look away; it's the one I liked the most.
A cop who uses all his force to enforce the law and who discovers Â for us Â because he knows, that the main opposition to that kind of police force and police work is not so much the people who want security, or the press who only look for sensational news items and strong police work is good news, but the politicians who are moved not by principles but by a bunch of minority groups who are so vocal that they can cover the noise of a hurricane if they so decide.
The films has gotten a new interest today because these pseudo Maoist and pseudo anarchist groups have become one of the most dangerous plagues of this world today?
It is easy to compare this film, with the two previous Dirty Harry movies, because there some things have (still) not changed.
It is not a decent or good film film, but it gets very close, mainly because of the good acting and the fact that the film remained interesting for the despite it's downsides.
After the shootout, where Will Hutchins' character bungles part of it because he hesitates, he actually has a line where he shakes his head after looking at the carnage Harry has wrought and says, "I've never shot a man", whereby Harry looks at him in disgust and says something to the effect of "Help out with the customers, will ya?"
I remember Hutchins because I hadn't really seen him since Merrill's Marauders and Sugarfoot and happened across this in the IMDb.
It was that bad and I would highly recommend that people do not see it because it's a total waste of time.
But they had better think again; because when they took down Frank, they inadvertently provoked the ire of Inspector Callahan himself, who does not take kindly to their sort to begin with.
That's not to say it was bad or felt out of place, because it didn't with the feel that this one opted for.
It is easy to compare this film, with the two previous Dirty Harry movies, because there some things have (still) not changed.
It is not a decent or good film film, but it gets very close, mainly because of the good acting and the fact that the film remained interesting for the despite it's downsides.
Clint Eastwood is now on some dead end assignment in the San Francisco PD because he's once again offended someone powerful.
Naturally, it's not as powerful and dramatic as the first of the series, because, once again naturally, sequels are difficult to make.
It is a must see, simply because I can't thing of any reason why this was made, or why anything in the future will be so...
It's a good thing that film lasts as long as it does, because they no longer make many comedies as successful as this one.
I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.
That's probably because they're not into REAL horror films, or B-movies in general!
Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "Dr. No" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character.
I'll have no laughter in the courtroom," says the deadpan judge, but in fact the scenes in the courtroom deliver the only laughs in this movie, because they deliver the only breaths of fresh, honest air in the script.
Not only would we suffer dire consequences at that time, but our children would also suffer hideous deformities because of our ruined DNA and we would forever be at risk of having a flashback at a most inopportune time.
If you really love Abbott and Costello, then you will probably really want to see this movie, because you might like it, but if you are not a fan of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon, then you will probably not like this movie, but I like Abbott and Costello, and so I did like this movie!
He comes from a broken home - his mother died when he was young, and his father married a much younger woman - and has next to no emotional connection with his long-suffering girlfriend, Sera, who leaves him because he just won't talk to her.
But if the violence is primarily what people talk about after seeing the film then that would be a real crime because the film is packed full of wonderful moments of real human emotion.
Watch it because although in time the movie is considered cheesy it was what I call a horror movie!
Sid Haig is fun as always and completely steals the show but apart from him there is not a single character here who the audience will feel strongly for or against simply because they are all 1 dimensional stock standards played in the fashion of a high school drama class.
...And it's not because of the B-grade gore!
I just watched it and it probably feels that way because the entire movie is just a pastiche of cult horror... All I can say is that I REALLY HOPE that The Devil's Rejects is better than this, because this movie probably ranks amongst the 10 worst movies I have ever seen (and don't worry, it isn't worse than The Abyss).
All in all this movie is yet another movie of the times, yet don't dismiss it because of the violence; dismiss it because it just isn't that good!
Even on second glance, "House of 1,000 Corpses" is awful, simply because form and narrative is jettisoned for a near-endless string of abrasively avant-garde camera techniques (loud color filters, cut scenes that come out of nowhere, aged-down video quality, negative filters, split screen, etc.)
chosen because...well, "they look cool," I guess.
I can't understand who is actually letting Rob Zombie (a rock singer or whatever he is) to direct this piece of crap, because he is even worse horror movie director than famous "Ed Wood".
But there is a lot of people out there, who are having a fresh ideas, but they can't show it to the world because they don't have the connections in Hollywood or entertainment industry.
You have a feeling like Zombie is filling us with violence because he doesn't have no idea how to develop a story.
: There is no spoilers in my comment, because I was watching this movie for about 15. minutes.
There are some quality jump scares and enough horror to go around for allÂ· Some people seem to go into this movie having already decided their not going to be scared and their not going to like it because Zombie made itÂ· Admittedly, I didn't like Zombie's attempt to remake Halloween.
Okay realism is something I truly look for in a horror film(along with characters and story structure), because it seems to me that if a horror film(of any kind) can in some way be portrayed very realistic to even a not so realistic situation than it has more potential to scare people like me.
I borrowed this from a friend because I was curious.
This is clearly one of the dumbest films I 've ever seen and surely the dumbest I've seen this year and that's only because I haven't seen any Uwe Boll disaster so far this year.
I don't mind downbeat endings, sometimes I find them preferable, but this ending just took the cake, I think mostly because it wasn't presented as a downbeat ending, again, I get the feeling that RZ views this as a happy ending.
I have to ask because it seems that I'm not a true horror movie fan if I don't like this movie.
The acting was so bad I almost left the room, the gory violence was WAY too much, and it only seemed that way because it was quite fake.
Despite or because of such incongruities, "Casino Royale" is a fascinating glimpse at giving birth to a 1960s icon a decade too soon.
They are either brain dead or dead at the core... because not being touched by the events strung together here is really not paying attention to the film or to the current state of things.
I can't say I recommend this for any reason, because it's not even "so bad it's good", it's just bad.
I'm referring of course, to the mother's meeting with the bombers son, which was of course, the completely logical conclusion of the journalists' actions, which themselves were borne out of a desire to win the mother back, which was totally understandable because of his guilt and her being highly attractive AND a damsel in distress, too.
Mommyyyyy..... Mommy indeed, because the director needs her mommy to spank her a bit and teach her some brains.
Go and watch it and try to put yourself into the story, because weather you like it or not, you ARE part of it.
In fact, one is tempted to say that all films with terrorism backgrounds should be directed by women, because they are not tempted as men are to dwell on all the violence for its own sake.
But not because of her grieving for her lost family.
A pity, because it does have some potential.
It does make me sad that I found this film so unenjoyable, because it was obvious that the director was very nervous and had put her soul and time into it's making.
The profound isolation of the family is shortly to come to an end, because one of those California coastal highways is being constructed, with much dynamiting, landslides, and convict labour with picks on the obdurate rocks.
The film is worth a look because of Ida Lupino.
And what a shame, because this is a remarkably vivid, extremely well produced effort, featuring a typically marvelous performance from the so called "poor man's Bette Davis" Ida Lupino - her last as a Warner Brothers star.
But it doesn't matter that these elements got recycled, because Deep Valley is a really watchable 90 minutes of Hollywood melodrama.
I saw it way before it came out because my friend Geoff has a small role in the film.
Â But despite-or possibly because of these facts-I found HELLGATE to be oddly enjoyable.
Make sure you are in the mood for a fun cheesefest, because Mutant is certainly a remarkable one!!!
That's because he was smart, and smart is sexy.
I think if ever a movie makes a good argument for the potential of cinema, "Lot in Sodom" is a good film to turn to because it so well manifests an understood story in a whole new form very different from what we accept as generic narrative form today.
I was curious to know about any censor issues with this film because their is a lot of eroticism with the young male dancers and some bare buttocks, as well as an extremely voluptuous statue of a female torso(at least I think it was a statue).
I wondered if such a graphic image passed the censors because the story was biblical?
I cried when Obama won the election, because I felt like it was a win for MY side.
I have wondered if it is possible to make a new version with the same respect for youngsters who take life serious but make it a joy because real love has that power... joy in life.
OK, so let's take this weird looking nebbish and cast his as the hero - OK, fine - go against type - but the script was written for an obvious stud because ALL the women in the movie flirt and gush over him.
I watched it because I thought that Jeff Goldblum, being a star, would pick good projects.
Biberman is thrown in prison because he and his wife, actress Gale Sondergaard (Greta Scacchi) refuse to "name names" of communist friends.
Sondergaard, who has been unable to find work for years because of her husband, is very upset by this, but continues to stand by her husband.
Not because Herbert had any love for Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union but believed, unrealistically, that Communisum was the only way that those hundreds of millions exploited by the big corporations can get their share of the wealth that they provided for them with their hard and back-breaking labor which they got paid next to nothing for.
This was shot down by whomever their adviser was because asking about anyone's political leadings is unconstitutional, and the Ten wanted to fight the hearings on constitutional grounds.
(I swear they hired Abigail Wolcott to play "Josie" because she had nice legs...She even "strikes poses" while being carried away and raped! )
It certainly was an eye opening insight into the judging, because I came away with sense that these judges were certainly not qualified to be in that position.
I was genuinely surprised just how good this film was, because I had heard so little about it.
But it's not quite as satisfying as "The Body Snatcher" on the same Burke/Hare theme because it doesn't engage the dark undertones of the human psyche through its sadistic "graverobbers" as much as the Karloff film, but instead dwells more on the scientific ethics issues.
If you saw this on video or TV, you might want to give it a second look (like I did) on DVD because it looks a whole lot better.
I think it is more because of the fact that Cushing and Pleasance are in this, that people consider this a horror movie.
Cushing as the cold, logical doctor who abandons emotion because it just gets in the way of his work, and Pleasence as cruel scoundrel Hare are both chilling in their own way.
This film should be quite an interesting pairing with the 1987 film, "The Doctor and the Devils" because both films deal with the same themes yet change in certain ways.
In "Flesh" there's a positive outlook for Knox who comes to the understanding of what he was doing wrong because he had abandoned any emotion when it came to accepting any corpse those two brought him only thinking about science and leaving away the conscience.
While the Lewton movie was marvelous and horrifying, this one seems worth seeing as well because it is more realistic and unflinching (with some very brutal murders), plus it sticks much closer to the facts and mirrors the real decisions in the courts.
Rose is the dummy who gets hanged because he didn't know how to play "the prisoner's dilemma" to his best advantage.
It's odd, because despite the greatness of the other film; The Flesh and the Fiends is a lot better, and has the added malevolence of being based on a true-life story.
Still, the escalation of the tragedy is truthfully illustrated with Burke and Hare getting into the body-snatching business coincidentally at first, but quickly specializing in it because of the good cash money and eventually even converting to murder in order to deliver the most 'quality'.
Maybe because it's not a Hammer production or maybe because the substance was considered controversial for a long period of time.
I watched this movie last night - largely because of all the little people in the cast.
".But she has good reason for butchering six people: they all commited a crime that no one understands, like dumping her daughter, eating poultry (because Beverly loves birds),smart-alacing about her dentist husband, refusing to rewind a rental tape, critisizing about her family skills, and witnessing one of the other five crimes.You may think she's insane, but really, she's just expressing things we'd rather hide inside of us.Like, say you work in a store and someone wants to return something but they don't have the recipt.It can't be returned without the recipt, so you tell them "No can do".Then they start cursing you out like you're worthless.Wouldn't you get the urge to shove a bullet in their brain?Well then, you now know how Beverly Sutphin feels when someone decides to be a wise guy.This movie is perfect for anyone who loves to laugh.Plus, the DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, several TV spots, four interview clips, and extra behind the scenes footage.I give this one a 10/10!
I really enjoyed this movie because Kathleen Turner and John Waters just let loose with the demented psychotic energy of a parent who takes many legitimate parental urges to the next level - or maybe the next 5 levels.
I gave it a 7 rather than something higher because the action around her is okay but delivered more as a set-up for her various exercises in family values, and the plot itself doesn't seem driven by anything other than her proclivities for a particular problem solving approach.
This is one crazy house wife that you don't want to be a rude kid or adult because she will find you and hunt you down till you are dead.Man this was the best movie that I have seen that is based on true events that is horror that I know and love.This b****Y mom was finally on the louse and insane to kill people that are rude,dressed badly,and anyone that messes with her family,any jokes.And when she went to court was really when she became wild and made each eyewitness into trouble.She is using facts about them and her body to make them crack.And very funny when the judge was flirting with Suzanne Somers when she came in the Court.And lastly,great ending when she kill a woman for wearing   white after Labor Day.And that jury woman taught she was innocent right from the beginning,can you believe this damn woman.And she kills when she was just set free and kill,very stupid thing to do and stupider was the jury setting her free.Now she will continue her work,make a part two Mr.
Beverly secretly starts a series on phone harassments and vulgar letter to fellow neighbor Dottie just because she stole her parking space.
Stubbins, who suggests that Chip is in need of "therapy" because of his love of horror films, is the sort of arrogant, self-important teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives, down to their taste in films.
We don't know how long she's been killing, but the first half of the film follows a week in her life and the various neighbors and acquaintances she dispatches simply because they pi$$ her off.
Who else but Waters could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death with a slab of pork chop (because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns it to the video store) while watching a videotape of "Annie"?
If you like Waters' latest irreverent venture into visceral, cutting black humour, then get all his other movies, because they are all even more extreme and grotesque - "Pink Flamingos", "Hairspray", "Cry Baby" - all kitschy, underrated classics in their own right.
I completely understand the plot it goes like this :  - Girl without memory has face changed for some reason - The police changed her memory - She changed her face because she did a drug rip-deal - Here brother likes to kill people who look like her - Actually she is a Turkish terrorist - Jean reno is involved in something - The turks kill another group of turks in a bath filled with mint  Then it gets better :  - The girl is a ninja - The drugs are in an enormous cave filled with death people - The case collapses and Reno is death - No he is not death  Never mind all that the end is amazing :  - Reno, the cop, the girl, the brother all end up in Turkey - At the same time of course, the whole France police force is also there - The girl kills here father - The cop, reno and the police kill everyone else in the village - The serial killer brother tries to serial kill the girl  The best thing about this movie however is the final end :  - Switch of DVD player, throw disk in bin, and sue the french for wasting your time.
The "scientist" finds a trace of henna in her finger nails, and he concludes that she is a Turk, because that particular henna is grown in Anatolia.
A lot of ''serious'' film critics consider the ''New French Cinema''(with Luc Besson as the biggest exponent)as an artistic prostitution which destroys Godard's,Truffaut's and Rohmer's legacy.I have to say I appreciate a lot that kind of movies because they take the Hollywood's clichÃ©s and they give them ''new life''.In other words,films like Dobermann,La Femme Nikita and The Crimson Rivers take the typical clichÃ©s but,in the hands of talented directors and screenwriters,they take ''new life'' so the final result is something innovative.L'Empire des Loups is another example of what I just mentioned.This film adapts the North American clichÃ©s to the French style and the result is a very entertaining and interesting thriller with a lot of energy.Director Chris Nahon and his screenwriters(Nahon is also one of them)do not stop in giving too much explanations in this movie,so the spectator has to pay a lot of attention.And I really appreciated that as the best element from this movie.I'm tired of the Hollywood movies which explain everything thinking the spectator is stupid.Nahon and his screenwriters trust that the spectator will be enough intelligent for taking out conclusions.This film always keeps the suspense and there are some really unexpected revelations.The fail I found on this movie was that,near the ending of the film,there's an imbalance.I mean,this film has a mysterious noir style and near the ending,the film suddenly becomes in an action film with explosions,chases and shootings.That parts are fun and exciting for themselves but they seem like out of place.In spite of that,L'Empire des Loups is a very entertaining and tense thriller that I totally recommend.
The reason I am giving Empire of The Wolves a strong 8, instead of a pure 10, is because of the scientific mumbo jumbo.
Still not to worry because this film is so awful it`s nearly good .
the only reason i watched the whole movie was because i expected a good ending at least.
and the ending was a twist(i won't say right now)  i recommend this movie for anybody who enjoys movies that don't follow the set pattern of hollywood(the guy gets the girl, the good guy always wins, the bad guy dies, all i good at the end) i AM going to go out and buy this movie(not just because Rachael Leigh Cook is in it, although it is a very good reason to)
From the beginning it can't seem to find what it really wants to do, which is unfortunate because it's a kind of interesting premise...but only 'kind of', which dooms it from the outset when coupled with its lacking script and subpar acting.
This is a serious shame because the premise could have been very suspenseful, but it wasn't even remotely realised.
It's not because of any religious undertones (although those are botched too), but instead because of the extremely regrettable fact that this script was not anywhere near as engaging as it should have been.
You'll clap your hand when the titles get there: not because the movie was good, but because it's finally over.
I say this because, it's just not horrific.
!Âif you're worried about real-world plausibility, if you're not going to like a film because of a lack of real-world believability, then why the heck would you be watching a film about Satan?!
The question is whether The Eighteenth Angel succeeds as a kind of dark fairy tale--that's essentially what the horror genre is, with the exception of psycho/serial killer films (and those count as horror because they're "monsters"; they just happen to be real life monsters).
The Eighteenth Angel has some stylistic resemblance to The Omen (1976), which shouldn't be surprising because David Seltzer, the scripter, also wrote that earlier staple of the genre.
This is where the movie gets interesting on the legal field because it shows topics like the lawyer's professional privacy about his clients, rape, testimonies, murder, etc.
Watch this movie and you won't regret it because it's a solid drama with likable characters, great acting, and most of all, it's entertaining and very believable.
Joe had found out that these women would not be believed in a court of law, if they chose to press charges against him, because they were already proved to be lairs before so why would not a jury feel that there lying now.
The film is interesting to watch because it's not the typical Movie of the Week type.
"The Advocate's Devil" will not disappoint because the quick pace and credible story.
Jones is indeed superb, and though the premise is somewhat far-fetched, it is not important, because the drama remains.
The question should be asked does the race of the President require that no criticism be cast on his (or her)actions,that no honest and fair debate be held, or that all policies be acquiesced to just because of race.
To how much of an extent that was the fault of the original work by Miller and how much was due to the changes by the screenwriters it's impossible for me personally to judge because I'm not familiar with the material.
Larry, the "missing pilot", had planned to marry "Ann Deever", who's father was Keller's business partner, who went to prison while "Joe Keller",(Robinson) was acquitted of any wrong doing at the trial because he was home sick.
I was afraid to relate to her because she was so believable.
During World War II Joe started bidding for government contracts and he was making good money until American pilots started having problems with their aircraft and many pilots were killed because of faulty parts.
But during World War II it became a big issue because of the huge government contracts that Washington set up for the war effort.
Robeson was over in the United Kingdom at the time because he could not get the kind of film roles he wanted in the USA with America hung up on stereotypical blacks.
Though the film is a salute to the judiciousness and fairness of British colonial role, Robeson took the part because I believe it gave him a chance to show the real Africa.
Sanders Of The River though incredibly dated should be seen quite frankly because of that.
But then, you don't expect subtlety from a story by Edgar Wallace, who many blamed for the collapse of peace talks during the Boer War because of his salacious invented newspaper stories of Boer atrocities.
OK,this is a resume of the entire movie,because this movie is probable one of the worst movies ever seen,not for his special effects it for his awful script.. i resume:this movie is about the NATO mission in kosovo,its about a soldiers of Spanish engineers corp., the film start whit him trying to rescue a Serb hostage,but wen he arrives,he don't shot he see how the hostage is executed with a plastic bag but he don't do anything,he is hitting by a weaponless mens and have more brainless scenes, 1ÂºIn the mission and stupid french commander decided to shot some kosovars refugees,(but kosovars militants of elk were the NATO allies).
I rated it 7, partly because there were some concepts I had not seen in movies previously.
I think that fortunately spanish cinema is evolving from the obscure era of the "destape" (the first movies that were made after the death of Franco were known like this because most of them were light porn films) and from Almodovar's large shadow.
But finally they get in trouble with the kosovar guerrilla because of the acts of a french captain and almost every french and many spanish die.
A disaster because every lieutenant on every army knows how to manage a situation like this; that's why they're lieutenant and not soldiers, platoons never go along the path, and in anyway, all together to give a clear objective to an average shooter.
That's because they were trained partly by the spanish army and they taught them some things :)  Despite of the military mistakes, it's very entertaining and superb in FX, at least for spanish cinema.
I really wish I could give this show -10 stars because this show will crush childhood dreams.
Characters of the show: Billy- He was a neighborhood boy who doesn't remember anything because he doesn't have a brain, Well, he has a brain right now!
Grim is great because he is more like an extremely old, six foot tall Yoda always helping the kids, hmm?
A happy-go-lucky boy named Billy (Richard Steven Horvitz) and a cynical girl named Mandy (Grey DeLisle) own the Grim Reaper (Greg Eagles) because they won a limbo match against him (the bet was placed over the soul of Billy's pet hamster).
One of the reasons why the show is so funny is because it depicts the Grim Reaper as a childish, washed-up individual.
Another reason is because the only intelligent human in the show is Mandy, while everyone else is either stupid or insane.
The only reason why I don't give this a perfect 10 is because there are a few flaws to the show.
I remember dying to have a pair of Adidas because of them.
When they recorded the movie I was just a baby because I'm born in 1988.
I was a bit touched by his passionate "Puck" performance, but it was confusing because his dad walks in during the performance, and you're thinking "his dad finally accepted him", but no his insensitive dad drags him home, where his son eventually kills himself that same night.
So in that respect, Emperor's Club was even worse than DPS, because the basic premise that "men of honor" ruled the world of long ago is flawed, whereas in DPS, Prof Keating acknowledges the chaotic passion in poetry, and tries not to moralize as much as instill his students with the same romantic passion great poets felt.
It's a constant reminder to "make your life extraordinary," because often, we all get caught up in the daily routine of life and what "we're supposed to be doing" and we forget to live life to its fullest.
His students love him because he teaches them to squeeze and suck the day, "carpe diem".
In this movie we can watch pretty good performances;emphasizing one or two of them would be unfair because they all are incredible,however I can say I consider Robin William's performance in this film the best of all his filmography.
This film changes the audiences lives and make them feel into the film,because they talk about problems and subjects present in our society and make the audience think deeply about them as well as Mr Keating does in the film.After seen it everybody wants to "be more",and you feel you can "be more" if you simply "SEIZE YOUR DAY".
I completely agree with that message because there's no coming back and time flies.
Besides this incredible teacher, other great characters are: Neil Perry, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, Todd Anderson and even Richard Cameron (although he has the power to anger us at the end because of his attitude).
this is a movie i saw with the 5th floor back in the day when it came out at the drive in .... some of the scenes in the movie stuck in my head some 30 years later until i tracked down a 15.00 copy off ebay... re-watched it and now I'm not taunted to find it anymore but do not regret getting this nostalgic scary cult classic... worth the watch BUT you must keep in mind that you have to put yourself in the year it came out to watch it not the year were in... that way you can fully appreciate the special effects that were 'from' the day not today.. because they obviously don't compare... well its definitely worth finding... pay for the copy not original that can run you 200+ dollars from places that actually still have a few... thats all... enjoy...
Which would be just fine except that they seem to be telling each other these stories because they don't have anything else to talk about.
One of the college dorms used for one of the story segments is rumored to be haunted, and maverick wunderkind Quentin Tarentino has championed the movie, supposedly owning his own print which he screens for people who don't know any better than to go do something else just because it's Quentin Tarentino showing it.
Im sure some of it is my youth perspective in 1979 but I think its in the class of something like Legend of Boggy Creek which is a classic because it brought something new though campy as all heck.
Granted it is not the best film to come out of Hollywood, but that's because it did not come from Hollywood.
Perhaps it's because I came in with bottom-of-the-barrel expectations for a movie I've heard absolutely nothing good about, but I found myself enjoying "O.C.
and Stiggs of the title) spending one summer terrorizing an affluent, middle class family because the patriarch (played with just the right amount of buffoonery by Paul Dooley), head of an insurance company, has denied insurance for O.C.
The film begins with the only witness against the head of this organized crime ring practically crawling out of his skin because he's so worried about being killed before he can testify in court.
Turkus was an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn who became known to the mob as Mr. Arsenic because of his incorruptibility and ability to convict organized crime figures.
The criminal in question was the head of a group of contract killers who carried out murders to order and avoided detection because their operatives never had any connection with their victims and so there were never any known motives or obvious leads for the authorities to follow up in their investigations.
The ending is a bit anti-climatic only because it wraps up so quickly after all the tension and flashbacks have reached the anticipated moment of the "pay-off", so I rate it a 9 out of 10.
DeCorsia is the main character because all roads lead to him as the number two guy, but only he can finger Sloane.
Taking place between parallel dimensions of a colour-saturated Wild West and contemporary Bangkok, Tears of the Black Tiger is a moving 3D postcard of retro-camp kitsch, and because of this, the sudden explosions of (literally) teeth shattering violence are all the more outrageous.
Maybe it is because my expectations were too high that I'm a tad disappointed now I've finally seen it.
To conclude, this is a movie I recommend to see, not only because otherwise you'll never be able to boast you have seen a Thai western Âwhich is always a strange thing to seeÂ but also because is an entertaining movie with a couple of fine touches of comedy .
It is hard to describe or categorize this movie, because it crosses over so many categories.
It may be because I had no idea that Thailand made western films in the 1960s, let alone seen any of them, that this film proved rather effective.
I really wish the filmmakers had been more sincere with the material, because the winking at the camera prevents one from being truly lost in the dreamlike style.
So because of that she is married off to a policeman, but this doesn't stop Dum from trying to get in contact with her, even if something always gets in between them.
Sadly because of the style being the film's main strong hold, the story had to fall by the wayside, really.
The storyline isn't a linear one, because we explore into our protagonist's past midway through the flick, looking at why he became an outlaw and how important this girl has been in his life.
I kept asking myself if I was watching a cartoon and that's definitely because of the look, but also the performances.
I gave this movie a 2 rating and that is only because of the abortion that followed it deserves a lower mark.
I remember when this movie came out and my parents took me to Sea World because they had all the props out used in the movie...I was embarrassed to even be in a picture with that stupid looking shark.
I saw it in the theater with my sister when it came out and the only thing that was worth the money was the 3-D effects...this crap was on TV and I feel the need to vent because it's 2 hours of my life that are gone forever.
She is frustrated because not only did she lose her job but her uncle and father are so lazy that everyone expects her to support them.
this is an excellent film that most have never heard of because it was made for TV (turner)and never shown in the theater.not much to add except that the film sheds light on the short and little known 1898 Spanish-American war which while trumped up by the media(newspaper publisher William Randolph Hurst played superbly by George Hamilton)catapulted the up until then isolationist united states on to the world stage for the first time and which gave the united states control of Spanish territories around the globe-Cuba,Puerto Rico the Philippines,wake island,Guam and the Marshall islands.and allowing the united states to flex its military might globally for the first time.there are some historical inaccuracies(such as the imperial German army advisor's aiding the Spanish, director john milius also made the turn of the century imperial Germans the bad guys in his 1975 film THE WIND AND THE LION in which Brian Keith played teddy Roosevelt as president during an international incident resolved by his big stick diplomacy-sending the marines.if you liked rough riders see the wind and the lion.
", because quite a few people told me it was so beautiful, poetic etc.
Maybe I didn't get it, because the acting is as terrible as always in German productions or the screenplay was just lousily written out.
I think this film is BEAUTIFUL (That's the better word to describe it) because it's made of small things and tries not to give a lesson or just entertain you for two hours, you will leave the cinema with your heart touched... No one had showed me Spain, the way Doris DÃ¶rrie did...
Plain, simple and yet astonishing... Perhaps I understood her because I come from a country that lives of small rituals like Spain does.
I'm not even getting into the nitty gritty of plots and characters because quite frankly this movie doesn't even deserve my time, effort or your money!
These natives sacrifice the crash survivors (of which there seem to be many more in movies and TV than in real life -- oh, I guess that's why they call it fiction) to the flying beasties because their presence keeps "him" (pseudo-Kong) away.
I gave this film a 3 / 10 because at least it was in focus, lit, audible and none of the actors stared at the camera or off-camera people.
Some characters have so little screen time that when their time comes you are baffled because you have no idea who they are or what the hell they were doing to warrant such a killing.
Then, suddenly, they stop because someone spots a plane crashed in the jungle (there are a surprisingly large number of nearly intact planes laying around) and they set the woman down on a rock where she sits for a moment.
She shouts for everyone to come because she found their plane!
And I guess a couple of days ago it had 5,8 rating because all the guys from the ending credits voted here.
I actually went out of my way to find this movie because I love giant monster movies, especially King Kong related monsters.
I recommend this to western fans with some patience because, as written, it takes a while for it to reach climax, but when it does, you won't forget you watched it.
William Holden is good in his role, though it's hard to always like him because of the stubbornness and seemingly lack of emotion of the character.
The film has exciting cavalry-Indian battle scenes, and the second clash is particularly novel in its execution because it is done by Indians.
He is disliked by his captors as well by his captives because of his displeasing behavior toward the escapees whom he invariably recaptures... A main example, dragging back to the fort John Lupton with a rope around his waist...  To Fort Bravo arrived, one morning, the talented, and beautiful Eleanor Parker (Carla) apparently for the wedding of a friend (Polly Bergen)...
But, if you have heart problems, I advise you to be wary, because it is so funny it could literally hurt youÂ.but wouldn't that be the best way to go?
I often say that silent films are not my favorite type, and I don't care for the silent Laurel and Hardy films like I do their early talkies, because I love hearing their verbal exchanges (especially Hardy's).
City Lights opens with some kind of weird talking so I enjoyed The Circus even more because it's the last silent film Chaplin made.
Maybe this is just me, but I really think that the parts of Chaplin's films where we see the tramp before the story has started going are generally some of the best parts, because we get quick looks at the tramp's personality Â what he does with himself when nothing's going on.
Note: The IMDb trvia page mentions that this is the only one of Chaplin's feature films not mentioned in his autobiography, because of "problems with the film, not the film itself."
I understand that his studio burned down during production and that he suffered a nervous breakdown during filming because of personal problems, but do any of his dissatisfactions have anything to do with the actual film?
Perhaps simply because it is in black and white, or it is without dialog it is a sad truth that great auteurs such as Chaplin and Buster Keaton have been mostly forgotten by today's moviegoers.
Ordinarily, I'd dismissed it as another black and white film because I was just a kid at that time.
It's kind of sad that Chaplin didn't really mention this film at all because I believe it is his finest film next to The Gold Rush.
Charlie Chaplin would again play The Little Tramp whose tried to escape from police because police believe that he steal someone's wallet, which he was falsely accused of.
I like this movie because it presents Chaplin in his prime: the 20's and 30's.
I don't know why I mentioned that, but I guess it's because I wanted to be facetious and have a spoiler alert.
But even when Gosling figures out how Hopkins did it, he cannot be tried twice, because of the double jeopardy law....  Who will have the last laugh?
I watched this film primarily because I believed Anthony Hopkins was going to star in it; instead, I would call Mr. Hopkins role more of a supporting costar.
Hopkins kills his wife with a well-thought out, yet highly unlikely plot, which is only believable because Hopkins' character is so intelligent.
But, at the same time, the plot is so unbelievable because Everything and I mean everything goes just as he has planned it.
Anyway, I am rating this movie a 7 of 10 because it was entertaining to see Hopkins act as the super smart bad guy again and to have Gosling match wits with him just as well as Jody Foster did.
I spent a lot of time criticizing this one fatal flaw, but overall I am still giving the movie a 7, because the rest of it (with the exception of the tepid romantic subplot) was so good and so effective.
The SFX and directing are obviously not going to be as great as the original because there is no Spielburg.
Just because you now have a different result doesn't make it a different crime.
But perhaps moreso because his character was the best drawn, the smartest, and the most emotionally complex.
Hopkins' was the character I was rooting for because Hopkins' was the only character with any depth, with more than a single dimension.
I give it six stars only because of the talented Mr. Hopkins.
For my part, knowing where the gun was didn't hurt the film at all because although Gosling's battle to solve the case and get a conviction are certainly a core part of the film, 'Fracture' works better as a character study.
Only once, I think, have I ever proclaimed something "best movie of the year" and all that, because it's all too subjective and also a clichÃ© but that's how I feel about this movie unless something better comes along the last few months of 2007.
Even though Sir Anthony Hopkins played a role almost exactly identical to that of his previous Hannibal Lecter, it was still great to see him back in this form because that's what I always thought he was best at: the maniacal genius.
This was most likely because it flowed with the story and offered a fresh perspective.
In many other films like these there's always that the policemen/attorneys (in this case Gosling) fall in love and then mess it up/ruin their marriage because the case is tearing them apart, you know the drill.
The movie surprises in more than one way, not in the last place because of the pretty much brilliant performances of both actors.
In that respect, the movie is rather sad, because McQueen never made another movie.
Again, Nyuu is a retard and she takes up more screen time than Lucy does; this is likely because she is made to be a sadistically perverted retard who assaults other women in the household at any given opportunity.
Not for kids although because of all that blood and explosing bodies^^  I m not telling the plot... Just watch it.
This anime will go down as one of the best in history because it speaks to the heart of the person watching it.
However by no means avoid this because of it, there's a lot more to it than the violence, and you will be denying yourself a truly wondrous experience by not watching it.
Although it is fantasy because of the special powers the girls have you should not think it would diminish it.
Be warned, however, because this movie contains scenes that some may consider "strong pathos", but other than that there's absolutely no reason to watch this movie.
Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this anime because of the gore, blood and nudity content.
I watched this series over 2 days which isn't really fair because it's probably about as long as any of the Lord of the Rings movies and I watched that in one sitting.
I'm not going to give a description of what it is about because you can find that elsewhere.
And because you get to know them pretty well, you will eventually get involved to the point that you really fear for their fate.
I rented it because the presence of John Malkovich, who makes a funny cameo, and watched very perplexed the first part, really too slow and without new glances on the matter.
I don't mean to be harsh, because really I could see this was a labor of love and it does have potential if it had simply been edited differently.
Based around the urban legend of La Llorona, "The Cry" deals with mothers who drown their children because a spirit tells them to.
I was really excited about this modern take because Mexcian folk tales and especially la llorona stories are a passion of mine.
all the women didn't do bad at all but maybe that is because all together there may have been about five lines of dialogue written for all the females in this film combined.
the only reason i watched the whole thing is because i'm paralyzed and when in bed i couldn't shut it off myself, lol.
Despite repeated warnings from my family and IMDb users to skip this "Jaws" flick, if you even want to really call it that, but I ignored it and figured maybe it's just getting a bad rep because it would be compared to the first and ultimate classic "Jaws".
As far as the mother's killing their babies because of La Lorona, well that could have been handled in a terrifying but effective way (if it had to be handled), but this is not a thoughtful or sensitive treatment.
The main character is not a nymphoid because, well, she's just not.
I only bought this movie because it only cost like three dollars from a store that was getting rid of all it's VHS movies.
From now on I don't think that I can ever give another movie a vote of 1 because I think it will give this colossal piece of crap too much credit.
Yes, I am aware of the fact that I'm ranting on and on, but that's partly also because there's very little to say about the film itself.
I see this film in the same league as 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili' because the woes of the protagonist are the same still it is completely different.
The paradox of the situation is very interesting because through out the film you see young Pushpa as a prostitute.
Must mention the name of the genius because of who this film is sure to go down in the history of Indian Cinema.
I rented this because it was written by Ross Thomas, and I'm a huge fan of his novels.
He is fearless for his craft, his equipment, and his life, and it is because he imbues all of his cinema completely with his soul.
There's also the element of industry that finds this way in this mix, especially because of the presence of human beings in this mix.
It is obviously a contemporary urban area because we see highways, traffic, stoplights, and large buildings, but it is also obvious that it is not an American city.
The best part of the movie was the end credits because that signaled the end of my torture.
These people just couldn't spit out their lines and when they did it was hard to understand them because of all their indecipherable accents.
I went in with low expectations and yet I was still disappointed because it doesn't even classify as typical mindless action-type fun such as "Bloodsport" and the like.
And don't get me started on the raw cheesiness of the props such as those stupid tiki torches lighting up every part of the building/arena/outside that the bad guy owns, or the main character driving a construction machine to the fight because the car door is locked, or why the bad Asian dude does a Michael Jackson dance after he wins a fight (which I'm sorry for, but it definitely detracts from one's alleged toughness).
Just because he was funny in the clever Brooks/Kahn comedies does not automatically make him funny on his own...and this proves it beyond doubt.
When I saw this movie on TV some decennials ago, I found it quite funny, because Gene Wilder was "in" at that time.
I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts.
Don't see this or part 4 because they both suck.
This television movie is aptly titled, two doctors Drs Jones and Enari played by Robert Culp and Eli Wallach are sent to an isolated Arctic research lab because Dr Vogel hadn't had contact with the base research station in five days due to snowstorms.
It may have had a similar plot, what with the whole boy meets girl on vacation, girl moves into his school, they can't be together because of clicks thing.
He does give in and lose himself because money and opportunities show up.
The movie is more like a musical because in the first film, the majority of the songs were songs that were to be performed.
Anyway, the movie was great because it seemed like it could have really happened.
We know that Disney likes Ashley and promotes her big time, but there were other talented actors and actresses that were underutilized and basically didn't add a thing to the film because they were never part of a storyline.
The only reason High School Musical was such a hit was because it wasn't like a real Broadway musical where they sing to each other and it's so corny.
he has a nice voice when he is singing those remedial notes, but give him some actual soaring notes and he will croak like a frog because he does not posses the range.
Of course it sounded like he did in the first movie, (only because they morphed his voice with Andrew Seeley, a very accomplished singer), but then the producer let Zac sing on his own and all the songs were low key because Zac can't hit any good notes.
The jobs they secured aren't given away to teenagers with no employment record and you don't become an assistant chef because you made a CrÃ¨me Brule and some cookies then complain about it.
I hoped and prayed that they would not kill these movies, because they're a cute and happy movie.
The reason that High School Musical, and now Part 2, are such a success is because 1990'S POP MUSIC IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!!!
Still, if this second movie doesn't match up to the first, it's because of moving it away from the dream of Triple Talent Status.
The kids will LOVE IT, the parents will Tolerate it, Disney Channel will collect money hand over fist, and everyone else will have no idea what is going on because they've failed to realize (A) what it meant to be a kid, (B) that 90's Pop Music is back with a vengeance, and (C) everybody wants to sing and dance, even if they don't want to admit it.
As it turns out, Bulworth was totally misrepresented by the trailers, which is a shame because it is a much better, much more intelligent film than it would have you believe.
I can't say this is a comfortable movie to watch, nor a family feature, not only because it has lots of bad words but it's also against other things that are apparently revered in this country, like the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules).
As a racially homogenous society, we will all be the same color and life will be beautiful because we'll all be the same -- I think Hitler had a similar idea.
So, because of Bulworth's rapping loud mouth, everything falls into place and is so perfect and happy and the world is going to be all okay?
I should have known this movie was going to be good because it came highly recommended by Matt Lueck, who seems to be very picky about what he considers "good" movies.
The original films could not have much better though because a couple of these actors - okay, most of these actors are just downright awful from the lead Barry Norton to the excessiveness of Jack Del Rio looking like a psychopath at the ship's steering wheel to the laughable persona of Jack Barty as the captain to the even more ludicrous native chief with a New York accent.
After initial resistance, Bickford agrees but Irene, even after being publicly ridiculed (everyone knows about the affair it seems) refuses to grant him a divorce because she "loves" him to much to let him go.
Despite having the excellent Irene Dunne in the lead, this film just isn't worth your time--mostly because the last 20 minutes of the film manage to undo any good feelings I had for the rest of the movie!
No Other Woman is famous as the film that derailed Danish Gwili Andre's career because her character is so nasty.
As the film opens Dickie Moore is bawling out the butler because he is not allowed to play in the ballroom.
Here, William stars as Allexander Stream, a wealthy, non-evil financier who is lonely because his wife (Mary Astor) is away for weeks at a time.
Katharine Hepburn's famous remark that Ginger gave Fred sex-appeal while he gave her class is relevant here, because Ginger is much sexier in this movie than in any of her musicals.
Still, I like watching it because of the location shooting.
I don't think it has ever been shown on British TV since about 1980, though i know it has been shown at least twice altogether because i remember my dad telling me he had seen it (and giving away the ending!).
A repeat of the Thomas Crown affair, which was only good because of the originality of the 1960's script.
Harrelson then catches up to them because a cruise ship is in port that is displaying one of the world's largest diamonds.
We accept what's happening on screen because we want to.
Although the film's about an FBI agent (Woody Harrelson) tailing Max because he's convinced the crook is going to steal the third "Napoleon Diamond" from a visiting cruise ship, this really isn't a cat-and-mouse picture.
This movie is so stupid because Pierce Bronsan doesn't really want to steal the diamond until this idiot of an FBI agent comes and tricks him into it.
Perhaps it was the size of Salma's boo Â name, or perhaps the fact that Pierce Brosnan's The Thomas Crown Affair was such a cult film, or maybe because Don Cheadle was in it, because it had really no pull with just Woody headlining.
I say this because I saw no true direction or moment of impressiveness where he defines himself as a director.
Brosnan had trouble with this film, and I couldn't tell if it was because he just didn't care, or because he was working with such low-talent that his heart just wasn't in it.
I rented "After the Sunset" because it looked like a fun flick.
Woody Harrelson and Brosnan make a really funny team, and if they make a sequel, I hope it concentrates on their two characters, because they have a great screen chemistry.
This movie was a pleasant shock, because it wasn't typical high octane adrenaline-pumping Pierce Brosnan action flick of recent memory!
In the novel, Ms. Metallious points out that gossipy old middle aged women castigate against young people, because they themselves are just too old, fat, and ugly to go out and party any more.
It's impossible to describe the plot of Peyton Place because there are so many strands in the plot fabric.
In spite of the flaws (or even because of the flaws?
I've given it a 9 because that's what I would have given it at the time - if only I could see it again through more adult and educated eyes - maybe one day?
I watched this movie at 3:00 in the morning because nothing else was on TV.
I had to buy my own DVD of it, because I love it so much.
The reason I think this is because most of them have not done many positive things in their in lives but this is one that they have done.
I also like the full-length performances by the featured actors, because although I like hearing excerpts of things, I do like to hear them in whole too.
I only remember it because it's "No Name" backwards, and I have the strange habit of reading everything backwards and forwards, spoiling the movie from the outset.
The simple act of watching this movie as a child made me hate the way people were treated and discriminated against simple because they were different.
However, go rent it anyway because no one will ever believe how bad this movie is unless they see it for themselves.
I rented it for my family because the guy at the video store recommended it.
The fourth story is mainly about the hot chocolate-loving Donald and because of this obsession he has no cares whatsoever.
It is a shame it was a direct to video release because the animation is awesome, and certainly looks like it is feature length quality.
I understand that Gangs was an unpopular movie because of it's incredibly violent themes, but the sentimentality the Academy has towards movie-musicals is a ridiculous justification of how trite films like Chicago can win Best Picture.
I think Scorcese has watched other directors use color schemes to make the movie visually stunning, because this is the first movie he has made that has coloring that stands out.
Keep in mind that I only say this because this movie should be good.
The only reason I didn't leave before the 3 hours of torture were over was because I was expecting it to get good (oscar nominations) and I paid full price to go.
That said, without spending too much time, I belive the film fails honestly because Scorcese is attached to it.
It looks really stupid because a fight in which about 200-300 men take part, and they all have knives and axes and swords, there would be dozens of dead and the place would look like a butchery.
Cameron Diaz is totally unconvincing as Jenny and Scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life NY hooker while Daniel Day Lewis gives a powerhouse performance as Bill Cutting , however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to Lewis's other work   Indeed everyone involved in GANGS OF NEW YORK in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies , and I'm somewhat happy about that because this movie isn't a crowning achievement for anyone , especially Martin Scorsese or Daniel Day Lewis who are capable of better things   Seven out of Ten
Don't get me started on Cameron Diaz, The Whore With The Heart of Gold (because THAT's a story that hasn't been told enough) who, inexplicably is the only character in the movie with clean teeth.
The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end (because, after all, it is a movie based on a true-ish story), it was incredible to watch how it got that end.
Second reason lead us not only everyday fascism but also (and because of first one) state fascism.
**************************************Spoiler: I must turn the real question of the movie because you can't understand things I wrote if I don't answer that question.
TunÃ§ prefer to confess (or do) the crime because he didn't want his nationalist (and praised) dad (the butcher) have known he had f*Cked Firuz.
Firuz (who possibly knew the real killer) prefer to agree the accusation of murder because he want that nobody have known his homosexuality (and his love to Kaya)so he made up a different story about the murder with the police along the movie (and the reason of the pain he felt while he was sitting on his ass is not his regret!)
Salim the stationer (who possibly knew the real killer) panicked and told a lot of things because he tried to save Kaya (because he is his real father).
American and Salim are afraid of the reactions of the neighborhood (because one of them is an ex-communist and a cheater while other one is a foreigner) and they are easily persuaded to hide somethings for the possibility to continue their lives in the neighborhood.
It succeeds because it KNOWS it's a 'B' film, and not for one frame of celluloid does it take itself serious.
We laugh at the characters because they are exaggerations of stereotypes.
This is a strength for the films, I feel, because it really helps the target audience rally around the hero.
It really is a shame because this film easily falls into the 'woulda - coulda - shoulda been' category.
During the sun eclipse, demon-guy will use Chris to make the world come to an end because he was born with stigmata.
I was highly surprised that this pearl of a movie has only an average rating here in IMDb, because this is one of the finest comedies of all-time!
I just watched this movie because Hopkins was in it, I expected another boring Hollywood style comedy.
There is no relation at all between the various threads and they have no influence on the main storyline because it is either totally lacking or so weak as to be invisible.
Is it funny for a man to have an erection because of electrical charges applied to his feet?
As it has been proved more than a few times, just because there's a strong cast doesn't mean that the movie will be a success.
I rate the picture highly simply because it evokes the period and attitudes so interestingly.
A shame, because it starts off quite good, then slows to a crawl and the interest peters out.
This farce is great fun because of the cast assembled for the movie.
IÂ´m sorry for those, who cannot like it because of their prudery, rest of you just try to watch a little bit more open - minded.
Maybe it's because it didn't reach its public... Or that the whole purpose of the film is being missed by the majority of the public... Or that people think Parker should only make serious movies...
Upon joining the gang of raiders calling themselves the Jayhawkers, he starts to accept the ambition of Darcy, because the man seems intent on bringing peace to the territory, but under his rule.
Come on, only because it's a gay couple it's not a clichÃ©?
Reassuring, as we can see the crew reacting together as one social unit, even after the inevitable trials of months in space; disturbing because it is all so emotionless and controlled.
If you are looking for epic space battles for the fate of the universe, look elsewhere because the crew kills absolutely no living thing.
hard to stay focused because it is not interesting at all.
I wanted to watch until the end because of commenting otherwise i wouldn' t.
OK i wont be long but i gotta say this, i watched this movie because of the other recommendations (i.e.
It really doesn't work because there is no real drama here - I didn't feel like I could know the 4 main characters - the only character who seemed to have an attempt at becoming multi-layered is Renee.. From the mention of wanting to be with a girl and then befriending the waitress, who seemed like she could be a lesbian, a new layer began to unravel for Renee.
the only reason i cant give this movie a 10 is because the story-line is pulled out to thin, sometimes it becomes boring because absolutely nothing happening for minutes, they filled those long minutes with "everyday" conversations that do not build on the story-line nor are in any way interesting nor funny
Sex and relationships, at least make up your mind what your movie is about before you shoot it, because whoever wrote this obviously wasn't talented enough to include both.
Though many will avoid this little film because the title and DVD cover suggest a mindless mÃ©lange of sexual encounters, those who can get past these flaws will find a well written (Miles Brandman) examination of young people's concepts of relationships and how to keep them.
So does anyone actually own the rights to this film, because I can't imagine anyone would want to.
A very charming and entertaining short film not typical for the period because of the use of prominent Chinese actors in an American film.
At the time I was blown away by this film because it had every thing in it any city kid would want to be able to do, which mostly was race horses and have a pretty girl interested in the same thing as a friend.
I know I am right in this because I've seen this film at least 20 times over the years and have read the book that the film is based on (The Phantom Filly).
Nevertheless, I think I enjoyed the sequel even more than the original, not because of the nostalgic clipshow, but because of the interludes in between.
A good thing about this movie is that anyone can enjoy it - young and old because there is something that will appeal to everyone.
The dramatic arc of the film concerns Catherine O'Hara's character, who begins as a well-respected, serious actor who in late career has been reduced to taking minor parts in mediocre movies, and who ends as a botoxed, pompous, frankly insane drama coach because of her obsession with getting an Oscar nomination.
Overall, it's tough to read Christopher Guest's "For Your Consideration" as anything other than a satire-by-numbers by a director still trying to find his way and possibly fearing that his past success has come only because of his much-liked troupe of improv actors.
the actors are terrific, did they win an award, because they deserved one.
Good thing I rented this piece-o-shat because I would've bought it had it been for sale.
I don't have much to say about "For Your Consideration," except that I liked it, in spite of the negative reviews it received, and I wanted to say that here in case other viewers, like me, put off viewing it because the reviews put us off.
Acting, actor training and film are all open to exploitation of the gullible because so many people are desperate to be part of it; consequently it's an area ripe for satire.
I have to admit I miss some of this dynamic because the on-camera realism resulted in some of the funniest moments in the previous films.
They return indignant to the ticket window because they have been shorted.
His children, John Arledge and Constance Moore attend a really posh Ivy League type school and you sympathize with Fields because you know this why he's probably not paying his bills.
Even without knowing that background, today's audience can still enjoy You Can't Cheat an Honest Man because the comedy is eternal.
I enjoyed Edgar Bergen's performance more than anyone in here, including W.C., because he gave his famous dummy, "Charlie McCarthy," some of the best lines in the movie.
Tom Welling did not act his part as well as he usually does; he seemed restricted because he had to portray a side of Clark (aka Lana-obsessed) that was the exact same five years earlier.
I very highly recommend this movie, because it sheds light upon a type of life that many cant see.
Burnt Money is a movie that society should be interested in, because it shows how first impressions are almost always incorrect.
See Joni Mitchell full of emotions, because a freak have gotten on stage to make music with her.
Although, a lot of the festival turned out badly (cops being uptight about drugs, violence in the audience, performers threatening not to play because of money, on-stage fires, etc.
That I just found out doing an "after viewing" search on Matthew Settle; betting I saw him in "I know what you did last summer" originally renting the movie because I am a "Samatha Mathis" fan.
Especially the more dramatic parts of the film brought loads of tears (because I was laughing so hard) to my eyes.
Granted I realize it isn't all James Bond in real life, but it has to be a thousand times more interesting than the film, because someone could pay me to be a spy, but they could never pay me enough to have to watch this film again.
Not that the story is complex - there hardly is a story - but it is hard to understand because it's directed very, very poorly and at an infuriating pace that seems to be wrong for every scene.
I saw this film because of monica and vincent to be honest.
And because Bruno Coulais had done the music.
I don't want to admit that I have get used to hollywood stuff and that I am not in place to appreciate something different, because I watch more "different" movies than Hollywood movies.
But when different gets so out of line...I wouldn't say it is a spy thriller, because I don't think it is.
Also, this film gave me a hard time, because never before had I consider rating a movie below 5.
Which is a shame, because the plot isn't bad when it finally kicks in - in the last twenty minutes.
It's a pity because some sequences show that he is talented with a camera!
The best moment of the movie is their "vacations" in Casablanca, because it was almost like mine in Oujda, another Moroccan town: streets filled with people, red and whites taxis, pool, Â   And another french DVD without subtitles!
Not because of the plot nor because of clever dialogs about international security or about the loneliness or the dangers involved with the spy business.
But mainly because of the excellent cast, with exception of the clichÃ© looking villains who kill a French agent in the strong first minutes of the movie: they look like the stereotype gang members of Pablo Escobar.
Many people found this movie boring, but that's because the lives of real spies are exactly like that!
I wasn't disappointed as many seems to be because I knew what kind of film I was going to see... By this, I would mean that it is a 'Schoendoerffer movie' i.e.
Just because a new generation of writers and performers wants to explore a similar strand of comedy/satire, that doesn't make them rip-off merchants.
Maybe there was a missing subplot about him being Garrett's and Aurora's son who was put away in an institution because post menopausal ladies usually give birth to children with severe birth defects.
I recommend to see this movie before the first ( "Terms of Endearment, if you haven't seen it jet),because it isn't much related to the first.
In this film, Aurora deals with troubled grandchildren who she helped raise because the father was absentee.
And Melanie (Juliette Lewis), the youngest, is struggling through college because she's going through a rebellious phase and likes hanging out with her sleazy boyfriend, or mooching off Patsie (Miranda Richardson), the now very rich divorcÃ©e.
Juliette Lewis takes the role of Melanie and in my opinion, I thought she played the best character next to Aurora because we have to remember that Melanie is the only child that has never really known her mother so you can automatically feel the pain of the character.
This is 13 years after the first and the storyline is pretty much that amount of time later, maybe a little more because Melanie is pretty much grown up as well.
I thought that was beautiful because even though Rosie was the maid, her and Aurora were like family and when Aurora was carrying Rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life, that was truly beautiful.
This is also why it went under a different name, because it was the same characters but a completely different plot and story.
Overall, a movie that should be given more credit because it is just as good as the original.
I seriously considered stopping it several times, but i soldiered on all the way to the end credits just because it was a Casper movie.
I've watched "Meltdown", one of the most ridiculous sci-fi movies ever made, a bunch of times because he, in some sort of bizarre way, makes it very enjoyable.
This film was quite mediocre, which is okay, because I didn't expect much from it and so could not be disappointed.
I can say I actually knew who he was anyway, because he was on One Life to Live and Beverly Hills 90210, although perhaps I should not admit that I ever watched those shows.
This was perhaps a miscalculation, because they are being followed by the Argentine police, that is working with local authorities in apprehending all the criminals.
I use to think it was a Rankin/Bass movie, just because it is similar to Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and all other movies like that.
Keach and Pritchard could've been memorable villains if they'd been given more time on screen, but they remain in the background because this film merely uses them sparingly as a dramatic device.
Valee sings and talks about the old days of show business, then warns Robert and Jenny that they shouldn't hike to Michael's cabin because they might wind up being hunted.
to characters and royally confuse my family because I watch movies with headphones after midnight and we live in a one story house.
She's dating an immature frat bully named Mitchell (Ric Carrott), but decides to end the relationship because Mitch is a complete d--khead who doesn't understand her and makes one of his pledges do a pool-side striptease wearing female underwear and Mickey Mouse ears.
The creepy old man in the store tells the couple not to go to the mountain because bad things happen there.
Since this is a PG-rated film, Baumann's strip-down is discreetly screened by a VERY INCONSIDERATE bush - but then she skips into the shallows and, because of how she's built, you can pretty much see everything anyway.
Casting these two beautiful, experienced young men as lovers in a violent true-crime drama could not have been more fortuitous: Their devotions are rarely consummated on-screen (all of the aforementioned sex scenes are heterosexual), except for a chaste kiss at the end of the film, and an earlier, erotically-charged sequence in which Nene tends to a wound on Ãngel's shoulder and initiates a sexual advance, only to be rebuffed because of Ãngel's mental condition.
In case you're considering to rent "Slashed Dreams" because it features an early role of Robert "Freddie" Englund, well, DON'T!
Clint Eastwood seemed very nervous presenting and messed up his lines, which was odd to see from a person of his caliber and acting past, though he would claim it was because of he forgot his glasses.
I remember the JDL wanting it banned because it had Vanessa Reedgraves in the title role and she had recently been photographed with the PLO holding up an AK47.
I cannot understand why there is no DVD or video -- except that Vanessa Redgrave once told me that he movie was "banned" in the United States because of her support of the Palestinians.
It lives through me to this day - my daughter (born long after my experience on this film) is very interested in the Holocaust because of my experience on this film.
One of the most haunting,soul-wrenching dramas I have ever seen, made much more so because it actually happened!
After Atomik Circus, the hyperactive Belgian BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is yet again jumping with young directors and writers in a crazy movie with lots of pace, plenty of ideas and references, a lot of humor (JC Van Damme laughing at the image of himself that was built and then that has spread to all french-speakers in the world after several interviews and comments he made when on drugs again and again, several crazy TV appearances saying stupid things absurd semi-philosophical metaphorical sentences in a very pedantic tone while they meant nothing because he was stoned etc...) and some critics made about current society with wit, discretely etc...He succeeds at making his crazily pathetic character very touching and above all hilarious as always...
I worried about myself because I can admit having seen this show.
The reason I rented this video was because the cover seemed scary enough to me, a hideous woman, who somehow reminded me of Lordi's keyboard player, awakes from the ice and goes on a rampage.
Now, it could be because I'm a High School teacher of History, and I might be more critical about historical incorrectness than others, but I do believe more people will hear their skin crawling when they claim the Homo Erectus (which only lived in Africa by the way) has a body temperature of -30Â°.
Never have I seen such a stupid ending in a horror movie, and remember, Freddy Kreuger was killed initially because somebody didn't believe in him, while he was standing right in front of her.
All in all, this movie is one of the most horrible horror movies ever made, but I gave it three stars, because the last 20-30 minutes were just so plain ridiculous that they made me laugh, and that means the movie entertained me, although not intentional.
Wardrobe design for the Ice Queen and miscellaneous characters are pretty bad, the make-up for the Ice Queen is bearable but only because it makes you laugh.
Let's see, the reason why I rented this movie was because I've kept seeing it popping up at all the rent franchises for 3 months and finally gave in.
The doctor is some kind of crack pot, weirdo which is typical of these doctor types, who some how survives the monster's attacks as if they share some sort of union which compromises the character because the logic is, if you raise a baby croc, it will eat you so I think it would apply here as well.
Also, the part where the ex-alcholic uncle used emergency services to call for help was turned down by the operator because she'd thought the uncle was going through one of his drunk rants of madness.
WRONG-if this were real, that person would of gotten fired because all emergency calls have to be taken seriously, but then again if this was the case, there would be no movie.
I tried to decide the best order to watch them, because it's hard for a mediocre Kung Fu Movie to follow a really good one.
Unlike the Ringu and Ring 2 this has a slower pace even though the movie was short it felt long because of the pacing.
Why because it has a heart it may be sentimental sometimes but it works, the singing works, and there isn't that much of it.
Dixie was an angry, embittered woman because Eddie Sparks sold out on her uncle!
She didn't want to go on tour with him and only did so because he talked her into it, "For the Boys"!
The film ends on a funny note too because despite being a good guy and going back to the army a hero, the film ends with Lucky back in the cooler for yet another act of insubordination making it clear that even his goodness/patriotism has its limits.
It was okay for Jimmy Cagney (as Rocky in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES) to shoot down two "business associates", because Rocky was fair and even handed with loot - just insisting that his loot was left his loot, while those two associates (one is Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer) were just willing to cheat Rocky of his loot.
That established, "Distant Drums" appears to me as a highly entertaining and well done movie as well as a very original film mainly because of where the action is located.
movie which i still remember till this day clearly because one scene with the Forrest fire reminded me of the Land Before Time III.
But there was a scene in it where a Forrest fire started and it reminded me of the scene in The Land Before Time III where they had to escape the great valley because of a Forrest Fire.
Its not the last Great one because it never lived up to the standards of the other Nicktoons.
!You can't beat shows like these, and anybody who tries to run away, always find themselves crawling back to them.I would watch The Wild Thornberry's show all day if I had to, because it is just a show that you can love forever, and never get bored with it.
Many avoid cinema because they have been disappointed so many times.
I liked this movie because it teaches people that its better to work for what you have, and not just asking other people for it.
I did not give it a 10 because there were a few choppy parts that could of transitioned better.
However, the end was somewhat surprising, because of the dynamic change that the main character went through.
I know it will touch the heart of all who watch it and give hope to everyone out their that a persons heart can really change when love, which is given to us by God because He first loved us, is practiced and felt in our lives.
I first got this film out of the video store last year because i wanted to see what Drew Fuller was like outside of his role in Charmed.
If so, that's really a shame because this is quite a nice little film that deserves an audience.
I gave this movie a 9 because as much as I did enjoy it there were a few things that didn't completely make sense.
If viewers pass by this DVD because they fear it is just another sappy lecture, they will miss the pleasure of entering the realm of tender communication delivered with style and sincerity.
In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there.
The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them.
His movies are unfamiliar to most people because his contract called for extra fees to him when his movies played on television!
I'm hesitant to give a movie this silly, corny and stupid eight stars but I had to because overall it was fun to watch and provided a number of genuine laughs.
That's too bad, especially with the older crowd, because they've missed a funny movie.
I find bad films much more interesting then good ones, because u can understand what the director meant and see were he got lost.
The third guy, son of the last one, irony of destiny, doesn't seems at all to his father (and his mother too), because he's thin as a bone...
Well well after the 2 first Ringu's that i enjoyed soooo much because of the scary screenplays, Ringu 0 brings us a very different prequel with this on, if you expect seeing as much scary scenes as in Ringu 1 and 2, then i hope you will read this first so at least you know that it won't, it is explains about all what you needed to know, with a end you already know but hehe it is a prequel so what else could it have been.
Which is a shame because the film has the right settings to be politically meaningful and also the casting couldn't be more superb.
However, the poor schluck doesn't get very far with his sexual shenanigan because a rather bored but grim-looking rooster sees what looks like a worm-like animal to him, and pecks it very hard.
normal sex with a consenting adult from the same species and of the opposite sex, because it appears as if the fat middle-aged woman is really there - making her moves on him.
Must admit it was the cover that sold me on this one - 3 foxy Asian chicks in sexy cat suits and tooled up - and its a belting movie as well... Qi Shu plays Lynn who with her younger sister Sue(Vicky Zhao) run a high-tech assassination group - they do this because their Father designed a satellite surveillance system but got murdered by the gangsters who wanted it for themselves and the two sisters undertake to revenge themselves.
We can't say, that the leading characters are perverted, because everybody is as much perverted, as the ones we see.
I stumbled upon them on a flea-market and just took it home because of the cool cover-art (paintings of water/fire-disasters, not shown here on IMDb).
They were still slaves, only they could cope with it because they sang a lot.
I'm not a fan of "hip hop" because I think it is a degenerate art form created by an oppressed people.
needless to say, police got involved because it was after curfew and i had my little sis w/us.. so we went home w/those feelings and 'clowned' and 'krumped'... it was "ahh" ::sighs.w/relief::
LaChappelle interviews a Krumper named "Dragon" who states (and I'm paraphrasing) that Krumping (the "street" version of Clowning) is something that "we do because we can, because we were made to do itÂwe were born to do it."
I really enjoyed the movie because it allowed me to see another culture than the one i live.
I only ask because the movie kept making the point everyone was invited to participate.
The number one reason i went to see this show was because of the actresses :-) And they.. ahem i mean it didn't disappoint.
I hope more kids that are born into this type of environment have the opportunity to join the clowns, the stripper dancers (which are not sexual at all) or the krumpers because it is a positive way to not be into any negative activities and to be surrounded but nothing else but positive people.
I approach most movies with a jaundiced eye, because most of them activate no thought, creativity or originality.
I am not the biggest fan of hip-hop, rap, r&b, etc., but I decided to check out this documentary because I recently moved to LA and I appreciate seeing people who take difficult life situations and turn them into something positive, and that is exactly what happens in this movie.
Though I can honestly say that I am nor have ever been a fan of Christina Aguilera's work...I certainly do not hold this against Mr. La'Chappelle because unlike most respected and honored directors who turn a blind eye to movies like this because they aren't "Oscar worthy" he stepped in, and in his own artistic and beautiful way shuns the myths and stereotypes that have plagued the African-American people.
But for any fan like me thinking this game could be any good just because "evil Dead" stands on the cover-you'll be disappointed.
But I guess for those seeing "Evil Dead" on the cover and buying the game just because this fact is enough for them, if they are satisfied with playing their favorite movie character then I z'think I could also recommend this game to them.
For me, it deserved for a rating of 100/10 because it is the best movie i ever saw in my entire life..
Harold was so proud of the chase scene in this that he borrowed from it in the 1960's & because of that borrowing, he helped make another comedy star whose name is Dustin Hoffman.
I must say that in the past I had underestimated it, because I did not pick up the "Connoiseur Video" PAL VHS a few years ago (as I had done with 3 other available titles by this great comedian).
I enjoyed this film very much because of the many funny scenes that had me laughing all the way through; it also had me very nervous waiting for the ending.
If aging population and decline in birth rate are any indication of a troublesome European identity which will continue to haunt all Europe by year 2020,European subcontinent is in desperate need of a poetic film which talks about issues related to population.It is really a wonder that "Flores De Otro Mundo" has not been criticized by feminists.This is primarily because Spanish actress turned director Iciar Bollain has ensured that the female protagonists of her film "Flowers from another world" are not treated as mere objects as the title of her film makes allusion to the word "flowers".
One couple were truly in love, they got along well but the woman got kicked away by the husband because she lied that she already got a divorce from her ex-husband.
Her acting was good, because she showed her emotions without being too exaggerated.
All we see are individual ninjas cruising round fighting each other, because they've got nothing else to do besides meditate and wave their swords around to the same individual sound effect.
I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film, in fact I watched it merely because I was in need of a laugh.
That was a very interesting bit of information I found out because it does make more sense when watching these Godfrey Ho Ninja movies.
Anyway Billy meets a group of thugs and beats them up and so because of that the kill his mother so Billy decides to get his revenge, Billy also has other problem since his girlfriend's father doesn't like her being with him since "He's a Ninja and a very dangerous man."
It's a shame because the Brothers clearly aren't playing to their strengths in this movie.
However, no harm done because the Marx brothers are very good.
The movie was about two sisters who became professional killers because of their traumatic childhood of witnessing the murder of their father.
The film is called THE HATCHET MAN because Robinson is literally a hatchet-wielding assassin who does his tong's bidding.
I suspect while reading it that this is OK because the cultural norms to be depicted are alien and unfamiliar to a 1932 American movie audience.
I bought this movie when it 1st became available (to the tune of ~$65) because I was there for some of the shooting and my car was in the movie.
Not sure why, because he has directed five other films.
It's hard for me to explain why I love this movie so much, but only because I'm not that articulate when it comes to speaking what's in my heart, I guess.
But that's also a compliment for writer, director Larry Holden, and his remarkable directorial debut - because (I think, anyway) that's his goal: to try and speak the inarticulate speech of the heart.
I mean, it would be a damn shame if this film got lost, eventually, and all because he won't take advantage of all of the available distribution channels.
I gave this film a 10 not because it's perfect, but because the pitifully low rating nearly made me overlook it.
Defenetaly I would recommend to see it because, probably, you haven't seen something like that... so it's worth it!!
we rented it and thought that it would be a scary movie because the back said something totally different from the movie and looked scary.
I saw Dead Doll in about ten minutes, and that was only because I actually stopped to watch and listen to the dialogue of most of the scenes.
I'm sure that writer/director Adam Sherman is a big fan of those guys because his own movie is just as retarded.
Wing Zero Custom I didn't like it very much because of the angel wings, some people said it looked great but it wasn't too great.
That's right Relena 'all violence is wrong' Darlian, had slapped someone because of the cause of peace.
But that shouldn't matter because this movie is GREAT!!!
The DVD is an excellent value because not only does it contain both version of Endless Waltz and some nice little extras, it is possible to watch Endless Waltz in the original Japanese!
Cut scene number two is my absolute favorite (I try not to cry too much) because it is a sweet semi-reunion between Zechs and Noin.
I didn't like Wing Zero Custom because the angel wings was ridiculous!!!
I just love this movie because of one character : Lady Une, former OZ soldier and now the leader of The Preventers.
The Gundams themselves have undergone some sort of face lift and I'm really glad they did because they look a lot cooler in this than they did in the anime show.
The orchestral elements and electronic elements are mixed together nicely because sometimes they will have nice strings and horns going then kick some nice electric and bass guitar.
American composer need to take note to the music because this is a great example of how to mix orchestral and electronic elements to form a pleasing listening experience.
I cannot began to discribe my feelings towards "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz" simply because, It is in this reviewers option.
Lolo is owner of the main restaurant in town and his wife (cook in his restaurant) left him because he never really paid any attention for her, only for money.
Raquel is middle-age woman who is very lonely (because her husband left her), so she keeps some sort of relationship with one man on internet.
He needs a new chef and ends up with Mao, a Chinese immigrant who's kungfu-ing all the time but is the most efficient cook he ever had and suddenly people are flocking to his bar because his dishes are actually really good now.
Sadly, it's neither, and as limply directed by Gary Winick ("13 Going on 30"), it seems targeted squarely to privileged pre-adolescent girls because the two principals reflect the obsessive, childish mindset of that age.
i loved this movie, i saw this movie when it came out on DVD,because of Kate Hudson, i had recently saw how to lose a guy in 10 days from my sister and loved that movie.
when i saw this movie i thought it would be so funny,it didn't really have that many funny parts, there was a couple, me and my sister were cracking up when Kate woke up in the morning and her hair was blue and she went to work because she forgot to get it dyed back to blond,and she used her shirt and wrapped it around her head so the people she was working with wouldn't see her blue hair, and so during her meeting all she had on was her pants a suit jacket and her bra,and it was so funny.then when the shirt fell off her head and she was telling the people that she was fighting with her best friend and everything and then she sat down and she ripped of part of her hair and was like "oh my god i'm gonna be a bald bride"that was funny....it is a chick flick/comedy, for that reason it was good and i would totally watch it again.
...because I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theaters.
"Bride Wars" works, because it is the story of best friends and soul mates who get distracted from what is really importantÂlove.
You'll just sneer evilly because that's what you want to happen.
It was because of circumstances beyond my control that I was dragged in to watch Bride Wars in the first place, and while I can't avoid admitting that I was truly, truly suffering for the first 30 minutes, I would be lying if I said the film is devoid of laughs.
They are as unimportant as the honeymoon, which is never mentioned because the girls childhood dreams never extended beyond the wedding ceremony.
First of all, I will say that I have a tough time relating to this belligerent scramble to get married absolutely as soon as humanly possible, but that may simply be because I'm a guy.
"), because Emma was hoping she would gain enough weight to where she wouldn't be able to fit into her Vera Wang dress (for those of you who don't know Vera Wangs are supposed to be like, super super tight for some reason, and thus insanely expensive).
Something happens involving one of the weddings that may even qualify as more than mildly surprising, because you just don't see this kind of thing in this kind of movie anymore.
The fact is, humans can be absurdly obsessed with the superficial at times, and just because this movie overblows this concept a bit does not automatically make the film wrong just because the main characters happen to be women.
Candice Bergen could have been pretty spectacular because she is a very talented comedienne but she doesn't get a lot of screen time or character development.
I think it's ridiculous and to call a film chauvinistic because it features two women who have dreams of their wedding which happens to be a little bit old fashion perhaps?
Anne Hathaway is a great movie star, because she can play the buddy thing... i mean to say that she is not trying to take over the movie, even though she could, and i loved that.
i liked seeing this type of psychology in a movie role because we all know people who act like that sometimes, but you don't see a lot of it in the movies.
but, i am willing to let all that slide... because at the core of the movie is a good story about relationships... which is what all movies are really, even Star Wars.
OK, i don't know about Hostel because i didn't see it.
Anyway, once these two dreadful dames are engaged, they visit wedding planner Candace Bergen, who informs them that it won't be possible for them to get married on the same day because the hotel is fully booked.
Apparently, wearing costumes to opening night is a dying tradition in American culture, because if you're not getting in costume for Bride Wars, what are you holding out for?
In fact, I only know of one girl who would not murder her best friend if her friend was preventing her from having her wedding on a specific day (and that's only because she has no friends).
Although I wanted to watch it, mainly because of Anne Hathaway.
Martin Scorsese once famously said he does one movie for the studio and one for himself, and so do many other directors or actors (George Clooney admits he did Ocean's Thirteen because that way he could do Michael Clayton next).
And yet it sounded like it could be a lot of fun, at least judging by the premise, which reverses the classic wedding stereotype: women are in it for the romance, guys are game because it's fun (that's what they make it look like in American comedies, anyway).
Well, at least I think it goes on a rampage, because that's the point where the "Specters" really stops making sense.
But "So Close," nevertheless, enthralls because it's so unpretentious in its aim.
Harvey, number one at the game only because of the illness of the Russian champion (Jack Kruschen) the year before, panics when he plays a practice match with Kruschen and realizes that this year, he will lose his title.
Harvey is wonderful in the role, a perfect villain for Columbo because he is so opposite -- arrogant, beautifully spoken, and immaculately dressed.
Is that because the trash compactor stops automatically for security reasons?
The game continues in Clayton's apartment Â secretly, because both Dudek's doctor and his coach would throw fits if they knew the diabetic Russian was out late, eating rich foods with his opponent.
Consequently there's a great deal of gentle humor here, but it never gets campy, and doesn't get in the way of a tight little mystery that is doomed to end badly for everyone - the detectives succeed in the end only because they live to be able to tell the tale (and are smart enough to know not to waste their breath telling it).
Buono's perfect plan goes all to hell because of a dame.
I think that it is even more than what I expected it to be, because it goes deeper than the first one.
it shows u how u feel about the game and if u want 2 become a professional football wit love involved i just wanna no wen goal 3 is out because that has 2 be better because she is pregnant and who's the father i think we know its munez's baby.!
and i reckon this has become a gr8 movie from goal because it means anything is possible so u don't have to have trails for teams you can just be spotted u never know in the years 2 come but i just cant wait until goal 3 comes out because thats just going to be fantastic so thanks for looking at my comment and hope 2 comment again soon about goal 3 this time thanks
Only see this movie if u want to laugh at errors and not to take it to serious because European football is nothing at all the way they put it in the movie (And the Champions League is not played like the superbowl playoff there are 2 games in the quarter, semi-finals so it's not enough to win just one game)
I watched Goal 1 quite solely because I'm a Newcastle fan, and Alan Shearer has a cameo role.
Moving to Real Madrid already tell us that the story WILL BE Santiago Munez being proud because of his fame and big money.
The editing was choppy, the football boring...there was no tension in the film...and because of how annoying Santiago has become you don't even want to root for him either.
This is not a good Football movie (Yes I said Football because thats what its called, not soccer)Generally football movies aren't good because they truly fail to capture what is so great about the game.
And now, I even wonder if it was the club owners who produced the film, because this is advertising as its best.
Indeed this film did have it's entertaining elements, but that's because I'm a football fanatic.
I hope he does... because he seems extremely out of place in goal II.
it was expected that santi was going to get into trouble because of his mom.
movies because of my bad experiences with a few other soccer movies I've seen in the past.
I truly liked the original "Goal" mainly because I'm a huge soccer fan.
Let me explain myself...  Sure, the movie is very well done because it has good acting, an interesting romantic plot, and tries to display the ups and downs of being a famous soccer player.
So, "Goal 2" succeeds because it's a blockbuster movie and probably a favorite among young audiences.
I give this movie 2 out of 10 and only because they had balls to film it.
This will set in motion Brewster's calling on help from Transylvania's own Professor Lazlo(J Edward Bromberg)who understands the vampire ways for his own homeland has become a desolate wasteland because of the bloodsucking & death.
She stirs the pot and I'm pretty sure was an indirect influence in the death of her own father just because she feared the idea of death.
I rented this movie because the back of the box sounded awesome and I love horror flicks.
His 'Second In Command', so to speak, cries at one point in the movie because the other felons 'make fun of him'.
That is completely understandable but it is also a shame because with the exception of that shot, the film is wonderful for all ages.
I realized it was much better than it first seemed because, like a performance by a great dancer or skilled actors, it looks too easy to be really excellent, too natural.
Ben Stone realized that being a Doctor in a small town might even mean having to read to your clients personal letters to them because they could not read.
Perhaps it is because it is so well written, has outstanding actors, or that I recognize the realistic characters and one street Southern town it is based on, Micanopy, FL, having lived in nearby Gainesville.
First off, just to let you know, Queen Latifah cannot act, she has about as much acting ability as my left nut, just because someone can go on-screen and play themselves, over and over again, does not mean they can act, second off, I wouldn't even have had to watched this movie to tell you it's a piece of crap, the only reason I watched it's 'cause I work at a video store and it was playing on the tele, even then I stopped looking up after five minutes and tried to block out as much of the useless chit chat they were spitting out, and I can tell I'm not the only one who didn't like it 'cause people where walking out faster then they were coming in.
I would just like to put thinks clear, because truly, sometimes a movie tries to hard to accomplish its objective but it ultimately fails.
Actually, nothing could be much at all, because the storyline was so repetitive and the script was so lame.
If I don't say much about the story, it's not because I want you to find out, but because it would be useless (you'll probably get what I mean, later).
But noooooo, this film wasn't hilarious... Fallon has a career because of playing retarded roles in Saturday Night Live.
Mostly because of him being an incompetent blockhead and being paired with F.O.C.
Tell me honestly that this possibility is funnier than some jerk losing his licence because his driving is crap.
I gave it a 10 because so many people gave it 1.
The original film works because it had all the ingredients to make it great: Class, Sass, and a whole lot of...well you get the idea.
I am NOT saying all this just because I am from Europe.
I only saw it because of Queen Latifah.
I even had low expectations because the critics murdered the movie but it was not very funny.
It's a shame, because Jimmy Fallon can be funny, but here he's just annoying!
Quincy's friend, Lt. Monahan, wants to close the case because he KNOWS that it either wasn't a murder or he's blaming some innocent guy for the crime.
Well, perhaps it was because although you knew what to expect in general, the shows were very creative in how they thought out the murders.
It did bring the science of criminal forensics to public attention so I am sure there are people working in that field today because of Quincy.
I've been watching this as it's rerun here on ITV3 and am really getting into it.It's CSI before CSI and in my opinion better because it's a very human series not all about hi tech equipment and explosions.Plus every episode is about something important like cancer treatment,abuse,alcoholism etc and tackles the subjects head on.The autopsy scenes are good as well because you don't see the bodies you just see the top half of Quincy and Sam and get Quincys description of what's happening.I think that's great because what you imagine can be ten times worse than what your shown in graphic detail.
My only reason for bothering with this film is because of the fact that it was a part of the DPP's Video Nasty list back in the eighties, and I'm pleased to say that now I've seen three of the four Nazisploitation flicks on the list, I only have one left to go (the almost certainly mind numbing Love Camp 7).
Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but sympathize for his loss, because we can believe him.
How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.
You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made.
The first time you'll See this, I can guarantee that you will want to watch it again, because you won't have figured it all out.
The Sci-Fi genre has often been ridiculed because of the great number of hacks that have infested it, but fortunately there are often refreshingly intelligent and well-related stories like this one is.
I did have my doubts towards it because Tom Cruise starred on it.
But both together are just absurd because contradictory.
This is a movie that requires a lot of concentration, because it's one of those films you have to pay strict attention too, and the plot is seriously awesome, plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when Cruise chases his own eyeballs!.
Son of Dracula is an underrated Universal gem which is sadly overlooked because of people being prejudice to Chaney playing Count Alucard(Spell it backwards your in for a surprise).
It's sad that Chaney isn't praised for taking this risk because I think he knew his acting ability was going to be challenged by this picture.
Kay knows Alucard's true nature and offers her neck to him in order to live forever but she must agree to become the Count's unholy bride in return which causes problems because she is engaged to Frank Stanley.
Anderton is suspicious of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system.
This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole.
This is obvious, because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well.
John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day.
If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable.
It turned out we were lucky we had each other, because this would not have been near as fun to watch if I had been alone.
They more or less get picked off one by one, but we really can't care who is dying because the characters are all so damn similar.
the only reason i went with this trash is because i have seen the werewolf in Paris already.
I was especially irritated because the dumbest, most volatile fool of the bunch...the one who's stupid actions get I lost track of just how many people killed....survives in the end.
I guess some people might be pretentious pseudo-intellectuals and say the film has a self referential marxist theme because of the title and therefore that`s why there`s been no money spent but I`d say correctly that even in 1976 it would have been an outdated British B movie with limited appeal hence no one would want to invest money into it
That the police chief was singly able to commit her was totally unbelievable and the scene in the police station that precedes the asylum scenes is a laugh ready to burst from my gut, but does not quite escape, because we know it was not intended to be funny.
I know I'm going against the grain here, because most of the comments have been favourable, but this movie is about as plausible as the Tooth Fairy.
I mention Hitchcock because his Vertigo some four years later has striking resemblances to work in here, not copies of course, but certainly genre staples being noted me thinks.
However, because she was such a great star and actress, she could still get good roles in big films, "Titanic" and "Executive Suite" being two that leap to mind.
Cheryl is considered an hysterical single woman who has delusions because she isn't married and probably going through menopause, though this isn't out and out stated.
I bring this up because I feel the film will lose nothing, and gain so much more, if it was tighter.
And I really wish this was not a Dracula movie, as it would be better appreciated as a film, and we wouldn't have to see the untalented Lon Chaney Jr. as Dracula (only Carlos VillarÃ­as in the Spanish DrÃ¡cula made a worse Count for Universal), who is pretty decent actually (better than as Larry Talbot), but that may be because he gets so little screen time.
What a cad he played in this film; Joan's character was almost justified in doing what she did to him, because it was obvious he was going to marry her step-daughter out of spite and greed.
Being his social inferior, Louise (Joan Crawford) thought she could improve herself by going all the way with him (a big deal back then because birth control was so primitive).
It's not easy playing a woman going slowly insane because it's not the obvious signs of insanity she has to convey; it's the slow insanity that results from years of inevitable tortures she must express.
It's decided it was because she was 'morbid.'
While Van Heflin gives an applaudably callous performance as the insensitive focus of obsession, partially because I cannot understand why such an incredibly ugly man like him so often plays roles of confidently unavailable loners after whom beautiful women obsess, Joan Crawford gives one of those tremendous performances that is almost like a throwback to ancient Greek theater when the protagonist was such an abundant function of the story to the extent that he had to portray every other character and even sometimes the props as well.
When she falls in love with him, Heflin announces he's restless because of the war and is taking off.
I found the plot to be original because of Dillon's machinations to get another guy the girl.
I have read the other reviews, however I cannot agree, because this is a BIG hearted not light hearted comedy drama, and there is PLENTY of chemistry between the stars Annabella Sciorra and Matt Dillon.
This role fits him very well, because he is a very funny guy behind the scenes, as said by his fellow crew, and can do one hell of a British accent.
If somebody watches the film because of your great review, they should have the right to slice you with razor blades and pour alcohol all over you.
57 points, and thats only because ruttens in it as opposed to it being any good.
It actually took 3 hours to get though because I kept scanning back in disbelief to make sure I actually saw what I saw.
Anyone who gives this a good review obviously did not watch it or was involved with the production of it because no sane person who is familiar with television or film could find this at all acceptable to spend their money or time on.
I just hope the filmmakers can come up with a better script because this formulaic an d amateur film lacked in so many areas.
Well, it isn't your typical D movie because poor D ends up fooled without even realizing it...the belle planned beforehand to first have D kill her father, thus inheriting vast estates, then to convince her beau to kill D himself, thus leading an immortal life with him as "undead".
Quoting from Hedayat's "The Blind Owl", he says that he left home because of he was weary with his life in Iran and now aspires to be a singer of Persian classical songs, though he drives a taxi to stay alive.
An elderly Spanish woman speaks at the gravesite of her husband, telling how she and her husband fled Spain because of Franco and his murderous priests.
Although physically apart from the cemetery, this scene works because the calmness of the artist and the beauty of the music remind us of the calmness and beauty of Chopin's grave and of the Lachaise itself.
(Though Dracula does get some interesting dialog about how he's attracted to America because it's a youthful and vigorous land.)
It's not as eerie as "Dracula" or "Dracula's Daughter," probably because it's a more modern and technologically advanced film.
You can tell that sparks are flying between them, but she resists because he isn't rich and so she ardently pursues Young throughout most of the film.
Yes because of James' performance but the others were good too, because honestly I couldn't just watch it for him...
I don't want to go into spoilers because, frankly, I don't want to spend too much time writing about a movie that already took up ninety minutes of my life that I can never retrieve.
The reasons being because we saw Bela Lugosi's Dracula killed and burned in the previous two films.
Otherwise you won't enjoy this film, because it's not up to today's standards of horror.
They leave their family because they love family.
why would you despise your mother, who, from previous countless accounts of domestic helpers, had been enduring unimaginable working conditions in other country, just because she missed or unintentionally failed to reply to your letters.
This movie is a s***, because it is just for americans!
The filmmakers should have thought about this, because that's what this film is- pointless.
I like this one because it made me laugh and it had some good acting mainly by Willis and Pheiffer and some good laughs by Rita Wilson and Paul Reiser you shouldn't miss this movie mainly because it is a good depiction of a off and on good marriage.
The trailer/commercials for this movie make it look somewhat interesting, because it gives you a quick snippet of what has happened in Ben and Katie's lives together (with children Josh and Erin sprinkled throughout).
The acting of Willis and Pfeiffer wasn't bad, but the ending is not believable at all (another case of wrapping a movie up simply because it's nearing two hours and we need a resolution, no matter how flimsy).
Oh and don't see it with someone you are having problems with...Only people in stable relationships can endure this movie together and not get into a fight about it, because everything that's argued is so real and so true, you forget that it's just a movie.
Directed by Rob Reiner (When Harry Met Sally), one of my favorite directors because he depicts sad realities in funny ways.
The key reason of the low ratings, in my view, is because there is a generational conflict here.
The reason I do not see much of his acting is because of the projects he picks.
Some people just don't get the movie because they haven't been there in their relationships.
I can say that because I have been happily married for almost twenty-three years.
I'd heard it wasn't a good movie, but I rented it anyway because I ran out of options at the local video rental.
It's a shame because it tends to taint all the quirky, fun memories that the delightful "When Harry Met Sally..." offered a decade ago.
I thought this movie was good because it was very real.
This movie will be mostly lost on the younger crowd, simply because they have not experienced the problems the forty something and above audience have been through.
It took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her.
After seeing The Story Of Us and talking to others about it, I came to the pejorative conclusion that the folk I spoke to just didn't get the film because they simply had not been there.
the only reason i bought this DVD is because cynthia rothrock is in it.now everybody knows she is the queen of martial arts b movies.the trouble is this is not a martial arts movie.cynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of fight scenes in this stupid movie.now if you were a film maker and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie would'nt you want to have a lot of martial arts action?
But this is excused because it gives a truly realistic mood to an insane story.
When I rented this film, I did so on a whim, also because I knew a lot about the production from talking to many of the people who worked both on and off camera.
It's a shame because Myers can be a good comedian at times, as is evident because a few jokes and puns are actually very good.
Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title.
Of course, Pelle soon becomes the laughing stock of the town, because the other cats think that "he can't be a proper cat if he doesn't even have a proper tail".
However, the film is a bit sad at times, mainly because of the abuse Pelle has to take from the other cats.
It is a very clear message, because Life is Hard.
when I saw the trailer for the love guru I thought it would be a somewhat bad movie compared to what mike myers provided in austin powers, but I saw an early screening today (mainly because I saw my fav and one of the best stand up comedians out there, Daniel tosh, the dude with the cowboy hat) and I was impressed.
There are many people just destined to see this movie fail because they think it looks stupid.
Not because I wouldn't have enjoyed meeting some of the others, but because at one stage fellow house mate Verne Troyer might have asked me about the last film he did with his best friend, and I wouldn't be comfortable lying to him and denying that I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.
I went to see this movie hoping for lighthearted entertainment, because I have always loved Mike Meyers.
Now I'm convinced that Mike must have some obsession with the penis, because there are so many penis jokes in this movie it just becomes painfully unfunny.
He should have just stuck to the animated voices, because his characters now are just lame.
There is truly no point in describing a plot because there isn't one.
I read the book, first, as a kid... and not because I was assigned to read it but because I liked to read.
Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.
I noticed a lot of recylced jokes from early Mike Myers movies, but no one will notice because they too busy staring at Justin Timberlake's fake bulge.
It's been widely reported that the reason why Myers hasn't done a live action film in five years is because he's been fine tuning his Guru Pitka at various comedy clubs until he felt he was ready.
Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title.
I really love a lot of the Three Stooges shorts that I have seen, with both Curly as the Third Stooge and Shemp as the Third Stooge, I haven't seen Joe Besser as the Third Stooge and I don't intend to, because I heard that he was not funny, he was totally annoying from what I heard.
I just do not know where I would be without the Three Stooges, because I would not know about all of those gags and pratfalls that they did!
This version of Steinbeck's novel drew quite a lot of attention in its day, not because of its financial success (it was a box-office failure) but because it was considered very daring of Hollywood to film a story with such an uncompromising finale.
Picture starting to watch a movie have way in, because thats what it feels like when you start watching this, They don't explain a god dam thing.
I had never heard of it and thought I would check it out because I love Milla Jovovich and Sam Jackson.
I watched it because of Samuel L. Jackson.
Which is unfortunate not least because movies like Gamerz can easily be overlooked.
So all in all good horror, no plot connecting, sex and violence - ingredients of a good B grade horror and all the better because it is Japanese B grade horror, which is always much classier than our B Grade horror!
Always watch a couple of episodes at once because of that reason Ignoring that it is a typical British comedy that will lighten you up when you are feeling down.
The characters are grotesque versions of real people, which seems a good idea for comedy but after a while the level of comedy is so basic that i forget to laugh because you've seen it all before.
When I watch Little Britain I can't stop laughing because the jokes are original and completely un-PC You should definitely watch Little Britain to see Vicky Pollard who is a ginger chick who can't make up her mind, and Lou and Andy (the guy who doesn't really need to be in a wheelchair and all the other hilarious characters.
I can understand if some snobs don't like it because vomit and nakedness is a part of the show, but don't say that it's made by people who don't understand humor.
I also fancy Ann (played by David), but that is manly because she's so funny.
Mrs Emery was simply a 2nd Maggie except it came out of the other end, Desere was a disaster simply because Bubbles was fine on her own and Sid Pegg was simply offensive and totally unfunny.
We hardly saw the supporting cast because Matt and David were in everything.
I don't know the reason why because undoubtedly the two writers can write a much better script ( well I hope they can) While the show attacks all groups and genders it is in fact riddled with political correctness in every sketch.
Everyone seems to like the shorter one the best but I think thats because he is short and fat.
I watched these episodes on NetFlix and there are moments that are funny, but the comedy gets a little old after a while because of the limited number of characters.
Andy is always changing his mind, and getting up and running around while Lou's back is turned, but the joke is always funny because it is always new in some small way.
Some of the ones that are exceptional and don't seem to get old with repeated segments are the adventures of Daffyd, the only gay in Llandewi Brefi (a town I visited on my last trip to Wales because of this show), the nasty lady at the Fat Fighters club meeting, the two transvestites and the bizarre narration by Tom Baker (of Dr. Who fame).
("Are you fat because you're a lesbian or are you a lesbian because you're fat?")
As always, it's the mothers, here Jiang Xuehua (Jiang Yihong) an actress wannabe, who played a huge role in her appetite for films, and for her philosophy to lead a life with their heads held high because of her single parent status, leading to Ling Ling being quite a feisty little girl.
Here, their co-workers include Candy, an elderly man who won't likely be able to work on the ranch for much longer, and Crooks, a crippled black man who faces discrimination because of his race in this era.
Maybe it was because I was on a flight from Beijing where I fell in love with the country and the city, or maybe because I compared it to the other Chinese film they showed on the plane (it was horrible).
The comparison to Italy's "Cinema Paradiso" is apt in the most important way because it's all about how movies enrich the life of a child.
Yet thanks to a style that is warm, honest, rich and--especially--gentle, a story full of quite awful happenings is told in such a way that whatever director/co-writer Jiang Xiao offers us, including some pretty heavy coincidence, we gratefully accept because all of it works beautifully toward her goal of celebrating film, family and friendship.
Her achievement is all the more surprising because the movie--her first, and filmed, it would appear, on an awfully small budget--starts out simply and charmingly then quietly builds until it reaches a conclusion that ties everything together without a whiff of heavy-handed melodrama or overkill.
before this film i usually used to say 'no' to his films, i saw solely this one because of Nicholson, i was not too sure this film amusing me as im a guy whom films normally dont impress but also i do not have a critic's eye, i'm like a normal film viewer.
but i can say now, this is one good film i have seen in years because of its light comedy.
The movie is more up beat than the 1992 version but it benefits because this version is more real than the Sinise film.
This version has the benefit of being made in the middle of the depression and because of this it has great power to it.
We forget Of Mice and Men because we were also introduced to the Land of Oz or the plantations of Gone with the Wind or the Congress in Mr.Smith Goes to Washington, but unlike those pictures the movie relies more so on it's outstanding cast which give this picture more emotional weight.
It's good because of the casting mainly.
The basic plot line is about a timid businessman who has to undergo anger management because he got "mad" on a plane.
I was surprised because I was not expecting these two players to appear in the film.
The casting of John C. Reilly was also right because he looks menacing enough and is still kind of soft spoken.
Nicholson should do a Tim Burton or James L. Brooks film next because he has done way better with them than anybody else.
no, i really didnÂ´t expect much, because of what i had read, and because i am not much of an adam sandler fan.
in fact, weÂ´ve decided to buy the video once itÂ´s out,because this will be just one of the feel-good movies one likes to see every once in a while.
Neville Brand is  good as Choo Choo, who earned that nickname because he has  a section of rail where his hand was.
While this Western (from a story by Samuel Fuller, also the original director but fired after disputes with star Harris) won't be for everybody because of its grim and sometimes ugly nature, there's no doubt that it hits a real nerve.
Not so much because of what happens, but because of why it happens.
The supporting performances are generally rather lacklustre, possibly because none of the characters beyond the two principal players carry much depth or interest.
Anyway, your loss because this one kicks butt.
The reason I like this movie is because I like that type of movie-Cops or robbers or detectives and stuff(BEVERLY HILLS COP, 48 HRS, LETHAL WEAPON, etc.).
I know it's not for everyone and I know a few people who don't like this movie simply because they don't like Carrey.
It's also funny because nobody takes Ace Ventura seriously because he is a pet detective.
But this movie, in my opinion, deserves an 8, because it's just really showcasing Jim Carreys excellence.
Maybe because Jim Carrey's the only actor on earth who can pull Ace Ventura off without looking like a complete jackass.
Right off the bat, it is a Jim Carrey showcase: chasing missing albino pigeons, rescuing a pampered shiatsu, and making high speed getaways, this all works because it is Ace Ventura, a hilarious, live-action cartoon character who spouts one-liners like an M-16.
It is a bit dated and 'stagey' in its opening minutes, partly because it is taken from the play, not the novel, by John Steinbeck, and also because so many of the outstanding cast were only making their second or third film, and needed warming up and getting used to the camera.
He is the gentle giant who crushes all the little rabbits and puppies he loves because he can never understand his own strength, and his pathetic efforts to remember the simplest things are totally convincing.
That is just because I am insecure.
Too bad this dramatic powerhouse got lost in 1939's crowded field of movie classics because, as a drama, there was none better.
And because of that, the ending achieves much of its emotional power.
I liked this movie because it deals with the great questions of life.
And also because it shows a lot of friendship and brotherhood amongst the POW's.
Are we satisfied to dismiss nobility that withstood the crushing blows of torture simply because the "message" is too obvious?
This was his biggest role, I can't call it a career role because no career came from it for him.
The worst and the best of the human condition is on display, it doesn't succumb to tricks or props, it doesn't need to, because what it has is emotion.
Be prepared for marvellous performances by all of the cast, nobody stands out because that was the way it needed to be played.
I had never heard of the film To End all Wars when I picked it up at my local library because it looked like a good popcorn kinda war movie and had one of my favorite actors in Robert Carlyle.
He is called Yanker, as they say its because he's American and he's kinda a w_anker.
It's a breath of fresh air because it makes some strong statements about morality and forgiveness, and is written beautifully.
I watched it because I like Robert Carlyle a lot and was not disappointed by his performance or any other of the actors on both sides of the war.
Robert Carlyle was fantastic, as were the rest of the leads, i would give this film 9 out of 10 simply because 10 out of 10 would be perfection and perfection does not exist.
Curly is fearful of Slim, the 'Skinner'(Charles Bickford) because of his work skills endear him to Curly's father, the ranch owner.
It's powerful because it's realistic; no stereotyped good guys or bad guys here (it's based on a true story, after all), and yet plenty of cruelty and some kindness, which leads to an exploration of themes such as justice and mercy in a way that (at last) doesn't lead to boredom or cynicism.
To be honest, I'm afraid to ask the question because I may not like the answer.
That is, because it is hideous!
Anyways, after watching this sequel, I can happily tell everyone to steer right clear of it, because all it will do is depress you.
The only reason that doesn't make this one my favorite of the series is because it couldn't exist without the others.
I also recommend to watch it more than once because it has nothing to do with American fastfood film-making, so there might be things that are misunderstood during the first viewing.
Maybe I was resisting because I didn't want to see my life up there on the screen.
Everyone is back, except for Robin Williams because of some disagreement.
It's great seeing Aladdin, Genie and the rest in action again, because in my opinion, Aladdin (1993), is one of the best Disney films ever to be released.
OK, I feel a bias because my personal path crossed the one of a Arabian girl, and the two are really like twins, in their expressions as well as their charms!
Just because it is not a stupid horror movie or some stupid movie like Snowwhite does not mean it is not an excellent movie to most people and children.
But because the kids complained they wanted the newer one, we never finished the older version.
Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first.
I didn't care about the animation because it was good enough.
It was better than The King Of Thieves because the animation gets even worse.
Maybe because it followed a great Disney classic.
I don't have a favorite song because I don't like any of them.
He returns to Agrabah, hoping to convince Aladdin that he had served Jafar only because he had hypnotized him just like the Sultan.
Any acclaim he has ever received from any other role should be retracted because of his awful portray in this film.
That's easy - It's obvious that they've seen John Woo films and know that a guy firing two guns at once looks too damn cool to get killed, and because all these scenes are in unnecessary slow motion shots it gives them plenty of time to dodge the bullets.
So he can include clever scenes of Dafoe calling his lover a fag because he wants to cuddle and saying something similar to a bartender at a gay bar.
It's because they've seen Pulp Fiction, only Samuel L. Jackson's character was more honest about his motivations for quoting the Bible.
lets the killers go, because, well, we just don't know.
It wasn't daring for Duffy to include an non-stereotypical gay character in a mindless action flick, because the character's homosexuality is simply used to shock the audience who didn't see it coming.
However, the films mindless fans seem to worship it because they're unfamiliar with the material Duffy blatantly rips off.
The release of "The Boondock Saints" was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
This film had the sad history of being blackballed in the United States due to the incident at Columbine...which is a real shame, because it is a treasure...written and directed by Troy Duffy, Boondocks is set in Boston...it is the story of fraternal twin Irish boys (Connor and Murphy McManus) who work in a meat packing plant...when their friend, Doc, is being stiff armed by the Russian Mafia, the boys and their friends step in to help...and away we go!
Freeman commits crimes that put Reeve in jail, because now he has obstructed justice.
Many people probably don't even know about this movie and that's a shame because Freeman's performance must be watched.
That being said, I think he played his role extremely well, because it was able to work with Morgan Freeman's outbursts and explosions.
Then I saw why:--because it's too lousy;--because it's so ridiculous;--because it's extravagant in an overÂcamped manner.
I remember when it was on cable years ago my young nephews loved the boy in this movie because he rode a dirt bike.
I rate this movie a 7 because it will have you using your mind to find out the killer.
Perhaps that's because he's never stepped foot in the town.
After about a half hour(or what seemed to be a half hour) of the two talkin about things you can't understand, because they're cleverly mumbling(I guess the director wanted to build a sense of mystery) we switch to a scene with the 70's guy, 2 chicks and another dude, who is the worst actor I've ever had the displeasure of viewing(though all the others are horrible), all step into an RV for a road trip.
I was a little surprised but I expected them to have a movie like this because they had been open since the dawn of video and the owner bought every movie he could get his hands on.
Were they trying to act bad because they pulled it off brilliantly.
They sold me the movie because they knew it was terrible.
Mom tries to thrust an automatic pistol into his palm because Mafiaso Don Vito (Arthur Kennedy) had his father, Gaspara Aversi (Luis Induni), murdered.
Rosa (Malisa Longo) joins him a moment later; Rosa was the girlfriend of Don Vito and she was cheating on him with one of his crime lieutenant because she wanted to have sex with young meat.
When it comes to subtlety, you'd better look elsewhere because the Italians always go for broke.
Maybe it's because director Tulio Demicheli never truly belonged to the prominent circle of Italian exploitation filmmakers?
He also kisses like a fish, rolls on the ground with his sister and her boyfriend because they're too happy to see him out of prison, feigns laughter when he nearly evades car accidents, blinks in close-up when he recognizes his mother and sister's dead bodies (that's emotion for you), heck he even karate chops people in a flashback to impress his father.
I've no idea what the title is alluding to, but to surmise the film; it's an unflinching depiction of murder and rape that is all the more shocking because of the fact that most of the film is really quite realistic.
The pastry chef is VERY spooky because he's so expressionless, and the waitress is domineering and basically never shuts up.
A very strange and nasty film, mainly because of the time in which it was made.
I have no moral objections to this material because it is what it is, and what it is is a tour de force of violent cinema with not a single cell of poltical correctness to muddy its intentions.
Again, it is hard to categorize this as comedy or drama because both genres are both successfully represented herein.
To avoid the inevitable comparisons, Dreamworks should continue with the idea to produce animated motion pictures equally for the adult because there IS an audience for such a genre.
I can't comment on the score or soundtrack, because it was still incomplete when I saw it, but Mr. Savage does a superb job, and the story and writing are both well thought out and interesting.
I remember this movie only because my sister and I were the original latch key kids.
I found it interesting that Clay Allen (Ronald Howard) distrusted Drango because the Major was an honest man.
It is the "Test Market Audience Mentality" that kept this excellent movie from getting a big-screen release in the U.S. "Cracking Up" keeps moving--if one gag fails, don't worry because there will be another, funnier one right on top of it.
That's a shame because when you've seen that part you should see the all the next parts as well to get the big picture.
What I find to be really annoying is these whiners running around complaining about the sex and violence because it " is unnecessary".
It's because of these dull trolls that the US has an edited version thus making the best and only version worth watching in my opinion harder to find.
I can personally related because two people in my extended family did this and they're getting off the easy way.
It's a good thing that film lasts as long as it does, because they no longer make many comedies as successful as this one.
I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.
Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "Dr. No" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character.
I'll have no laughter in the courtroom," says the deadpan judge, but in fact the scenes in the courtroom deliver the only laughs in this movie, because they deliver the only breaths of fresh, honest air in the script.
OK, the story isn't its strength, well it could be although it is taken out of the bible, though some of the scenes very really moving, not just because of some superb animations (especially everything covering the presentation of H2O).
Unfortunately, because the brothers see the film as a rip-off, they have no plans to re-score it (it currently uses a temp-track that includes the Jones films, The Addams Family, The Rocketeer, Ricochet, The Hard Way, Mountains of the Moon, Sleeping With the Enemy, JFK, and lots of Cliff Eidelman's _Star Trek VI_ music, among others) and release it officially (which they can't in this current state), though they do sell it through their website.
However this scores over the feature simply because it has more chapter endings and serial like adventures then the feature.
It's hard to follow the plot, because there really isn't one.
Somebody get the mop because this thing needs to be cleaned up.
(Paul Robeson is not considered here only because he was deemed to be a bass-baritone and did not have the opportunity to sing at the Met)  Both Virginia Bruce and even Alice Brady had creditable voices in their brief stints but were no match for Mr. Tibbett.
I loved this film because it was absolutely real and totally believable.
The movie centers around her character: everything happens because of her and everything doesn't happen because of her.
Not well known Crawford film which is a shame because it's one of her best.
I loved "Queen Bee", because it made me laugh at such meanness, although I've known a lot of those people, too.
I totally cracked up because everyone else is dressed and lit adequately,but in each shot, each frig-gin' shot, Joan is in fantastic gowns, jewels, lit fabulously and with just that HINT of gauze, Vaseline over the lens.
Things about it hit so close to home because they are things that all of us have to deal with on a daily basis.
They are haunted by memories and demons just like we are, yet they keep on because they know more than anything that the minute details of their day to day doings affect millions.
They all blur together because of their sameness.
He plays a small-time burlesque player teamed with his wife (Ann Dvorak) who gets discovered because of a runaway heiress (Patricia Ellis).
Instead it falls in the same group of movies that sound like they were written by the same people who write telenovelas and latino sitcoms, thinking that they are funny, just because somebody in Televisa likes this crap and wants to keep Mexican people ignorant, so that they do not rebel against the governing status quo.
The aspect of using a character as almost a director was an interesting technique, because we were able to view the story through the eyes of Nora, thus we are able to witness both the good and the bad.
This technique also helped the viewer to relate to the characters because we were able to see their desperation to appear "normal" (by begging Nora not to show arguments in the documentary), and normality is a quality everyone seeks in a relationship.
It appears that as a couple, they have come to a dead end because Carlos believes his job is too important.
Honestly, people should make more movies like this, because nowadays, it's all movies like where you forget what the movie is really about.
It gives the monster a face and because of that we loose some of our respect for the character and it ruins his original image.
The movie couldn't get my attention so I turned it of after 45 minutes and that's sad because it has some fine actors in it Like: Ford, Dafoe, Anne Archer, Thora Birch and Hope Lange.
I went to the movie theater to watch 'The Prince of Egypt' and the money I spent was very well used,because it is a great movie and one of my favorites from Dreamworks!
I rated this as a 10/10 movie only because the chart does not have any higher scores.
Along with Patriot Games, this is part of an impressive set of movies which are far more entertaining than the books (perhaps thats because I'm not an avid reader) and shall keep all you viewers out there happy, if only for a short while.
It seems that everyone was enjoying an hedonistic lifestyle, the upshot being, however, that you ended up dying because of it.
Before commenting on the film as a whole, I want to make that clear, because in the inevitable rush to pick this film apart (the plot, the voices, the religious significance, the literary accuracy, the moral issues, the music, the comparisons with Disney and de Mille, etc...) one might easily become distracted from the aesthetic and technical triumphs of The Prince of Egypt, and that would be unfortunate.
Comparisons with Disney are inevitable, especially because Prince of Egypt employs tired Disney formula in an attempt, I assume, to remain economically viable.
I suspect that I wasn't really bothered by the others only because I hadn't seen a cast list before seeing the film.
It's worth seeing because of the animation.
From this format it can just lead to a complete and utter drag for most part, because of too little action.
The script by Mike Hostench & Angel Sala was based on a novel by Matthew Costello & one has to say it's a bit of a mess which is a shame because the basic story of a ghostly underwater town is something different & had lots of potential but sadly this is what we ended up with.
So maybe, yes, this movie doesn't really deserve 7/10, because, well, it's not as good as THE NUN, to name another Fantastic Factory production.
"BSW" (and I like the acronym because it emphasizes the nature of this mess of a film) has none of the vigor or playfulness of his earlier films.
The reason I am saying this, is simply because I don't understand the thought and the planing behind this movie.
"Beneath Still Waters", with its misleading tag-line of 'Fear Rises' should not even be classified as a horror (or b-grade horror) because it is simply not scary.
Oh, and the film is majorly distracting because there are an unbelievable amount of different accents in the film when really there is no need for that many.
This film certainly doesn't look as if it were directed by someone with over twenty years of experience in the genre, because the wholesome simply feels amateurish and unfinished.
Few people know, however, the dam initially served to deliberately drown the entire town of Marienbad, because all the inhabitants were gradually joining the satanic cult led by Mordecai Salas.
Such a dam(n) shame, because the Spanish filming locations are genuinely ominous!
I'd heard nothing but bad things about this film; but decided to track it down anyway simply because it has so much promise.
This is simply a horrific film - not because it was a scary movie, but in how very truly bad it was in every department.
because i enjoyed this average horror movie for it's cheesiness and interesting ideas and cool dancing lol.
You know the times when you feel cold towards the characters because they don't act human, especially when they're too brave, and in real life, comedy is a massive element.
But maybe that was because I watched "Ghost Delivery" before it.
If you are looking for an Asian terror tale, look elsewhere, because The Bros Pang just weren't in the mood this time around.
I think the comedic tone will repel some viewers because the cover of the DVD I rented promised something terrifying.
It's because it is great for what it is.
Many people gave this movie a bad review because they thought it was supposed to be scary movie like the first "Eye" and they didn't realize what was going on.
I say that if you liked the first two movies you should see this one, because you'll probably get a chuckle or two.
I've given it 3/10 only because some of the scary bits were quite well done, but don't take that as any sort of recommendation.
This, in my opinion is true because my late Grandfather used to experience this himself.
Karate Tiger II proves that just because a movie is low budget, it doesn't mean that the people working on it aren't incredibly gifted and talented at their craft.
Others need not apply because you'll be turned away from the nonsensical plot and pedestrian acting.
His Vietnamese girlfriend, Sulin (Patra Wanthivanond), is kidnapped by the nefarious Vietcong -- because her father just happens to be a local bigwig.
That's because in the fast and loose 20s and especially early 30s, all sorts of very adult themes crept into films.
My assumption is that because the movie came out in 1935, it had been designed as a Pre-Code style film but had been re-written for the new sensibilities.
So, on one hand, the film has themes of adultery BUT because it's Post-Code, the people never actually get a chance to consummate their illicit affairs.
The songs in here were nothing special but they didn't detract from the story because they were all short.
I know this movie is supposed to be only a fun one, based on a character that grew on MÃ©xico's mind as a legend because of the way he was caught.
All the other members of his band was female, because they were more loyal, and brave.
Then again, it is a lovable fantasy because it contains so many of our hopes and dreams.
Sadako, right from the start, is treated as a derelict, placed on an island because she sends off "spook signals" to everyone.
The movie begs you to come and see it again because of the truth that it shows.
I thought that it was great because for once, Angus was fighting back.
It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clichÃ© problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy.
Similar to Pretty in Pink, but better because I think there's better chemistry between the actors.
But don't get me wrong, I avoid it not because it's a boring or bad movie, it's that it provokes me mixed feelings.
I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.
This is not a masterpiece but for people who are different, abnormal or rejects from society because of what they look like or how react, this movie can change a life for the better!
Another part of the movie made me realize that we (the not normal people), are braver than those who have it all because we have to face adversity ("Superman is not brave because he is invincible... you're not...")  The music is excellent (most of it by Green Day), especially after his grand-father's death in the park.
it followed the most basic of plot lines, but what i loved about it was the acting, writing, and directing, because those were what made Angus extraordinarily good and unique.
My wife and I rented this movie just because we couldn't find anything else at the time, and did we get a surprise!
"Angus" is in fact a rather painful movie to watch sometimes, because the strongest subject matter it deals with is bullying.
A real shame actually, because those short 15 minutes of highlights really proved that there still was a lot of potential to continue the original story of Ringu.
I didn't wanna know that either, because otherwise the horror simply doesn't work (unless of course it's done cleverly and subtle, like in Ring: that "eye" still scares the life out of me).
The director has explored this topic previously in films such as The Unfaithful Wife and Wedding in Blood (among others), but Pleasure Party stands out because it's an overall much darker tale than what went before, and may well be a contender for Chabrol's all time darkest film.
they weren't grasping at straws (as some have suggested) to follow a successful movie with a moneymaking sequel, because the movies came out at virtually the same time.
Further, you can't judge the first one by itself because the story isn't complete.
It is better if you watch the first one because seeing it will only lead to many questions.
There are a few scenes that are a bit choppy because the movie mixes science and horror, but some of the other scenes are just so disturbing and effective, they make up for the mad-science scenes.
Thus, his wife crossed the border restricted by the Korzybski-functions and is to be condemned because of that.
Therefore, the final question arises: Does the reflexivity which arises when somebody plays himself still belong to Korzybski's principle or does it violate this principle, because self-reflexivity is excluded in a multi-ordinal world?
They don't seem to understand how beautiful and quirky people who are very intelligent, can also be really creepy, because they can see and comprehend things faster than the rest of us, but like Cassandra, are sometimes helpless to change things because everyone else is so slow.
Spoilers Ring 2 is a very, very good film that I gave 8/10 I would have given it a 9 but didn't because it gets a bit to overly supernatural.
And because of this as a whole it loses some of that great spooky atmosphere that made the first film so magnificent.
An adaptation of a KÃ´ji Suzuki novel, 'Ring' had a breakneck pace because of its "race-against-time" plotting, and 'Ring 2' picks up from this by beginning just days after the events of the first film, allowing the audience to observe the aftermath of the terror that Sadako and her tape wreaked on so many people.
If he feels inadequate and helpless in the face of what he can only understand as female weakness, it is because he has bought into women's difference--from men.
She can never finally disbelieve her husband--even the forced foot-licking is not proof-- and so, in the end turns to him in a moment of personal crisis because "she is too scared" to visit alone the tomb of the dear deceased aunt, the woman who raised her.
Sadako, the chairperson of the Ringu villains, is the principal, most focused example of this, primarily because she's had 30 years in a veritable isolation chamber to effectively bury her thoughts.
Maybe, but it doesn't work very well as such because the points are so shakily, ambiguously and infrequently realized in the film.
Don't worry about explanations, character development, or intriguing dialogue because there isn't any.
Really hard to describe because the plotting is so loose that to give away many details both ruins the effect, and don't do the film justice.
Then there's a lonely old man who finds the world contents passing him by with nobody interested in hearing him talk a bit (well, because he's long-winded as well), finding a companion in an angel, whom he asks incessantly about Heaven.
Then there's a boy who has a friend in his piggy bank, and a couple on the verge of being married having to fall out because one of them refuses to grow up.
But of course we all know that there's no silver bullet, and the characters here, though the course of this emotionally moving film, learn of that meaning as it applies in their own, with the old man determined to take a more proactive approach, to a connection between a father and a son, to love found and running parallel to that, a love broken because of sacrifices that one has to make, or the lack thereof, and the maturing of a young child.
I watched this because it is part of a collection of 50 horror movies.
I have a hard time understanding WHY she agreed to do this film because it hits so close to home.
This horrible woman is Harriet Craig, played by Joan Crawford who gave an outstanding performance only because she was actually playing her true self on the screen.
Its unfortunate, because she was on the same level as Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis.
Familiar now, because we've seen Joan spackling her angst all over movie and TV screens for decades, but along with *Mildred Pierce*, *Queen Bee* and *Torchsong*, *Harriet Craig*, at the time, was a new dimension in Joan's personal psychosis committed to film.
Chris Penn yells the whole time and the others are mumbling most of their lines (probably because they are embarrassed by them) so you can't understand a thing, which is probably good because one would realize even more how stupid the story is.
Most Corman films are in black-and-white, but the thing is even the colorized ones tend to look gray because they're usually so drab and depressing(i.e., Gunslingers).
He`s best known for making DRILLER KILLER a movie far better than it`s given credit for and his only mainstream film is BODY SNATCHERS which is a rather unnecessary remake   THE FUNERAL hints that it wants to be mainstream because everyone loves movies about gangsters don`t they ?
I didn't rate this movie higher only because of what I considered flaws in pacing and continuity--as others have noted, the ages of the brothers and their physical dissimilarities seemed peculiar and it seemed to drag at times, but the actors were so good and played their roles with such intensity and skill, and the intelligence and insight of the movie was so sharp that I feel guilty for not giving it another star.
The movies were so good because they were done with a real imagination.
I gave it a 3, simply because I managed to sit right through to the end.
Other than marketing, I have no idea why this never found it's audience and its a shame because it would have been nice to see a sequel that it was set up for at the end.
It's kinda sad now that Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan have broken up because their paring made it all the more special.
It's difficult to find a purely entertaining movie that not only has no flaws whatsoever, but whose virtues are almost consistently wonderful, but InnerSpace might be the one; Dennis Quaid never quite made it as a big A-list star, but here's he wonderfully likable, despite of (actually, maybe because of) his cockiness and smart attitude, and he manages to register a consistent strong presence throughout the film, even though he spends most of the time trapped in his tiny ship, thanks to his performance and his excellent chemistry with Martin Short, who never quite hit the jackpot in another film quite the way he does here.
I was surprised to discover that this film wasn't too successful, because I believe Innerspace is good solid entertainment, albeit daft.
Dennis Quaid makes a likable character as Tuck, because although he is a wise guy, his pep talks to Jack are quite inspiring and how you can learn to take control of your own destiny.
"-like movie I expected because of the language and several sex jokes.
His macho father (an absolutely terrific performance by Kevin Anderson) loves him, but is ever let down by the boy's inability to be more physically active because of his disease.
I'm glad to see a revival of sorts with modern westerns and I find it very difficult to criticise Brothers In Arms too much because with a tweak here and there (granted, one of the tweaks being someone that can shoot action) this really could have been a great film.
The worst acting  The worst clothing (notice I don't call them costumes, because they didn't even attempt to make period clothing.)
I watched the special features on the DVD to see what the maker of this film, Jean Claude, was thinking... because really, a black western?
I will even go so far to say that I can in fact enjoy a good turkey, because it becomes so bad it is actually fun to watch in good company, but this..
I'm guessing because the movie is not even convincing me that it could have been set in any reasonable past time frame.
I gave it a score of one because 'awful' really is fitting.
I thought the music sounded very familiar & I was right because most of it is stolen from The Incredible Melting Man (1977).
Obviously, "Mystery Science Theater 3000" showed "Swamp Women" (alternately called "Swamp Diamonds") because it's such a slipshod production, and because the movie gets silly whenever the women start fighting.
In the first plot, which really is just a filler because they didn't manage to pad out the 2nd plot to last for more than an hour, the good guys need to rescue a little girl who's been kidnapped by her Austrian dad from his American wife.
The only reason no one liked him is because he's a Latino, fair and square.
Kiri Te Kanawa is also a marvel as is Michael Ball (who uplifts the most with his "Love Changes Everything" - which literally had me dancing on my living room floor because of the gospel choir backup).
People who eat gourmet all their lives would mostly likely be put off by junk food, just as people who watch nothing but Bruckheimer films will be unsure of what to make of this (because they're stupid).
This movie was a joke, if I kept on watching it was because my only other option was some Martha Stewart show, and i Can't put up with that since my liver is about to give up on me.
I hope this new clean cut Carlin takes a drink and a couple pills, because this is not the guy that gave us such great stand up's as, "You are all Diseased", "Complaints and Grievances", "Jammin' In New York", "Doing It Again".
So if you feel that this wasn't good because it wasn't as comedic, then i think you completely missed the purpose.
George may not have been as quick as he used to be because his age and drug use has taken its toll.
Carlin also does something in this special that I liked that he rarely does: he referenced a joke from an earlier concert because he got mail from people who didn't understand it and chose to explain it here.
The majority of the material seems to be centered around subjects like death, dying, suicide, murder, and other cheery topics, yet, as always when watching George, I found myself laughing my ass off and agreeing with everything he says because after all these years of pushing the comedic envelope, one constant that has never changed with George is that everything he says is absolutely correct.
The closing segment "Coast to Coast Emergency" is actually a very hopeful piece but I think too many people get confused by it because he's discussing the bitterness of the average person and is revealing that the solution to most people's unhappiness is to rid themselves of their own bitterness.
It's why it is always a risk to tell the truth because most people want to kill the messenger that brings them bad news, especially when that "news" (intentional ignorance actually) is about themselves.
In a way he is even angrier than he was in what I think is one of his very best specials, You Are All Diseased, because this time his anger is loaded at present day subjects which are, quite frankly, infuriating.
I know as a person of Irish heritage I cannot possibly know the struggles she had to endure, but I know my world is a better place because of her bravery both on and off screen.
I applaud all that allowed her story to be told...because she is indeed a woman of many talents and excellence.
Probably this is because since this film he's become so type-cast.
It was interesting seeing John Wayne in a movie where he is not a cowboy because that's what he is mostly know for.
You can easily tell how bored sailors become because of how they acted when the Spanish girls cam on board.
To me I think he was saying that there is no point feeling sad about not being able to be on land because there is nothing you can do to change where you are.
You feel bad for the lives they live because they go through the same routine for such a long time and they see the same people everyday without seeing their loved ones.
To me, it would become really frustrating because I would get frustrated doing the same things and seeing the same people.
It was strange how he died because he was on a row boat hanging on the side of the ship, and when he got shot, the tarp just covered him and nobody really knew when he died.
John Wayne, (Ole Olsen) plays the role of a Swedish seaman who wants to make this voyage on the Glencairn his last, because he wants to go home to his mother's farm near Stockholm, Sweden.
Okay,  Maybe they should have titled the movie differently because it is not just about bees, it is a wonderful feel good movie that can bring hope to those that are feeling down.
It's poor because the story has very little to do with the original Conan Doyle story.
It's bizarre because Reginald Owen seemed a very odd choice for the lead--seeming much more suited to the role of Watson than Holmes.
Also, I am really confused by the film because although it bears almost no similarity to "A Study in Scarlet", the film is very similar to Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" (a.k.a.
"The 10 Little Indians" and another title which I can't use because I doubt if IMDb would allow me to use the original title due to political correctness).
If you ignore all these aspects, you still have a poor film because the film had such poor production values.
I watched this show once in mid 90s on Discovery because I saw Connections before this and liked Burke as the narrator.
I never thought that because of natural temperature change historical events happen.
This is an interesting twist on the otherwise formulaic story because you really don't know who to route for.
This film was also one of Cynthia and Biao's best performances in screen combat during that era but the praise goes to Cory Yuen because of his skillful direction and casting of martial arts action figures from both worlds to pull the strings.
It seems the whole town is held hostage by a mayor who just won't call anyone in on this because it might mess up the chances of the giant superstore people opening up a store in their town, and interfere with the upcoming "festival" (can we say "The Swarm"?).
I guess this is some kind of "the mind protecting itself"-mechanism because Pretty Peaches is god-awful.
I don't usually give the lowest ranking of 1 out of 10 points, but I'll make an exception here because of the rape scene.
Which is a shame, because one of the first ones I ever witnessed was Pretty Peaches I... this movie has it all.
The creatures are genuinely menacing and scary, all the more so because the filmmakers wisely keep the viewer from seeing too much of them.
It is an interesting show because it reverses the series' formula in an interesting manner.
Magnum was a great show because it offered fine actors usually giving excellent performances, great production values, always great music, and almost always interesting, and, frequently very moving, story lines that were typically believable.
People identify "Magnum" with Tom Selleck, and love the show because of him!!
His closest friends are usually in danger-- or killed-- because of him.
Tom Selleck and cast are utterly delightful, and I think this show is quite underrated, because when you take away the car chases there are still first and foremost good story lines and good writing.
You really feel like you know Magnum, and I think it's because he's just a little messed up that makes him feel real to you.
Women liked Magnum because he was so charming and good looking and mischievous like a little boy.
I liked him because, like Duke and Bogie and Gable, for all of his faults, he was a man!
was so popular because your average guy had a definite identifiability with Magnum!!
He was peculiar, because the film was in subtitled French and in English.
I believe that a film of Jess without this scene of the night club and the onlookers does not exist, because if she does not appear us we can imagine easily.
As she is natural Jess relates a history to us in which the important thing is not the argument, in fact the personages are immersed in a mystery, but they are not worried in solving it, and Jess either, because what really it wants it is to show a dance to us of erotics images that, without arriving at the soft-porn, they do not wake up our libido and they soil our glance.
I first started watching Jess Franco movies because I noticed on the IMDb lists that Klaus Kinski was in many of them.
I have to comment on Galloway Grumblefield's reply because I'm another white person (20-something male) who share's his/her sentiments and then some.
This should be required showing in every U.S. and Canadian history class but of course the fundies would most certainly object because of the mysticism.
It should be released as a feature, because it played incredibly well on the big screen at UCLA.
But there is hope for many because the roots of them and the old stories are still there.
Yesterday i bought the movie the Dreamkeeper because the little scenes i saw on TV during a commercial interested me a lot.
I must say that this story was for sure not a disappointment because it is really a beautiful story which is a mix of fantasy, legends and old stories.
In this story a boy from the Lakota Sioux tribe has problems because he has a quilt with an Indian gang.
The maker of this movie also made Arabian nights and you can see it a little back in this movie because the setup is the same because in Arabian nights a woman tells a movie to the sultan she wants to marry.
This story really impressed me and i enjoyed it a lot, also because i am very interested in Indian tribes.
This movie deserves a 9 out of 10 because i kept my attention for the full 3 hours it took, in one word beautiful and well done.
There is plenty of killing but, hey, it's all okay because just about everyone with a gun is really a good person with a nifty sense of humor.
I have personal experience with autism, my sister and I had to leave the theater in the middle of the movie because it so accurately portrays the life of a family that has experience with autism.
This is so bad that I wasted so much free time on this bad special effects film.The bees are fake which don't look scary.Remakes are just not so good these days personally because special effects are what is ruining ferfectly good remakes.
Fraudulently obtained obviously because you didn't like it.
The latter premise is nonsense because our films don't make big Hollywood money whilst the first premise is self-evident by your logic.
I loved it, and even more so because I know what Thomas went through from personal experience.
I gave this movie a 10/10 because I felt the movie portrayed exactly how life is for a family with a disabled child.
He's not able to speak and because he's the size of an adult, caring for him is not easy.
But his tranquil being there is a camouflaged concentration of scene nicety, because all four of them could probably converse in English very well.
Anderson may not have used a straight, constantly progressing story structure before either, but he clearly knows it, because the humor and poignancy come in the way he meddles with non-sequiturs and inconvenient interruptions of rambling.
The lead isn't even much of a hero, because of his terrible acting.
Wes' detractors complain that he is a pretentious one-trick pony, a true statement, but to me, not a negative one because I love his universe and I love being invited into it in every one of his films.
I seem to be griping because Anderson's fifth movie is as good as the others.
And, because of their respective flaws and quirks, they become more than characters; you can see them as people.
Maybe it was because India is so bright and beautiful and exotic, to the tourist's and movie-goer's eyes.
The Darjeeling Limited is a metaphor-laden ride in which the characters all have baggage, both literal and figurative, that they cannot seem to shed because they have yet to understand that they would be less encumbered without it.
Jack is the only one who seems largely unchangedÂis this because the actor was a co-writer?
Even the '70s thriller 'The Swarm' had better special effects than this, probably because the makers didn't automatically switch to a digital solution every time a stunt was involved.
It has absolutely nothing to do with a serial killer of women (the killer in question kills butchers because they kill animals) and Soper accuses his cousin Molyneux of having poisoned his (Molyneux's) wife.
The resolution, such as it is, is a complete lie, because there is no crime, and yet it is brilliantly subversive because it completely disrupts the duplicitous order at the beginning, it alienates people living convenient compartmentalised lives from themselves, forcing them to confront, if only for a moment, their true desires, which contradict their public faces,  DROLE is ridiculously funny, and Prevert's arch theatricality has never been used to greater effect.
In fact I found the final ghost to be humors looking because the actor was just trying to hard to look scary.
I definitely say that you should watch it once especially if you like punk and noisy new wave music ,which I do, because there is lots of it in this film.
It's more a film about growing up and friendship than about sex and punk music but it is quite gritty and real feeling which is good because it is like watching real life only much more exciting.
The thing is, at that age, and in that type of life you live without worrying about the next day because it's just too big a concern to deal with.
It's also important to note that this is not a Hollywood "teen" or "young adult" comedy - it's a drama with a lot of nonsense included, because that's what life is like.
I have owned this movie for quite some time, mainly because SMG is in it and I'm a big fan of BTVS, but I had never gotten around to watching it until last night.
So, I was actually sitting through the whole movie, hoping it would be over soon because I was tired of watching it.
I really laughed at some scenes, not because of comedy content, but because of the stupidity of some scenes that should be frightening.
I would have vote 1 out of 10 but i voted 2 because of this involuntary comedy factor that is present.
I read some great reviews at Movies.com on it and it seems like it is held in great respect by critics who know it was unfairly snubbed by the Academy and even Golden Globes because of a young, yet talented cast with a low budget-an independent film!
Director James Toback originally wanted Leonardo Dicaprio to play the leading role, because of Titanic - he became 'too expensive' which was actually a good thing.
Sarah Michelle Gellar was Toback's first choice to play Cindy Bandollini and despite her heavy schedule and limited time she could spend on making the film because of 'Buffy' I think she did really well.
This is one of those rare movies that you can't wait to see a second time because you want to laugh at how bad it was.
I was expecting the movie to be more offensive because the director has a reputation for doing unspeakable things to females in life, and given his other movies.
I love it when movies inject philosophy into the plot of a film because the film is then acknowledging that something is supposed to be learned by watching it and therefore it isn't stupid.
Meanwhile, the aunts' house staff know all about the double timing and dirty tricks but keep their mouths shut because the women are so close to senility, they probably wouldn't believe them.
The second tells him not to trust the first because, if the priest kills himself, he will go to hell; suggesting- is an eternity of suffering in the afterlife worth sparing him a few minutes of agony in his current life?
Joey Lauren Adams is just good to listen to because she is a bit sexy.
The only reason I saw the entire movie, was because I wanted to make sure the film was bad until the end.
The only reason I didn't give this movie higher marks was because of its ridiculously slow start and poor dubbing.
After having watched this movie Dracula III i thought that they should have kept Stephen Billington as the one and only Dracula in the third movie because he gave it that, how do you say?, mystery and yet at the same time he keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart rate fast and makes you anticipate his beautifully exotic voice.
Well, I think it because they're thought of by all as mysterious and sensuously alluring, but then again that's just me or do other people feel the same too.
I've got to admit i wasn't sure if i was going to like this film because they had yet again changed the actor for Dracula.
As I said, a strong 1, because I can not note it bellow...
Which to me is the best place to film a vampire movie because of the whole vibe that place gives off.
I had reservations about Rutger Hauer playing Dracula simply because the actors used to portray the previous Draculas in the first two movies were hip and hot.
You can't relate to any character because of the bad acting and because they all seems odd.
I laugh about the stupidity of the character and because of some great quotes.
He had promised he'd throw his next documentary online, maybe he threw out this stuff because he didn't want to skimp out on the earning potential of an actual decent documentary he's making.
Also, I don't know how this grade could be so bad, maybe because there's a lot of republicans here.
I'm glad this was free to download or made about as cheap as a film from a major filmmaker (and say what you will, like him or hate him, it's your right either way, he is a major filmmaker now in America), because it is a lessor effort.
Pretty stirring in places, with some good live music thrown in, MM is an excellent orator - let's just hope he never becomes a politician - even though he's got the chops for it - because he is the living proof that to hope is to be an American.
A super comedy that is all the more funny because it deals with real people like you and I.
I searched for that film in every TV schedule for more than ten years...it must have been practically every day, because when I did find it(and made my copy!
I found these comments because I was trying to find a copy of the DVD online, so if anyone hears of of how to find it...share!!
I'm writing this because I see that the DVD has been released on September 28 for $4.95, but I haven't found any information on who released it, where I can get it, or anything else.
I also like the head nurse, because although she wasn't thrilled about him at first, she grew to care for him a great deal, a must see movie.
I was touched by the film because of its storyline of drama, brilliant script, acting and music.
Even though, since... i've seen hundreds of gory films, but this one is still implanted in my head, possibly because it was my first.
Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during the Victorian Age, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (John Hurt), an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as 'The Elephant Man' because of his hideous deformities.
Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintains that freaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they `challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed and sexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.'
Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen.
I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynch deserves no less.
Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.'
I would be pretty happy, though, if Valdez had blown off R L Davis's (Richard Jordan) head, because he is one slimy little creep of a coward who richly deserved it.
The first 30 minutes are rather tame in the gore-department, but still amusing because of the hilariously inept acting and crazy character drawings.
He kills the bandits only because they continue to refuse his small request for an Indian woman who has lost her husband (I think he is killed by the bandits).
In this film Frank seems to be one mean sonofabitch and finds that he is slowly losing his men one by one to a superior enemy he misjudged because of different skin color.
"Let Sleeping Dogs Lie" would be a good title for this film because Burt's past is that of a man who hunted Apaches.
Townsmen and friends alike, know little of him or his background, until an uneventful day when a rich and powerful land Baron, incites all to chase and corner an ex-army soldier because he "looks familiar."
Please, do not watch this film and expect ANYTHING redeeming because you will not find one single thing.
this a great film, if there are flaws, i didn't bother listing it because the story itself shines.
Just because this film bears a typically Troma-like title, and features the Troma logo on the packaging, don't make the mistake of thinking it is a Troma productionÂbecause it isn't.
As an EMT/Firefighter and an embracer of public safety - of course I'm going to love this movie because it involves my favorite things.
I give this a great rating partly because it really hits a lot of areas that I, personally, enjoy.
Frequency is such a wonderful movie because it incorporates a realistic father-son bond, and raw emotion into an action thriller.
This one is special because it does what the Fountain and a number of other, recent "high concept" and "message" films try but usually fail to accomplish in any meaningful fashion.
It teaches love and does so without relying on the tension of plot because as I discovered, it still works after ten viewings when the end is not in doubt and "what happens next" isn't why your eyes are fixed on the screen.
It is because,well, because, there is never, never enough love and this is a way to find a bit more, every time.
I am very glad, because the trailer gives away a big plot twist, which occurs halfway into the movie and I think it is more exciting if you don't see that coming (so I won't elaborate on that part).
This movie has authentic characters that I really cared about, which makes the suspense so much more real because I felt invested in what was going to happen to them.
Well, you have to see it because explaining it just makes it sound silly.
I would most definitely give this movie a 10 because of its awesome performance and its amazing genre.
I hope everyone likes and enjoys it just as much as I did because I know it was good and it deserves a lot of credit.
Remember to also listen to all of the songs Aly and AJ have written because they are all talented!
Sticks and Stones especially because it helps many kids with bullying problems to find their inner self and to stick up to the bully.
I also think this is a really good movie because both Alyson and Amanda M. are very talented not only in acting but singing!
This movie is a wonderful, because it teaches you that just because you are rich doesn't mean you get everything you want.
The Michalka sisters get a lot more than they bargain for when the paychecks at the plant bounce because, Rhoades emptied the accounts of the business and ran off.
After seeing this movie I bought Aly & AJ's CD Into the Rush because I liked the song On the Ride so much!
This movie really surprised me because I thought it was going to be another "dumb blonde" movie but it really had purpose and meaning.The plot line was really good and I think it teaches kids a lot about responsibility and life in the real world.
Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when in pursuit of someone we lust after.
Another outstanding development in the climax is rooted in the relationship between two characters, and works so well because of strong cultural taboos.
While it's probably my least favorite Ring-related film, Ring 0 is worth viewing because of its place in the series and the excellent climax.
This shouldn't be held against them - because not only did each perform solidly, but they definitely played off each other.
There is so much more I could say, but I have refrained from even telling my friends the details because this is a movie best watched unspoiled for the first time.
Don't believe the hype because you'll end up disappointed.
Betsy (the wonderful writer of this amazing film) personally asked me to write something because I had such great things to say about this film to her on Myspace.
I could definitely not refuse her because I want everyone to know what I think of this film.
I was originally going to come to the Newport Beach one but I hadn't been able to because the airline ticket prices went up way too high at the last minute for me to go and I was so disappointed I couldn't go.
I've told some of them to come by and make that known too because there is definitely a market for this movie.
Well, I suggest copying off Betsy Morris's paper because she managed to do just that.
The acting doesn't help much, because the characters are so badly stereotyped that the actors must've felt quite stupid.
I wasn't sure what to expect because I had never seen an independent film before.
The dialog is witty and sharp, the plot elegantly constructed and absorbing, the music masterful (and funny, because it perfectly mirrors the plot and - surprisingly - brings comic relief in a few carefully chosen places), the filming beautiful and professional, and the actors good, funny and entirely believable.
I truly hope the movie acquires a solid distribution deal, because I think it would be a shame to deprive a wide audience of such a delight.
I feared this movie would be WB fare because of the actors involved and the many young audience members at the film festival where I saw it who seemed, shall we say, infatuated by certain actors in the film.
Who hasn't felt like they didn't belong in a certain group or situation because they didn't fit the profile?
A handsome actor gets a role because he is handsome, but is another role denied him because he is too good looking?
Priestly is a nice change of pace because he is allowed to embrace his comedic talent while portraying his most normal and well-adjusted character yet, despite the character's outward appearance.
LEO is the kind of film few people will have heard of--and that your local video store dealer will try to get you to rent because he knows nothing about it, either, and wants you to check it out for him.
I'd not heard of the movie until I saw it for sale that day and bought it merely because Joseph Fiennes was on the cover.
I suspect we will never get the chance to own it for home viewing because of its age-1932, and the unfortunate trend of too many to dislike or ignore films older than six months
Sam explains he has to get to Hell because that is where Hellcop took his fiancÃ©e.
Unsaid at the time because the audience knew what the effects of bootleg liquor were on some people from the Roaring Twenties.
Before the arrival on the scene of Bette Davis, Ms. Francis reigned supreme because of her intriguing beauty and her way of making every character she played a winner.
One really has to view this more as a surreal world with little scenes and parts that are not really connected by any great spine, because otherwise one is to be lost for sure.
One really has to view this more as a surreal world with little scenes and parts that are not really connected by any great spine, because otherwise one is to be lost for sure.
The dream is frightening, because it is endurable only through intense and irresponsible indulgence followed by interminable escape.
It is an id world that must inevitably consume its pawns, because it moves only on primitive drives, a world without innocence, purity, mutual commitments, restraints, or real love.
This film is has bizarre dialog, repulsive images, many freaks of nature, strange music, scenes that don't make sense, and yet at the same time, repeated viewings will show that it does make sense... simply because the moral of this story is that it doesn't make sense, and life can go in a thousand crazy directions, we're all like dice in the hands of fate.
I could not immerse myself 100% in it because the staginess kept reminding me that I was watching a film.
One of the most underrated horror movies of recent years, mainly because it can seem confusing at first glance, and because very few questions are actually answered.
Some examples are as follows:   During the "Death to the Classics" scene, the poet Eumolpo says that the arts have declined because the desire for "virtue" has been lost.
I have to say I'm more on the mesmerized side, because I was mainly focused on the visual/meditative aspects of the movie, not on the narrative ones.
It breathes (it is nearly 3 hours long because it had to be).
The answer arrives when you see it because it is the only day they could have released it.
There's no denying this film couldn't have been made five years ago, not only because the technology wasn't there to make the process of aging backwards look real, but it would've also been a completely different movie as screenwriter Eric Roth wouldn't have been able to bookend the film with Blanchett on her deathbed as Hurricane Katrina comes to literally wipe away her life.
He is a reactive character and because of this you lose interest in his goals.
Maybe because people are so used to seeing visual trash from Hollywood these days, when they get visual trash with some good acting, they call it a masterpiece.
This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before.
I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it.
It displays how we need to live with our mistakes because they are part of our life.
He could have been born as a 100 lb old man, and that could have explained why the mother died, because she had given birth to a 100 lb old man (she could have been a 300 lb pregnant woman, not any harder to believe than Benjamin's condition itself).
But again, the relationship between couple and audience is one-sided, because while we can see why Daisy would wish to return to the rock-steady loyalty of Benjamin, it's unclear what he feels about her other than a regard (she's certainly lovely enough).
"Button" has struck me like this because a recurring theme in the film is that age is only a number, and that we as people can choose what we do with our lives, no matter what our age is.
He is mainly helped out by a magical score, and absolutely stunning cinematography (which immediately identified it as a Fincher film, because of the darkness and lighting of it).
What great family fun, you must have crowded around the fire and watch this movie burn because that is the only thing this movie is good for.
If you want examples I will be happy to give them, but not now because I really don't feel like it, there are too many to mention without being asked for it.
But seriously how on Earth can you call this a good movie, and Michael Medved must be out of work by now because there is no way any decent movie reviewer would recommend this movie to anyone.
Yes, the accents were a little extreme and fake at some points,(maybe I just notice it because I grew up in Athens?)
I am not sure if they did or not, because we got to the part where the "preppy" kids are talking to the guy in the woods and turned it off.
If you love action and don't want martial arts in it, try this film because it is the most stylish, gun crazy film around and I haven't seen a film which comes close to it yet.
Though, I did not have the pleasure of watch this movie with the sound on because it was 3am, I was able to follow along with the subtitles.
Though, I did not have the pleasure of watch this movie with the sound on because it was 3am, I was able to follow along with the subtitles.
They say it is bad because the dubbing is bad (that is the crappy American company that sold you the movies fault, not the movie) or the transfer was bad.
This isn't the greatest action movie ever simply because every action seen tops the other and they are so superbly choreographed.
He is not at all standard in his portrayal because, as he clearly shows it, he does not begin from cinema clichÃ©s, but from a true grasp of his role's requirements.
Definitely one of the true 'must see' films of the nineties, not only because it was the first to fully establish John Woo as the master of action movies and Chow Yun Fat as a superstar, but because it has had a massive influence on every action movie made since, and is easily one of, if not the best action movies ever.
And also, the American audience probably liked the action because the setting was very different.
Too bad this isn't remastered because the current DVD version is an obivious public domain copy.
He doesn't show realism and humanism in this film, because he wanted to emphasize and slightly exaggerate on how big the elements can go.
To action junkies, this movie is an easy 9, because the only thing that really matters is that the action is superb and the other elements, if not stellar, don't detract enough from the action to really make a difference.
And if you thought Sadako couldn't be scarier than when she crawled out of the TV in Ring, sit tight - because Sadako's still got a few tricks up her elongated sleeve, including a finale that will have people of a nervous disposition reaching for the 'off' button on their remote control.
There's not much more I can say because actions speak louder than words.
Release was withdrawn from circulation for the Dallas magnicide(1963) because the events are pretty similar.Frank Sinatra(JFK's friend) as producer ordered the retaining copies and the movie was forgotten,however long time after was issued in video market and obtained many success.
This game is really the top of the cream and will be for a long time because there hasn't been any game like this before..at least not as good.
Here Alfred "Battling" Butler, a spoiled rich young man - in order to keep his girl - lies about being the lightweight boxing champion of the world, because that guy, who has the same name as him, is a hero and he wants to impress her and her big brother and big father.
He wants to marry her right away because she's pretty and she consents as soon as she hears he's a big shot.
That's because this film is much more plot driven and character driven than most silent comedies--and that works well for me, though you might miss the more acrobatic and violent character he plays in his shorts and in some of his full-length ones.
Instead of Buster going to propose, he sends his butler--who immediately knows her dad will say "no" because he wants a virile, more "studly" son-in-law.
The plot is predictable - Italian male professional, married with family has to leave town because of a family crisis.
I bought this movie as part of the The Scorsesee Collection because I wanted Goodfellas and Mean Streets.
A shame, because it's the type of storytelling that I sorely miss and that has been largely absent in cinema since the early 70s.
The dialogue in the scene is also wonderful, and not at all plot-oriented - arguably because there was no semblance of a plot yet but also because both Keitel and Bethune speak and act naturally, as two people who are simply interested in what the other has to say.
This is a hard movie to review because it's essentially an amalgam of several different shorter student films, and some work better than others.
I must wonder to tell you the truth because when it comes to a night out with the great (Marilyn Monroe), and a chance to kiss her too ..HHHHOOO this is wild man..Very wild..
So all the rest of our silly, foolish, and risky actual life is more fantastic because we actually lived it.
Still the part of the kiss is such a magical cinematic moment and one of the most immortal kisses I've ever seen as well, not only because its achievement of what any fan of (Marilyn) dreamed of (getting a special kiss from her) but also because it was one unforgettable hot kiss in so colorfully sensual close up.
It might be gritty but only because characters say things like " Ah'm thru wid chew you motherf--kin' ho " while the drama elements never come to the fore .
He wouldn't do the stupid gangster films the other rappers do because he takes the job seriously; so seriously he wrote his own neighborhood and people story, which is unexpectedly touching in its most impressive moments.
His gift as a director (because he could have sucked) comes with the importance he gives to the camera.
I particularly liked Skyhawks because most of my immediate family are/were licensed pilots (Dad, Mom, me), and it was near unbelievable to see a kids' show devoted to our passion.
It begins with a poor little boy who cant have a toy gun because his mother wont let him and the sheriff who's dying to do the single mom buys it for him anyway; way to go sheriff, that'll get you some!
It is strange that he tells her the story because she has been a part of his life since childhood.
This movie's plot does hold your interest, partly because there is an organized, well financed conspiracy involved in the attempt, compared to the "lone nut" from history.
I can't quite bring myself to give this a 10, because the plot suffers the same way all morality plays do.
I think it's more of a psychological western in which Robert Mitchum works out his own salvation rather than get the help of a doctor like Ingrid Bergman who wouldn't have been available back then because Dr. Freud was just starting to develop his theories around the time this was made.
An oddity of sorts because Pursued is thinly embracing a number of genres, stretching the elements of each strand to create a film that once viewed, leaves one very intrigued as to its purpose......... 7/10
I say the latter because of all the stark black-and-white contrasts, night scenes and facial closeups.
He's gambler, willing to risk whatever he has (here he loses his stake in the Callum ranch on a coin toss) because he knows in the end the best he can hope for, as he says in OUT OF THE PAST, is to "lose more slowly."
I give this movie 8 out of 10 solely because of the laugh-out-loud level.
This award winning series also provides the brilliant western episode:'Gunmen of the Apocalypse'   Series VII: This is the weakest series in the show, mostly because of Chris Barrie's (Rimmer) departure from the show, to concentrate on 'Brittas Empire'.
I think it went crap because Rob Grant stopped writing and left Doug Naylor on his own.
I was a bit hesitant about renting out "Red Dwarf" the first time one of my friends recommended it too me but I got it out anyway because I always like finding a new fantastic show, and this was definitely all that and more.
Countless are the times when you will be watching red dwarf and you will literally have to pause the DVD because you are laughing so much.
Just because it didn't have as many laughs as the other series doesn't make it crap.
Series eight was funny because the seriousness of seven wasn't needed anymore, besides, Holly was back.
The series bugged me, but maybe that's because I'm not too fond of series and fond of sci-fi movies.
Watching Red Dwarf not only makes the viewer laugh, but the characters are so likable that watching it gives a deeper form of entertainment because the characters almost become like friends.
Its such a shame because in the early days of Dwarf, there simply wasn't anything better on TV.
Mainly, because, I would love to know more people out there would get the chance to see this movie.
If mother-daughter stories touch you, be sure to bring at least one whole box of tissues, because you WILL need them.
:D The background story to the beast and its motivation close before the final and the portrait of it really gave the whole thing more depth to it and i liked it very much, because that way you can just be all "alienhating" over the course of the whole movie and get this slight "oh noes i feel bad for them" feeling right before it ends :D I like that the viking cast does not only consist of 2 meter man with 1 meter broad shoulders grunting and shouting, but that they are more displayed as humans, normal men (unlike Pathfinder / King Arthur), which i honestly had expected to happen, because of the "B-movieish" kind of nature of the main idea for the movie.
It does not have many faults, most of them are because of the lower production values of the movie, but they really pushed themselves and I wish this movie the best of success and want to see more of this kind of well-done-entertainment!
One can see the maturity of those involved to endow us a jewel, because when you think of how the dilemmas and dramas intermix in rivalry from different clans, the characters are all blessed with the intelligent mindset of the makers of this movie.
Simply because it probably didn't overdo it, like a uncertain pleader who would try to hard to convince it with fancy words and show, rather then solid statements.
Im in the same mood as i reviewed a drama a couple of hours ago, so don't think I'm being generous, because i shat on that so called 10 star flick.
Whatever, though - the box office opportunity was wasted because someone or other didn't have faith in humanity (I mean seriously, anyone with a droplet of testosterone in them would find this highly entertaining, so of course there's a market for it), but this movie's cult status is assured.
I give it a 9 out of 10 because nothing is perfect.
I must say that this film was a great surprise, not only because of my personal taste for sci-fi / fantasy flicks, but because this production is flawless.
It's one of those movies I would buy on DVD and i've had a look on the official site etc..The positive feedback i've seen lately seems to have had an impact because the straight to DVD option has been shelved and the UK distributor has changed the release date from Feb to the Easter break.
A pity about that because it looked like the story had more to offer and was chopped up somewhat to fit in a bunch of set pieces.
The only reason I watched this film was because of Megan Ward but I'm glad I did.
I really only watched it because it's opening screen was the Bakersfield street sign.
I caught this on the Lifetime Movie Network and watched it because Megan Ward of "General Hospital" was in it.
Or you might want to rent it because the sex stuff is cut on TV.
I found this at an "everything $1.00 store" and bought it just because Sinatra was in it.
Not because Europeans were "bad" but simply to see something before it's changed dramatically.
In my opinion, John Goodman should've been picked for this particular role because he definitely had Gleason's build and look.
This film would have merited a rating a ten from me, but I gave it a seven because of the casting choice of Brad Garrett and the film's failure to show us the complete career of Jackie Gleason, who will always be The Great One in the hearts of his many fans.
I am a big fan of the first movie - "Zenon girl of the 21-st century", and after watching the first sequel I thought to myself that they ruined the whole story and the illusion, I saw this movie because there was nothing else to see on TV, and I'm glad I did, because this movie brought back my admiration to this story.
I don't watch this show, because I actually have a significant IQ, but I've heard about some of the episodes on my local radio station.
They were born spoiled and don't have to work, because their parents give them money and subject themselves to their demands.
Watching the TV over my sister's shoulder, I am seeing a teenage girl go into an "I'm going to look stupid in front of all my friends" mood just because the entertainment is cancelled.
It wouldn't occur to them that there are 16 year olds waiting on tables or stacking supermarket shelves to make themselves a bit of spending money because their families are on the breadline.
I give this show 3 stars, because: 1 star.- It's the worst rating a show can get here.
In some episode, this girl was SO UPSET because her mommy gave her as a gift, a FABULOUS car, three days before the girl's birthday.
They go because it's free, there's going to be delicious food and some hip hop star guy will perform there.
Still, I watch the show because it's SO bratty that it keeps me entertained for some half hour.
He thinks he is better than Booth and the other assassins, because he has his escape planned - although Gleason warns him he'll never get away with it.
He also dismisses the men who hired him because immediately as the President dies he'll be replaced by the Vice President.
That is what is wrong with the world, people like those girl think they are large and in charge because their parents are super-rich and own a couple cars and a pool.
Enjoy the cars because you have little chance of becoming employable.
Even if this show is a deliberate strike at the heart of human decency the fact this point is not made obvious (perhaps because of the increasingly shallow context of MTV) could even be considered quite dangerous owing to the fact that the intended audience really are too young to realise just how this sort of attitude blights society.
It's a real shame, because these kids are very ungrateful, even though their family has more money than just about most other families in the entire world.
I feel that rich people are rich because they work hard.
It seems like this kids have no appreciation of their parents or even realize how lucky they are because they are only part of a small minority who can actually afford Sweet Sixteen parties like theirs or their parents want to spend so much money.
It is a lame show and unrealistic because how can a bunch of teens afford their Sweet 16 for over 9000 bucks?
These are people who are annoying beyond belief, because if something doesn't go their way, such as their favourite celebrity won't be showing up because he/she had other plans (like WORKING), or the fact that the parents won't let them buy the $300 dress that makes them look like a whore, then they bitch, whine and moan until they get their way.
They act like they are so high and mighty...just because Daddy has a few million pounds in the bank, doesn't really help the fact that they are ugly, stupid, stuck up and not likable at all.
I am glad this was banned in the United States, because it shows a total lack of professionalism in regards to theft of ideas.
It's a bit strange that this one is so unknown, because I think it would have been popular at the cinema.
his daughter, Jenny, loses her leg to a shark, a toy helicopter crashes replacing real one, a man's legs is torn of, oh and it made me smarter because in the movie, sharks roar, are made out of rubber, bob up and down, and look real fake.
I've seen lots of Frank Sinatra movies and I never liked any of them, because I think he is a terrible actor in all those movies (and that goes for films like "From Here to Eternity" and "Some Came Running", which the critics always claim to be "wonderful - come on!).
It's good, and doesn't bore you because it doesn't go on and on and on like most films nowadays about somebody wanting to kill the president of the USA.
However, this non-straight format is essential because the films aim is not just to tell a simple story.
The woman does not pee on Singapore Sling, she tries to kill him with water released from a valve because she does not know what else to do.
I believe the stories that this was pulled from circulation simply because I had never heard of it before.
Years later, I've seen many, many such films, but SS still holds a very special place in my heart, simply because not only is the film truly demented, but it's also very well done, which is rare for an exploitation film.
I had the luck to find a sub-titled version of this movie because otherwise, I wouldn't understand the plot, which is minimal, but still explains (or tries) some strange situations of the movie.
The male lead is mysterious and a bit unworldly, the young girl is definitely crazy but mainly docile because she doesn't know any better and the adult lady can't possibly be categorized.
We didn't know, because the series was canceled at that precise moment.
And I love the character of Carrie Fairchild, maybe because she was like the first Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) Carrington my favorite Dynasty character: a spoiled rich girl, intelligent, cunning and ambitious to get what she wanted.
Rating 2 out of 10; a point for the girls each because I honestly felt sorry for them.
In short, I enjoyed this movie, because it introduces some character development in a genre where it is often conspicuously absent.
It is a great game and even better on computer because the computer won't screw up every ten seconds like the original Nintendo did.
Dramas such as "Rebecca" (Hitchcock) or "Now, Voyager" (Bette Davis), which are still some of my all-time faves, fare much better because technology won't really make them better; they already have great direction, story, pacing, acting, etc.
I slept through many parts of the movie simply because it is so dull.
maybe it wasn't at the time the movie was made but it only make sense to review it by today's standard because people live and watch movie in the present.
Obviously a lot of people love this film, but I'd give it only 7 out of 10 because it's way too long, over 3 hours.
(For example, what's the value in judging Billy Wilder's best _at the expense of_ those by Ernst Lubitsch, or vice versa, simply because both had Germanic backgrounds and exiled to America and excelled at witty romantic comedy?
Or with OTT 'mood music' to prompt you how to feel because the script isn't up to the job.
But its well worth a look because if you like it, you are liable to love it.
I also felt that the whole idea of researching abilities really slows the game down and because the AI opponent always start with a big head start you spend a lot of time waiting for research to be done to be able to match you AI opponent.
He cannot share these tensions with Lucia because he thinks he is too poisoned within.
Or not really, because he is still in touch with Luna's mother Elena through anonymous internet chat.
It's because she is on that island that Elena gets to meet Lorenzo, and she really reunites Lorenzo and the mother of his child, resolves their story.
Further, in StarCraft, the campaigns are meant to be played in a specific order, because they are not concurrent, but rather entirely different chapters in this wonderful complex story.
StarCraft, like WarCraft 2, has a built-in map editor, although it is more difficult to use, simply because the game is more complex.
Julio Medem could be to work at a doctor, if it's possible he could be better professional, because as a filmmaker is very poor.
I only saw this Israeli film because I wanted to see Ronit Elkabetz and she blew away the scenes she was in but overall, her appearance was much too brief.
I also recommend 'The Band's Visit' with again Ronit because this had to be an embarrassment to everyone who worked on this production.
Did they think that putting the zoo in this movie would bring more tourists in, because I would think it would do the opposite.
I did not see anything THAT bad about this movie, because while it is cheesy and overrated in some scenes, it's total fun and a complete delight.
Not many people might have heard of this movie and I believe it is their loss, really, because they're missing out on a very interesting movie with a decent story and plot that you can just get a good kick out of.
Supposedly because Japan became by far economically richer and this film lost its conviction in present Japan.
Kurosawa never ceases to amaze me because of his incredibly acute comprehension of the visual effects of a story.
The more it becomes a day in the life, the more upsetting we find the challenges facing them because of the Occupation and the crumbling economy at the time.
Something happens, and it's resolved... something else happens, and it's resolved.. and none of these things really get to you because they are so incredibly predictable and unnecessary, mixed up with pretentious horror-like cut-scenes to spice things up, which instead ridicule the whole deal even more..
because it seems lots of Japanese films are.
Uniqueness: 8 - Maybe its because I've seen a lot of Japanese horror/thriller but this one wasn't about one crazy guy trying to kill everyone, or a group of school kids killing each other.
Dodos argues that ID succeeds in the public arena because it tells a simple story, while the truth is much more complex.
Evolution succeeds because it is such a simple explanation; ID succeeds when the simplicity of Evolutionary theory fails to account for the evidence.
Granted, the movie can be hard to follow because of the vast amounts of symbolism and somewhat confusing story line, but it becomes very clear by the half-way point.
Whether you believe in ID or don't, when it comes to whether ID should be taught in science class, it is clearly unreasonable to think that it ought to be, because science is a completely different way of looking at the world than that implied by ID.
The debate is important because it is evidently not going to go away by itself.
I can't see both views being given equal weight in biology classes because, if Darwinian evolution is "only a theory," as the ID people argue, then Intelligent Design hasn't yet cleared even that bar.
Things are complicated for Jakob when his friends start to believe that the bulletin came from a radio that Jakob owns - a radio which doesn't exist - and begin to hound him, some for more information, and some because they want him to destroy it before it destroys them.
Sex is gorgeously photographed but plain, perhaps too caste in feeling, in fact most of it is boring, possibly because of the lack in dramatic tension (very far from the heat accomplished by masters like Nicholas Roeg).
While people who say the "holocaust film" has become a trite and overdone genre may be correct, this film is an outstanding piece of work that suffered mainly because it was released around the same time as the fairly similar "Life is Beautiful."
Maybe the reason I keep hearing so many negative comments on this film is because people aren't seeing it for what it is.
The other performances faded into the background, not because they were bad but because Williams so dominated the movie.
A world-famous cardiologist, Kirschbaum, because he is Jewish, is forbidden to practice medicine, and ends up cleaning toilets.
It's a conflict that you sit there knowing what needs to happen for a happy ending and so you sit there and hope for that, because every option has terrible consequences.
Jakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased.
Pass the word on because this is one film you don't want to miss out on.....
The writer twisted the order and events of the movie because he can't write.
I don't think people champion films like this because Byler avoids the cheap tricks that plague so many of the films that are coming out of the independent production world.
The characters involve us but they aren't always easy to relate to because if we're honest with ourselves we'd find they are uncomfortably a lot like us.
I liked Julio Medem's "Vacas" and "Los amantes del cÃ­rculo polar" very much (I have not seen "La ardilla roja" but I've been told it's good), but this time I found his movie so ridiculously pretentious and boring that I could not believe my ears (because my eyes were more or less fascinated by the vistas.)
If I had to articulate why I liked this movie, which is really a character study more than anything else (and I love character studies - maybe it's why, in fine art, I like still lives, too), it is because it is so true to the characters.
It's positive because that conception is the way life is and there is no real need for it TO develop.
Afterwards, I realized it was because the situations that the characters were put in and the way they responded to those situations was so true.
I was kept rapt by the action because I wanted to find out how each character would respond to each situation presented and, in every case, it was so natural and easy and, most important of all, believable, that it was gratifying to watch.
Visually it's got problems because much of it was shot on digital.
6 out of 10 because it kept me thinking and I'm confident that both the director and actor/actresses have the talent to create even better art in the future.
I loved the simple sets and uncomplicated camera work because it reminded me a lot of the recent Taiwanese movies I liked.
Yet, inevitably, because of this rarity, we can't but be intrigued as we watch these people behave as all Americans do, yet with a grace and refinement so unique to Asian culture.
This is really a shame, because being in love with a woman that only wants to be your friend is a situation in which most men can relate.
Lori is the pretty and sweet girl that always feels unsatisfied in relationships because she's always attracted to emotionally unavailable men.
It is my belief that most of the American public shuns this film because it is too truthful about emotional isolation and social isolation.
this version aired in the 80's when i was just around 10 years old, i remember so well watching with my mother and loving it so much because we had the soundtrack with Robert Goulet singing...he kissed my mother at a concert in Edmonton when she was a young girl...tragic that the world only knows the gene Kelly version...he is not an issue, just the whole movie, all dancing and the singing is weak.
I liked it better than Gene Kelly's version because I love Robert Goulet's singing.
Ok... Maybe I enjoyed this film because I clearly went to see it with a bunch of misconceptions...
I suspect this is because the premise of the film was to write a story where if you didn't like the ending, there was an escape hatch to return to the middle - which it did.
I'm from Scotland, & the Kelly version just didn't have it, even although it was entertaining, but the 1966 Goulet version was more realistic & caught the essence of the highlands, I know because, I was a youth hostel member & my happiest memories are when my group of mates & I would travel all over the highlands, magic.
because they are all dead on.
I suggested a foreign art film because I was getting sick of all the Hollywood story lines that were starting to look alike.
The colors in the film are also unique in that I'm sure they were chosen so that your eyes would not wear out because of so much life you see.
perhaps i appreciate it more because i went to a boarding school as well and i can relate to a lot of it.
It's not fair to compare The Smokers with Heathers because Heathers characters were never this *@#%" Up!
all in all the film had a happy ending because the dumbest girl who started it all died.
The acting was good, but mostly because there was a great book and a great direction behind it: MÃ©dem's work was remarkable.
I, however, was only glued to the tube because of my favorite actors, Dominique Swain and Oliver Hudson.
Still, because of the interesting plot, Thora's amazing scene, Swain's good acting, and my ability to chuckle at Loeb every other scene, I gave it a pretty high ranking in my book.
So these three girls are outcasts, because they smoke but mostly because they are infantile.
You recognize her voice more than her face and it takes a while because you are struggling internally with disbelief, like if Emma Thompson had made an appearance in "The New Guy".
they feel powerful because they're wielding guns, but they're weak without them.
Thora Birch must be trying to earn indie cred by appearing in this right around the time her career was taking off, and she does have one of the better moments towards the beginning involving playing a Russian roulette-type game with an almost completely loaded gun, but the fact that the gun is loaded is the only fascinating part about this scene because her acting isn't particularly stellar.
It works really well because the science-fiction takes a back seat to realism and characters.
It was Stan's idea to come to Switzerland to sell mousetraps because it's where cheese comes from.
They are obnoxiously rude to the chef because he has no apple pie.
Stan thinks that they will be able to sell mouse traps to the Swiss because there are more mice there than anywhere else in the world.
I have started watching the US version but it's not as good because somethings i don't understand what they are talking about because some words are different in the US.
Its less than intelligent in the level of the story: lust drives meaning, but that's because the written novel is at that vulgar level.
One intelligent, educated young man said he didn't like to watch it because "you have to pay attention."
Newsflash: Just because it's gay doesn't mean it's mysterious.
This is definitely a must see simply because of its history, and its future impact on the underground movement of the 1960s.
Interesting note: Jean Genet was a petty thief himself, but was saved from incarceration by the director Jean Cocteau because of a poem he wrote.
Again, because of Genet's own tastes, there is an element of sado-masochism mixed into the eroticism: indeed, all the characters but one are oppressed prisoners, literally in "bondage."
I don't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because I walked out.
When I first saw this I did not know what to think because I had seen Pryor in several movies, but I had never seen him do his stand-up comedy.
At first I started to crack up because he was insulting this guy taking his picture, which to me when a comedian includes the audience and insults them it really makes the performance a very funny one.
People who never try foods because they are'nt the strict "meat and potatoes" they are used to will never know the wonderous flavors available beyond their meager appetite.
And because of that you'll laugh so hard your gut will bust.
Thinking about the loss of Richard Pryor makes me want to cry because i feel like he was someone i knew personally,thats the effect Richard Pryor had on everyone that watched him pro-form on stage,he broke the color line,even thought he is clearly a African American man,Richard Pryor made people of other races so comfortable listening to jokes revolving around race and social status.
In my opinion we never gonna see anything like this again because Pryor delivered the funniest and most high class comedy ever.
No doubt this is because comedy is the hardest thing to do.
Not everyone is able to watch this film not because it has unsuitable content (it is PG) but because it requires a maximum amount of patience.
The filmmakers took 2 hours & 10 minutes to tell the story although it could even be made in 1 hour 30 minutes because it is an adaptation from an Old Russian short story called "White Nights".
I thought it could have been much better if the director tried to show her love towards Ranbir as her acceptance due to his devotion and not because Salman has not come.
Saawariya is not such a astonishing well-made picture.it is just because i've seen Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas,Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,Khamoshi & Black.between all Saawariya is my least favorite.any of those films are memorable.not just for it is so artistic,but the myth inside of em gave me pleasure.now it comes to Saawariya,which is a dramatic/Romance part of a tail.it's an adaptation from The White Nights.it is not a good adaptation.just for it low potential for turning a Russian story to a musical movie of Indian cinema industry.
The songs are picturised nicely, but because the movie is 2.5 hours, i don't think any of the songs are the complete track.
For once he is restrained and doesn't overact because he doesn't have much of a character.
I have read most of the other comments, but they don't do justice to it, mainly because of the lack of understanding the original tongue of this film.
My rule of thumb is that i don't watch any new actors because they simply cant act and make the movie unbearable to watch, BUT the rookie Kapoor's were amazing.
Without being driven by my emotions for SRK(whom I really admire), I think Saawariya is a much much better movie than OSO - I hate comparing them but that seems to be the way people want to judge it.Saawariya is definitely SLB's best work , is breathtakingly beautiful and has wonderful acting which confuses me because inspite of all this it tends to get boring.
Also, it emphasizes the contrast in society: when the whole city of prostitutes yearns for love (because they are not loved by anyone), the Prince of Love gives his heart to a woman, who already has the love of another person.
I say this because the characters and their chemistry can make you feel that it is out of the world.
Sonam is a beauty- the type that you don't lust for because it's so pure- the type you fall in love with.
it is true that it's not mass appealing, because it doesn't have the jhatkas and the matkas in it.
I like that movie because the actors can interpret what the character need them to act.
But this goes one step further: What part is in the eye of the beholder here, because little clues are given so the mystery format is only used to keep us entertained at a basic level.
Maybe it is because some of its cool and innovative cinematography?
Maybe because the movie had some strange but strong feel, an atmosphere to it.
Maybe it's because I thought Kelly Lin was such a hotty.
I can't really comment on anyone's Cantonese because I don't speak it.
The Curse of Monkey Island was one of the best because it was one of the funniest and better graphics than the first two.
The making of footage on the flip side of the DVD is equally nifty, because seldom will a film include multiple agonizing takes of key scenes both action and non-action so that you might understand how excruciatingly demanding and exhausting film making can really be.
Their campaign of terror against voters by cutting off voters' hands and feet made the elections much more difficult and costly because many voters were refugees.
Nigeria has a strong friendly relationship with Sierra Leone because many Nigerians attended Fourah Bay College in Freetown.
But, the truth is that Nigeria acted because no one else would.
While this film is by no means a stroke of genius, it has its many flaws (compounded by the fact that it was never theatrically released because of the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games in 1980), it is definitely worth a look.
Not because it is 26 years old, but because it is so great and there are no others like it.
However that hardly matters because the real pleasure lies in the smart script, engaging vocal performances and first rate character design.
I saw this film as a kid and really loved it, mainly because of the imaginative and funny uses of different animals competing in certain sports (i.e.
Squid in the Bobsled, Otter for the swimming, Frog for the high jump, Bull in the boxing etc etc etc) but also because of the terrific soundtrack and songs by Graham Gouldman of 10CC.
Too bad too because although Meyer improvised by reshooting footage of huge-breasted Uschi Digard (and who can argue with that?
Also absent was the choice of "light" and "mega" that was present in other games, because playing on lite first for a little while might have been helpful for "getting used" to the game before really going for it.
I was disappointed to hear that the creators of the game didn't include little Wally because they didn't like his character, because I (and many others, I'm sure) thought he added a nice touch to the whole game, along with helping move the plot along.
He must have gotten him from the zoo in Mombasa because as most kids know, tigers aren't native to Africa.
I had to review this film here, as terrible as it is, just because all of the other reviews were positive.
This is a totally awesome movie not because of awesome special effects, not because it is particularly well written, not because it is at all believable because trust me it's not very realistic at all.
The Walk Like A Man works because, it is funny and it has an awesome message.
I really only had difficulty in one section and that is only because I was pushing the wrong button like an idiot.
I liked how the movie had its twists and turns, and the fact that he keeps changing from human to animal like made it more affective because it shows the struggles people go through.
It is one of those movies that hardly anyone has heard about because if they did, you would have a fairly long conversation about it no matter good or bad.
This is a great movie i strongly suggest that you pick it up if you get the chance it is exactly what a movie should be an escape from reality do not listen to all the people badmouthing it the only reason they do so is because they either have no sense of humor or they think that the only thing that people should watch is social commentaries and reality shows i personally think that movies need to go back to this state where it was about the movie itself and not just the special effects i think it is sad that most modern day movies rely only on the eye candy, this movie is a great movie to sit down in front of and just forget the outside world exists at all
Plan 9 From Outer Space by the notorious filmmaker Ed Wood was so bad it was good, a laugh a-minute because it was intended to be serious.
The CIA is after Ms. Porcupine and her pals because she and her two friends broke into some Roswell type of secret lab where the Spider was gestating inside a dying Astronaut.
In the fifties horror movies always contained giant insects, probably because the creators thought this was the best way to scare the audience.
That's right: a good laugh, because the spiders in this movie are so huge that it makes you forget that you should be scared.
Well no, because than it might still have been quite good, but the directors made such a big mess out of it, that you can only laugh.
This movie was recently shown on the Sci-Fi Channel much to my delight as I really didn't want to rent this when it came out on video because the box cover made it look like cheap straight-to-video trash.
)and especially : Bad casting (although the Male lead character who's name escapes me DID closesly resemble a HeMan type o' guy...)  If you are into this kind of "underground" movies, go right ahead and take a good laugh at it before you return it to the video rental store, because I know you won't laugh as easily if you decided to actually buy this one....
The plot, effects and seriously bad acting are'nt even laughable i would give this film a 0/10 if possible, don't waste time buying this film because you WILL take it back  thank you, stephenquinn
Couldn't stop laughing the whole way through this movie, simply because they were trying to be serious.
i wont tell u the end because hopefully by now your on the edge of your seat and you will have to by or rent this movie 9/10
made me at least chuckle at times, because they often raise valid points regarding the absurd setting of the film, and do it with subtlety.
It was a product of the times and can't be completely ignored just because it makes people uncomfortable--especially since this is such a super-important film to our film history.
And the scenes with Natalie Schafer are very difficult to watch because it's so sad to see her in such a terrible state.
If there is a place where I can go and request this film, please tell me so I can add my voice to yours because I agree this is a story worth hearing and Cristina Raines is one of my favorite actresses.
Dame Wendy Hiller is not prized for this film because she is found selfishly hogging the screen, but because she and her fellow storytellers, bring their whole beings to the roles they present.
We both want to see it now, me because I loved it so much originally, and her because I've told her about how great it is, and how sad it is, and how its the type of movie that never leaves you, once you've seen it, it just touches you.
Someone asked me at a job interview who my most influential person and I said Jacquelyn Helton because she had the courage to do what she thought was right all the while knowing what the outcome would be.
I have it from an inside source the reason the series was canceled was because Eisner and Katzenberg were having a pissing contest.
Much of the film was shot in the director's home town of Rochester, its worth seeing if you live there because of all the recognizable land marks.
But it's this warmth that's much harder to analyze because it is not carefully calculated.
Why this series isn't available on commercial release is a mystery, because they just don't get any better than this.
We know the film is set in 1930 instead of the 1890's because Holmes deduces that Watson is having trouble with his car, but we never see any cars Â or much action of any kind.
Lloyd Kaufman personally recommended this film to me because I said that my favorite filmmaker was Jodorowsky -- and while this isn't really anything like Jodorowsky, it is still absolutely genius and is essential viewing for anyone interested at all in "avant-garde cinema".
One night, when his own date is ruined because Lucy doesn't come home as promised, Danny returns first and drives Ian home.
I said I don't know what I was thinking because I became very absorbed in this story and cried through most of it, hating myself every step of the way for watching it.
The movie was a bit of a drag for me because as an Indian I already know the stark contrast between the kind of people who travel to the US.
Paresh Rawal doesn't need much of writing because he delivers much more than what is expected of him.
Things get even more convoluted when our team receives word the mine needs the cannon, like, now because some miners are trapped and - cue ominous trumpets - Forster's brother is among them.
This is indeed an odd flick and I assume Bogart agreed to star in it because it more closely represented his real-life political and social beliefs.
I assume that MANY who saw it in 1949 were VERY disappointed because instead of the tough guy Bogart, he is a lawyer who decries the evils of slums and how it produces career criminals.
That's unfortunate because the lawyer's part is both marginal to the plot and strictly one dimensional -- that of a "tough love" social reformer.
But conflict they do, because the slum scenes bring out the expressive artistry of director Ray, while the high-key lighting and prolonged dialog of the court resemble the boilerplate of the old Perry Mason show.
This twist is jarring, because it abruptly overturns both movie convention and audience expectations.
It's fairly short, but sort of drawn out at the same time because this whole story of a demented young individual poisoned by the ravages of civilization has been told many times before and in better situations.
Of course they can't use that name because this man has hair, The real Kingpin of crime is BALD!
Stan Lee criticized the movie because of daredevils costume and a few other things, but frankly for the budget (and all the early marvel movies were low budget with an oddly 1970's feel),the director and cast have managed very well.
The film focuses a little more on Matt Murdock and his alter ego Daredevil then David Banner and the Hulk manly because this film was going to start the Daredevil TV show.
For the most part, I enjoyed the Trial of the Incredible Hulk like I have the other movies and the series, but as a purist fan of the series, I wound up disappointed with this movie because I feel it was the farthest away from the series.
Most of this is because he's feeling that life has somehow passed him by--he's a relic of the past.
The theme of this episode is living in the moment and while this installment of the series isn't as weird or unpredictable as most, it manages to work well because of the nice leisurely pace that was created by Aherne.
No need to change the script even, because it already contains a decent twist around the middle part, which in today's suspense cinema has become a must.
Actually, they might want to make the bats virus-infected this time, because how in this film they manage to kill off adults in a couple of minutes with a dozen bites or so, is beyond me.
Sure, the special effects are rather inferior to today's modern technical improvements, but they didn't seem to bother me all that much because I found the cast so much fun to watch, and the premise was quite enjoyable.
Only this movie is at least a gazillion times better than and Big Brother edition you ever saw, because it has genuine suspense, a formidable cast of characters, plot twists you actually don't see coming and Â not to forget Â thousands of bloodthirsty bats!
i watched this film years ago, and was pleasantly surprised how effectively scary it was because i'd never heard of it.
He survives the attempt because, at the exact same moment, his body becomes possessed by the furious spirit of a murdered gambler.
What connection did this have to anything about the animal rescue, just because it was New Orleans?
Some people have a problem with movies like that because when people see a documentary, they expect to be schooled in something or preached to.
My iTunes has grown a lot because of the undiscovered, amazing talent this film brings to the big screen.
He is doing this because the real king of England is captured in a distant land during a crusade.
On the box Gary Daniels has a katana sword,I didn't see him use it in the film,where in the heck was it and according to the box his family is in a house and he wanted to get them out because bad guys were going to blow the home up and after all of the fighting you never saw him get them out or at the end or at any time at all.
It seems that Molly's ex-husband (James Keach) thinks that she is neglecting the kids, mainly because he stumbled into a party given by Molly to the football players after a victory and to top it off the oldest daughter gets drunk.
This film ranks just below average mainly because he did so much better at other times.
Why some people think this is so funny is beyond me because everything that is done here has been done better somewhere else.
But feels she is taken seriously because she is a woman.
Okay, the film gets a 3 even though it's duller than dust because back in 1898, ALL the films were duller than dust--having NOT AN OUNCE OF PLOT--consisting of people doing mundane stuff that thrilled audiences at the time but would hopelessly bore people today because films are so omnipresent.
Of course, that would be your story line, not the writer's or director's, because they didn't have a story line or any conception of what this movie is or is supposed to say.
Maybe I missed the point because I was too asleep to follow it.
A viewer can have a tough time finding his movies, but maybe that's OK, because once seen, they can haunt you for years.
But surprisingly, it's not bleak the way you might expect, because Munch also shows us characters whose lives contain riches that they do not see themselves.
However, her lovers Â and we the viewers in the audience Â see that her beauty and her lust for life have enriched those around her in ways that she cannot recognize, perhaps because the experiences have not been comparably enriching for her.
Well, it is funny at times, though this is not the point here, because it is supposed to be political rather than funny.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   I'm rather glad I'm now a member of the internet based LoveFilm rather than still renting films from a video shop, because I'd hate to have to phone up and reserve this film.
This documentary won't make a lot of money, because documentaries usually don't but it definitely keeps your interest from the beginning to end.
The ending is left with only two characters left - hopefully they're compatible (though I will admit the Blond was very annoying), because it seemed very much as though they were headed towards an uninhabited planet to start a new life as the only survivors.
I hate scary movies, because they Never scary just blood and guts and are easy to guess the ending.
She is a better actor than I realized because she fits the part she plays in the marsh.
My score kept changing because I thought I had sussed it out and I am glad I didn't, gave me much more to think about.
Luckily for the viewer, the documentary is thorough, unblinking and lucid, mainly because it follows Stacy for so long, and documents so many aspects of her life.
But this carefully constructed image gradually unfolds: Stacy visits the cosmetic surgeon more often than I see my dentist, and she occasionally comes off as incredibly callous, such as when she prostitutes herself to a wealthy fan (not too long after gushing about how frightened she is of losing her boyfriend because he might find someone better), or when she gets very cross at her boyfriend because he can't handle doing a double-teamed scene with her (she actually services the other guy first -- that's showbusiness).
My husband said that when it started out, SV "seemed happy and pretty much OK for a while", but from almost the first shot of SV talking about how this is a great job for her because she loves sex and how the porn industry "is the only job where she would get people telling her she's sexy and beautiful", it was obvious that though she is smiling and sounding positive, but really just trying deep down to convince herself that she's happy.
One side note:not a good date movie if you are hoping to, er, get lucky afterwards, because after watching it, having sex will be the last thing you feel like doing.
Not exactly a Rhodes scholar, she had a simple goal in life - get married and be a good wife, because that's what's expected of proper girls from Tulsa.
The relationship between Neil Morrisey's and Rachel Weisz's characters sparkles because however quirkily their attraction as lovers fleet on and subsides off at different times, one gets the feeling that Weisz is partly a fantasy (there are storyline elements that also drop hints of this) for Morrisey's pint chugging bloke (not too unlike the concept in Fever Pitch) and that his and the nation's fantasy of success for their Football team mirrors their relationship.
Koichi couldn't direct the action the way he usually does (DRIVE) because of this same problem.
Mae plays a movie star who stars in romantic drama and Warren William is her press agent who dreams up schemes to keep her from getting married, because her contract says that she cannot get married until 5 years.
It was all because of that awful Satan MET A LADY (1934) which greatly hurt his career.
WC is at his best in this comedy, and it is especially valuable, because Fields gets to do his old vaudeville juggling act at the end of the movie.
The Adventures of Robin Hood holds up remarkably well, perhaps because it focuses on the story elements which have had universal appeal throughout the centuries.
We see a whole bunch of Americans losing their jobs because their jobs have been outsourced to India.
He misses the driver who had been sent to pick him up because that poor fellow was holding a placard that said "Mr. Toad" instead of "Mr. Todd".
Aunty ji cleans, starches and irons "Mr. Toad"'s underwear because that is what all Indian mothers do.
But, only because it is Ayesha Darkher who transforms things.
We liked the movie because it kept you continuously engaged.
I would remember this movie because of its somewhat accurate representation of India.
What is unfortunate about this movie is that it is, in the end, irresponsible propaganda to make light of the most disastrous thing happening to Americans today- they are losing their jobs because politicians have been bribed to look the other way or worse create new legislation that makes it easier for scumbag corporations to live in America, manufacture outside of it, and still charge similar prices as if it was produced by American labor, and they destroy local economies in the process by removing all wealth from the community via offshoring their jobs to India or china.
Released in 1938 in the new Technicolor of the time, "The Adventures of Robin Hood" was the one film that not only launched the career of actor Errol Flynn but that of his co-star Olivia De Havilland as well as director Michael Curtiz and even elevated Warner Bros Studios to a new level of greatness, simply because this film boasts a strong cast and oozes with grand old Hollywood spectacle.
The story of Robin Hood has endured over the years because it's at heart a classic tale of heroism.
This film had two directors, Michael Curtiz and William Keighley because during this time in Hollywood, the more ambitious, expensive or difficult-to-produce films normally needed extra direction.
I too saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, sitting in the first row because I was in the "rush" line.
This is not a "good little movie" -- it's a good movie, period and it's a crime it's not getting wider distribution just because the male lead isn't played by the flavor of the month.
Lee J. Cobb, who took over for Henry Hull as Dave Morris, Father Flanagan's friend, is effective, although there is an initial jolt when he appears, because his is the only major role that was recast from the original film.
), THE MEN OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1954; if only because it's directed by Val Guest), ROBIN AND THE 7 HOODS (1964; a musicalized version featuring The Rat Pack and reset to 1920s Chicago), A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD (1967; another Hammer Films variation), L'ARCIERE DI SHERWOOD (1970; a "Euro-Cult" obscurity directed by Giorgio Ferroni and starring Giuliano Gemma) and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS (1993; the inevitable Mel Brooks spoof which, amazingly, I've yet to catch up with in its entirety!
I'm surprised that he wasn't used more often after that because he was in jail, not dead.
I have not seen all episodes, because I did not watch it when Charmed was on TV.
I've always been a huge Superman fan but never cared for the Superman films because: Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is always a big goof, Margot Kidder sucked as Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman couldn't do Lex Luthor justice.
I would hate for others not to want to watch the series because they only think that the first two seasons are the only good ones.
I watched it because I liked Dean Cameron in an old TV show and was curious to see what he had done since then.
Cameron unfortunately is smarmy and no matter how fearful a situation is, he is the same wisecracking jokester because we all know that he isn't ever going to be hurt so he can be the obnoxious cavalier buffoon.
However I will give it a go, apparently it's supposed to be funny, but having a no-sense making story or did I just write story I meant, I don't know what I meant because there is no such thing as a story in this movie.
By the way ladies... he's married now and has a couple kids so don't get any ideas :P I give this movie a 10 simply because of the utterly gorgeous girl who plays Beth.
Simply because, at no point what so ever does the film attempt to be great, it just happens by accident.
Randy Orton, Triple H and Rey Mysterio would seem to be among the favorites but the overall match was not the classic Rumble that we always hope for, mainly because there are usually a few side stories that play out, some setting up future feuds.
This was a pity because they missed The Undertakers return at the end of the show to challenge Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship.
REF - Trish 3/10 It started well for these two, Ashley looked better in ring but after 5 minutes it turned into a horror show, they got sloppy, Trish got bored, Ashley started getting booed because all she was doing was fake, and i mean FAKE!
It was a great rumble match as usual, a bit better then last year, mostly because i was so shocked Mysterio won, even though there were rumours he would, i didn't believe it, then when he was left with Orton i was sure Orton would win, but it was Rey!
I Bought this because of the absolute love for the genres themselves and the way in which they were marketed.
This is because by the late '80s this wasn't quite the one you remember from Midnight Cowboy.
Many of these films look awful, but at three minutes apiece it doesn't really matter because you can get to the money stuff and not have to suffer as much through the bad acting and awful production values that sitting through these films in their entirety would entail.
I am sure there might be detractors out there, but that would be because they lack good judgment.
Diane and I watched this engrossing film last night after she had purchased it because of her recent trip to Buenos Aries and both of us loved what we saw.
I guess, because of my general drift towards evaluating films visually, I was taken by Felix Monti's cinematography which was deep and almost malevolent in its intensity--a perfect match to the unfolding drama.
however, the reason for duvall's giddiness seems to be more about a realization on the lack of interesting dialogue his character has than because of a good film.
i'm a guy that loves 99% of movies because i see them for what they are, not what they could be.
"Assassination Tango" is completely overrated and I believe just for two reasons: the first one is because of the name of Robert Duvall, but he needs to look to Clint Eastwood and learn how to get old with dignity and glamour.
I'm drawn to any Duvall movie simply because of his past movies and his compelling screen persona.
This film takes a little time to settle into because the assassination is more of a subplot in the movie.
Once this point sinks in, I really enjoy the film because the Argentinian tango dance scene is enthralling.
The longer I'm here the more I realize how difficult it is to portray what Argentina is "really like," mainly because it isn't any one thing but a whole mishmash of cultural, historical, economic, and political things that career around in people's lives and their minds and their emotions continuously.
The rural-urban split is real -- the whole City of Buenos Aires votes completely differently from the rest of the country and it doesn't mean a whit of difference except that the federal government becomes even more reluctant to help the capital because its politics are so frequently played out on another planet.
Well, we also have romance (Wendy is also introduced, and boy is the kissing because everything went fine scene is simply ruined!
However this episode had many moments that made me laugh like in scenes where we see Cartman telling his friends over and over that there's nothing wrong with him when his friends obviously know that there is because there's a Big Ass Satellite coming out of his Ass, or the famous Kick the Baby scene where Kyle constantly kicks his little brother Ike like a Football.
This is the very first episode of South Park entitled "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe".It has the worst animation in the series because it was made using construction paper...but we never looked at the animation in this show anyway.Nowadays, South Park has plenty of its humor stemming from current events and politics.I like this, I like all episodes of South Park, but its pretty interesting to go back to a time when it was just funny fart jokes with a simplistic plot.In this episode, Cartman recalls a dream he had where he was dragged on a ship and got an anal probe from aliens.However it was not really a dream and the aliens have come to south park.Cartman just thinks the other boys are trying to scare him though.The visitors kidnap Kyle's brother Ike and now they must go find him.With the help of the school cafeteria chef(played by Issac Hayes R.I.P), they get out of school and try to get Kyle's brother back.Meanwhile, officer barbrady has been investigating why the cows are being mutilated.This episode was originally 26min long.You can find this extended version of the episode on the internet.It makes a few changes, such as Cartman having a father and a sister and an introduction to Nurse Gollum(without the fetus on her head).Overall, its the not the best episode but it is pretty funny and good.
Also, prepare for culture-shock abound because as they say - 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'.
I love this show because it creates a lot of drama when people can get eliminated and because it's cool to see all these different places they get to go to.
Mainly because it's so global, mixture of different cultures and traditions.
That is because Communism is pretty widely accepted in France.
Wargnier forces you to feel for these characters, from the beginning until the end, because they are no different than you are I.
Perhaps we are too haste with that decision, because as our story unfolds, as does the bond that connects these two individuals Â or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think.
Unfortunately, the principals of this story never really had a chance to enjoy anything because the nightmare that became their lives under that totalitarian regime.
Whether the story the film was based on was true or not, I thought the performances of all the actors and actresses were exceptional, the photography was excellent and overall though not a film that could be called 'enjoyable' because it was so sad, I was intensely moved and gave it 9/10.
The couple gets a new subtenant, the young Sacha (Sergei Bodrov Jr.)whose grandmother was executed as "traitor" because she was too friendly to Marie.
Melies, I feel, remains the most accessible of the oldest directors, in large part because of the sheer sense of showmanship and joy that is evident in these works.
What terrible thing has happened to the sensibilities of U.S. citizens that simply must look at the writer/photographer Lewis Carroll as a deviant because he acknowledged and tried to portray youthful beauty?
I suppose it's because Melies was having fun himself.
I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10, but I gave it a 2 because Simple Plan was there to take the spotlight off of MK and A.
I certainly hope that al-Qaeda doesn't get a hold of this movie, because it's New York and it's a bomb.
This is very clever and funny and it differs in this case because the head it enlarged again and again using a pump until it ultimately explodes!
You should see this movie at least once (or twice) because it is absolutely awesome!
Since I get unlimited rentals from Netflix, I often mix in some stupid movies, sometimes because I feel like watching a lighter movie that doesn't require any thinking, and sometimes just out of morbid curiosity.
During the bizarre chase, Jane accepts a ride from the limo driver because she can't wait 3 hours for the next train, even though she has more than 6 hours to get to her speech.
We dubbed the night "Teeny bopper movie night", because we watched this along with 3 other movies with tryhard teens thinking they can act.
Only watchable because of Levy and our main man, Mr. Andy Richter.
Their jokes don't work because the set up lines are very clunky and the jokes are just so awkward and lame.
I gave it a 10/10 because it is what it is and shouldn't be judged for anything more.
I'm 22 and love their movies because they are fun and innocent.
The only reason the movie didn't got a theatrical release is because Dutch cinema in general is not very popular by the main stream audience and besides movies like this just don't do well in Dutch cinema's, regardless of the language spoken.
A shame because that also in a way means that not too often Dutch movies like "Cloaca" will ever be made and released.
And because of the fact that in Holland, we don't have lots of issues we want to film, 'they' decided to make a movie of "Cloaca", with the same (great) actors as in th play.
Gijs Scholten van Aschat (who had the chance to play the raper in Lars von Triers "Dogville", but didn't do it because he wanted to make "Cloaca") plays Joep on a wonderfull way, and also the other die hard theater actors Pierre Bokma, Peter Blok and Jaap Spijkers give a fantastic performance.
I wish there was a complete cast list on the IMDb because I wanted to note the great supporting performance by the guy who plays Baker - the "john" who takes Sinclair's Sara on the ride of her life (or death).
When I review these very early films, I cut some of them a lot of slack because of when they were made.
The director says he was inspired by two Italian movies:  "Mediterraneo" directed by Gabriele Salvatores because both of them talks about war and soldiers who lives in peace;   "La vita Ã¨ bella" (Life is Beautiful) directed by Roberto Benigni in fact both of them introduce some people's sacrifice to save the innocent ones.
The film makers seem to feel that there is a magical quality to living and they have infused their film with some truly magical moments, how else do you describe a hostage situation that falls apart because the hostages wander off to do other things?
At the beginning of the film I thought that it was going to be another cynical korean war picture, because it was so dark.
In many ways, this transient, new life within the village represented a form of "utopia" which seemed far more preferable than their former ways of life  *spoiler* The only thing I didn't like was the tragic ending --and I do agree with the arguments made by a few on this board concerning the illogical nature of opting for a futile, suicidal standoff as opposed to a more practical evacuation of the village--even if that would entail some sacrifice on the part of the villagers...there was definitely an alternative to avoiding the unnecessary deaths...Just because the villagers would be losing their way of life doesn't seem to justify their deaths...on the other hand, I guess it's arguable that their deaths were heroic and almost "redemptive" for them...especially for the NK leader and the suicidal SK solider...nevertheless, it was a great film.
World cinema is far popular now than when i first got into it and i'm not to sure thats such a good thing because there was a time where only the best titles made there way to this country, a time where renting a foreign film guaranteed quality but that changed with the sudden American studio interest.
As time went by I realised it's the same music used in Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'....which I think was shot before 'Dong' but I'm, not sure...we might have a chicken and egg situation here because the films are, in my opinion of equal merit...and I loved 'Ryan' and its message with a similar evangelical zeal.
so the teacher gets disillusioned with the answer because the normal correct American answer should "I am fine, and you?"
This was simply because of the score and the setting, a near-magical isolated village, complete with folk lanterns and strange wildlife.
In my opinion the war is roughly depicted because it is just a "place" within which the main story unfolds.
Welcome to Dongmakgol opens with a small detachment of North Korean soldiers whose numbers are continuously dwindling not only because of constant attacks, but also because they have been given the order to kill every wounded man.
Although each man points a gun at her, she shows little concern and informs the men that they should move because they are standing close to a snake rock.
Please excuse bad English, I am still learning :) This is excellent film but I think many Americans will dislike it because it shows American soldiers as "bad guys".
but still it tells truth about war which Hollywood has never done because Hollywood always shows good guys vs bad guys.
Better than the usual MGM short, because there's some attempt at gags and some characterization, but still nothing to write home about.
Buckwheat sees friend by the name of Bigshot who is sending a nameless dog away because his dad doesn't have enough food for him.
Buckwheat convinces him to have the gang take care of him and call the dog smallpox because of his spots.
Actually I know quite a few guys and girls -of different nationalities- that live or have lived with their parents not because they could not afford to live on their own but also because it is... convenient.
I left the cinema with satisfaction, because I saw one of the few intelligent - and most importantly funny - modern comedies.
Maybe that's because, by the time the film ends, we're not quite sure they're heartfelt.
Maybe it's because Will recognizes that, once again, he can practice the same rescuer skills he employed with the two people he lives with, Liv (Robin Wright Penn), his common law wife, and Bea (Poppy Rogers), her functionally autistic daughter.
Maybe it's because, this time, he'll be able to get it right.
The whole story with the prostitute in Will's car is just useless, and I think it was made up as a filler between the main story, because something must be happening in the movie, right?
In real life Will could not say no when Amira is begging him because (1) he does want to help the boy, (2) she still has the power to embarrass Will and his wife even though she has given him the incriminating photo negatives, (3) it is totally out of character for him to suddenly care so much about the affair coming out, and (4) he immediately confesses it to his wife anyway.
After all this time, I decided to give the film a second try mainly because it stars Jude Law, a great actor that usually does the kind of films I like, emotional dramas, often very character-driven, about relationships and the human nature.
Or just see it because it's entertaining.
It almost doesn't matter, because Mangella fills in the void with cinematic ambiguities.
Poliakoff can pull off these rambling associations of disparate characters who come together in ultimate profundity, because he has some magical ability to make it all mean something in the end, but Minghella simply cannot do it.
This is because there are things that also remain the same; the kind of things that define a director's work: like actors direction.
You really need to watch Jude Law in an Anthony Minghella film because the director has made him portray all sorts of things, but here you can catch him as an everyday man, and sense his reactions to the dramatic and comic situations in a way he's not shown before.
Maybe it's because Juliette Binoche can play any character and resolve any scene, but putting her character and Law's together in such a common place as the Millennium Bridge doesn't sound good with a simple look.
The kid, Miro (a promising Rafi Gavron), robs an office because he needs to prove something to himself; a detective (unexpected Ray Winstone) looks for him and tries to talk about the issue because he senses the boy has some good inside him; Will does what he does (the good and the bad) because he's a kind person; his wife (Robin Wright Penn) makes a choice because she understands.
The ending it's a cop out, because Will enters into his affair with open eyes.
The film does not have a very original story and is fairly predictable but that is okay because it is not really plot-driven.
The film is dreary, but girls seemed to like it, because good-looking guys learn their lessons (from women, of course) and become much better people.
Best part has to be when Murphy goes through his stock pick notes that have been doodled on my his daughter - "this stock is gonna drop its pants because they have a poopy diaper...........".
(And please, spare me the gaggle of wrong-sighted support for the film simply because it was made by a gay man and involves gay characters.
- with a couple having sex in a car the night before Halloween, who then get killed by a mysterious, beefy psycho (because we all know that sex kills in slasher flicks).
The music was fantastic and I wish there was a soundtrack.I have never heard of most of the artists but like their music.I really like how it has a Halloween theme.The costumes were outrageous and the party blew me away and looked like a lot of fun.This is a nice alternative to watching Halloween on Halloween night(even though i'm a huge fan of J.Carpenter's film)because it gives you a choice between them.Of course I will watch them both personally.
I'm not a fan of slasher films, but I was intrigued by this because it's the first gay slasher film.
Being low budget some of the acting isn't world class, but that really doesn't hurt the film because of the campy, sexy, spooky nature of the film.
There are some wonderful moments in the film, like when Eddie first sees Jake, and has trouble hitting on him because he's nervous, or when Joey gets the phone number of the guy he's interested in.
I wish I'd seen it in a theater packed with a bunch of screaming queens, because it was joyous cheesy fun.
No matter, because what we get is an entertaining, well-paced, witty-scripted, full of tension foray through the clubs and alleyways of the very colorful West Hollywood Halloween atmosphere.
Not because it was a gay slasher film, but because I was worried that the characters weren't going to be portrayed as real people, but rather caricatures of gay stereotypes.
I'm giving this an 8 because the guys were just incredible and gave good performances...but I can't say I loved this.
And I will not say why the call did'nt come because if I did, I would actually feel tears welling up in my eyes.
The actors and actresses must have been paid extremely high to do this because I'm sure they would have never done it on a regular budget.
I kept trying to figure out if "Lake Placid 2" was supposed to take place in Maine, like the sequel was, because everyone in this movie has that Southern drawl.
Some have criticized it because of "slow" parts.
It could be because the dialogue is so laughable and special effects so poor.
Of course, everyone is a jerk in this movie and you don't even get the satisfaction of wanting them to get eaten by the crocs because the special effects are so awful, the amateurs on the Star Trek fan films are actually better.
She must have been aware too because the Sci-Fi channel didn't even mention her name in the credits.
I would recommend this to people that want to know what makes a bad movie, because this describes this "not even worthy of being called a film."
And gets eaten and you are happy that she is dead because that means that 10% of the bad script has been cut off from your ears (if they aren't bleeding already).
Unlike "House of the Dead", it isn't a bad movie that is funny to watch because of how much effort was put into it, it's just an all-out bad movie that Sci Fi can add to their quite long "Flops" list.
I might have given this film a rating of 2 or 3, but for potentially tainting the reputation of the original, I give it a 1 - but only because there's no option to give it a zero!
I'd give it a 7/10, only because I didn't expect much from it.
I avoided this movie for the longest time because of the video box, which prominently features Jamie Kennedy and Freddie Prinze Jr. Ugh.
Well first of all I have to say I mainly rented this since I found out that Jamie Kennedy was in it, and I didn't think it'd be that good because well I was only 13-years-old thinking this would be boring.
TRUST ME, you'll end up wanting your boyfriend to see it because it clearly depicts what CAN happen when a boy doesn't know when to say "enough is enough" and take, albeit giant for some, that step into becoming a responsible man.
I call it unusual because how often are men really truthful about their actions and desires?
I don't think "The Boss" allowed his songs to be used here because he needed the money.
I like this movie now because not only does it show something of New Zealand's past and the possibilities the film-makers foresaw (some of which later came to pass as part of NZ history) but because it is an early vehicle for several New Zealand film-maker's craft.
I liked the movie because it tries to clear up Vlad's name.
Maybe because it was shot in historically authentic locations of Romania.
I've seen many documentries on Vlad Dracula, and even though this movie hits on some real points in the impailer's life I think it is more of a prequil to 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" because it focuses on the love story between him and his queen almost mirroring in 90min the short prologue of Dracula '92.
His wife stays with him, but, after Vlad seemingly comes back to life after his soldiers were convinced that he was killed in battle, she becomes convinced that her husband is a damned soul; that is to say, that his spirit is doomed to remain in limbo on earth forever because neither Heaven nor Hell will receive him.
Vlad the Impaler, that is the son of Vlad Dracul, inherited his father's membership into the order of the Dragon, but because he was the son of Dracul, he was named "Draculea", or "Dracula", which means "son of Dracul", son of the Dragon, and ultimately son of the devil.
His reputation as a mad executioner would be well justified by today's standards, although he was just a babe when compared to other rulers of his time (his own cousin, Stephen the Great, ruler of Moldavia, "the Athlete of Christ" as he had been named by the Pope for having repeatedly beaten the crap out of the Turks, had reportedly killed many more people through impalement than Vlad but because he had always been politically correct, he never went down into history as a deranged butcher).
Vlad Tepes had the Saxons of Transilvania account for their transgressions against the conquered local Romanian population and it was because of the vengeful literate Germans who wrote exacerbated stories about him that he was later on remembered as the sadistic figure we now read of in the history books.
It's because of this that, during his reign, crime had reportedly dropped to nil.
That is why, for the Romanians, he's still, up to this day, considered a national hero of special importance, unlike any other, because his name is called upon in times of great oppression, when corruption and plundering of the national economy by the oligarchic political class bring the common, ordinary citizens on their knees.
This is one of the better silent films because it had many dialog cards.
Still I'm going for it because this movie was good.
There are scenes where Professor Challenger (Beery) chases and assaults this man because he hates reporters.
Inevitably- because of this emphasis on the special effects- this romantic subplot seems intrusive.
On the whole, The Lost World is one of the more interesting silent films-- mostly because one can see some of the seeds of King Kong being sown here, seven years before.
back in 1990 because it had to contend with Goodfellas, Godfather III and Miller's Crossing.
I bought it because of Sean Penn.
Worth seeing for any gangster film fan if for no other reason than because it is one of the few that deals with the Irish Mob.
In the scene where Jody and Mike go back in time to visit the Tall Man, Jody tells Mike he can't kill the Tall Man because they're in different dimensions (Mike tries and he goes right through him like a ghost).
Have your cigs handy, because this movie will make you want to smoke a pack!
It's too bad this gem isn't recognized more, because it's a real treat.
And I gotta admit, I decided to watch this just because he was in it.
I said then Gary Oldman should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor and he should have been, except nobody saw this movie, probably because Orion didn't promote this movie at all.
It is Penn though that has the heavy lifting to do, because he doesn't have the luxury of hiding behind the frenetic machinations that Oldman's character does.
Magnani, therefore, works because she conveys so much in her expressions, her eyes and of course voice, all without having to go into soap opera hysterics.
The peasant woman turned homeless that Magnani plays so beautifully (for such a simple character there is enough nuance for two performances) holds onto faith because, frankly, it's all that she has.
Even if you don't have a belief in Catholicism or even just religion, the film has an impact because of elemental questions Rossellini is trying to raise.
I remember being conflicted by the ending - not because it was bad, but because it was so (for me, at that age) adult that I really had to sit down and think about what it meant for all the characters.
i found myself watching it in fast forward towards the end, because the it just would not end.
I think it's a wonderful movie and it's been unjustly underestimated:it's oneiric,sentimental,poetic and the dramatic plot is dealt with a sense of humour.There are various issues like male bonding,homosexuality,friendship and I think every role is proper for the actor who plays it:my favourite actor JOHN MALKOVICH(GREAT)is a homosexual with some existential problems and he falls in love with Marty(Michael Zelniker)and they get engaged at the end of the film;Dennis(Kevin Bacon)has in vain tried to get successful in Hollywood as a musician,Al(Joe Mantegna)grows up thanks of Jamie Lee Curtis,Vinny(Tony Spiridakis)dreams to become an actor and Ray(Ken Olin)a painter.Even if the dreams of some of these guys don't come through,their strong and profound tie is the reason to continue to hope in the future.I also think the title is the only very funny thing of the movie(in Italian language it's "Dreaming Manhattan")but the film succeeds to alternate melancholy and thoughtless scenes:Mantegna climbs up the bridge which links Astoria to Manhattan,Ken Olin listens to his message "I love you guys" while he's thinking about his life,Kevin Bacon and Michael Zelniker play "ordinary people song" while Zelniker and Malkovich look at each other,Malkovich jilts Terry Kinney,who had fallen in love with him,because he doesn't like the way he talks about his friends(when Kinney asked him if those guys were his type,he replied "that I don't know but they are the best I could do"),Tony Spiridakis howls with a healer without a reason,Tom Waits reads his odd poem at Jack's,Jamie Lee Curtis takes Mantegna's gun and learns him to throw all away,Chloe Webb tells Madame Rose,a palmist, she's surrounded by idiots,the five boys shout out Arnold's name while they're having a bath under Hellgate during the night because he was the only guy,apart from Mantegna,who climbed up that bridge and they don't see Linda Fiorentino stealing their clothes out of spite,because her husband Mantegna spent all his time with his friends(he also kisses John Malkovich at the disco)...well,these guys are amazing!They are either crazy or gay,either sad or happy,sometimes they make you cry,sometimes they make you amuse.Personally I was a depressed sixteen year old girl when I saw this movie for the first time on a night during last summer and it made me dream:this movie is everything for me,it lets me to take refuge in another world and it makes me isolate from my reality,whom I hate as much as I can, but fortunately I'm not here,I'm under Hellgate Bridge to dream with other Queens.I thank Tony Spiridakis,who wrote the story,and all the actors very much for this wonderful movie!!
Everyone that worked on this movie worked on it because they cared about the people involved and expected something more than money out of it.
I plead that Linda gets work soon again because she is really one of the best actresses out there playing strong women rather than weak and superficial.
Perhaps the best scene is when Eliot tells a "pesky" homosexual to "bug off", because he just doesn't like him.
But for me, it works because, at the end of the day and looking back over thirty years, I knew a few of those guys.
I saw this over youtube (it's the TCM version) and it must be missing a few scenes, because the official running length has it at 65 minutes, and the version I watched ran under an hour.
Alonzo has a secret - he does have arms but because he has two thumbs and is responsible for a spate of robberies that occur whenever the circus stops - he binds up his arms as the police will not suspect an armless man.
He longs to be with his gorgeous young colleague, Nanon (a very young Joan Crawford), and because she is turned off by the thought of male hands on her body, he poses no problem for her.
Many viewers gave negative reviews to this film because it was not your typical slice em dice em horror flick.
It has a decadent atmosphere but it is the twisted second half of the oeuvre that gives to the film, if it is possible, more boldness, darkness and evil, not to mention that it is always a pleasure to check up again and again on this wonderful and terrible circus troupe, surely a collection of the most hideous, complicated and malicious people found in the whole silent world..  And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must join such a strange and perverse circus troupe.
Nanon grows tired to the brink of psychological woe because of men's desires to grope her with their hands.
This silent film is breathtaking mostly because of Chaney's commanding performance.
"The Unknown" is a silent film starring Lon Chaney, Sr., as carnival star Alonzo the Armless, an expert with gun and knife, who, because of his condition, must use his feet instead of hands.
Zanzi doesn't trust Alonzo and when he sees his daughter alone with him again, his anger builds because he feels he is putting "ideas" in his daughter's head.
Part of the reason is because Chaney could play the agony of unrequited love like nobody else.
But because the character has no arms, he can't very well resort to physical bullying.
A print was found at the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que FranÃ§aise, mixed in with a lot of other films marked "unknown" because the contents were (at least temporally) unidentifiable.
Especially because Copping's character seemed so thoughtful and level-headed, that for her to simply switch and buy into all of the religious ramblings from somebody suffering from schizophrenia seemed a bit absurd.
It's a simple story about a delusional woman (Gina Chiarelli) and her brother (Paul McGillion) who is seduced by her delusions - because it's the only way to love her.
One reason that I like it, is because it takes two controversial themes and sticks them together.
The plot is loosely based on lead actress, Gina Chiarelli's experiences of her schizophrenic aunt, obviously an experience that touched Gina deeply because her portray of 'Grace' is absolutely driven.
I couldn't pick out a scene for Gina because this is without a doubt, one of the most driven, talented and stunning performances from any actress I have ever seen.
I know I have a better relationship with my husband and his family because of this film.
I think the main reason I liked it was because I went into it not expecting much of a movie at all.
Regardless, the movie was unwatchable in an Ed Wood kind of way--the only reason I stuck through the whole thing is because of the occasional laughs my friend and I got at some of the most "dramatic" scenes.
That is probably because this film differed from the rest in the way that it made some sense.
I am not surprised to know that this documentary was nominated for two Academy Awards in 2003.Such a pity that it didn't received any award, because for sure it deserved!
The 1st because it shows the fact and is realistic cinema.
Fardeen Khan played a Muslim youth who believes his father was killed because of Dev Pratap Singh.
Fardeen Khan seems to be in the industry only because of his lineage, and attractive looks.
The original Phantasm is such a landmark cult film because it truly bent the limits of the horror movie genre.
There's some good old time "monster encounter" action at a spot called (love this name) "the pit", and the film's "unseen monster" approach works well because of it.
Thank god Phantasm V was announced because this has an extremely vague and unsatisfying ending.
I suppose it isn't too terrible though because his character wasn't of much relevance to the overall story, but still).
I'd strictly recommend it to "phans" of the series though, because all others will likely despise it.
Yet, it is a good reminder of the pain the hemophilia community endured because of poor medical treatment.
This is a must see movie for all parents; no, for all families, because it has such a precious and loving message to share with the audience.
Just because it is not right.
Maybe because men don't listen anyway.
The characters here talk a lot more than in other of his films, mostly because they are by nature big mouths.
My rating is 8 because of the great intense scenes later in the movie, and because it just gets better and better.
It appealed to me mostly because of it's dramatic story (which playing now, I realize has suffered from a poor translation,)and its imaginative environments.
I never bothered to look at previews for it, because a) she's really hot and b) I figured the title was self-explanatory.
I wish I could sue the film-makers for false advertising and racism because they really make Indians look bad in this film.
Still, I'll give it a 2 because it was catatonic enough to get my hot friend there to make-out with me.
I started with this one and only because I couldn't find the original and just wanted to see this series so badly.
It was made worse after I saw the first three because they're all so good by comparison.
The Calcutta story was finely depicted, perhaps because of Dutt's knowledge about the culture.
because it takes a lot of guts to set out on a journey to discover yourself.
...Not that I think it should have ever been banned, it is just that shorts that were less disturbing and more worth watching this were banned and because of this are not very well known nowadays.
Personally I have a high level of tolerance for the use of dreadful clichÃ©s, but if you're exclusively looking for horror movies with innovating and daringly creative formulas feel free to skip this one, because it features absolutely nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before.
Their last name is either a lack of scripting inspiration or a truly lame pun, because they actually inherit a lake and complementary lakeside motel somewhere in the middle of hillbilly nowhere.
I gave it a 4 because I felt the camera work was polished enough, and the film moves along well, but if you are looking for slasher fireworks, look elsewhere.
I gave this movie 9 stars out of Ten, only because the story line resembles other flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Timber Falls.
My rating in detail:  1 star for cinematography (ok, but barely) 1 star for the music (it didn't hurt) 2 stars for acting (sticks out because the rest of this film is so bad) -2 stars for the script  The only positive: James Burns obviously has tremendous fun playing the sadistic Sheriff - it's a pleasure to watch him  Makes for 2 stars overall - and that's generous.
Maybe they changed judges because this movie is nothing compared to any of 2006 8 films.
But poor confused little Michael claims that everything felt so realÂ Ten years later, his dream is proved a reality because the Tall Man is back, desecrating every town he travels throughÂhe also kills Reggie's family.
Well, because there were some unsavory family ties that he didn't want his daughter involved in.
I think this movie is getting unfair treatment.It's not one of the best Afterdark Horrorfest films, but it definitely isn't one of the worst.The acting was actually good and not just horrible like it is in most B-Movies.The script is actually quite new and fresh, for a movie of this standard.It was also very entertaining to watch, and while I did find the ending EXTREMELY stupid, most of the material in this film didn't bother me.It was good, and I enjoyed watching it.The characters don't stick to you like they should, and there were a few flaws with this movie, but no movie's 100% perfect, and you definitely shouldn't sit down to watch this movie expecting to be.I liked it, and it's rating is too low if you ask me.I recommend it if you've liked all the others, because it is a fine edition to the series.
You'll notice why it incorporates these films because of two main concepts presented in this film.
I never could really understand why The Tall Man would need a cohort to join him in his "dwarfing business", but perhaps he's lonely or something..fact is we just don't get an answer because it seems like Coscarelli just wants to keep us head scratching.
Reggie is pretty much a non-factor in this installment which is a bit disappointing because he was the major character in the other two.
He actually carried the series on his shoulders because most of the entertainment came from his quips and charisma.
nobody knew who blade was until marvel came out with that movie and it spawned into 3 movies because of it's success.
Farm doesn't have any special effects but is a delight because of the witty, intelligent script, superb acting, and visually gorgeous cinematography.
I recommend turning the subtitles on if you're watching the DVD because the British accents and slang make it easy to miss words and lines without the subtitles.
Flora is the kind of upbeat heroine who would take a hot cup of cocoa to Dracula "because he is probably cold after all that time in the tomb."
An activist and a pioneer in many ways in the Brasil of 1930's, he could be seen as a gay activist, a transvestite activist, a swinger activist, a one-man-show pioneer, a strong, willful, self-confident and proud individual who defies almost all possible rules, regulations and conventions of his time, and not because he wants to be standing out.
The film opens as Joao is being processed because of a crime he committed.
The result is an instant success because of the innate talent in Joao.
I've given this movie 10/10 just because of the nostalgia factor, if i watched it again as an adult, i get the feeling it'd struggle to get past 3.
It's clear from murder #1 who the killer is and there's not even an attempt at a red herring but by the same token we are spared the justification scene I did it because my parents rejected me, never displayed affection, etc.
But she better be careful, because this gang is deadly.
This stretches out into the first half of the film; a friendship develops around food that Paul brings over, and it's only when Paul thinks its time to go the 'next step' that he's told it can't be because of a past horrible relationship that Helen faced- horrible in the sense of disappointment.
One thing that is particularly striking is that he is able to use long, unshowy takes (some lasting several minutes) simply because his actors are up to the challenge, giving the film an unforced, natural flow.
The Butcher, however, is not a masterpiece because of its cynicism; it's a masterpiece because it manages to be cynical while having utmost respect for its characters.
It's a great film because of the way it explores how hard its characters try and how pathetically they fail.
But Helene's unwillingness to become Paul or anyone's lover, because of the pain she endured from a previous relationship, stifles a budding romance.
He can trust this woman because she is "logical," a word that turns up frequently when the two main characters describe how they run their lives.
Like his desire for his mother still lurks in his unconscious, his desire for Helene is always present - and because Helene has rejected him, like his mother had done, Helene has created a relationship as close to his mother as possible.
There is very little in the way of action in this film; but it doesn't matter, because the director knows how to handle suspense, and so despite the fact that there isn't much going on; the film is always interesting.
If the ending does feel like somewhat of a copout, that may because we as the audience have viewed one plot twist too many, and the frequency and slightness at which each twist is revealed diminishes its impact somewhat.
This obscurity is less frustrating than it is fascinating, however, because Chabrol is a master of pacing and mood, and he knows not only how to keep an audience gripped right to the end, but also how to haunt them afterwards.
This film was a surprise because I came across it on the Lifetime Movie Network and watched a few minutes to kill some time before another program began and found myself entertained.
Even the first delivery goes wrong because the boy wants to help a guy who is writhing and retching on the ground.
It's a trap and the boy sees the bag snatched away from him because he showed empathy.
Bad films I'd recommend from the early sound era would be "Golden Dawn" or "Lights of New York" because they are so horrid in places that they wind up being fun for the early talkie fan.
That's because they couldn't get the rights to use the Bond name in the film, although Sean seems to have been amenable to his own name used.
Neil's a plastic surgeon, of all things, who gets drawn into a spy caper because of his work with hypnosis.
The wife, Dorothy Matthews, is bored with early retirement mainly because she's been two timing Ayres with Cagney and Cagney's not around.
Sadly, because they didn't do this, the movie is robbed of any REAL menacing villain.
This is actually rather ironic considering that in real life, Ayres was strongly opposed to violence and when drafted in WWII, served as a medic because he was so morally opposed to taking lives!
I would like to have seen a better resolution of the Ricarno/Mileaway relationship, particularly since Cagney's character just disappears after his 'confession', and even more so because of his heavily implicated fling with Ricarno's wife - very risquÃ© stuff for the 1930's.
Well,not in my Dad's instance,because when my Dad saw the film on the Screen, it was shortly after Bogart's death and Cagney was already a long since established star.But still a treat nonetheless.
Real life gangsters dared Hollywood to make this movie because it hit close to home, for them.
It's an interesting film to watch because of the miscasting.
A thing William Wellman took note of during the filming of "Public Enemy", and had Cagney and the Lew Ayres clone "switch roles"...because "this Cagney guy has that gutter quality that this story needs to become effective".
Not only because it was ugly, but also the way she is made to seem completely helpless was unconvincing.
It was one of the better movies created about Tomie, the girl who'll never die... because she is bakemono.... Tomie, a girl who is picked on, is at a jewelry store looking, but has no money.
Then you have these 3 dumb girls who want to kill Innocent Tomie but just be rude to her instead because they like having somebody to pick on.
The Father comes to the convent anyway because he "felt" that he was needed and all the nuns try to screw him...The End.
I would certainly recommend this movie because of the wonderful acting which creates characters which are virtually indistinguishable from real people I know.
However, he has also brought with him the devil (in the form of a statue), and this leads the local priest to visit the convent in order to expel the demon, only he ends up featuring in the nuns' desires also...  At first, I didn't think this movie was going to work as a porn film because the first couple of sex scenes are far too rigid and it seems like the actresses are just doing what they're told.
The only difference is that he used the Rockaways instead of Brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was.
Young Mr. Green believed that Wallace Shawn was a superhero because of the radio.
I love this movie because Allen doesn't pretend that the past is perfect, but he loves it even with its flaws, and he presents it to us with the love that feels for this time gone by.
It does have laughs but not as many as the normal Allen movie because the idea of this is simply to be a nostalgic piece, mainly Allen's tribute to his own family days of growing up, what it was like around his house.
I wonder what Woody feels about "Radio Days" because it looks to have been made by a man with a huge heart.
"ninjas" (you know they are because their headbands read "Ninja!")
However, because Lau Kar Leung(Legend of Drunken Master),Gordon Liu(Kill Bill 1&2), and Jacky Wu(The Legend of Zu) are in it, some will watch anyway.
I wanted to watch this movie because of the director, Lar Kar Leung a.k.a.
Well, not all of them, because Drive is one of those cheap (around $4 million) movies with relatively unknown actors (Mark Dacascos, anyone?)
because unlike every single other martial arts American movie this film actually seems like it was made in Hong Kong.
It was only a flop because the studio didn't promote it at all!
I stumbled across it on USA and stayed because the guy from that Crow Stairway To Heaven show was in it, and I always felt he was a decent actor on the rare occasions when I watched that show.
Of course, if it was supposed to be a blockbuster, it would be a 6 because of the plot, but that's forgiven here because it is a low-budget film.
I rented it from Blockbuster because one of 3 favourite actresses is in it: Brittany Murphy, and because I'm a martial arts fan, and I'd just started reading up on Mark Dacascos.
I decided to take a chance on it because of that...and it was a big disappointment.
I was sceptical at first because straight to video martial arts films tend to scream 'rubbish' from the front cover all the way to the final credits.
It's the perfect mantra for his character, and we believe it--that the character is done living and can't wait for it all to end--because of Willis' performance.
The only reason I give this film a nine instead of a ten is because there is one moment, late in the film, when the film uses a kind of tired trick on the audience; in case you're not as cynical as I am, I won't reveal what that moment is--but you'll recognize it just as soon as the moment begins to unfold.
It deserves one because it overcame the odds.
But every one of them knows that in some way, large or small, a person has been helped because of them.
If there was a number below 1.0 I would have voted that, because even a 1.0 rating is very overrated for this 'movie'.
Not having seen the original I can't compare the two and maybe that is for the better, because often a re-make loses it from the original, simply for that is not the original.
"Vet Hard", a remake of the Danish movie "Old men in new cars", is one of the very few action movies to come out of the Netherlands, and because of this it was received quite enthusiastically by the Dutch press.
But when the time has come to kill Koen, Bennie can't do it anymore, because he started to like Koen too much.
And you better don't expect to see the most original movie either, because than this will be one big disappointment.
But then... the unexpected starts to happen and Mosely must snap out of his delirium because this witness is wanted dead.
He took action against his colleagues from Las Vegas who had trailed him to Seattle because of his own intervention with adultery.
But that`s probably because I was expecting the worst movie ever made .
That's because the mostly predictable storyline revolves around one man's desire for revenge.
Jack Carter is mad because his brother has been culled by either Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming) or Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke).
Jack: Just because, what is your favorite color?
Jack: Just because.
The movie had to be edited down for TV viewing, because some of it was too graphic.
I hated the ending to the original because of how it just came out of nowhere.
It was almost like they put that in there because they were forced into it.
You know the movie I'm talking about, you saw it at Suncoast for $6.99 and almost bought it because it had a big picture of Robert DeNiro on it.
Then we have Michael Caine - of whom I honestly cannot decide whether or not gives a good performance because I cannot get over what a backstabbing Judas he is for being apart of this film in the first place!
Sly and crew will impress you with the acting and you may think it is a shame that great actors like that wasted their time making this movie, The flick made Sly look like Rocky again because he was made out to be very tough.
Which was cool because I was glad to see Rocky come out again.
I say the only reason this movie is watchable besides the usual Stallone delivery is because of Rachel Leigh Cook...this was back when she was in her true prime and she is GORGEOUS in the movie.
Michael Caine acted in this one simply because he knew it was good.
But he did it because unlike other remakes, this one is just as good as the original.
And this only because the producers did not get this movie.
But if that happened there would not be a story because the movie would have to end then.
Watched this film the other day expecting the worst from a 1930s film but was surprised it was really quite good.Its a story of two people from different cultural backgrounds who fall in love,the biggest problem is he is married,so the relationship is doomed to failure.I must admit i didn't care for the wife at all,as looking at this film from a 1930s aspect a woman always stood by her husband no matter what.This one deserts him purely because she misses her socialite lifestyle in New York,if she really loved him she would have stayed with him.I found her totally selfish,and a 1930s audience probably would have felt the same.When you watch these old films you have to forget your 21st century attitudes,as what seems acceptable now wasn't back then, she should have stayed with him.I hated Frederick and the father he was a pig and a bully who didn't care for his daughters happiness,which leads to a tragic conclusion i wont say why.I was really hoping that Gary cooper would ditch the wife then tell Frederick and her father where to get off and run away with the Polish girl for the perfect happy ending,but alas it wasn't to be.I don't understand why this film is forgotten because it is quite outstanding for its day.
She also loved the film and I felt so gratified by that, because sadly this type of quiet, sensitive films is not the kind of film which you can watch with anybody and can be fully appreciated as it should be.
And this is no by chance, because the film was directed by the masterful King Vidor.
The scene in which Cooper reads to her the first chapters of the new (autobiographical) book he is writing, is most telling in this aspect; because Miss Sten does not fall for the dashing, tall, handsome Cooper, but for his character's sensitiveness, feelings and emotions which she apprehends by means of this book in progress.
A wonderful experience, which with no doubt I'll repeat in the future, because this film deserves many viewings and is just my kind of film; a simple love story, unpretentiously directed, that does not aim at over sentimentality and does not fall into the maudlin which can ruin a movie, with superb, unaffected performances by the leads.
Interesting film, partly because Cooper is cast so completely against the type he is later to be best known for from his Capra films - that is of the rural innocent encountering the corruption of the city.
A shame really because it never gives this movie a chance from the opening credits to the mercifully not too far off end credits.
Paradoxically, this movie might thrive because of its awfulness.
Just don't make them close friends because after they see this on your shelf, they'll never look at you the same way again.
I would like to read plots of movies that did not make the cut because they must be really horrible if this movie got made.
Instead, there were pressures to let matinÃ©e idol Ivor Novello out of the killer role, probably because people didn't want to picture Novello as a killer.
Hitchcock once said that he liked to make films with a contemporary setting because he could understand the minutiae of the character's daily lives.
I am going to remain neutral on this, because neither appearance is surely Hitchcock.
Hitchcock's original ending wasn't used, because Ivor Novello was a big star at that time.
And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take lodgings tonight with a Teutonic rich heiress.
Regarded as a classic by most people simply because it is Alfred Hitchcock's first suspense film.
This movie is fantastic and fascinating mostly because of its director, but it would be fun either way.
The Lodger was the feature which Hitchcock himself described as his first true film (it was actually his third complete one), and film historians, particularly auteurists tend to focus upon it because it is it introduces themes of murder and suspense that Hitch's name would later be synonymous with.
I've watched it three times and only because it's part of the movie series I love and I wanted to find even something good in it.
It's too bad, because this film, which displays a tenderness to these characters and Edwards' creation as a whole, was never allowed a chance to really be seen without generally jaded eyes.
i rate this movie very highly because the story line was 100% true and the acting was very convincing.
In all i rate this movie a 7...not more because the ending is a little odd for me...go watch it for good entertainment.  
I'm guessing that this film is so hard to find anywhere because some of the stars that appeared in it lost their sense of humor as they got older.
Candy is an important movie because it doesn't pretend anything else is important besides falling between the knees of a beautiful, nubile, not particularly bright young woman.
The novel's Candy is led farther and farther into lovemaking because she embodies sympathy.
This sympathy involves sensing the need men have for her without ever really understanding it, and so the joke is, apparently, that she has sex with various men because she misunderstands their lust for a deeper spiritual needÂand this, the novelists suggest, is itself the essence of male sexuality: the wish for a compliant, innocent beauty.
It's complicated satire, because at the same time it promotes and mocks arousal.
I was initially drawn to it because of the involvement of one of my heroes, Marlon Brando, and after seeing it the first time, I thought, "What were they thinking?".
The only reason I'm rating it so high is because IMDb doesn't give you a lower choice.
For an action movie there is much down time, time enough for Def Moses to steal the movie, which is O.K., because in this movie Bruce is content to let his Co- Star have all the best lines, and most of the best scenes.
In The B E Kutcher remembers parts in the past that have been blocked because they are memories best forgotten, with more tragic consequences when the events are changed.
This movie was slow because of poor writing.
I cried because this creation is one of those that truly touch you, and take you to a fantasy realm that can only be experienced in imagination.
And the thing I really loved: unlike many "high art" movies this one ends realistically WELL because, maybe I am too naive, God is kind and life is not a movie.
It took me awhile to see this movie, because I thought it would've been stupid, but I was pleasantly surprised about how well everything came together.
My only problem is with the child actor who played Angus, because he never pronounced Crusoe's name right (it would sound like Crutoe, Cretos, Cristos, etc.
Where Angus retells his tale to two complete strangers, simply because they were looking at a fake photo in a pub that 100 people a day look at and question.
It's too bad because the opening and closing of the film felt awkward and unconnected with the rest of the charming story.
I thought it was very well made, the visual effects are very good and not over done, which was great, because obviously the Lochness monster is going to be CGI, but they made it look so real, and so lovable, lol, like I said, I did cry, it's a tear jerker.
The film is great because of the contribution of three good writers, a charming Maureen O'Hara and fine editing.
I expected, due to the era, for DeMille's battle scenes to be poetic justification for large levels of carnage, but perhaps because I'm unfamiliar with a large part of DeMille's work, perhaps because of my own immersion into the primary sources of the Crusades, I ended up completely mesmerized by a much starker anti-war message than any contemporary film has fully justified for me.
It is hard to say because for every good scene there is a juvenile scene obviously put in to satiate the masses.
He goes to The Crusades in the first place to get out of marrying Alice because any promises would be absolved if he went on Crusade to reclaim Jerusalem for Christendom.
These are similar to the ones in Cleopatra, but far more effective, not because of the higher production values, but because the shots are held for longer and their sequencing is better timed.
And although Joseph Schildkraut was, as it happens, a very good actor, DeMille repeatedly cast him as these Judas figures because of his thin face and piercing eyes.
And we should forgive him, because he did it so well.
I've become jaded as a writer because I've found it increasingly hard to scare myself.
I give this 3 stars mostly because of the acting.
Although one might think that this movie cannot be suspenseful because it takes place within the radius of 16 blocks, many twists and turns occur which make it very interesting.
Soon the scriptwriter disappears and the actor begins a love affair to find out years later that the girl is some kind of ghost/witch/vampire... honestly I couldn't care less because the episode is boring and makes no sense.
This is just for real die hard fans of horror shorts... the slow ghost movies won't be too interesting for neither "Tales..." Fans nor others because they don't lead nowhere.
That point doesn't immediately sink in, because the film is so BEAUTIFUL, a real feast for the eyes, and because the final twist in the story - in my case, anyway - has a delayed impact.
We see the events through the eyes of Shuisheng (Wang Xiaoxiao) a 14-year-old boy from the country who, because he is a member of the trusted Tang family, is brought to the city to be a servant to Bijou.
This film sits well with the current communist government of China despite or perhaps partly because the Boss with his small round eyeglasses looks a little like a Chinese Trotsky.
But Zhang Yimou can be forgiven for playing to the powers that be because he does it with subtle irony and for a purpose, the purpose being to give himself the celebrity and an international reputation so that he is able to make films that might in some way criticize the communist state while he maintains a position of loyalty to that state.
The result looks rather like a VHS transfer, but I'd swear in court that the film looked a lot better on my UK VHS copy (mainly because of the colours).
A lawyer finds Lloyd in this state and instead convinces him to marry a young lady sight unseen--because she must get married and live in a house in order to fulfill the conditions in a will.
That's really too bad, because the little black kid in this film proves himself a comedian easily on a par with Lloyd himself.
This is because F Gwynplaine MacIntyre says that the title of this movie is meant to be a racial pun: 'spooks' being a 1920s slang term for Negroes.
This is because that the film's 'spooks' are supposed to be the uncle, played by Wallace Howe, who is trying to scare the Girl, played by Milfred Davies, who has just married to the Boy, played by Lloyd.
Therefore, the black servants have nothing to do with scaring them away, because they just hide behind curtains, get covered in flour after jumping in the flour, or hide in a huge pair of trousers, or caught the Uncle in disguise as a ghost!
This is because we see Lloyd as a suitor of a rich socialite competing with another suitor, and in this amazing montage, we see them ducking it out, with Lloyd easily getting the better hand of the frustrated suitor.
I bought the DVD (had to order it because nobody carries it) and still find it pretty entertaining.
Simply because you really want Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore to get together.
but huge fans of Sandler would probably be disappointed because there is no gross or wild comedy in here.
I'm partial to this movie because I grew up in the 80's and it brought me back to the music, fashion and fads!
I would have added a Madonna song because of Christine Taylor's character trying to copy her.
I might agree with my first comment but this film pulls on the old heartstrings and makes you want to go visit the mens room because it makes you laugh out loud!!!
As much as i hate to hate to say it; i have based my whole philosophy of love on this film and have found the woman of my dreams because of it ( with none of the corny 80's music involved!!!)
It's a movie that is made great by having an amazing cast making well written characters come to life, and this is in big part because Sandler and Drew have amazing chemistry.
The main reason I can honestly say why people like this movie (especially me) is because it has humor and an element of romance as well... let's also not forget that this was set in 1985; that gives the cast an excuse to dress like a flashback.
It's the funniest of Sandler's films because he seems calmer than in his previous and recent efforts.
The Wedding Singer is a pretty average romantic story that wins because of funny performances and the ever elusive "chemistry" between Sandler and Barrymore.
A reason people, especially guys, don't like romance movies is because often the love between the leads seem contrived and forced.
I think that because of it's relative obscurity on adult swim it's overshadowed by Family Guy and South Park(both of which I also love).
Maybe these are funny to me because they use characters from my childhood that have all but been forgotten.
I always wished they would do an animated show...Then recently a friend asked if I had seen "Robot Chicken" because it was "right up my ally".
I think my dislike of this show might be because of the lack of consistent, well-formed characters.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
Religious satire is great, I believe morel orel is a show dedicated to that ... however Jesus and the Argonots (Despite the fact that the name is funny) I think it's just over the top, and doesn't hit the nail on the head at all, especially because if you're going to satirize something you should do it in the confines of what you're doing.
Not because it is well written or animation genius, but rather it is an exact parody of life.
One reason I enjoyed (and still enjoy) Robot Chicken is because it is so damn nostalgic, among other reasons.
First, i'm a fan of stop motion because I grew up on Gumby and i have also experienced using it.
I happen to get it because I grew up watching mostly re-runs of these shows.
I say often because there are sparse moments of amusement, but these are too rare to make the show worth watching.
I wanted so badly to like this because I love Emmy Rossum, but seeing her prancing around on a bed in her bra and underwear, swinging a sock with a lock in it at a man in his tightly-whities.... it just sort of ruined it for me.
That was great because it gave more insight into the story and how the movie was made.
I watched "Nola" because I am a HUGE Emmy Rossum fan.
Whether you're six years old or twenty-five, this is a very enjoyable movie, and hopefully it will reappear on video again soon, because a virtuous film like this should be readily available to everyone.
I'm Deaf and fluent in ASL, but taking the class because I didn't want to take Spanish.
William Girdler made his directorial debut in 1972 with the surprisingly decent exploitation flick Three on a Meathook, and since then basically everything he's directed has gone on to become notorious - though mostly that's because his films are so low quality, not because of any content.
I say this because at this point, movies like this were largely considered old fashioned.
It makes you wonder how the judicial system can ever figure out who's telling the truth and also how many guilty people are acquitted because of their acting abilities.
I rounded up to 7 because the film's current score of 5.5 is more fitting of a stodgy film like 2002's Unfaithful.
This picture got seen, but not by many, and that's a shame because it's effectively stylish, creepy and perceptive.
And finally, because the film had to have an ending I guess, they give us the solution to the 'mysterie'.
This is not as easy as it sounds and has been messed up in other films, but it does work here because of Rudolph's sure directorial talents and the acting of Moore, Willis, Headly and Keitel.
Be that as it may, this is a superior thriller mainly because the story is compelling and the acting is first rate.
If you don't like her, I guarantee you will not like this movie because she dominates the film.
But boy does it go on, because if feel like its in slow motion!
The main reason I rented it is because Carol AndrÃ©, the beautiful actress from the SANDOKAN TV series was on the cast.
Paulette went on to make another film with Sonny Tufts, "I Love A Soldier", because of their charisma in this film together.
The action and pathos of this film feel real because they are based on real human beings faced with critical issues of life, death, hatred, love and courage in the face of fire.
I enjoyed this movie a great deal because of it's accurate portrayal of the power of women.
Both films are fascinating and moving because they were made during the War, before its outcome was known.
For the ladies, they might like this "war movie," a lot more because it pays tribute mainly nurses and all the romances are probably just the ticket.
Not as gory or violent as it could've been, probably due to lack of budget(..for a Band production, the film looks great, particularly the underground facility and it's devastated state due to natural and unnatural factors), but director JS Cardone is able to build the dread quite nicely due to the fact that the being could be anywhere and mimic certain things(..this was perhaps what many believe was ripped from THE THING, I guess, because an animal is used by the being to trick characters).
i was rolling on the floor laughing till my sides hurt because it was that bad.
i promise you your sides will hurt because you'll be laughing soooooo hard!
Not only that, but the film is fair to Communist Poland- we see Agnieska's home and realise that it is because of the opportunities given by communism that she can leave the boundaries imposed on her railway-worker father, just as Birkut only achieves fame as a worker in a supposedly workers' state.
It is because both of them take rhetoric seriously that they are finally unsuccessful.
i was rolling on the floor laughing till my sides hurt because it was that bad.
i promise you your sides will hurt because you'll be laughing soooooo hard!
It's unfortunate, because the subject matter had so much potential, but this was terrible!
Great flick, mainly because of the acting.
I was looking through my satellite guide to find when this movie was on because I am a big fan of Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis as well.
It's not that she's unattractive, this is Uma we're talking about, but she is socially retarded because her daddy ran out on the family.
Maybe we laughed o much because it was a shock.. that we weren't prepared, so maybe you won't laugh as much once you've read this.. but seriously, once you've seen this film you must look back and laugh at the crappy "bear-klls-human"-scene.
I love character studies and love independent films because their often not afraid to take chances as are many, more mainstream movies.
Movies that capture the humanness of everyday people and environments, deserve kudos because it is not often when that happens.
There's something about this movie that gets hold of you and doesn't let go; maybe because a lot of us have felt like Debbie at one point or another in our lives.
I enjoyed this movie because it was REAL.
Hollywood too often sugarcoat characters and their experiences, almost to the point that it makes you want to puke because you know real life never turns out that peachy.
Both daughter and mother have been cheated out of happiness because of the loss they have experienced.
Unfortunately, this film is so awful that I have no inclination to watch It's a Mad Mad World because I know the memories of this film will be conjured up.
They are arrested for a crime they did not commit (in a scene so shockingly bad the writer should go back to cleaning toilets) and are promptly released in the middle of no where, where a car crashes and out rolls a dying man who informs them that a fortune of INR10 Billion waits for them because they 'are good people'.
Sanjay Dutt adds another horrible film to his resume which is already chock full of horrible films (thanks in part to his friendship with Sanjay Gupta), it's sad because I do think there is talent there that hasn't been properly used or been discovered by an appropriate director.
Maybe I enjoyed it more because I was with my friends, but believe me, it's good to see such a non-stop laugh riot once in a while, however non-sensical!
Not because it was supposed to be scary but because it gave me nightmares of bad acting.
But while I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's "so bad, it's good", I will have to confess that there were times when I laughed because of the overwhelming stupidity.
I gave this movie 1/10, although I have to say I watched it right the way through simply because it made me laugh so much.
Anyway, it did make me laugh, but only because it was so bad.
And her eventually reason for breaking up with him is that teachers in the school are lowering her grades because she's with him.
Not because he likes drag, but because that is what seems to be expected.
Yet, that's what makes this movie so impressive...because it's really GOOD!
I think nothing because of several reasons.
I recommend this movie because it is so wonderful in many ways.
The total feel of Miami it embodied in the show and you have to embrace it, in the episode I viewed there was a arms deal with a Cuban guy(who i swear was the drug dealer with the chainsaw in scarface) and he had a real cool suit on but I won't tell you much more because I don,t like spoilers
I have to say that this first episode passed by so quickly that i thought it was a regular episode (which means 50 minutes long because that's the length of 'Miami Vice' episodes unlike some shows which have 40 minutes episode's length) and not a double one, it was exciting and entertaining in almost every scene, acting was very good, far better from what i have expected, since i heard that 80's detective shows aren't well known for their flawless actors, but Johnson and Thomas are dead on most of the time, specially in dramatic scenes and dialogs.
Not so with Macross, which didn't make a big deal ou t of the characters' ethnicities and saw only the Chinese character standing out because of her frequently-worn Hong Kong-style dresses and hairstyles.
If you can get your hands on the Animeigo boxed sets of the original uncut and subtitled Macross series Â avoid the sequels and the not bad Americanized version, Robotech Â do yourself the favor and check them out, starting with episode number one because the whole thing's one long story told in thirty-six chapters.
Most of my Austrian friends love this movie and i think the dialect is too difficult to understand for German people, which are commercialized by teenie-shockers likes Scream, Black X-Mas, I know what you ...  As I mentioned in the paragraph above Germans maybe don't understand the people speaking because of the dialect and therefore they rate this movie badly.
I like this movie, because it is the first step to a new age of Austrian movies.
I also welcome this movie because Horror has a very small tradition in European film-making.
I was positively surprised by this movie, mainly because the director, Andreas Prochaska (a former collaborator of Michael Haneke) knows how to terrify his audience even if the plot is all too familiar: 75% of the screenplay is shamelessly borrowed from other horror films, some blatantly (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Deep Red), others in a more subtle way (Halloween).
6 out of 5 stars here again mainly because of dialog and time-travel done inventively.
The story is not compelling, maybe because it tries to stay too close to the original media.
Unlike the gratuitously overblown, happily-ever-after, D.C. Comics inspired "Superman" and "Batman" franchises, "X-Men" differs because Marvel Comics forged superheroes with tragic flaws.
Homo superiorÂwill suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous.
"X-Men" hits the mark because Singer and Hayter fuse superior dramatic elements in the best Aristotelian fashion; its heroes experience a tough time winning.
This is OK because Connor says its a different future, but then MC G used a lot of history form the others, such as kyle Reese being Connor's dad, and the photograph, this is OK also, but MC G should of chose to base it on the whole history, or non at all, leaving many loopholes because he doesn't decide.
There are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.
This film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 Million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was Bryan Singer, who's most famous film before was the Usual Suspects, a psychology crime thriller.
He also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but I thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak.
The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise.
As each mutant character is given a past (to give him a motivation) and a weakness, the film's plot never got boring because I also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselves.
James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor.
I think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him.
Magneto's plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done.
I have seen on this site where people scoff at the use of Valium as a way to get a laugh because the drug is too weak.
People immediately labeled Jean Smart as "family TV" because of one role, so they failed to accept her as Ellie Walker.
I can't say I'm wild about Andre Techine or the kind of films he chooses to write and/or direct and this is just about the best film of his I've seen very possibly because of the standout performance of Michel Blanc who dominates the film.
Written by Andre Techine, Laurent Guyot and Viviane Zingg and directed by Techine, "The Witnesses" draws us into the lives of these people precisely because it refuses to make an undue fuss over them and how they choose to live their lives.
It's a small world, because not only have Manu and Mehdi met through Mehdi's well-heeled wife, Sarah (a friend of Adrien's); Mehdi also minds the seedy area where Manu lives with Julie and consorts with the local whores.
There is something radical about TÃ©chinÃ©'s ability to avoid a central action or central character, yet keep things interesting--even more interesting because of the unpredictability of the interactions and an openness toward behavior the straight world tends to see as forbidden or transgressive.
It's disconcerting to discover that Manu isn't central to The Witnesses because when AIDS takes him away, life goes on.
The movie's never really sad, because the director doesn't have the typical long, sad scenes with slow music and lots of tears; just like life, the movie keeps going.
It was actually remade Â and considerably improved upon Â by THE SHOOTING OF DAN McGOO (1945), a Droopy 'vehicle'; while remarkably similar in many respects to the later classic, one of my favorite Averys, it is a minor (if still highly enjoyable) effort Â for one thing, because of an anonymous i.e.
Calling them unbelievers just because your religion is different from theirs?
It all seems senseless because God listens to us all regardless of the way we pray to him.
The picture is moving on (and ironically in the same sense, moving back because of the whole "sending robots to the past" thing).
But that is OK because it was very fun and entertaining.
Maybe its because I'm such a huge fan of Clive Owen.
Well, if somebody asked me how did i like the movie I'd tell them I got disappointed because none of the "revelations" proved to be really moving (neither the history of Marcus, nor new facts on Skynet's creation) but on the other hand it's a nice contribution to the Terminator realm.
Shoot Em' Up may look like an insane movie full of action and lack of remorse towards the squeamishÂthat's pretty much because it is a movie full of action and lack of remorse towards the squeamish.
We have a child born because of a bullet, we have a gun battle midair, and then they even managed to make carrots the most dangerous vegetable in the history of modern film-making.
I find this rather unfortunate because I had been anticipating Shoot 'Em Up for quite some time and had heard many good things about it.
It also failed as a comedy because I think there was only one (maybe two) parts where I laughed.
Magnificent, in a word, not for the dude who is going to sit in the corner and say 'oh look how far fetched that is, look at all that CGI, this is so unrealistic', that is the brilliance of this film it is well and truly rip the crap out of the films which try to hide their CGI scenes with the good old chin wag, this film goes all out action, forget a good old nip to the toilets or a steady stroll to the popcorn stall unless you are still at a dated cinema which has intervals which always spoil the drift of the film because you are sure to miss a key action scene which all the guys you went to the movies with wouldn't stop talking about on the trip home.
I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti & Clive Owen, their combined body of work is impressive to say the least, with works such as Sideways, The Illusionist and American Splendour (Giamatti) with Croupier, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and Children of Men (Owen) to their name, this is a pedigree of some standard and to bring them together on a project has gave this film some much needed gravitas that has allowed it to have a cinema release, because believe me if this film didn't have these actors in it, it would have never seen the light of day.
My cousins and I almost didn't get to see it because the nim-witted box office staff decided ticket stubs would be needed to get into the theater even though we had Shoot 'Em Up passes directly from New Line Cinema reps. Because ticket stub holder got in first, we ended up sitting in the top seats of the theater, which turned out to be a blessing.
It works namely because the violence here is just so creative.
That doesn't deter the film, though, because it's kind of like a stunt show, you're not really concerned with the story.
I'd like to use this film as an example to my (former) favorite critic Roger Ebert as a perfect example of how video games can be construed in the same light as video games, because Roger, this is clearly a movie made by a large video game fan.
Think about the title of the movie, because if you don't like that than just stay home.
This makes me sick, because I wonder how many times the media has destroyed careers, caused riots, ruin investigations, and caused deaths by unethical reporters.
This movie intrigued me right form the start because it's an american movie about Afghanistan.
But this isn't completely accurate given that many reporters are refraining from "asking the tough question" because they feel it would be unpatriotic to do so.
Someone once said:" In war and love, anything is allowed" so expect everything, when they pursue their quest for "their truth", because there is no simple truth, except : "any war is dirty, even the clean ones".
Each one is different and each one experiences a death because of it (as I remember from seeing this one when I was a child.)
And then only because I moved into another section of the country.
In the middle ages a nobleman has a village woman burned at the stake because he believes the woman bewitched his son into killing himself over love for her.
The eldest son is scared to death because of the curse.
And I suppose, that's why they don't show any re-runs today, because most people are "wimps" and can't handle the "real" scary stuff...like.. "Aliens", "The Thing", "Predator", The Hidden, Nite-Flyer and "PitchBlack" just to name a few.....I sure wish I could get my hands on that series.!!!
My wife, some friends, and I rented this because we thought we could at least laugh at how bad it was.
I've only seen a handful of Jaws rip-offs, but even among the few that I've seen Â Mako: The Jaws of Death surely ranks right down near the bottom, and that's actually a shame because it has a fairly decent plot idea going for it.
Especially because, at that point, the cameramen probably didn't yet know anything about how tepid the story lines and how ridiculous the plot of "Mako: The Jaws of Death" actually were!
I'm generously rewarding this film with a four out of ten rating because I appreciate the effort and because I like sharks but, in all honesty, "Mako: The Jaws of Death" isn't worth any rating higher than two.
I tuned in hoping for humor because I enjoyed the works of other members of the cast, specifically Bryan Cranston and Penelope-Ann Miller.
There were moments in which I just had chills because it was real.
It's because they filmed this with what must have been McG's and crew's own jeeps and equipment - throw some military cameo netting and things bought for cheap at your local army surplus store, and you have "Terminator: Salvation".
To do so - I would naturally have had to begin hurling obscenities at the screen, and I didn't because, well I didn't want to ruin the possibility that others might be, cough, enjoying themselves *wince*.
I think it should be seen especially by white Americans because the slave experience, now that all the eye-witnesses are long dead, is in danger of being forgotten.
People SHOULD be angry over what happened but I don't recall the program suggesting that any black person should go attack any white person because of what occurred back in that time.
It is certainly not to be compared with the best work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach mainly because it lacks their genius for character development.
Cheated because of all the talent that could have made a GREAT movies and instead just cashed in big paychecks.
This movie is so powerful because of its reality: especially the casting and dressing department have done a great job to create characters just like you and me (unlike those Hollywood-babes).
Little weaknesses: because the main characters are all part of one family, they are much alike and it was a little problematic for me to distinguish the different characters in the first 30 minutes; composer Michael Nyman seems to have understood the intimacy of the movie with his score but his music is a little too emphatic.
Overall, 'Wonderland' is a very gripping movie, it's a little like a soap opera but much, much better - mostly because of the great cast.
I award it the grade below because this took me by surprise and kept me locked on the screen for 108 minutes and that's a rare accomplishment these days.
In all, I gave this film a 7 because it does what a good futuristic action film should do: wows the eyes and ears.
Not because it makes you feel good... but simply because it makes you feel.
One of the major problems with being a film fan, or a British film fan for that matter, is the deep sense of embarrassment whenever a new British film is released, because it's almost always bad.
You believe these people exist, in reality--you _recognize_ these characters because you've seen them before.
(Anyway, I may too pessimistic for this scene because in the end Eddie and Molly can get along well.)
So if you haven't seen this show yet, watch it, I'm sure you'll like it because I do.
There were a totally of maybe 3 exciting moments in the whole film, I will not spoil them, because honestly, if this was just a post apocalypse action yarn, it was awesome, but its TERMINATOR, not at one point was there any new ideas put in any of the scenes, it felt like McG cheaply ripped off the previous 3 films (but with way more NOTICEABLE CGI), the major problem with Hollywood today, TOO MUCH CGI, NO PLOT DEVELOPMENT, and this film is no different.
There's absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just drags on... and on... and on... That's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress.
Don't expect much from "InuYasha", because you will only feel let down.
These situations seem strange because they look as if taken from real life.
But I want suspense fans to remember the name, because Zambeck brings classic suspense out of the attic, polishes it up, and displays it for the next generation.
I guess it was the second Huey helicopter crash with John Connor as both pilot and sole passenger that did it for me (it seems the U.S. army hasn't surplused any twin-engined Hueys yet, because Hollywood is still flying leftovers from "Apocalypse Now", even in the future).
I also zoned out during the drawn-out battle with the Schwarzenator near the end, because I really didn't care about John Connor (or his cute, perky wife, though she was never in danger the entire movie - another dramatic mistake).
In a sense, that is very true because it is told by the doctor who treated the inmates and thus forged friendships with the criminals.
Many will call this part slow because it is: it's not designed to progress the plot, it's merely there to make you feel the humanity of these prisoners.
I enjoyed this movie because it poised many questions: which punishment should fit which crime?
Let me tell you, my day was full of carnage but it's OK because both movies were very good.
I only put it on because boredom had took over me so I was not expecting to see a good film!!
A safe bet because it does not cause all the impact expected, probably because of external pressure, a safe bet because it is a easy movie to watch, and has a commercial background.
In spite of 2 1/2 hours, you don't feel the time passing, because the cast and the directing are perfect.
In spite of 2 1/2 hours, you don't feel the time passing, because the cast and the directing are perfect.
It's difficult to explain this, but this movie makes you care for the worst kinds of men because it shows you their humanity - their weaknesses and faults, in the prison and outside it.
A sad thing too because children are innocent and so trusting to people they know ( think they know ).
The keyword is "based" because this movie is a true story but has a lot of fictional drama added to it to pique the interest of the viewers.
The reason I can say this is because it is based on the true story about the disappearance and murder of my 5 year old niece.
It is good to sleep while you're watching this movie, because you'll wake up and see that almost nothing has happened, so you can safely eat some popcorn and continue sleeping.
In the end, the couple seems to stay together because they are too tired to move on to the next drama.
Double conflicts suddenly emerged in my mind because I always think like Marion (She usually befriended with her ex) but what I have really done is like Jack (He can't do this to his ex.)
Julie Delpy makes an impressive first work as a director in 2 Days in Paris,a great movie.The best thing about this movie is,no doubt,the screenplay because it makes very intelligent commentaries about the modern relationships and it also has brilliant dialogs.I would say this movie is a twist between Annie Hall and Before Sunset,because it has the intelligent humor of the first one and the brilliant dialogs from the second one.Delpy makes a pretty good performance but Adam Goldberg really surprised me.This actor made a perfect performance and he does not seem to be acting at all and I think that's the greatest achievement of any actor.The only fail I found on this movie is that some scenes are a little bit pretentious.2 Days in Paris is a brilliant movie I truly enjoyed.I totally recommend it.
However, the makers carefully avoided even this and created such a mediocre and bland story, portraying the uninteresting lives of boring characters played by boring actors in such a mediocre fashion that one cannot but wonder whether these people really intended to make a film or were just shooting up some left-over reels because they were desperate to spend all their government subsidies before the Ministry of Culture would reclaim the money.
Yes, few times Woody Allen's name came to my mind because Adam Goldberg seemed doing homage to Woody Allen's character, neurotic, unsecured, and whining - and not particularly good one.
The scene in the beginning of the movie when Jack gives the group of the Americans tourists the apparently wrong directions to Louver just because he is sure that they are conservative Bush supporters does not make him a white knight, and it is just not funny.
Whatever happens between two people in their intimacy should stay between them because it belongs to them only.
by Julie Delpy, comparisons to the Richard Linklater twin combo Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are inevitable, because firstly, they star Delpy, and secondly, the characters hit off into interesting chatter that grabs our attention, albeit this one takes place over a longer period of reel time over 48 hours versus the combined 24 hours that the Before movies offered.
In fact, you'd wonder if honesty (100% no holds barred revelations) can offer you less headache, particularly when your partner has to discover some parts of you that you want hidden away, either for reasons of being ashamed, or just because you want to protect him/her from possible hurt when they find out the truth.
It is definitely to your advantage if you don't speak French, because a key plot element is how Jack (Adam Goldberg) becomes so regularly frustrated by not understanding the language.
In the end, I think I loved this movie because it is one of the best love stories I've ever seen.
I never found myself being so touched by the subject of child abuse especially because of the calmness and the final lines Neil delivers with Brian on his lap and fading into the beautiful piano melody of Sigur Ros' Samskeyti.
Then we have this film - which is what it is - still clinging ever so strongly to the vastly resource-depleted story of Carmilla, and lastly there is Twins of Evil which is nothing more than a Carmilla film in name only because of places and general themes and film trends.
Neil is the great character of the picture, partly because it is he that goes on the strangest and more dangerous journey, or simply because of Levitt's performance: his strangeness in every aspect of life, without ever being numb or absent; the way he wears his clothes and his body, always hitching and always agitated; simply the look on his face, smart but lost.
In Brian's case, his life has been scarred because the trauma caused by that monster to his young mind, has created havoc in his life.
I say strange, because this movie is more hard-core than any American film I've seen since, perhaps, "Happiness".
While the first one had it integral to the plot, this one instead seems more like it was done because it could've been done.
I really don't like Mrs. Trachtenberg probably because I saw her in the god-awful "Euro Trip" and in "Buffy" however in this movie she was pretty good.
The movie at times is hard to watch because of how disturbing some of the scenes are.
I can't really say that I liked the film because this isn't a movie you come out of and say oh yea that was wonderful!
It's shocking and disturbing but it's only that way because it feels and seems real.
Sex is just an important part of the characters' lives - to Neil because he is gay and enjoys sex with older men (he works as a rent boy); to Brian because he is not sexually driven, and is surrounded by something he wants no part of.
Brian blanked out the episodes because he couldn't face the truth, and Neil can't face it either, though he thinks he can.
It is painful to watch at times, but to me at least, that's because the actors and the director managed to immerse me in the characters.
It is interesting because the first half of the movie is focused on Barbara Parkins and then the 2nd half is focused on Barbara Stanwyck.
Barbaba Parkins calls the caretaker to see what is for dinner because the mother is out all night shopping, cold cuts and salad.
I just watched Ode to Billy Joe today because my mother and aunt talked me into it, and I am 13 and I have the biggest crush on Robby Benson(in his younger years of course).
I really think that because Billie Joe was drunk, he may not have realized the reality of what was going on when that man raped him(in my opinion it was rape).
I think he was just extremely ashamed because he knew that was totally unacceptable in that time and very scared and didn't know what to do.
Bobbie Lee and Billy Joe fall in love but can not be together because Bobbie Lee is not allowed to date.
I won't tell more, because you should see this movie if you are a horror fan that appreciates low budget.
I'm not sure why this film has been rated so low, but I'm going to guess it's because most people go into every movie they watch expecting it to be Citizen Kane, and then rate the movie with a 1 because it wasn't a Hollywood blockbuster with 10 million dollar explosions.I'm assuming if you're checking this movie out, you are either a Troma fan or a Zombie fan.
I am rating this film 10 because I believe other people have severely underestimated the film, and I feel its poor rating might deter viewers.
Well I just thought I would post this and if you have seen please respond because I would love to know me and brother are not alone.
Mark (also played by Gibson) has purchased the home at a steal because of its disturbing past, which he isn't aware of.
This is given far less weight, partially because it's not so directly related to what's on the screen, and partially because this is impossible to "measure" for most newer films; this last factor also only tends to help ratings; I don't really subtract any points for cultural/historical _unimportance_.
Partially because of this set-up, the dialogue tends to be ridiculous, well written, unintentionally hilarious and scathingly satirical, often all at the same time.
He opens up the stores of food at the palace and gives it to the citizens - they have no food because the city is being held by the Burgundians.
Someone complained because Errol Flynn did not play this role.
Louis XI was known as the spider king because the man was the craftiest of schemers.
Pre-Holmes, he revels in playing an unprepossessing cynic to whom everyone must bow because he happens to be the king.
Yes, the movie also looses points because nobody in can act worth a crap.
While maybe the movie does earn those adjectives, it is not because of the stupidity of it's creators, on the contrary; the cast & crew made it stupid on purpose.
I think the reason that the TMOTMM didn't make it is because wives wouldn't let their husbands watch it, which is perplexing since husbands don't mind if their wives watch the predictable pretentious, "Sex in the City."
I think people trash this show because it really does make them look at themselves in the mirror and ask yourself 'am I really happy with the choices I've made?'
This miss had my name on it because madman George Zucco and Last Universal Frankenstein Monster Glenn Strange were featured in its cast.
A genuine cult following has formed around this film because of Stensgard's devastating charisma, which would never be properly employed again, by Hammer or any other company.
When the sheriff (Charlie Middleton) shows up about 34 minutes into this 65 minute opus, the lawman arrests Allen Bentley because Lee's father had slapped Bentley in the presence of both Bradford and Andy.
The revelation of Winfield's killer comes as something of a shock because of all the red herrings and the meticulous characterization.
A motley group of people are forced to seek shelter at a remote inn run by the snooty, sarcastic, but suave Amos Bradford (a perfectly unctuous George Zucco) because of a raging thunderstorm that has flooded out the bridge and the roads alike.
ha ha  I liked the movie just because of this event in my life.
Having said that I know you will agree with me that it is because of their true talent which is so convincing, compelling and genuine to life that I can almost believe in the reality of the characters as true to life.
This show defiantly found a way to touch on all subjects, broken homes (with out being stereotypical because daddy doesn't always have to beat mommy or be an alcoholic for the home to break up) in the case of Maya and her husband.
I was resistant to the show at first because I was overwhelmed with shows like Moesha, the Parkers, and I didn't like the way they portrayed black people.
The characters are pretty obnoxious and as the show progresses its hard to like them because they do some pretty stupid things to jeopardize their lives.
First of all we all know that Santa Claus is an imaginary character so you're going to get angry at William because he doesn't cater fairy tales to a little boy that needs to be fed truth in order to be a mentally stable adult?
I am always anxious to see Black people on the TV screen but when all I'm getting is chittlin circuit trash like Girlfriends, Eve, Cuts, The Game and Half and Half , I begin to lose hope for quality Black shows because every show that was cool like All Of Us is countered by dreck like the shows I just mentioned.
This is definitely not one of the strongest entries but I don't go along with people that think this is a truly bad film because it's not.
Technically this is a film that could have used some rewrites on the script because while you watch it some things just don't make sense.
Is it because of her powers as a vampire?
maybe it is because this meeting even though it is for some hours is more important than the rest of the every days.
I love this film because of its wonderful image of the city and the perfect work of actors.
And because this film is about us - or about us some years ago, our desire to live, feel and to do.  
At all times it is believable because the forces driving Sybylla transcend time and place: creativity and independence.
"Tee for Two", despite being so simple and predictable, is different at the same time because it is one of those Tom & Jerry's cartoons all about sports (in this case, golf).
I feel reluctant making this comparison though, in a way, because it is evident that this piece of animation must have taken thousands of hours to produce.
I have found myself watching this again and again, simply because it is so darn funny!
I can't even count how many people I have gotten hooked on this movie because I made them watch it with me once.
I really wish Mike Myers can go back to doing comedies like this because after seeing The Love Guru, I lost all hope in Mike Myers.
Mike Myers, in a dual role as the neurotic but romantic Charlie McKenzie and Charlie's cantankerous father, gives the best performance I've seen from him so far (I've yet to see the "Austin Powers" movies but I didn't especially care for "Wayne's World," maybe because I couldn't stand Dana Carvey or his character).
Will he get away with it because he's white?
So the atmosphere is not hindered because of a cheesy score as is the case of most giallos.
The complex plot is also quite an achievement because at the end the pieces fall into place quite perfectly.
Finally this movie is a winner because of the existence of the standard giallo characteristics which will definitely please the giallo purists.
Gore fans may not be disappointed because of the existence of a scene where a character is sliced in the face.
Firstly, because of it's inventive and bloody murders.
This latter factor is because of the section of the movie where four youngsters turn up at an empty villa to party.
And that's all the movie is: there's no mystery as to who the killer is, because it's everybody, so it's just a matter of who is left at the end.
SPOILER AHEAD: Only the hanging death at the beginning was of any interest, mainly because every other murder in the entire movie looked as if it was doused in red tempera paint.
The narrative â in which members of the same family kill each other off because of an inheritance â brings to mind not only the âold dark houseâ-type thrillers like THE CAT AND THE CANARY but also the celebrated black comedy from Ealing Studios, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS (1949).
Incidentally, Bavaâs film has also been seen as a black comedy in some quarters â but itâs rather difficult to concur, in view of all the typical giallo viciousness (reportedly, former Bava collaborator Christopher Lee walked out of a screening of the film because of its excessive violence!).
The humor is oppressed, but it's definitely present throughout the whole filmÂif you don't see that, I pity you because the film's power depends on it.
Many critics have dismissed the whole slasher genre just on that basis: the films are not horrifying because the people getting killed either deserve it because they're annoying or the acting was really bad, or just because the writing was terrible and the characters were just token characters and it's not scary to see token, cardboard characters getting killed.
It hardly matters because the killings aren't being made by a single killer with a singular reason but by several killers, whom all have a confusing number of reasons (which can all be traced to greed), with few of the killers knowing that others are also killing other people at the same time and as the film progresses, the killers, in turn, also become victims themselves.
I laughed, I cried (not really), I even bought some old Ginger Lynn videos because of K&C.
As something of an indie film-maker myself, it's exciting to see a film like Kisses and Caroms, because it manages to use it's indie status to it's advantage - free of studio interference, Vince Rocca has crafted an outrageously funny film which could never have come out of Hollywood, whilst still not falling into the traditional pitfalls and clichÃ©s of independent film.
You can't see this movie because Traci Lords lied about her age to get into pictures.
I think it was on A&E, it intrigued me because the story line was so unusual.
I watched it, and knew I had to rent it, because when the commercials came on I just wanted to be able to see it in its entirety without the ads.
I started not to watch it because I only liked one of Berringers movies, and that was the one where he made a comedy spoof out "movie cowboys"; forgot the name, but it was all those colored shirts, always clean shaved, and shot the gun out of the outlaws hands with a sixgun from a mile away.
No, I am not 1/4 Cheyenne or Cherokee, nor would I ever want to be one of the multitude who claims to be one of them, just because it is fashionable.
The story is about the survival in a 'lost valley' in the Oxbow region of Montana (actually shot in Alberta, Canada, presumably because Montana is not wild enough anymore) of the descendants of a band of Cheyenne Indians called 'the dogmen'.
It's both a chick flick and a guy's movie because of the great mix of emotion, excitement and action.
But that may be because I found the book more complex and relevant.
LIONEL BARRYMORE: His character (but not his acting) is the one I like least because he is constantly cringing and apologizing; however,based on the type of role it is, he is right on the money.
(Watch him in "You Can't Take It With You," for instance, when he had to work on crutches because of his advancing arthritis.
(He apparently only accepted the role because he was promised he would be the single star with a German accent.)
Edmund Goulding's Grand Hotel is a perfect example of how a flawed film can still be great because of its blemishes, and not in spite of them.
When first released, Crawford was notoriously frustrated that Garbo received top billing (she was rumored to have always arrived late on the set, playing Marlene Dietrich records in between cuts just because she knew they were Garbo's pet peeves), but to me this only enhances the characters: Crawford's role is supposed to be more subdued (afterall, she IS the stenographer and Garbo IS the celebrity in the film).
Otto is staying at the hotel because he only has a short time to live, so he takes his entire life savings and decides to live the rest of his life in luxury.
Realizing that she was a drama queen as a profession, I excused a lot of it, but it got to a point where I was really snickering to myself after awhile, because she was acting just like Gloria Swanson later would in "Sunset Boulevard".
By today's standards, the film is dated, but for a discriminating film fan, "Grand Hotel" is a classic because of the star turns one witnesses.
Some seventy-odd years after its release in 1932, GRAND HOTEL today holds an interesting attraction more for the presence of its two leading ladies than from its cinematic power, although there will be some purists who will state that because the images of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo have been immortalized in their own respective canons, that in itself is cinematic power.
Greta Garbo is the temperamental Russian ballerina Grusinskaya and her artistic tantrums are getting less and less tolerable in many ways because of the Depression.
The "international team" is narrow and biased in its exclusion of the Armenian and Russian voices; the "in-depth" documentary makes erroneous statement (e.g., the socialist revolution could not start in March 1917 and be led by Lenin at least because he was out of the country until April 1917); the images collected are biased in minimizing the Armenian cause....
While they are very effective in their advocacy, their approach is also unethical because they use "selective truth" to "prove" their point.
This one is special because it's another rip-off of SMOKEY & THE BANDIT, and also another with the name "Smokey" in the title (how many were there???).
A shame this is so bad really, because I like bad horror movies and actually rather liked the basic premise: Back when the Spanish were being generally unpleasant to natives in America, they enslaved the local populace and got them to mine all the gold out of the mountains and basically ended up with a wet dream's worth of gold.
A few comments- First of all, I was student body president at Antelope Valley College when this movie filmed there-they got to film because they kicked $750 into the student government accounts and loaned us original prints of three films for an on-campus showing (they came back to re- shoot two scenes on a weekend, and snuck onto the football field by conning a security guard, btw)...I'm also a background extra in three different scenes in the first 10 minutes, and several of my friends are also in this movie.
Jimmy McNichol plays the local bad boy in this neck of the Ozark woods who just likes to race cars and wreck as many as he can because it's good clean fun.
How lame is that, plus is Drake suppose to be one of the seven monks, because they never said.
This is unfortunate, because I respect Adel Imam for some of his other cinema & theatre work.
That is because it fits like a skeleton key in these generic movies with extraordinary plots.
That's because there are so many negative side effects of the drug--nausea, illness and weird hallucinations by some.
Which I think was a great idea, because they explored JASON to a different state of mind.
This to me should have been called JASON goes wild, because of the harsh punishments he gives people in this.
There probably a bottle of nerds here that voted 1 because OH A NAKED LADY!
The whole reason he was scary was because he was this backwoods, crazy type of character that was based soley in legend and newspaper writings.
We've got the inclusion of Jason's half sister (I'm guessing a rip off of Halloween), and the fact that Jason is immortal because of some device from the Evil Dead series.
If it came down to it, go with Jason Goes to Hell, because Paris Hilton, sucks, big time.
I just wanna say this was an excellent movie to finish the series of the hockey mask killer, i can tell it was excellent because i am the greatest fan of Friday the 13th!!!.
Except the rebirth is anti-climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie.
And apparently genetics has a preference for certain types of clothing, and a certain mask because he is reborn with both.
only gave it a 2 because it has Jason and i was able to watch the whole thing with out switching off.
"Jason goes to Hell" is substantially worse than any other entry, mainly because it is completely unrecognizable.
because of that, I doubt very highly that it was directed by Lo Wei.
That is surprising, because it must have been an anachronism even then.
You may not have any sympathy with the characters, or like them, or even be able to empathize at all; but you have to watch because you just know it is going to get more intense, and it does.
I was at first disgusted with director Sun-Woo Jang because I had felt that he cheated me.
I will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic, because there are human elements at the core of this film, as underdeveloped as they are, they are there.
He failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about Y and J that we could care less how they resolve themselves.
Robert Montgomery and Crawford's characters love each other, but because she is rich and he has little money, he is afraid to marry her because of what people might think.
For instance, Jason X is almost a 10, because it is bad and intended to mock the Friday the 13th movies.
Not that I protest too loudly, because most b-grade zombie flicks don't offer much more in the line of storytelling.
That is because Anghus Houvouras (the writer) seems to fancy himself imaginative when he makes them a hybrid from the "fast dead" (as seen in 28 Days Later) and vampires (they drink blood).
Thats mostly because of Berg who is just funny as hell.
I can't comment on the 'stunts' because there weren't any that were bigger than someone rolling off a 1-storey roof onto the ground.
Mostly, because I am a fan of James Cagney's and thought his performance in this movie was excellent.
In fact Universal fired Chaney because he thought he deserved more money.The ending is the part that gets me the most.
Chaney Jr became an actor because he had a family to feed and he thought he could get work because he was Lon's son.
But only because of Cagney.
Still I gave this movie a 3 because of cast, acting, makeup and stuff.
I think the film succeeds because it made the "thousand faces" the backdrop to the life of the man and the difficulties he faced.
I liked the movie because I love the actors in it.
I mention this only because it seems as though this movie made it here on star power alone.
Maybe the English version of the film is ok but the original version (in french) has no taste, no colors, no shape... it is a sad movie, because you see the end of great actors and you see how somebody who could act very well now seems to be reading a text in front of the camera without entering neither the story nor the character.
The idea behind this film sounds like the stuff good comedies are made of: two very different people, man and woman are forced to share a hotel room because their flights are cancelled.
I call it a French flic rather than the usual "film", because it seems more American than French.
I caught this on French TV about 2 months ago, with high hopes because it features Jean Reno, but I was very disappointed.
The film asks us to believe that because he loans her his phone and tries to pass on a message, then meets her unpleasant boyfriend, he will offer to share his hotel room when their flights are cancelled due to a strike and that they will both begin to open up emotionally.
You know you're in trouble when a song starts in the middle of a movie and the story stops developing for a while: They do so here because they want to stay faithful to the romcom genre and DÃ©calage horaire / Jet Lag is a French take on a distinct American genre.
Binoche will probably be CÃ©sar nominated for her role, and because this is such a change in direction for her she may even win.
He has reached his peak, and while still near the top, he has become a headache and problem to his studio because of his drinking the past several years.
Julliet Binochet, almost unrecognizable during the first half of the film because she is buried under makeup and an odd hair style, is totally delightful and stunning, especially when she finally appears with no makeup and wet hair.
Could it be a little bit of jealousy because it is a foreign film from a country with no tradition in this genre but that nonetheless achieves what most American romantic comedies don't?
We see a man getting pushed aside because of his own destructive behavior and attitude.
Ohhh, and for an added bonus the marshals who are supposed to be trained at firing guns can't hit the jackhammer zombie because they are firing at the jackhammer that is just there.
Of course there are some mean, ugly zombies here who wants to make asphalt (yes, you heard right, asphalt) out of everyone foolish enough to travel there, because the road is cursed you see, some prisoners were killed here for a long time ago.
You might think that I'm not telling you anything about the good things in this movie only because I'm mean cynic who loves to slog off movies but no.
I tell you this because there are almost no good things in it.
The effect doesn't make the movie any better, simply because its action scenes are just, well, terrible.
Do NOT watch this movie, because it will be a waste of your money and your time.
They go down it and a mole hand pokes out of the wall, which, of course, they don't see, because the Load has the vapors.
Well, John the Pompous A** shines a flashlight on 'em and melts some elves, because they run away from 'light that is slightly brighter than what [they're] used to, NO!!!'
I gave it three stars, partially because it is the genre of B movies, and it deserves it.
I'm giving this crap a 3 because some of the sets are impressive, but everything else rots.
Not hateful, because it doesn't actively promote antisocial behavior, and not bad enough to be unintentionally amusing either.
They don't have much time anyway because, before you know it, they discover a lost civilization of pale Sumerians who live on mushrooms, except for one beautiful babe (Cynthia Patrick, the best actor in the bunch) who looks reasonably human and has something resembling a tan.
When Agar retires, she goes with him and he must gently fend her off because, after all, he's a man of principle.
He schemes to get the flashlight away from Agar, because he believes it will make him all powerful.
I picked this up at a car-boot sale on VHS for a Â£1 purely because I remember seeing it advertised in the back of "Famous monsters of film land" in the 1960,s and wondered what it would be like, Well!
It is one of the best portrayals of an alcoholic that I have seen, because March focuses on the pain, the resentment, that causes him to drink, rather than just the ugly aftermath that a binge leaves in it's path.
Barrymore was also a big-shot whose career declined heavily in the 30's because of his alcoholism.
Esther is not just a wishy-washy, typically 'nice' girl- she is strong and willing to stick by Norman because of her faith and her faith in their love.
Does the producer of this film think that just because they made some film condemning the poaching and extinction of some species of antelopes in Tibet, the Tibetans will love Chinese, who stole their land and massacred their people?
I have repeatedly criticized this movie because of its disgusting propaganda.
I had real fears about watching this film because the 1954 remake is one of my ten favorite films, and absolutely perfect in every way.
On top of this, Ritai has decided to let the group of incarcerated skinners go because he can no longer take care of them.
So, life saving medicine that she would deny to ten million other diabetics is OK for her because SHE is devoted to saving animals.
The men carry machine guns and give plenty of warning shots because their unsanctioned job is to fine or arrest, not to kill the poachers.
This film had a limited marketing and release because it didn't quite fit any of the "commercial" film genres-- but I'll be watching out for director Lu Chuan's next film about the Nanjing massacre (or "incident" as some Japanese call it).
They become even more realistic because of the strong inner conflict which is aroused by the necessity of selling some of the confiscated antelope skins.
The only film which I'd consider Unintentional Horror is this it because I may explain the plot is about Lies and deception -- it's all in the family when a man must convince his future in-laws that he's as uptight as they are.
I almost couldn't watch the movie because his character was so annoying and, as another poster mention, goofy.
It scared me so much that I actually almost screamed in one part but gasped instead, and twice I had to turn it off and stop watching it because it scared me that much.
The reason why it scares me is because since early childhood I've suspected that I may be a victim to alien abduction.
I decided not to even finish it back then because it's way too intense.
True, near the end the story gets quite fragmented, and results more in the telling of anecdotes than actually trying to wrap up an already incoherent story (note that I'm not using the word 'inconsistent', because Strieber is very consistent in his way of telling the events, both in the book and the movie).
This one is worth a look because of the great cinematography and the use of color for a film made in the early years of its invention.
Flip is also surrounded by his equally white wannabes who constantly refer to each other as 'dogg' spelled with two Gs because it is so very gangster (I'm sorry, I meant gangsta) to misspell things.
He doesn't know anything about being a rapper, he doesn't know anything about drug dealing, he doesn't know anything about being a gangster, and frankly it makes people in Iowa look really bad because i'm sure they are not really like that.
they should have stuck to a genre, developed the characters with a lot more thought, and...lose the music videos...half of the movie doesn't even make sense because of it.
because its contents were so funny but its context of the prison so sad.
Instead they take every cliche out of black street dramas, but because they're white and because it's set in the ridiculous setting of Iowa (no offense to you Iowonians) they slap a comedy label on it.
Someone said that it is just a sterotype of white boys but it is not because there are really people like Flip, Trevor, and James who want to be black for some reason.
Someone said that it is just a sterotype of white boys but it is not because there are really people like Flip, Trevor, and James who want to be black for some reason.
I only watched this movie because parts of it were filmed in my hometown and I was very disappointed with it.
Apparently, people don't think there's drugs in Iowa, because stereotypically, we're just a whole bunch of white farmers or something, and that's what the movie portrays us as.
But there are a lot of drugs here because people make the stop in between Chicago.
Basically, acting like these kids is similar to deciding to dress like a cowboy because you start to like country music.
Its because we don't have the words to precisely categorise every kind of fool that it remains kind and not judgemental.
No, I'm not saying that because I disliked it a little and I'm definitely not exaggerating.
It's hard to comment on other aspects of the movie like acting, simply because it's difficult to get past the disgraceful audio/visual quality.
Check out this plot: experimental drug in a sanitarium ends up making all the people there go completely nuts, because of sanity juice sucking inter-dimensional parasites!
I would rate it as 9.8/10 because it has the ability to entertain young as well as middle-aged viewers in terms of horror story.
Wait until this comes to the big screen because you will get much more of an scary and intense experience but if you missed it then hire the video.
Both times I end up getting some badly needed household chores done around the condo, because this movie just doesn't hold your interest.
Finally, you can't even say this is a 2004 homage to the '50s cult classic "Them," because the ants are actually not really that big (about the size of a medium-sized dog).
As another reviewer commented, it appears that these scenes were almost part of another movie, because they didn't fit at all!
She was in the FBI but made a career change because she faints when seeing a corpse.. not kidding.
they found the gun because our moronic janitor who is also a psychic broke into a desk in the office where he was hit over the head with the wooden duck..?????
Thank god they can escape because there is a cable between this and the nearby skyscraper (????
Most of them escape however the company info stealing dude pulls a gun to skip the queue - I don't blame him- an ant follows him , he pulls the gun - magic gun because it went from the eaten editor to him?
Intro Martin I will really humiliate myself for a scrap of food Kove.. shoots his next in command about 15 times because his colleague is attacked by a plastic ant that basically sits on his shoulder.. like a parrot.
I enjoy stupid movies, but this one was more than I could handle because it was simply bad.
B movies have the excuse of having a low budget, but in this case, I think if they had 20 Million dollars and the same help and talent, they couldn't have done any better because they aren't capable.
This movie works because its setup in a small town with backstreet gangsters who at times look ridiculous driving in their small car and hunting Richard is not the typical depiction of good/bad but rather different.
I can't believe I was so young when I saw it, because it made such a deep impression on me and I understood it so clearly, even at a young age.
Seeing it again on DVD, some of the early scenes made me laugh because the acting is rather wooden, and the production values are very 1970s.
The dialogue is straight out of the book, and in some places this makes it unrealistic and cumbersome, but the narration in Jane's voice is wonderful, because it lets us know what she in thinking.
It is one of my favorite British novels -- I bought my house because of Jane Eyre's love of window seats.
at least fifteen episodes; but, since it was a "low budget" production, it has only five - and, because of that, the "gipsy scene" had to be pruned up to the point of becoming just a hilarious scene, and the character of Rosamond Oliver had to be simply tossed off.
This movie resonates so much with me because I know many little, ultimately insignificant, "hard men" like those shown here, the big fish in little ponds who would not last 5 minutes outside their comfort zone.
This is the first movie I saw of Gina Gershon, I definitely want to see more movies, not because she was so good in this one, but because it seems as if she is capable of so much more.
Half way through the movie, he takes her to the scene of the crime, because the evidence keeps mounting against her.
This is a film that is very much overlooked by most Bogart fans, not because of his acting, but the story line may have been great in 1947, but is not very thrilling today.
The movie begins slow and dull because it's mostly just so formulaic.
It rises above the lice episode simply because it once again reinvents Garrison for the better this time (the Mayor's reaction, "You're a lesbian now," is priceless).
The episode revolves around Mrs. Garrison, at the beginning she is aggravated that her date blew off, because she was asked if she used to be a man.
I first saw this movie when I was a kid and recently, I have viewed it over and over again because it is one of my favorite movies.
The only reason I didn't give the film a 10 is because the accents could have been a little bit more country.
Interesting and engaging as far as documentaries go, but maybe that's because I'm interested in the topic.
This law is of course ridiculous and shows why the president can never really pass such ridiculous things, because of the system.
I'm a little disappointed with this movie because I thought that it would be better.
It's easy to beat up on a movie because some things happen in it that don't seem logical, but come on, this is a movie!
Well anyone thinking about seeing this movie should discount anything they've heard about it being bad because it is a super ,energertic original film.
It's easy to beat up on a movie because some things happen in it that don't seem logical, but come on, this is a movie!
And I think that's why this film succeeds; because it has a good story.
It's a really great movie for younger audiences because the satire has tremendous heart.
It's good for adults too because it's biting and intelligent.
There is a strong critical view of "A day without a Mexican" easily because it defends illegals and mocks Americans.
Still others believe that it is because the other races didn't appreciate the Mexicans and so they just up and left.
because if they watched it they would see how hard life would be if Mexicans would not be here in the US.
I routinely felt my intelligence insulted and because they absolutely had to isolate California from the rest of the country they had to invent that dumb pink fog concept.
Some have mentioned that the film carries a twist towards the end, but because of the execution it does not feel like a twist.
Yet, it is at times extremely harrowing, uncomfortable and unsettling - not because of excessive amounts of gore (while the film contains violence, it is the weight of the violence and not flashy blood and guts that carry impact), but because of the way the events unfold.
Just because someone is illegal, that doesn't automatically mean it is permissible to mistreat and dehumanize them.
My message to everyone who considers others to be different just because of language, color, culture or anything else and who likes movies: go see the Gatekeeper, it might tell you against who you should direct your anger.
I liked the movie as a whole because it had an original idea for a script.
All of a sudden, there's no fresh fruit or vegetables, crops are rotting because there's no one to pick them, and there are plenty of other jobs that there's no one left to do.
The movie itself provides some interesting informational tidbits throughout, and plenty of lighthearted laughs, such as a scene where the Los Angeles Dodgers will be handicapped because of the number of Latino players they have missing, but the NBA says the Lakers will be fine.
Maybe it's because I live in California, but I like to think that the vast majority of Americans with two brain cells working at the same time already knew everything that this movie had to say.
With this movie and Giallo A Venezia, I think Mario Landi attempted to do something outrageous, black humored and gory as Peter Jackson`s first two movies, but failed to gain such popularity because he aimed these elements at the sexual, to which most of the audience is very sensitive.
It is very hard for me to agree with almost everyone who reviewed this movie and Giallo A Venezia, because the question arises how did they sit through them in the first place since they have always been movies with such bad reputations.
Shot very effectively in a style somewhere between Italian neo-realism, early Scorsese and even Cassavettes improv but with a flavor all its own, it doesn't matter that one of the plot twists is very obvious (so obvious, in fact, I'm not even sure that it's even meant to be a twist) because co-writer Paddy Considine is such a riveting yet natural presence in the lead: he's able to be genuinely threatening while keeping it absolutely real, creating a very believable monster.
Regardless, or possibly because of these things, I still got a kick out of this one.
Nobody in the public asked for this film to be made and when released in 3 cinemas... none of which were in the western suburbs because the distributor knew already nobody West would see it... it was a compete financial failure again again again wasting public taxpayer funds which were spent 'creating' this turgid drivel..
Predictably, he has no luck; she bypasses him in favour of Jerry, possibly because he's not as stoned and can still string a few sentences together.
Maybe because I grew up watching SNL live during its first 5 or so years but I really got a laugh out of the Coneheads when they would do that skit on SNL.
The movie is called Coneheads because of the top of their head is shaped like a cone.
A woman sits and blubbers simply because her friends have walked into the forest and have been gone for awhile.
I can't continue to trash it anymore, because I just don't have time and energy to waste on this film.
Which doesn't make any real sense because that's actually five words, and Steven Hawkings can't actually speak.
Anywho, if you are lucky enough to run across "The Texas Nailgun Massacre" in your local video store (which you won't) I highly suggest you keep walking, because only those with hearts as pure as snow and strength as mighty as the wind blows can handle what lies in front of you on that movie store shelf..."Critters 3."
While some of the victims are the rapists and probably deserve this, other people are killed because they are merely construction workers(like the rapists) or because they are women who are with the workers.
I'm rewarding this crazed flick with a 10 out of 10 rating, for sheer awfulness but most of all because it's the single most entertaining 80's slasher out there!
His height and build also changes through the course of the movie because the director hired two stunt doubles, one of which happens to be female!
When the bad guy falls to his doom, it is obvious he landed on a mattress, because his foot flies back into the picture.
The first movie in the series what fantastic and the second was just horrible because they change the actors a little bit and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible.
He is defeated in the election because he shows a high level of distance from the people.
He refuses to accept the job his brother in the north is proposing because he does not want to move.
He also refuses to accept the job the local lawyer is proposing: investigator for his special cases, because he feels it is charity.
Maybe he was right but at that time crime moved from the back woods of Tennessee to the dilapidated ethnic and poor suburban areas or ghettos of the big cities because the main traffic did not concern moon-shine whisky any more, an inheritance of Prohibition, but the new hard drugs like heroin and cocaine coming from Latin America.
I give this movie 8 weasel stars because of the suspense that keeps watching the picture and the action.
I went to a recent screening of this movie because I had heard interesting things about it.
It's a shame because the film highlights a part of history that is not well known in the western world.
had a large role in the riots of '84 and I'm not saying this because I'm a sikh (because I'm not).
I was initially hesitant about watching Amu because movies with a backdrop of communal riots don't sit well with me.
While that happened, it only happened because he was facing death!
It seems like a low-budget production because the camera work is a bit choppy and the pacing is terrible - slow bits should be fast and fast bits should be slow - but the writing and acting are great.
Let me explain every motive the characters have because I'm sure you're not sharp enough to think about them on your own."
I went to a screening of The Civilization of Maxwell Bright at the Scottsdale Film Festival last night because it looked intriguing, but really, it was because Patrick was presenting the film and doing a Q+A after, and I didn't want to miss anything he might say about The Tick.
I love this documentary because it gives a better image of who Bruce really was and how much of a great hard worker and perfectionist he was.
But anyway, I loved the Game of Death footage because of the offbeat comedy between Bruce and his buddies.
Bruce did not compete in karate tournaments because he saw them as unrealistic.
Forget any documentary about Bruce Lee you may (or may not) have seen in the past, because this is THE one and ONLY one to see.
A sadness permeates this movie because you feel that Bruce Lee was taken way too early.
And this German count especially likes this silent film not only because in the oeuvre can be seen Teutonic aristocrats and even crowned kings, not to mention stiff laws about etiquette, uniforms with plenty of medals, tradition, obligation and, last but not least, royal duties.
Another reason is because the film has style and classic elegance, primal emotions in motion, beautiful scenery and almost real decors, an impossible but idealistic true love story and memorable and skillful direction.
I loved it, and not just because I have German roots in my family.
Maybe part of this is because I am not the biggest fan of musicals, but I think more of this has to do with how beautifully made this film is.
He can't go out and mingle or meet other people because of his station.
I sat through this ambitious film in its entirety because some very dear, close friends of mine loaned me the DVD and I made a commitment to them to watch it.
I tried watching it SOLELY because of Jason Isaacs.
Perhaps it's because I'm American, I really don't know, but I found this movie hard to follow (much like Clockwork Orange, another movie I never understood) and I really could have done without the drug scenes and violent fight scenes.
many would simply class it in the same school because it is british, it features "hip" newcomers, and the direction is very flashy and effects rich.....well except for the british part this describes most every film coming out now.
But the film is refreshingly free of Orientalist clichÃ©s, perhaps because the leading woman's character was originally conceived as a Pole.
Maybe it didn't make any money at the box office because it stinks!!!
I stayed with the movie just because the concept of the movie was intriguing enough to keep me watching.
I finally reached the "point of no return," where you finish the movie not because you're enjoying it, but because you've already invested so much time in it that you figure you might as well finish it off.
I don't know if the movie was cheap to make, but I really hope it was, because it really looked it.
So to surmise, if you want to watch a nuclear thriller with unintentional laughs which is camper than a row of Rocky Horror Show fansÂ then I'd point you to Wargames, because I simply can't recommend Miracle Mile to anybody.
I mainly gave it a 10 because I was amazed at the techniques used in this film, fantastic animation, music, great sense of humor, editing and these are things I don't usually notice in a movie.
You can enjoy this work on many levels because it, for me at least, it succeeds at every level.
This movie is really fun to watch everytime just because of the funny quotes that are made in the movie.
However, I can forgive all that and more, because this film contains a scene that left such an impression on me, I am sure it will be in the back of my mind for as long as I live.
Steve McQueen delivers a formidable performance as the convict Charriere, nicknamed "Papillon" because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest.
McQueen's movie star charisma has held up much better because it was a integral part of him.
The pic is overlong about two hours and half , though is neither boring, nor tiring, but entertaining, because develops many adventures and happenings.
I've always wanted to know what was this music, because I found it very appropriate with the action.
That is unfortunate, because that is it's only major fault.
I guess this is reasonable, as on the regular Muppet Show, because the songs may not be very familiar yet to the young audience.
But the situation regains its lost credibility when Alice's plain Jane roommate Dotty (Barbara Read) calls her a date getter and tells her that the sororities will want her once they see her because she will attract men.
I've seen a lot of movie, 2, 300... a year and only once have I stopped watching a movie because of how bad it was, something about killer kondoms in new york city, i dunno, don't care.
I mean, the reason why this movie is such an upset to some viewers is probably because MTV wasted all there money on it's crummy commercials.
Too bad it wasn't real, because I'd love to watch the Liz character be hot for a whole season.
Plus the filming work was terrible because at times it looked like the way they film in the real world series' which doesn't have that movie affect but then at times it did.
Well, because I'm a rather evil person who will no doubt find great delight in watching this pack of moronic actors have little-to-no success in the future.
Rest assured, this show is exactly like The Office because they both take place in a grocery store.
I had such hopes that someone had come to the slow conclusion that we aren't fat because we can't stop eating.
I guess it's still better than the endless stream of my husband is a monster because he only takes me out once a week and even had two beers last Christmas-flicks but man is it close.
Back to the movie....The reason I give bad ratings is because of movies like this one.
I just wanted to re-state that comment because everyone knows how much I hate that one too.
On the one hand she is angry with her mom because she had a heart attack (due to being overweight) and the hospital bills took all of her parents savings and left no money for her to go to college.
if the mom is fat, dump the girl because she will look just like her mother soon.
and had the surgery only as a last resort because she'd gotten to the point where we took her places in a wheelchair and she slept in an electric recliner.
Even the fact that the Aly character could be mean to her mother while trying to be sensitive to Ramona seemed real to me because kids and parents do lock horns at times in ways that are truly baffling.
It says just because people look different from you that does not give you the right to judge them by what is on the outside.
Right...well Ali (based on a "true" Story) is a bit of a Fat Phobic (just like almost in one in America who's never felt the pain of being fat)..thinking it all about your attitude..and when she loses her sports scholarship..she decides to enter a student film competition for the prize money for school.....and her idea is to prove being unhappy and fat is all out the fat person's negative attitude....if only people like her little brother(overweight) had a positive attitude their lives would be better..thats why she's popular (not because she's a pretty blonde jock)..the commercials leading up to this promised a true look/insight into one area of life where bigotry and prejudice are allowed to reign supreme... i "thought" finally people see something about the cost of our obsession with weight...how thou bashing of gay and others may be illegal...but fat bashing is More than OK....But the promise of the commercials was NEVER delivered...even although Ali don's the "Fat suit" for at least a month...at the end of it..she's still very hateful over her mom's past weight (its treated like a very dirty little secret)..never asking why people over eat...or even some the different causes people gain weight, her partner on the film has a hard attitude towards the world in general and never stops calling the one "fat" girl and meets and befriends.."her Fat friend"...after a month spent on this Ali changes only a little..after lying to everyone very little is said after ward...you keep waiting/hoping for her "a Ha!
An opportunity to make a documentary to win a scholarship is presented to her, and while watching her brother get bullied because of his weight, she decides that she will go undercover as a fat girl to prove that weight has nothing to do with popularity.
This movie really touched on what us fat people feel when we look in the mirror, what our diminished self esteem can be like when people continually taunt us, and what its like to shop in a store where we don't get the service we deserve because of our weight.
We seem to make rude comments about to those who are physically different just because people have low self esteem and zero confidence that they take it on those who appear weaker then they.
However, I paid no attention to that because I lived my own life, and true people accepted for who I was, and not my appearance.
I think that 99% of women have image issues and they're unhappy with themselves because they think they can't do better.
They fall into depression which can lead to dangerous eating disorders and cosmetic surgeries simply because of what society portrays.
This very powerful film, which is as fantastic as it is vividly concrete and sad (imagine Kafka with a Sicilian accent), tells the story of two Italians, Fiore (Michele Placido, director of the recent Romanzo criminale) and his assistant Gino (Enrico Lo Verso) who come to the impoverished, wrecked post-communist Albania with the scam of setting up a shell shoe factory as what they -- or Fiore, at least, because he alone is the mastermind and evil genius of the scam -- thinks will be a profitable tax shelter.
After the screening, director Gianni Ameilo, a wonderful man in love with his own film, gave an effusive talk about how it had been made: how he had wanted for years to make a film about his father's emigration from post-war Italy to America, but chose, at the time of the Albanian refugee crisis in Italy in the 1990s, to tell the tale allegorically instead; how he cast amateurs in almost all the roles; how he plucked the amazing Carmelo de Mazzarelli from a Scicilian street to play the role of Michele because he to liked his face; and how he directed him, never showing him the full script but merely telling him what was required from each individual scene.
In some ways, he is almost too effective in doing so: the film feels manipulative because of the power of the images in making its point (and one wonders, can life in Albania really have been this bad?).
Yes, I'll admit that I love this show, but only because it's so terrible that it's hilarious.
And so I have given it four stars - not because it's good though, because it's entertaining.
mcelwee, with his narcissistic focus on himself, something morris always avoids, manages to record (as opposed to filming, because the recording mostly concerns his puerile musings on his own love-life) a lot of drivel.
This happens to be the only sane person in the movie, mainly because she didn't continue seeing him afterwards.
Only because it was very sad.
I saw that film when i studied films in england, i liked the director's techniques with his subjects.First of all he provokes them in order to get more informations from them, second he manages to become intimate to the viewer with his monologues that take the form of a confession.Many commented that his life is pathetic, maybe so, but it takes courage to expose to the public some very 'personal' moments.Many people might comment about the ethics of documentary, because sometimes he seems to abuse some of his subjects, or even mock them,i have a specific scene in my mind:When he interviews one of the so called patriots,inside a snack bar he pans his camera and while we listen to the 'patriotic credo' we watch another man dressed like a clown.I think this is a film that deserves to be seen because it is a prerequisite for people who enjoy BIG BROTHER and other similar assortments, that victimize their subjects sometimes to the extreme.Compared to those SHERMAN'S MARCH is very innocent much more entertaining though.8/10
He attatches himself to the older son because he tries to emulate his father, and thus reads what books he's told are good, and passes those he's told are not; watches what movies his father likes while avoiding those his father doesn't; thinks and speaks how his father would, when it's obvious he knows almost nothing about what he's talking about.
It actually reminds me of an excerpt from "The Interperitations of Dreams", which reads, "His destiny might have been ours because the oracle laid the same curse upon us.
In fact, the only part of the movie that I had a problem with was that they would make Walt see a therapist because he plagiarized a song, but for Frank (Who's what, 12 years old?)
A great admirer of himself; an admiration which is shared by his oldest son, who becomes a cheater, both in school and in life, because of this upbringing.
This is significant because we learn that Bernard has taught her to write and there is even a scene early in the film in which he corrects a poor ending that she has attempted.
An upsetting scene in the film was when the girlfriend of the older son says that her mum doesn't like her dating him because his parents are divorced, and that that bad relationship might reflect on their relationship.
I must have avoided this movie because it was released after his death and I was not ready to enjoy another comedy with him at that time.
We could easily say that Baumbach's script is a storm, because it puts its characters in the middle of one, but we can also say that Baumbach is a man who definitely tries to find the calm between the storm, in his characters and in his movie.
The rest of the film is filled with Walt's blatant plagiarism, a non-stop stream of offensive cursing, arguments, premature ejaculation, Bernard allowing his dinner guests at restaurants to only order half-orders because he's so cheap, unbelievable therapy sessions, Bernard trying to force his female student and border to perform oral sex only to be interrupted by his son, and a medical emergency that is offered as redemption but fails.
Also, saving up the "you wanted joint custody because you're cheap" revelation timing for maximum emotional crippling?
A friend of mine was hesitant to see this movie, because she'd heard that it pushes the agenda that divorce is never a good option for dealing with marital problems.
He's the kind of guy who would be deadly at a dinner party, because there's no such thing as a casual or flippant remark in this guy's presence.
Laura Linney plays the wayward mom, blamed for the break up of the marriage by the dad because of a string of affairs she carries on.
I laugh a lot when I watch this movie because the lines are hysterical.
Me and other friends who have watched the film even get laughs out of references to this film, because its so classic.
I'm not the biggest fan of the Howling Series, but, just because this movie was horrible doesn't mean I'm not gonna try to finish the series.
And to stay awake through the whole movie you should not have seen the first because it kinda gives EVERYTHING away.
The acting is horrid except for Romy Windsor who seemed to have a bright future because of her looks and decent acting skills.
It needed more gore because Hollow Man 2 was too watered down.
It needed another actor to play the villain because, let's face it, Christian Slater is bad at acting.
I mean really, the first film was pretty good because it actually tried and succeeded in being entertaining.
It must have cost millions of dollars, because it's well shot, and there's nice acting, but the end result is so lame.
I almost feel horrible saying the movie was bad simply because it was all true events and tragic nonetheless.
We spend no time worrying for her daughter or seeing the growing panic in the household because we're running out of time.
As always, this is a successful film because it deals with a family that comes together to aid their mother, played fantastically by Winger, who is in the grips of a major illness.
But yet he isn't something to fear away from the movie because of.
There's no plot to speak of Â instead, we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms: from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching (which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord), to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal (who drives them out because of their constant bickering), then going their separate ways till they meet again (after he has learned about her movie experience Â a hilarious scene Â and a 'colleague' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace) and go out together (where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers), after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fiancÃ©e (a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline), to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another (beginning with their real names).
His role is the more difficult because he's basically the straight man, but he does wonders with it.
This movie is VERY loud (basically because Streisand yells nonstop), the humor is pretty caustic (Streisand thinks Segal is gay and throws quite a few homophobic jokes at him) and is pretty risquÃ©--it was edited from an R rating but there's still plenty of swearing and sexual sequences.
because they couldn't get anyone any better or because they were too stupid to know better.
I think the people who will most enjoy this movie are gay men because that's the only audience I think that won't be very offended by all the jokes about how these women try so desperately to get men.   
I'm intentionally saying very little about the film, because, its really not worth getting into.
I do have to say that I bought the movie because Ron Mathews is a personal trainer at my gym and my friend and I are hot for him!
I found the movie HILARIOUS, not just because I'm gay, but because I know how to take a joke, and enjoy a good, funny movie!
He falls in love with a brunette, loses her again because their summer-love relationship is getting too serious and catches her cheating on him with playboy Miguel.
If you want to see an array of beautiful sea creatures that no longer exist, by and large because they're butchered for no reason in this awful movie, then this film becomes a treasure of historical documentation.
It's a shame that the film is more like a soap opera than a horror movie really because the horror parts of the film are actually not bad, it's just the dull and tedious 'drama' side of it that lets it down.
The film is somewhat notorious for its animal killing scenes and that's hardly surprising because plenty of fish get butchered and it's not nice viewing - worse than Cannibal Holocaust, that is for sure!
It all boils down to a decent enough conclusion, but I cant bring myself to really like this film because it's just too much of a mess.
What really amazes me in this film is how long it takes for the shark to finally arrive because as far as I know, this was supposed to be another "shark film" that would appeal to the same audience than Spielberg's JAWS (1975) did.
I only rented it because it was Chris Farley's last movie and I am a huge fan of his.
Every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murders are MY responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant.
In 'Friends' he was OK, probably only because there were enough characters to keep him out of the spotlights most of the time, but this time he's one of the main characters, so you'll see him more than is good for your (mental) health.
True, this movie is already legendary because of its stupidity and bad taste and 'mostly ridiculous', I don't even bother to explain that one.
But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.
Yes folks, this is one of my favorite movies of all times  There are some people who may dislike this movie (because the truth hurts OR whatever sick reason they have for their hatred).
Although she and Hackman have fallen in love, she refuses to leave with him because "this" - gesturing to the vandalized ruins of the house she was born in - "is my home."
Mississippi Burning is one of those titles that despite knowing that it is apparently a modern-classic, I have put off seeing because of the average video cover.
The blacks won't cooperate because they're afraid, the whites for more obvious reasons.
Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well.
What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.
But I know they exist, because I know some of them...a few who are still living.
The worst part was that I am from a very racist town, unfortunately, and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film.
I didn't want to see this film again because of the awful situations I saw or heard of.
But not just because three boys were murdered, but because no one knows why they were murdered,besides racism that is.
From this moment it is clear who holds the real power in the relationship, because despite Andrea's pathetic pleas of "That's enough," Wayne can only see one way of preventing his dark secret from seeping out.
And i say team because his use of ad-libbed dialog is phenomenal in this story of two mad parents bent on setting the record for homicides in the family tub.
(And actually, I nearly typed 'people' instead of 'characters' because they are way too real.
Disturbing on a level I can't even contemplate because these characters were just.
And this is an amazingly scary movie, not because of the blood and gore, but because of the way this film captured the darkest and frankly most disgusting parts of humanity.
It's sickening because it's real--because there are people like that.
Still i am giving the film 4 out of 10 just because of the music and some what mediocre-ly cinematography!
Movie is crap because of the makers!
(The reason he wants to stop is because he accidentally slaughtered a family)  And the rest is self explanatory.
I hated the drug use scenes though because they were a bit too graphic.
I bet Chris Robinson just gave up on the script because that's how the movie looks.
The one and only reason I'm giving this two stars is because I like to torture people with it from time to time.
The movie was so forgettable that I kept focusing on Marina's lips, simply because they look exactly like Meg Ryan's, post-lip-enlargement.
But this must be because she cannot cope with her daughter's attempted suicide!
It's a good thing too because if this film had taken itself - or its philosophical/spiritual ideas - too seriously, it could have been a disaster.
And because the filmmakers don't violate the rules they've created in this world, you walk away at the end, maybe not believing, but thinking it'd be really cool if the ideas expressed were true.
I think Matthew Perry had't made it to rehab yet because during certain scenes he looks too thin and pale.
In fact, if you have the hots for Perry, you should definitely see it because he was looking pretty good to me by the end of the movie, and I never thought he was all that hot before.
Jerks) with another in the same part of the theater because no-one was showing up.
The film sags in the first hour because there is too much exposition (and some attempts at social-drama undertones), and it doesn't much improve when the actual heist begins.
I love this movie because it caught my attention through the entire picture.
I give Jane Curtin 6 stars because she wasn't bad in her movie debut.
is a consistent and entertaining movie that is sadly little-know and/or long forgotten in modern days, which is really too bad because this is an excellent film.
Although it wasn't one of ABC's television movies, it quickly became a favorite on the the 'Movie of the Week' line-up because of its suspense factor.
Playing off the title of "Whatver Happened to Baby Jane", it is not ruined by its television look and feel because of a particularly memorable performance by Geraldine Page.
I said that because I watch this on Nickelodeon and Noggin with my 19-month-old nephew from time to time.
You can't compare the twist to The Sixth Sense or Fight Club, or The Crying Game, and so on, because those twists made you simply look at events in a different light; they did not change what had actually occurred (though I guess Fight Club did change events to an extent).
It is clearly told that Julie is the daughter of the publisher and a french woman, whom he had left, because he did want to stay with his wife and children in England.
Julie lies twice: she says, her mother lived in Nizza (in reality, she is dead, but of course Julie likes to imagine that her mother is still alive); she says, her mother had burnt the novel she has written (which she did not, because Julie gives the manuscript to Sarah, the writer ÂÂ> the book that Sarah gives to her publisher at the end of the film is the copied manuscript of Julies mother (we see her copying it at her computer).
Julie indeed killed Franck, because he resisted her attempts to seduce him.
And because she is a mentally very disturbed character, she can't control her feelings anymore.
Her name is Julia because she was named by her mother, Julie, not by the publisher.
It's funny how people either critisize or praise all the nudity and sexuality common in European film, however here nudity and sexuality were intrinsically necessary because they were such a crucial component underlying the mechanics of Sarah Morton's personality.
"Swimming Pool," though billed as an erotic thriller, is really about the creative process (I think), and I won't say anymore about that because to do so will give away the ending.
It is likely that he rose to such prominence mostly because of his winning personality and good looks, rather than the movie plots, but in studying Western movie history, I learned that when he was given his chance to be the star of his own series, he set out to be good at his job.
It's a perfect choice for this movie (and this scene) because it's full of passion and promise.
In the first one, a ballet dancer is forbidden to dance because she has health problems.
But when a famous ballet director (who doesn't know about her health problems) asks her to dance for him because he seeks inspiration in order to improve his latest production, she can't resist the temptation...
The others weren't as good in my opinion, but I have still given ten points because I think that somehow (forgive the worn-out phrase) the whole is more than the sum of its three parts.
In addition to that, I enjoyed: 1) the timing--the movie consists of three shorts and I appreciate the order in which the three are presented; 2) sense of humor--the second short is quite charming and I thought well written from a child's point of view--it avoids being an adult pretending to be a child; 3) long dance scenes--there must be several three minute scenes with no editing cuts (the music is so strong that whenever I hear a piece by Faure, if it's not the piece in this one scene it reminds me of it, that I must stop a few seconds because the memory is so alive); 4) the deep exploration of "what is right" --I not only appreciate the presentation of the two sides of every decision presented in all of the shorts, but also that a quick Hollywood solution is resisted; and finally 5) a young Kirk Douglas--which is the old fashioned manly-man.
The Invisible Maniac, Sorority House Massacre 2 and Hard to Die are in a sense a trilogy because they all have Melissa Moore, nudity and bad acting.
I know, you want to see it because the cover shows a hot female body holding a machine gun, and because it's been out of print on DVD for years and now there's a certain level of mystique about it... but I'm telling you, there is absolutely NOTHING here that's worth looking at!
I have seen this DVD sell for more than $100 on Ebay, simply because it's not being made anymore.
I know, because I'm one of those people.
Wynorski's films win because he creates schlock that believes in itself.
In Sorority House Massacre II (which beats out HtD only marginally as the best B-movie, because it actually features a haunted house,) he used lengthy unrelated scenes from Slumber Party Massacre as back-story to SHM II.
This is truly a case of the train wreck syndrome and I simply could not stop watching because it was so awful.
It was the kind of movie you watch because it is so bad you can't stop but watching it to see if it gets worse, and you know, it does get worse.
The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because there were a few fine chicks in it and it showed a little booty.
I rented this because Tommy Lister is in it and the premise looked amusing.
Oh and you might have noticed I didn't mention Baldwin in my review, this is simply because he's only on-screen a whopping two minutes or so of the film and is a glorified cameo.
Also, I'm sure this couldn't have been the inspiration for "The Shining" ,because I'm sure only a handful of people have seen this, but the scene at the end where(spoilers, I guess) the killer chases the little girl and her mother through the snow and the end scene from "The Shining" are eerily similar.
there's no way anyone should compare a movie like this to "citizen kane" or, to a greater extent, "gone with the wind" because those are epic films with a lot more money backing the project.
No structure, clichÃ©d plot stereotyped characters and all the recognition in the world just because it was the first Indian American film released into the marketplace?
Hawke successfully recovers Airwolf, but keeps it for himself because the agency, known as the FIRM, wasn't able to locate his brother.
Thank God for that site, because I've been on an Airwolf kick lately.
Why, because they brought raw and real life like music back into the mainstream, resembling 70's metal, but much more powerful and much much more fun!
This is a better than usual Fatty Arbuckle film because the plot is different--so many of his Keystone films look awfully similar and this one is unique.
This is all fairly interesting because at the time this film was made Castro had not yet been declared enemy number 1 by the US.
Poor Dagget just wants to find his friend, but Miller had been used by the loyalists because he had expertise they needed, and now that they were done with him, he needed to be liquidated.
Well, I'm not a big fan of documentaries because they are usually really, really boring.
But, because this one was following one of my favorite movie stars, I went and saw it at a screening in New York City.
This movie has some really big surprises because, people like Mina Sorvino and Sandra Bullock keep popping up, making for some big laughs.
Guffman is seemingly similar because it deals with a faux documentary on actors.
Clearly a low budget movie, but they can make for great cinema because of the love effort to make a story come alive.
When asked a question about distribution, Radtke unfortunately answered with details about distributors' unwillingness to release a film because it may not be the easiest film to market.
That is a shame because this film, the Emerging Filmmaker Competition Grand Prize Winner for Best Narrative Feature, may not be seen by American audiences.
"The Dream Catcher" is a film that, if you have the chance to see (or even have the most minute chance of affecting the possible distribution of this film in any vein), you should see because it has heart not often found in Hollywood cinema.
I wanted to see this back all of those years ago because I had heard that it was funny.
It only came about because MGM wanted to re-use the sets from the film they'd just made of Kismet with Ronald Colman, so John Grant set about writing a pastiche version for the duo.
Put her and James Dean in a grave together (maybe with Marlon Brando who seems incongruous in this company only because he's still alive).
At least this variation on that ploy gives an "excuse" for bad acting, which is deliciously abundant in the film--delicious because it is bad enough to be hilarious.
I would describe it as a feel good film because it takes you through the motions and you want some sort of satisfaction at the end, which it delivers perfectly.
You don't have to be an expert in Mayan culture to know that tribes were constantly fighting, killing, and enslaving one another, because that's how all society has been since the birth of mankind.
"The Mayans were presented as savages" - that is because they were(check out their rituals), or what is your definition of a savage?There is another moment in the film:the bad guy threatens Jaguar Paw he would skin him alive and then wear his skin.I first thought, well that was original of Gibson, but then I found out on the internet that skinning your enemies and wearing their skin was an ACTUAL RITUAL of the Mayans.Yes they were savages, and I don't care how many Mexicans(who think they are the legacy of the Mayans, which they are not) feel offended by this movie.
Anyway, we don't necessarily need the answer, but we do need the consciousness and introspection because when we project ourselves against the primitive background, we can always discover new things in our body and soul.
First of All, I couldn't finish watching Sin City simply because it glorified senseless violence and I hate senseless violence, and yet its on the top 100 list-go figure.
Okay, I do concede that if Apocalypto is primarily a movie "about" the Mayans, it fails because it is historically inaccurate.
The setting in the jungle, the animals, the danger, the trill of victory are all in this film, and even better because of the Mayan background.
But I really will never know because if he is in fact making a point such as the one I have guessed at in 3., he fails in his utter vagueness and leaves us with a film that is ultimately disappointing, if not entirely offensive!
And words, either spoken or subtitled, often aren't needed here because the cast has great faces and can use these faces to convey both information and emotion.
I think that the reason why many people are upset is because he misrepresents the Mayan culture so much and helps stereo type all natives of Mexico as savages that really turned me off.
I am hearing that this is actually considered a foreign film by the Golden Globes because of it, regardless of the movie originating from America.
If this sounds too much for you than stay away because yes, it gets much worse.
The scene in which everybody joins in singing "I could have danced all night" is a high spot and their friend who acts as the butler for the night has a lovely comedy role as he stumbles about because he is not used to wearing shoes.
I think if Hollywood is up in arms it ought to be because Gibson is making them look inept.
It's a ten because, as a cinematic experience, there is nothing else quite like watching the work of Michael and Roberta Findlay.
I didn't really think it was a 10, but I rated it as such because I felt all the other ratings were too low.
The closeups give me the shivers because I can see the fleas flitting around their little bodies and there for a while one of them had ticks, which are normally group groomed off.
The writer, at first, resists because the screenplay is based upon his relationship with his own deceased lover, but is soon won over by the charismatic producer.
I think it's a good thing because it gives their words, their actions, and even small gestures a hint of duplicity and doesn't allow anyone to come off smelling like a rose.
We rented the DVD and I left the room to do other things about half an hour before the end because I simply could not waste my time any longer.
The voice-over is totally hilarious as well for example; "Flower has been the only female in the family allowed to have babies, a) because she loves being the centre of attention, and b) because she's a psychopath" The program is what show like Big Brother and Celebrity Love Island want to be.
Elaine definitely gets to understand Robert's pain, though she is resistant to feeling it because of her own situation.
It's a cool movie and definitely worth watching, but more so because of the technology, and less so about the story.
I didn't understand the title of this movie but was eager to see it at the Austin Film Festival because it features such an exceptional cast.
I don't intend to divulge the ins and outs of the story because that should be your job, but I feel compelled to talk about it because it kind of stacked all over me like some kind of alien jelly.
i cant believe the writer is from another country, because the those problem of china is so complicated that to hard to be understood by the most of western citizens.
Chinese audiences will find this movie insulting because all but one Chinese character are portrayed as barbaric, cruel, and malicious in this propaganda.
Most people still think that the Andresen's Little Marmaid is an happy ending story because of the Disney cartoon.
The United States have a strange but understandable reaction in front of the rest of the world because they are all the descendants of immigrants who left a culture and a history behind them to build out of conscious and willful choices a new history and a new culture, a heritage that became something that had to be built out of nothing or very little.
And If Europeans told the United States that they have to ban the death penalty within one or two or three years to be granted the privilege of being recognized as a democracy and keep the status of permanent veto-endowed member of the Security Council of the United Nations that could be withdrawn from them because of their not having banned the death penalty, they would react violently and viciously.
My wife liked RED CORNER a lot because of the romantic touch and the nice music.
Just because Richard Gere is a Buddhist doesn't make him biased as some have suggested, he is too gifted an actor and too much a gentlemen to let his spiritual beliefs affect a movie, his compassion sure, but not spiritual beliefs.
This film held my interest because of the great acting by Ling Bai,(Shen Yuelin),"Edmond",'05, who is a very educated Chinese lawyer and is placed in a very difficult situation in having to defend Richard Gere,(Jack Moore), "Unfaithful",'02, who is also another lawyer from the United States.
The whole movie was much more entertaining than I thought it would be, maybe because I have no expectation like the others who also went to see it.
Most likely it was because it was on HBO and I missed the first thirty minutes.
Brief, because the next morning begins with him dragged away by Beijing cops who, having found the girl's dead body in the room and her fresh blood all over him, proceed to assume the American guilty.
When asked, Shen Yuelin's assistant says that Moore's frequent beatings are simply "because he's a foreigner", a familiar sentiment to non-Chinese residents of the mainland.
Just because somebody promises you a gilded prize for playing by their rules doesn't mean those rules stop applying once the prize is obtained, if at all.
It keeps your attention throughout although I thought the ending was a bit confusing because things happened almost too fast for the viewer to take in.
i can't possibly say just how bad this film is, because a word has not been invented yet to do the job.
Several people safe aboveground know what he's done, and he's VERY aware of this because they keep telling him that they know (*cough*).
He ignores them but remains determined to go through with his evil plan, because, you know--he's eeeeeeeeeeevil.
moment -- the main dude pulls his elaborate heist because he cant find the Scottish drug dealer and, inconveniently, his buddy died (er, nice plot device).
Nick is a store security guard who sees Emily stealing and lets her get away with it because he's inexplicably captivated by her, even though he's actually prettier than she is.
Things go wrong, a couple of things happen solely because the story needs them to happen, and Nick ends up asking Emily to steal something for him.
The direction of Klepto is professional-looking but never more than ordinary, except for one long tracking shot that's clearly in the movie just because the director wanted to show he could pull off a long tracking shot.
There is a focus on the role of publicity and media involvement in kidnappings, which allows the "crook" to successfully blackmail a bank for a million dollars, and features a gullible couple who give up their small boy because they think they've won a Simca car.
The movie succeeds in hooking you because the plot is pretty entertaining and complex and I strongly recommend it.
Please read that because i really want people to discover this lovely film.
I think I understand why the critical review has been mediocre -- it's likely because critics keep comparing 'The Birdcage' with the original 'La Cage Aux Folles'.
The film will probably confuse some viewers because there is no clear indication that after Simon meets Jeanine and goes to see Martine at the park and his subsequent escape to either Spain, Switzerland, or Genoa, the narrative will go back to tell the real story in flashbacks.
As the old saying goes: Just because you don't graduate head of the class, doesn't mean you won't one day own the school.
Christopher Lambert stars as a man in the near future and his wife is pregnant for the 2nd time but that is illegal because of a population control and they are trying to escape to Mexico but they get caught and sent to a maximum security futuristic prison called the Fortress for 31 years.It is said that it is imposable to escape from this prison but against all the odds Christopher Lamberts character plans to escape from the prison with his wife and some of his friends.
It wasn't good how John was mind-wiped for not killing a man, because if he had done that, Prison Director Poe would of used that to keep him in prison for later on.
A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground.
The violence in Fortress isn't funny in the tradition of Re-Animator; It is serious because the film itself is serious, not the kind of half comedy like Re-Animator.
Lambert does a great performance as John Brennick a man sent to the Fortress because he wanted another kid with his wife Karen.
I like this movie because it not only has a great story line but also stars one of my favorite actors (Christopher Lambert).
One of the main reasons why Fortress works so well is because it puts its focus in one place and every imaginative element of the film goes towards furthering the central plot.
I think this problem with relating to the characters isn't just because they're not real, anime and Fleischer Brothers cartoons have given us numerous characters that we've been able to relate to strongly.
If I had really gotten to see the real Ray Winstone playing Beowulf then maybe the small plot would have been less of a concern because I could have related to him.
For many reasons, yes, and it should be watched by people who are fans of action and fantasy movies, because this really paved the way for what CGI and other special effects sciences only made better in the years to come.
The movie was probably a big hit at its time because so much artistic effort was put into bringing this Arabian Knights tale to life.
The Director is Raoul Walsh who is one of the great Directors who has gotten more recognition in recent years because of his great body of directing work.
Based on the "Arabian Nights" it tells you the story of a thief - Ahmed - in Bagdad that fell in love with a beautiful Princess and has now to gain her love, because "Happiness must be earned".
Unfortunately for this film, though, the remake starring Sabu was an even better film and was overshadowed a bit because of this.
Well isn't that ironic, since MTV and its nauseous ilk are forever trying to ape old-school underground film makers, and they usually fall way short of the mark simply because unlike these guys, MTV are clueless.
That was a good thing because exotic locations can often appear on film more like postcards and can detract from the story.
Now here's the thing: I don't quite remember the "guest stars" - maybe that could be because I didn't know WHO they were.
While Gilbert Adler's direction is technically fine, if at times a little too unrestrained, it sadly lacks any real sense of energy or character, and because of this the film just never feels quite right.
It is only because of him that I rented the movie, and only because of his wry, sarcastic comments that I finished watching it.
He never kills Grendel's mother because she seduces him and together, they beget the Dragon.
This is, of course, good for Beowulf, because he has a thing for Wealtheow, Hrothgar's wife, anyway.
Oh my goodness gracious, this movie just really leaves you gasping for breath because you can't stop laughing.
If you rent a Tales From The Crypt movie, don't expect something very good... but I was a little dissapointed when I saw this, because I think Demon Knight is about one of the best horrors made, and I was surprised that their second film was far different than Demon Knight...
I remembered that I absolutely loved this animation, but I thought I just loved it because I was in sixth grade and that I enjoyed just about anything.
In the myth, it was because he was responsible for Grendel's father's death.
If the lead actress was going to win an Oscar, it could have been for this, not Moomnstruck, because I preferred Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction much more.
I've seen this movie countless times because it is well balanced start to finish.
I have been wanting to write a review of this movie for a long time because it made a major impression on me.
You love him because Rocky is a kid who loves people back which to this day is a precious commodity that you rarely see these days.
MASK is the 1985 comedy-drama based on the true story of Rocky Dennis, a sensitive and highly intelligent teenager who, because of a debilitating disease, has a severely disfigured face that has made him an outcast outside of his family and the social circle surrounding them (basically a biker gang, who are savagely protective of Rocky).
Ignore the fact that Cher is a leading character, because people either love or hate her as an actress - there's almost no gray area.
While it requires some suspension of disbelief, I think people may not have liked this movie because it makes them uncomfortable.
This is a good story because it is based on truth, and Stoltz does a good job of creating a sympathetic, moving character.
Beautiful movie from a true master Peter Bogdanovich.Truly warm movie about a boy Rocky who has a rare disease so people often think he's wearing a mask.But he was lucky because he had a family.Maybe not kind of family we all think about when we hear that word,but he had a true family who loved him till the end.His family was mother,drug addict and bunch of bikers.All of them saw something in Rocky and that something was his inside and not outside.Story is very good and you can relate it to any other story from todays life.This isn't just a story about boy with weird face,it's a story about whole society,family and mostly about people.What is really important to us people?How we look from the outside or from the inside.Only girl who connected with Rocky was a blind girl.Isn' that tragic how we,people have wrong priorities in life.Excellent movie that really touched me and also some great performance from Eric Stoltz,Cher and Sam Elliott.All time story with great directing and good acting.
We get drawn into their struggles because they are shown to us as fully fleshed-out human beings, not because manipulative elements like the score instruct us how to feel, at what time.
i cried because rocky was so brave, because he never let anything get him down, despite being ridiculed by people simply because of his looks.
Cher puts on the performance of a lifetime as the mother of a child frowned upon by society because he looks different.
Eric Stoltz also gives a hell of a performance as Rocky Dennis, the teenager who's head is a weird shape because of a growth problem.
I cannot give this movie high ratings because of its twisting of the original story, which disappointed almost everyone in that theater.
A tricky long-duration movie that wins points because its masterfully made and because the connections established between its different parts justify its condition of full-length feature.
But don't worry about trying to get some 'meaning of life' thing out of this ride; the less you look for the better, because although Jarmusch's script is as complex and thought provoking as they come, there's never an intention of teaching something or giving a lesson of anything.
I mention the characters in detail and not the cities because I personally believe that these five cities could have been any of the cities of the world (of the Earth, to respect the film's title).
In a film with a such format, it is tempting to comment on "which segment is superior" but this would be missing the point entirely because "Night on Earth" is greater than the sum of its five parts, although it is true that the five segments can stand easily on their own.
This section of the film elaborates on the idea that some people are who they are, and don't act any differently, but then we know this is never true because no matter who the person is, you get to know them and you see them as differently to how they act on first meeting.
Hrothgar and Wealtheow have no issue, because Wealtheow will not sleep with Hrothgar due to his sleeping with Grendel's Mother, and the subsequent romantic subtext between her and Beowulf: Wrong again.
In fact, it's ironic because the only cast member that doesn't pull her weight is the only one that isn't unknown - Winona Ryder.
If you don't know who he is watch this film and if you like it see the rest of his work because it is excellent.
So Beowulf today was my first 3-d experience, I went in expecting something good because of the 3-d, but I didn't expect the movie itself to be superb.
Part of my reasoning behind this was because of the one and only experience I had had with Zemeckis and his new way of making movies.
So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3-D (more on that brilliant factor later) but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway.
This is one of Jarmusch's best films, because it shows how important to subtleties in riding in a cab can be rather uplifting.
It's different from most Jarmusch films because it's filmed in color, when most Jarmusch fans would prefer black and white.
The reason is simple: Is original, yes this film is one of the most originals films in a lot of years, the five stories, the five different cities and is all only in one night, for me that is awesome and excellent because Jarmusch is the only filmmaker that could do that.
About the film: well my favorite story is the one with Roberto Benigni that takes place in Rome, the reason is Benigni, because for me this is the funniest performance of Benigni and well the story is great, the part when Benigni tell his story about the sheep is just very funny and of course the other five stories are great.
Rowlands is subtle and complex: she's a rich bitch with a soft side, but we don't know if she's the former because she's a player or if she's the latter because she wants to use Ryder.
Maybe it's because scenes like these usually wouldn't make it into 'mainstream' fare, but a sequence like this showcases some great dialog on both sides (and when Rosie Perez comes in, all bets are off).
I'm sure it was PG13'd because of the sequences with Angela, otherwise it would be a solid PG.
Stories are told, because each episode is an encounter with the respective cabbie, who all have a life and a past of their own.
The concept of the movie thinks of night as a place rather than a time, because all of the stories begin at the same moment in time but in different time zones.
The Coyote, or Eatibus Anythingus, chases a fly because he is very hungry.
This movie is simply great, beautiful, moving, I loved it with my all heart as a child and cried together with the other kids in the kindergarten...I don't repeat the story, but this is really a uniquely nice movie and it is really a shame that it seems to be some 5.8 crap only because of this weighted rating.
This had to be one of the first movies I saw because I watched it for years and years after that.
I can't say everybody who watches it will enjoy it simply because people have different tastes.
I also at the same time adds to the charm of the movie and it gives B-slasher movies like this one (because let's face it, this is a B-movie, no matter how well its made) a big cult following.
In many ways, it's miles better than anything else out there because films like "Anthropophagus" achieve an emotional effect greater than films like "The Godfather" on a fraction of the budget.
There are two famous scenes in "Anthropophagus" that people tend to focus on because they are so shocking.
But sit tight, because that's all you get for the next hour, until finally the title character shows up.
The Uncut version has raised controversy mainly because of two gruesome sequences including the cannibal eating a woman's fetus and the later being his demise when he tries to eat his own guts after being slaughtered.
She says something has killed everyone on the island except her, because she is the only one who can sense when the killer is coming and is able to hide.
After these scares, it manages to keep the atmosphere, because whatever is stalking them, whatever this monster is trying to kill them is still an unknown to the audience.
Of course, this is unusual, because not only is D'Amato not known for thrillers, but this movie is usually considered simply dull, gross, and an over-the-top video nasty.
Too often are movies cast aside simply because of grotesque content, with no other aspects considered.
Also, cool is a suicide where a woman decides to hang herself, and Julie, at one point, is trapped in a gated graveyard by a jealous Carol(Zora Kerova; who was upset because Daniel preferred Julie over her).
Unlike many, I didn't have any problem with the pace because my eyes were taking in the location and how it was brought to the screen.
This offers a prologue to the main action, in which the same attacker menaces a larger group of Italian tourists who are island hopping and who happen to stop on the killer's island because they've picked up a boat-hiker who is going to be working there as the companion of a blind girl.
Dear IMDb-ers, This B-movie, which was originally titled "Peak Experience" and then "Lost Lake", may be a new genre of movies, let's call it 'Promance Movies", because it has elements of porn in it, but its actually very romantic, so abridge that categories of p(orn)romance into 'Promance' as a new film category which the Adams (the married director team of this movie) may have inadvertently invented.
I got a possible explanation of this peculiar storyline, which is that they all were experiencing a 'paradigm shift' of reality itself, in which the forces of life and death, order and chaos, good and evil, arranged catastrophic events around them, because like the calm eye of a hurricane, it was required that they all survive in a central zone of safety while the whole world shifted around them, apparently because they were all 'prime movers' in the future history of humanity,(this belongs on the SciFi Channel) which the forces of darkness were trying to eliminate, while the forces of good shielded them, noticeably with 'Pre-Javu', the opposite of 'De Javu' where you flash backwards in time, they 'flashed forward' to get a heads up of their immediate future to avoid it subtily.
Maybe they could do that with a new DVD release with the thespians doing things in a 'Blue Screen' room, (they couldn't use the same setting, because apparently this was a story they created, that was wrapped around a brief availability of a mountain skiing lodge, and they may not be able to get the set again, although they could 'MacGyver' a virtual version of the same original sets in the CGI 'Blue Screen' room, to superimpose later) for an alternative or extended ending with more CGI special effects added to make the storyline stronger.
Sam does annoy me, because she always makes assumptions, which aren't always right.
I used to watch this show ages ago when I was like twelve and now I'm eighteen and watching it again, because it's really good and I adore it.
I think they should continue this show because they left the 2nd season on a cliff hanger and now i am wondering what happened.
I love the show too,, And I was really made that they ended it right where they did, because we never get to figure out what happens like if Nicole really ran over Brooke or if she stopped just in time or if Brooke ran out of the way.
The movie also suffers from the age old, it's creepy because it's almost perfect.
next, the one character who was supposed to be individual because that's just who she really was was actually just trying to be different because she couldn't be popular or to seek revenge for petty stuff.
but couldn't help but be mesmerised because she's beautiful   lastly, a really petty point - by the end everyone gets along.
Although Popular only aired for two seasons, the reason the season two finale was a cliffhanger, was because there was originally going to be a third season, but the show was suddenly canceled, with no time to re-write the ending into a more satisfactory explanation.
The video monitor displays were obviously VHS videotape, since one of the special effect for those displays was just simply visual searching back and forth throughout the scenes, with parts of the video sequences showing dropouts, probably because the tape was being worn out through excessive use during production.
I like the general kinky story line--a seemingly innocent woman about to be seduced by a dirty old man--and, then, the tables are turned and you find out that the "innocent woman" is one sick woman--and, then, you see that the man is actually a good match for her because they are BOTH sick puppies!
I was disturbed by the sexism, violence, and repulsiveness of the main character because the movie never makes it completely clear where it stands towards him.
I am not going to linger on the scenes which involved food because it is simply something that needs to be experienced on ones own.
I laughed through the entire scene, because Scott is normally the laid-back and intellectual character in his films - which, at least for this viewer, has always made him very endearing.
He delivered my favorite line of the film, which struck home because of my own (at times) dramatic tendencies: "You have to kill yourself after you eat it because you can't live!
There has been talk in the last few years of a sequel, but I sincerely hope this never comes to fruition because this film would lose its impact if it were anything but a stand-alone masterpiece.
Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs.
In the end, all I can say is that it feels like a waste - of a clever idea, of good writing, of a very talented cast - because nothing really happened.
If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging.
Big Night is a peaceful joy to watch because its themes and the overall feeling of the film is so normal.
It's my favorite performance of his because I had never before imagined that he would play a role like this.
that succeeds without really trying to, or may be succeeds because it does not try too hard.
I read some topics of this film's board,some turk is praising g.o.r.a,and some other people declare they don't even know what is going on,why i am comparing this movie to gora,because of same directors,and gora was utterly crap..  anyway this movie is absolutely local,if you are not familiar with Turkish University Entrance Exam,probably there wont any empathy with feelings of characters,because in other countries the exam isn't same as ours..
The movie brings us the feeling of wrong idea of this exam,and it also adds everyone has thought to make difference,but in the end you wont,only hard-workers will win in the end,so criticism of exam and showing the results of working is too balanced so,we can agree it both ways..  Acting:Not the greatest there are some typecasting characters such as Big-Bad-Headmaster,Slutty music teacher,horny tea seller,punk-girl who was before a actual girl etc..But we can feel what students fell really,because of i was in that exam last year,i know that pressure and you feel it too..
Scenes:Some kinda video clip style,which is absolute problem of director,and because of shooting you always feel like its Requem For A Dream,and it also gives you pressure too..
So,if you are some kinda evolved with University Entrance Exam,you definitely enjoy this film,but you are from another country maybe enjoy the feelings of students and-thankful for yours- because there is no empathy for you..
After having seen this movies I was surprised because it was beyond my expectations.I was expecting a film with some poor jokes and little nice jokes but it was an interesting experience to see that the film has got good humorous parts.More than this the level of drama is perfect,in one scene it makes you laugh and in the coming scene you can cry so it's really hard to mix these so perfectly in a film.
Although the superiority of this film for a Turkish person I don't think it can make the same impact in Europe or United States because the film tells you a story which makes real deep wounds (I'm not joking,the wounds are really deep!)
And the last words...It's 9/10 and It's not 10/10 because of its ending...It gives real good advices to the life but when the film finishes you leave the theater with some questions in your mind but maybe there is coming a second film and I may change my mind to 10/10 after seeing the conclusion.
Maybe it's because Matthieu sees her as an object- and not as a complete and total human being- that he'll never possess her, and more importantly that he'll never understand completely why until perhaps the end.
Or when Matthieu comes to find another piece of Conchita's seemingly precious demeanor stripped away when he finds out how she 'really' makes her money in the small town, which is actually funnier not even because of her in the scene but for who she's dancing for.
But because it's Bunuel, and by the age of 77 he for sure knows what he's doing, and it's more worthwhile than a lesser filmmaker would have gone for.
The fight sequences, although dated very badly because of sheer physical deterioration, were particularly entertaining and amusing.
I find this scene particularly entertaining, because my brother went to college with the son of a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, and in this doctor's office, almost the exact same thing was on exhibition....
He sacrificed his military career because he cared so much about the fliers?
I am sure that there are some in the military that would challenge this movie because of the "going against orders" thinking.
I mention this because The Birdcage is about deceit, some funny, some not.
Last-minute heroism ensued: Billy, sick in body and spirit **spoiler** persisted in his suit with a fairly standard speech (I though acted appropriately with weakened voice and manner because the man was sick) about doing the right thing for the greatest number, and that his country ranked even higher thn himself and all the generals present.
Otto Preminger was perhaps honing his skills as a director, because this film seems to be a dress rehearsal for his greatest achievement, "Anatomy of a Murder", which is a classic of the courtroom drama genre.
I liked this movie because it was so strange, the seventies were an interesting period.
Mckenzie seems to have inspired Jackson quite amusingly, because you can totally see some of the elements used from his 'Salome', (Which I attended the world premiere of it's restoration) in his Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.
In fact, when it first screened in NZ it caused an uproar because it was assumed to be fact.
Really, the whole thing is just so far fetched, yet that is the film's great achievement because when you watch it, you actually believe it (at least I did!)
He also filmed the first 'talkie', which was a failure because all the actors were speaking Chinese.
He was also the pioneer in color film, because he went to Tahiti to get some special berries that could be used in the creation of color, and when he was using the resulting film to capture images, topless and curious Tahitian women wandered into the picture, resulting in his arrest for portraying smut on film.
This comes out clearest in the actual silent footage itself, where MacKenzie breaks through first with color, but because he (unintentionally) shoots topless natives in the shot, he's thrown in jail after the judges deliberate long enough to watch the footage repeatedly.
Documentary is a strange genre because we are told to believe something, often without real evidence (or with altered and misconstrued evidence).
The big joke is that even if it sounds unbelievable it's a documentary and you have to believe it because documentaries always tells you the truth.
Anyone expecting belly laughs from 'Forgotten Silver' is probably going to be disappointed, because viewed as a story, this isn't a comedy - it's a tragedy.
The question of why there are two actresses playing Conchita has more to do with Maria Schneider, who originally was cast in the role, but left because of the nudity or because Conchita's character was too contrary, than it has to do with any plot or symbolic necessity.
On the other hand, since she is that "obscure object of desire" (which really should be that "unobtainable object of desire"), and because Bunuel wanted to emphasize that Mathieu's desire for her had nothing to do with her personally, he used two actresses and made it clear that Mathieu didn't notice the difference!
It didn't matter because this is perhaps one of the best films I have seen this year.
The Bob Fosse/Debbie Reynolds seem to suffer because Debbie couldn't fully realize the moves that Fosse was giving her - especially since she was much younger than him.
I even go back sometimes just to watch the cutscenes because they are done so well.
When I play JK2 again, I'll probably just skip the cutscenes because I think they look very amateurish.
I gave it 8/10 though because the game is a lot of fun to play and the multiplayer is excellent.
I picked up this game a couple of months ago because I had played Dark Forces and Academy.
Some missions can be somewhat repetitive at times but you can be sure than many of them will have you tearing at the gums because you can't find your way.
It ended up dying, and the people on the show were talking about how the results of why the duck died were inconclusive, and they were angry because they couldn't charge the owner with any crimes or tickets.
Then fining them or arresting them and acting like these normal, compassionate people who were of meager means and doing what they could were actually sadistic freaks because they couldn't afford to get some stray dog they were leaving scraps for a $8,000 kidney transplant.
The film really defies any kind of categorizing... it's a mixture of many genres - comedy, film noir, horror, science fiction and something all of itself - which was refreshing because the film defied expectations.
So don't expect massive production values because you'll be cheating yourself and the film - buy ACNE wherever you get your hands on it.
First of all, my son brought this movie home and said that I would like it because there are songs by the Dead Kennedys and Devo - these are two bands that we both love.
I rented it for a movie night with friends because I was intrigued by the teens shooting lazers out of their eyes in the picture.
The plot was weird and hard to follow because it didn't make coherent sense.
I don't remember much of the plot of this one, probably because most of my memories of that experience are probably repressed.
because we are not used to watch movies that way.
because there is little chance to see stuff like this in cinemas.
Eventhe fact that none of the characters are likable isn't a turn-off, because they are so obviously just symbols.
This has to be a slur on psychology professors, because this professor interrupts repeatedly to make blatantly obvious points, and acting smug while doing so.
I wanted to see this movie because I had read the book on which it is based and found the book impressive.
If you've seen the previews, then you've seen the movie, because not much else happens.
I have to say that this film was eastwoods better works of history.The ability to bring out the real feelings in people about how we view the human race in general.I enjoyed this film for the simple reason that WWII was a turning point in how we see each other.How to come together in the highest need to overcome obstacles in the darkest hour.As the flag was raised and having a photographer just at that moment to take a picture of the flag being raised,coincidence flew out the door.But the film goes further as we see each one remembering the pain it created,from a simple misunderstanding about who gets what flag and why.If anything the flag should have went to the soldiers who fought there at iwogima.But like the narrations pointed out,it was a forgotten past and the hero's also forgotten.It's sad to think that the human race no longer sees why war is not necessary,just as long as money is made in the name of war is what it's all about.They were right though,without the money it would have been lost to the Japanese at least that part of the world.But in reality it would still be Japanese soil.This film impacted on all sorts of levels,financial gain through war,the soldiers dying because of money being made,artillery paid for by millions of people,and the suffering going home without so much as a thank you for keeping the world safe.In reality the soldiers who fought and died i would like to call real hero's.No matter what flag was planted,and why today most of the yesteryear men and women are nearly gone.I have to say this film gave me a bit more understanding why war is becoming a thing of the past.We don't need it and don't want it,flag or not we need this world safe and i think Mr. Eastwood gave us a good vision of it becoming a reality.So go ahead make his day.
I was hesitant to see this because I figured it would be a patriotic appeal for war.
Well, it is because what the film does right, it does extremely well.
While it has a slow pace, the movie feeds from it, especially because you have to get a grip of the story- and time-line you have to handle.
Flags is one of the best war movies I ever saw, maybe even better than Ryan, because it's never sentimental and always honest in its portrayal of the soldiers and war in general.
But she's reluctant to help him because Richard has her daughter, which is the only reason she continues this demeaning job in the first place.
Now that's out of the way, My thoughts on the movie... First the story, It was above average for an action film, but I wont dwell on that because let's face it, No one goes to an action/martial arts film solely for the story.
To my delightful surprise, Bridget Fonda gave a stellar effort, because she didn't put on lazy acting as if it's just another film project that pays her money - big kudos to her.
It's great to see that Li and Fonda do show strong on-screen chemistry, because after all I never expected so much quality from any martial arts movies.
Until the very end, she confounds and frustrates him because she is what he can never have.
KISS OF THE DRAGON / (2001) *** (out of four)   By Blake French:  	I admire "Kiss of the Dragon" because it's a wake-up call to the increasingly desperate genre of martial arts action movies.
It is very out of place because it is a cheap rucksack (Mathieu is rich) and is never given an obvious purpose.
My mom didn't like the idea that this was about gender types because she said it doesn't really apply to any men or women she knows.
But I disagree that it doesn't have meaning for reality because it does not represent reality.
Bridget Fonda did not do much (found her irritating in some scenes) but then again, did not watch the movie because she was there.
Duty, honor, something that is a natural for the monarchy of that country, was a burden Edward was not ready to accept because it excluded the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, who he fell in love with and put him at odds with his family and the English establishment, something unheard of in those days.
Winston Churchill, robustly played here by David Calder, was a principal supporter of Edward just because he was a prince, but then Winston was a rather romantic old Tory.
I sat down to watch it with him because I had nothing better to do.
But because of his own survival of so many critical missions have given him hero status, he cannot cut and run.
In truth, two actresses were used simply because the lead actress quit partway through production after having completed many critical scenes.
There were so many episodes that brought tears to my eyes, just because they portrayed what were so true-to-life happenings.
It is worth mentioning Paul Schaffer as well here because the chemistry between host and band leader is always amusing.
Growing up I LOVED watching "Life Goes On", especially because of Kellie Martin, and Monique Lanier.
I heard that he was fired from his other show because Jay Leno took over so he started this show because he was angry at Leno and wanted to compete.
I don't really know much what to say because this is just a talk show so.. Yeah.
David Letterman looked so bored and stressed because Marilyn was just so uninteresting.
the show always has the word CONTERVERSY attached to it almost every year but its worth it that what makes this show so unique and above all its lesser knock offs because each year is so different and more outrageous.
One because it is that dull - although that maybe a tad unfair on paint.
I'm going to give the show a 2 because Imogen reacted when she was kicked out like I would have.
Don't try to read anything into it that you may think was NOT intentional because it was ALL intentional with extremely dramatic performances, and you know that the cast had a great time making it.You can even see Robin Williams starting to crack up when his "male maid" (Agador) is trying to toss the shrimp into his stew concoction!
Unfortunately they are morons out there who enjoys this rubbish and because its cheap and easy to make Channel Four will not stop until there is no one left watching.
this is one of the reasons it has swayed from its original concept, because there are so many new people and twists put in throughout the series.
u really have to treat the show for what it is, because it certainly isn't intellectual viewing anymore, this was the start of reality TV, and has now developed a cult following who will not stop watching, i personally recommend it.
Those geniuses at Endemol U.K. couldn't have paid heed because each summer 'Big Brother' stinks up Channel 4's schedules like an overflowing dustbin in a heatwave.
Like golf, it's duller than a bucket, but TV channels insist on showing it just because it's cheap and fills slots that could be used to play decent, but expensive, shows.
In it's early years, Big Brother was fresh, original and fascinating, but I wonder how many watch it now for reasons other than duty, habit and so they don't feel left out at work, similarly, I wonder how many housemates appear because they aren't hopeless attention-seekers.
I don't need to watch it next year because I know who's going to win.
To be fair,this was a mildly interesting idea at it's inception,and would've been just about acceptable for one series.But such has been the dumbing down of UK TV,and indeed seemingly British society as a whole in the new millennium,that the powers that be at CHANNEL FOUR have elongated this woefully thin concept to at the time of writing,an eighth series.What is disturbing is that this has led on to other tawdry reality shows springing up on other UK TV channels (I'M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE,LOVE ISLAND,THE FARM,CELEBRITY WRESTLING,even CELEBRITY DETOX,CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER,etc,etc,etc...)like unplanned illegitimate sprogs,with the British viewing public acting as unprepared,unwilling parents.The aforementioned programmes are virtually as tedious,dreary,lazy,banal and pointless as this one,but BIG BROTHER is wholly deserving of the lowest possible vote because it is possibly the main cause of the shallow brainlessness pervading most of UK popular culture in contemporary Britain.For example,the only so-called "celebrity magazines" at the turn of the century were the highly resistible OK and HELLO!,whose sickly,ghastly and vomit-inducing sycophancy to various public figures (most with very minor talents) was initially mocked by comedians,satirists and journalists,but even this mickey-taking soon became passÃ© as it didn't seem funny to mock something which was already too unintentionally amusing to begin with anyway.
However, what they fail to realise (because they are so vain and self-obsessed) is that once the media have chewed them up and spat them out, they will be consigned to the scrapheap forever, because lets face it - who would employ some freak who is foolish enough to have shown every bad aspect of their personality on national television.
)I know this to be true because I have had the great experience of working with both of them.
I got hooked because of Natasha Henstridge and stayed because of the unexpected level of violence, pain, and corruption.
The story was good because it was a good and different.
It a shame it didn't get released in the cinemas because i'm sure if it was more people would of herd of this.
I can see how this film could be tossed into the Violent Action or confusingly written low budget categories, but I found it to be a cut or more above those types of films because of its feel.
There's really not a whole lot to say about "Pushover" because, again, it's just like the other 50s crime noir films.
Good thing she's called on to do little more than stand around looking sexy, because her bad, breathy imitation of Marilyn M. in the opening garage scene had me reaching for the off button.
Suspicion falls on the janitor at the high school though, mainly because he's big & weird.
Not a total lost, because some of the women were kinda attractive and wore sleazy sexy outfits.
I rented this one on a whim because it didn't look too bad, but I was way off point.
I give this film a ten because it was very entertaining and thought provoking.
Well, at least that's what I think...because barely any of the kills fit the title at all.
But I'm not surprised in a way...because this was a bad movie period!
OK I'm awarding this a 4..... And that is purely because 2 scenes in the entire film were well done, turned up the gore and feeling of real gut wrenching revulsion and just about saved the film from a Zero.
( no surprise, really) and I guess I should deduct points for that and Lalo Shifrin's sometimes bombastic score--but I am not going to; because after 21 years of mostly pale imitators, The Mean Season is looking better and better with age.
The issue of the reporter's complicity in the story he's writing about just isn't developed as well as it should be, probably because the plot twists in a direction it shouldn't have gone.
However, the murderer gets angry because, as his killings continue, Malcolm becomes the focal point of the stories; Malcolm's girlfriend (Mariel Hemingway), in fact, suggests that the two are practically collaborating.
Maybe for that reason or maybe just because I'm a wacko, I tend to judge every movie at least partly for its relation to all the other movies I've seen.
I like this movie, because John Lithgow is one of the funniest people alive(my opinion and taste), I get the jokes because I read the comics, watched the Sci Fi movies, like satire, lived the 80s, and like silly humour.
One criticism that makes this a less than perfect movie (although I rated it a 10 because it's just so way out there) is the audio track, which seems to be mixed way too low on my copy of the video, making it a struggle to hear what's being said over background noise, music, and tape hiss.
He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be: Pure entertainment from start to finish.
'Psuedo', because it is most definitely not serious about being 'Sci-Fi'.
You're watching this because it's ridiculous and the actors know it is.
Xtro II: The Second Encounter has nothing to do with the first Xtro mainly because the Director had the rights to the name "Xtro" but not the story of the first film so they could have any type of Alien scenario and make it a sequel to Xtro, this is why the Xtro films have no connection between each other and why the Aliens are different so Xtro II is a completely different film to the first Xtro.
Now just because this is better then the first movie (like it could be worse) does not make it perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
I love the film Xtro, because it's weird and imaginative, and just overall a strange little film.
Apart from everything visible you can read more between the lines, specially if you are familiar with Russian history and the social relations in the past.Reality is not shown too clearly - but it is all on purpose because the author's and the director's idea was to show a grotesque,rather than a document.
I'm guessing your answer will be no, unless you happen to have seen this film many times, because unfortunately this is the kind of daft drivel the film throws around to explain its plot set up of interdimensional travel.
I happen to love it, because it was totally unique Sci-Fi fodder that blended surreal elements with kitschy comedy, gratuitous nudity and gruesome make-up effects.
But the one I loved best was "Aliens", partly because of James Cameron's brilliant writing and directing, but mostly because I loved the guns.
Better had not done it, because it's another childhood memory shattered.
It's a shame, really, because the 'other dimension'-concept had potential.
I think because there's some mild gore in it (chest- & face-bursting and an exploding dude at the end), but they cut away from it too quickly.
Jan being brought back after being forced to retire because he destroyed the last facility that the device was used in and once again opened a doorway allowing alien creatures to escape!!
Not because it was meant that way, but because it was really bad.
If you don't take things too serious, this is a movie worth watching, but don't watch it because you want good action.
The two leads are rather bland, and maybe it is just because he would be such a huge star, but Cagney definitely draws your eye whenever he's on screen.
I had never heard of this movie but the only reason i watched it was because of James Cagney.
Withers is staying at Toomey's house but he leaves because he doesn't want to hurt Toomey.
I don't wont to spoil the ending because you can find it out for yourself.
It's a film that deserves a second look, without a doubt - and thankfully the audio commentary with the director and writer explains so much, because without it you'll still be scratching your head and muttering "what the hell was that all about..." In particular, that strange, terrifying Eastern-block country Gideon finds himself in.
The script and acting are second to none and the laughs are plentyful... don't be fooled by the fact it was straight to video because this movie is cinema at it's best!
The humor is terrible because it tries to be like "American Pie" but in such a not so funny manner.
Or maybe it was because of the gigantic publicity campaign that was launched to promote the series, and that could give reasons to fear an ambitious, but superficial Hollywood-ish production.
He followed the dialogues almost word for word because, so he said, Bulgakov wrote the novel almost like a screenplay.
The reason it just doesn't work is because 8 Days and 100 Girls did this earlier, better and more believably.
I'm sorry I couldn't give it less than a 1, because that is overrating it considerably.
Too bad, because it's a beautifully-made film with some points to make about its own medium and a mind-bending surprise ending that I wouldn't dream of discussing here.
However, the movie itself is supported strongly by the fantastic work of the acting, especially Lane because he is able to not only convince the audience about his character, but have his character try and act as well, thus creating multiple levels of personality hard to come to terms with inside of just one person.
So, as I overall liked this movie because of good plot and atmosphere, and also because of mostly good acting, I give it a final score of 8/10.
Unfortunately, it's never been a TV regular, which is too bad because this tale of renewal and survival is an unusual and gripping one, in spite of the obscurity.
He's about to be relieved because of erratic behavior, all the while he's flashing back on his wife's death in a London air-raid.
Nonetheless, he's jeopardizing his comrades with reckless manuevers because the loss has undermined his will-to-live.
Still, for a war-movie setting, the simple affirmation that mental health lies through nurturing social relations and not through government sanctioned killing remains no less suggestive because of its movie origins.
On the whole, this is a subtly and well thought out anti-war film, no less effective because it concerns the fate of one man rather than thousands.Too bad that its humane message remains so generally unseen.
He's a man who takes reckless chances on missions because he's got nothing to live for, his wife having been killed in the blitz in wartime London.
While I loved the film because it featured nice aerial shots of the De Havilland Mosquito (the plane), it was not really a film about dogfights and bombing missions but was instead a character study of Peck as he tries to survive and keep his injured comrade alive.
Recommended, because what we see at our Cinemas today has MUCH to learn from Movie making such as this.
Probably because most men don't seem to be able to easily distinguish between sex, attraction, affection, and love.
The stylishness of the picture comes at the expense of substance, however, and that makes the film hard to like because there isn't a lot of character for the audience to connect with.
I really wanted to like this movie because I love "period" flicks based on fact, I love older cars, and I love Jeff Bridges.
If I were to make a film about the power of dreams, I doubt I would start with a real-life story of a dreamer who ultimately failed because he had nothing BUT dreams.
It works neither because of nor in spite of whom Preston Tucker really was, but because he has been remade in the film to represent something larger--the postwar optimism that buoyed the nation for nearly two decades after the end of WWII.
It is frustrating, because I find this happening all the time with respect to Michigan and its cities.
I agree with other comments here that many dialogues are 'still born' because the text was transferred from the book too literally with no dramatic adaptation, particularly when Bulgakov's 'author's' commentaries were used in the dialogues.
To those who say it's awful, I think you should calm down and accept that Bulgakov's book and this movie are completely separate entities and the film can't be as deep because it can't reproduce all the philosophical richness of the literary work.
This I mean as a compliment - Tucker as a film is entertaining because of how endearing Tucker is, how Jeff Bridges plays him in this context (a guy with a pioneer-spirit, with a smile even when things look bleakest), and how the villains, corporate board members, a Senator, the "Big Three" come off.
My only gripe about this movie is that it takes a little bit too long for the actual bloodshed to start flowing (I say that because I'm a downright gorehound...).
when it first starts, i had to scoff at the acting in the first scene because it was SO terrible, but as the movie progressed, it got better.
Also a scene where the two misfits go to get guns and there's sort of a musical interlude where topless (but masked) models display the wares, but that's about it really, as far as the parts that were genuinely amusing, because the direction of the film is so inept that most other attempts at humor are pretty low grade, juvenile stuff.
it looks like these kids wanted to make a schlocky gore version of the real tragedy for their friends because they weren't satisfied with still pictures in the news or the few clips from CCTV available on the internet.
The only reason people will watch this movie is because of the anticipation of the massacre scene itself.
10 out of 10 because it could not be better!
It was interesting to see these pieces after having seen that film because it is so clear that his innovative and (usually) whimsical vision were present long before that film was released.
Even Kylie Minogue's "Come into my World" (I personally find her insipid at best) was extremely enjoyable because the video, essentially a mobius strip where Minogue is walking around a city block, was so sublime.
Having now seen all three of the collections released by the Directors Label series (including Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham) Gondry's work is the perfect addition to the series because he brings an element of bright imagination, and while all three directors are creative, his work is laced with a fancifulness that works as a thin patina, under which obvious intelligence lies.
I was very lucky because all three times I read it in Russian, and even the best translation can not compare to the original.
I had a lot of doubts before watching the film because as much as I wanted to see "Master and Margarita" on the screen I was not sure that it was possible to adapt it and not to lose anything important - which is everything.
I always saw him as a child in an adult body, and that's a compliment because only children can come up with such vivid imagination while exploring their world.
I'm pretty sure that such prime time bitch goddesses as Joan Collins on Dynasty and Jane Wyman in Falcon Crest modeled their characters on Livia because these women were Girl Scouts compared to Livia.
I'm not going to go into the story more than this because it gets very complicated and it is very long.
Fans of British cinema will be able to pick out even more familiar faces (I can't really go into all of the cast because there are so many excellent actors and actresses in this).
But the point is that this series is successful because of these apparent deficiencies and not despite them.
I'd rented it because I'd seen it during its replay in the 80's, and was equally fascinated.
I won't even get into the ridiculous psuedo plot because I can't get past the acting.
Typical slow, boring, badly written and acted movie that idiots will over-praise because they confuse dull with intellectual.
They should have had a different movie poster that didn't feature Barlow (from the first film), because he is nowhere to be seen, I guess that was one the other disappointments for people.
Mostly because the original was an interesting movie.
I bought this movie because I'm a horror movie buff, and it had a good cover art, but that's just a perfect example of the phrase "never judge the book by its cover.
He's had a couple of surprise hits, but they were surprises because the directors and actors involved made the necessary changes and added a quality to the work which lacked in Cohen's writing.
I actually purchased this movie simply because Moriarty was in it, absolutely for no other reason.
On a practical level, it's curious because, although it was completed in 2001, it has yet to achieve a wide release either at the cinemas or on DVD.
Within the self-sacrificing martyr's life that she has chosen (mostly, it appears, as a heroic loyalty for her family) we sympathize with her position because of the way the movie is portrayed.
Whats more, the movie progresses in such a way so that because we are being gradually introduced more and more into her daily reality (caring for her brother, teaching, etc); the culmination of her expressing her opinion (that she is actually providing male clients with a worthwhile and much- needed service) never seems audacious.
I am not sure whether the intentions of the producers were to portray this girl in such a light, but her sociopathic rationale never seems sociopathic because of it.
But the breakup at the end is usually painful because they don't want to let her go.
It goes something like this: Bad guys want to buy a woman's land in the middle of nowhere because they're going to build houses there, but she refuses to sell.
Of course, because of it's PEDIGREE all original thinking would be THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOW.
Put away the medkit, because in the very next scene, the nastiest of cuts will completely disappear!
One lady though, ain't budging because of it's 'sentimental' value and she'll even tolerate thugs killing her cattle and threatening her life with hooks to keep this ramshackle property.
I know many people do not like this movie, because they are used having Van Damme in action movies with martial arts and shooting scenes.
There is a scene where it would have been good some tears from Van Damme, but I bet this wasn't possible because of the "macho" he always portrays in all his movies, and... boys don't cry.
Nice music, good editing all add up to a very moody piece and the film is different, maybe too different for most people because it's tough to get a handle on what it is.
Not bad, but will probably be overlooked because it's a Van Damme picture.
According to me a mixture of Adam Kane (because of his arrogance) and Mason Eckhart (just.. the voice, the glare, the movements... wow).
Interestingly, the lead role is played by Angela Pleasence Â daughter of horror icon Donald; just because she's his spitting image, the actress' odd looks are perfect for her mentally unbalanced character (though I doubt Larraz intended it to be a serious case history, there is the singular fact of SYMPTOMS being one of the competing entries at that year's Cannes Film Festival to consider!).
Not that this is a comedy, but because the situation is grotesque.
You see, I cannot give any concise summary of the episode because its impossible.
And I doubt anyone disagrees because to this point no one else has posted anything about 'Improbable'.
This is Reyes' first chance to do comedy, I guess Doggett's as well, though it doesn't feel like it because of all his clever one-liners we are used to hearing.
I also like this episode because it offers a different combination.
And because of this she is able to make connections to a number of unsolved murders and tie them all to one serial killer.
It is kind of a shame too because numerology and this sort of thing actually are quite interesting to me.
And I'm sorry Chris but I doubt God would wear a bunch of tacky clothing just because he likes nature.
And at the end although the whole Italian festival is kind of humorous to watch it seems like Chris Carter just didn't have any idea what else to do with such a lame story because this honestly has nothing to do with the episode.
There is a very old name for him, being 'Pitch' (funny also because of it's musical reference).
This change works well because it satisfies the question of why the film crew would actually agree to document such a nightmarish evening without trying to stop it.
I watched this movie twice, once late at night after my kids were asleep because I knew it might be a bit scary.
That first time I was a little bit disappointed and bored, but wasn't really 100% paying attention because I was tired and using the computer while watching.
OK, so I watched it again the next day because I didn't really see the ending the first time, and I knew it wasn't even close enough to being scary to bother my kids.
Now over ten years later, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon does the exact same thing that Scream did and everyone thinks it's oh-so-original because it copies the same formula.
This has to be in one of the top 250 unoriginal movies of all time because there is not a single thing that Scott Glosserman thought of himself.
And then he just ends up killing everybody, all the guys filming, too, because they decide to stop him, apart from the girl, of course, that is one of the two, i guess, main characters in the movie.
I did not expect very much, because I was watching a lot of movies lately and 50% of the movies that get a high rating on IMDb actually are crap (seems as if a lot of people have bad taste, ungh...).
This is not "Scary Movie", so you will not laugh until the beer you've just sipped squirts out of your nose because you can not hold yourself laughing.
It's also not a real "slasher" film, because you do not see much slashing around, there are not many horrifying close-ups (besides some ripped out larynx that looked rather artificial) ... it's generally not very gory, it's not laugh-out-loud-funny, but all in all I highly enjoyed watching it.
Don't ask me how I came to my (relatively high) rating, because there was no real highlight beside the well-written script, actors were good (not more), camera-work was really good (nothing special though), editing was fine (but nothing special), sound was fine (but nothing special), but nevertheless I would highly recommend watching it together with a girl, a big bag of popcorn and a beer.
It also explores the history of the slasher genre, because Vernon is, of course, an avid horror movie buff, and idolizes all the great masked murderers.
The acting is refreshing, because the characters aren't unaware of the situations.
As you can see, I can't say the acting sucks because in some way it was intentional.
Nathan Baesel is a name you should be watching for in the future, because in his film debut as the titular 'hero' of the piece, he's funny, charming, self-ingratiating and as focused, dedicated and meticulous as any up-and-coming, hard-charging young hopeful should be.
I'm excited that this is Glosserman's first feature, because it makes a great calling card, and gives us fans so much more to look forward to from him.
First let's talk about the bad...because lets face it...it's rare for a film to get something right.
This is odd, because earlier in the film someone gets killed too and nobody seemed that worked up over it...oh wait...it must have been because she was some short, old woman.
Gore hounds will be disappointed in this movie because most of the kills aren't shown or are shot at a distant.
I won't point anything out, because it spoil a few kills, but you'll see it when it happens.
Understanding the premise helps a lot, because this is a great movie and excellent concept.
This movie was genius because it shows you how the slashing will happen beforehand and the victims are victims because they are too stupid act properly against the killer's foreshadowing.
Now despite these limitations, this Betty Boop cartoon is nice to look at because like many of the Fleischer cartoons, there were very lovely line drawings and a nice 3-D look to the backgrounds (something this studio specialized in).
Second, if you are not a fan of Boop, you also might not be all that impressed--simply because she's a rather dull character compared to animated characters from the 40s and 50s (which had a lot more personality).
Poor because several of the films are very lame and are NOT award nominated, the prints are rather bad and parts of some of the cartoons are missing!
The sets are quite decent as is the make up which is of course because they used sets and props from the films.
Tired old tale of a rough boy from a hellish background whose heart's in the right place and who battles against the odds to make it because there's one radical authority figure who believes in him.
!I should also mention that this film is hard to come by but you should try get it one ebay because it is worth it.The story to it is about a young dude called Vinnie who does boxing in his spare time but keeps getting kicked out of school.His mother is going out with a real scumbag guy because the father died.He often beats her and Vinnie thinks hes no good for her!Vinnies mother asks him to join the school band because she thinks it will keep him busy and off the streets away from all the bad action and maybe help him with a future career!
Don`t worry if he can`t do your script justice with a hundred million dollar budget because he`ll save a massive amount of money by filming in the nearest forest pretending it`s darkest Africa .
And don`t worry if this is totally unconvincing because that`s the audiences fault for having no imagination .
And make sure one of the characters is an ethnic women because not only will Halle Berry be kicking herself she missed out on the role but all the women and ethnic minorities will be able to identify with her , especially if they`re good at martial arts .
And since Tarantino style post modernism is fashionable make sure you steal lines from films like SPLIT SECOND or JAWS because the critics will think you`re a genius .
Don`t worry if there`s no logic to this because the audience will be too excited to notice.
The only reason i watched this film is because it was free, and i still feel cheated.
The only good thing that has come from this film is the quote "I'm tense because your making me tense."
This film even has an event, which has been done over and over in film but, just because you are not attached to a plot it seems like the most original event in the movie.
It really shows how we are in society also, showing things that we tend to think we have to hide from everyone because of the way they react.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, because it's quite a fantastic movie.
If i've repeated myself a lot it's because IMDb won't let me submit anything that's not 10 lines or more.. sorry!
The only reason I got sucked into this drab, dull, slow paced, nowhere-going movie is because there was nothing else on TV at 3am and I had insomnia!
There is no need for me to detail the movie because I could not do it justice.
This is not really fair, because the Fleisher's had a keen sense of the culture of the 1930s that the Disney people consciously decided to ignore - the depression; growing concern over the unstoppable march to the Second World War; an American pop-music culture adopting African-American motifs more and more; and a growing sense that working-together could provide us with a brighter future than rigorous individualism.
A few times over the last few years, I'd seen it on a shelf at video stores and thought about hiring it out, but had always moved on, which was unfortunate, because it's a genuinely lovely film.
Don't expect this film to be at the standard of today's animation, because you'll be disappointed.
The Living Dead Girl is one of the worst horror films ever because it has nothing to offer the audience, not even schlock or eerie premises, what passes as "gore" is supposed to douse us with some appreciation of this awful film, and yes, it is terrible.
I CanÂ´t compare it to any other movie IÂ´ve ever seen because itÂ´s so damn good and unusual.
Prior to my viewing of 'The Living Dead Girl', my only taste of the master of erotic vampire films, Jean Rollin, was the low quality and overall less than brilliant 'Lips of Blood', and because of that I wasn't expecting great things from this movie.
The acting is surprisingly decent, which is good because one doesn't watch this sort of movie for great performances, so when there is one or two, it's a treat.
i love emergency because the program i record in TV it is my favorite show in the world and i never miss it.
Emergency(1972) that is the Year i was born that's why i love Emergency and engine 51 because i love the engine 51 and Fire Engine 51 also.
I love Dr. Brakket because he was the coolest.
It's amazing to me that more of my generation didn't grow up angst-ridden because of pap like this.
Not because I didn't like her acting, but because I never knew for sure what she was playing - other than pain.
It was well acted I supposed - tho the camera didn't catch it nearly as well as it could have - I believed he was selfish and greedy, but because I was told, not shown.
Or do we assume all that because of what we know about Janis Joplin?
I think perhaps people are so eager to jump to this conclusion because without it, it is admittedly difficult to figure out exactly what this movie IS about.
Its length is a problem: I have no objection to long movies which need their length to tell their story (SCHINDLER'S LIST comes to mind), but at LEAST a half an hour could have been chopped out of this picture and it would probably have made better viewing because there are moments when the whole proceeding grinds to a screeching halt.
I saw "The Birdcage" because I'd already seen "La Cage aux Folles."
I was approached to be Bette's impersonator in a drag-club, because I was/am a live performer.
I attended the first day of shooting on location, but did not go for the second day - they came to get me, I suppose because they liked what they saw in the "dailies" - There was a third day of shooting, all of which were totally miserable for me - I had no aspirations to be a "movie-star" - I was an established drag-act with a large following and loved my work.
My drag-appearance was outrageous, as you'll know if you saw the film "The Rose" - I planned it that way, because that's the act I was doing at the time the film was shot.
Ms. Midler and I never stuck to the script, because it did not bring-out that her character had once been down-and-out when she lived above "The 777 Club", and I supplied her with drugs.
I've turned-down opportunities to appear in other films, because I have no real interest, unless the money is good.
I call myself "The Oldest Drag-Queen in Captivity", because I'm 82-going-on 30.
But you just watch Bette watching Houston Dyer leave her because he couldn't put up with her life.
The way the movie begins is all wrong, Tom doesn't begin telling the story just because he is bored, he tells the story to help him get rid of the memory of Laura, to an extent.the use of different locations takes away from the theme of escape.
only jane wyman seems miscast,a bit too character-actressy for the subtlty of the role to shine through.too bad,because without a good laura half the play is lost.
It a fairly decent film,the script isn't that bad,and for being a TV film had some very atmospheric moments given the way it ends obviously they were aiming for a TV series but i really had to laugh when i read the trivia page "a pilot for a series never made" because whoever made this should be suing the makers of "Lost" big time..
I confess tears streamed down my face -- partially because of the beauty of the film and partially grieving for lost youth.
Yet despite this, the lack of continuity between internal/external locations and lapses of plot logic (Chaplin's Tramp becomes a feared boxer because he has a horseshoe in his gloveÂ later he is able to perform the same feats of knock out artistry without the horseshoe, which makes no sense at all) do pall somewhat.
Its weird because you don't get to meet the characters or know their personalities or anything.
so i was stuck with it and so today when i bought it i played through the first mission and i was so excited because i thought that it would be like that for the entire first level but no it completely changed the level after.
In general, compared to volume 2, the shorts on volume 1 aren't as well-made--because the DVDs are arranged chronologically.
That's because this short is more like a mini-movie and is very plot-driven--something ALL great Chaplin shorts have in common.
I've seen some of the original Flash Gordon serial from the 1930s/40s (and found it pretty darn cheesy, inferior to this 2007 series in acting, writing and special effects), but I mainly tuned in to this new version because I thought Eric Johnson did a good job in his supporting role on Smallville.
Those who are disappointed because this Flash differs from previous incarnations of their childhood, should keep in mind that those other versions differed as well, from each other and from the original comics.
The show is still not great, but I gave it an 8/10 because it is now doing a good job at being exactly what it should be, a campy romp with clever dialog and just plain fun.
Flash Gordon has moved from a show I watched because nothing else was on to a show I look forward to every week.
The portal- this is good because now Flash and the others can go back and forth between earth and Mongo.
This bond game is pretty good because: The mission's are pretty good they are most of the time fun and sometimes hard and challenging to complete that can be fun sometimes.
This game is really fun so rent it or buy it some time because it is pretty fun to play.
I really enjoy watching the show, but that's probably because I don't have expectations of the show because I've never read the comic books.
I suppose I like it so much because I didn't start watching the show having a standard of what it should be like fixed in my mind, so I wasn't disappointed.
This is important because I think it's unfair to judge what's essentially a reboot of the franchise by comparing it to the history of the original incarnation(s).
I want to be the first to tell you that's okay because Flash Gordon isn't trying to be like BSG.
I like Flash Gordon because it doesn't take itself seriously, and that is what makes it enjoyable.
Apparently he's a pretty responsible youngster and has never lost anything...ever, because 15 years later Flash is STILL wearing the Timex watch that his father gave him... uh.. OK.  2) why would Ming send a flying probe though the portal?
Problems.... SPOILERS AHEAD not that I think anyone will care...  OK so now Flash is Stephen Gordon aka "Flash" because he runs marathons and wins medals for it.
Probably because SciFi Channel decided to save on money by hiring their usual low grade, pretty face talent Maybe if the writing hadn't been done by committee it would seem less like "Dawson's Creek in Space", but I doubt it.
Just because he's Denzel Washington--doesn't cut it.
"Stir Crazy" is entertaining and funny for about 10 minutes and those minutes are just at the beginning, so if after this comment you are going to watch it anyway I recommend you to stop watching it just at the first moment you find it a little boring because from that moment the movie will get after each passing minute even worse until the end.
I think at that time comedy makers knew what they are doing, because all of the jokes worked, not like in most of the nowadays comedies.
Very funny film, with one of the highlights being Pryor in the prison hospital because he was told he had to have his appendix out, though they had already been removed.
When Donahue is canned for harassing a starlet and Monroe is fired because his marijuana ends up in the food at a society dinner on the same day, Donahue takes it as the perfect opportunity to finally leave the cold, unfriendly metropolis and head out West.
It also turns out to have much more weight than just a comic device: Donahue survives in prison as well as he does, and it brings about the profound changes of character--Donahue becomes much more authentic, realizes his potential, gains material for his art and even gets the girl--because of his continued misprision (in the Bloom sense) about life outside of New York City, and in the end, it enables a "return to the market", as they say in Zen Buddhism.
Besides, this is a different Tom & Jerry's cartoon because it takes us to the old Texas, to the generation of cowboys, which makes this a western.
All in all, a very good movie, one worth seeing not only because of Denzel Washington :))), but also because of the social problems mentioned... And really, is Britain such a racist country?
The costuming is atrocious as well, because there was black leather and a Rolex on one character while the others wore colorful tunics and togas.
I showed it in my 10th grade English class because we were studying Antigone and this was the only film version the library had.
I liked this movie, but because it was so bad on all accounts.
It has a mother saying, "She can't s**t. I made her hot coffee because she can't s**t. Now she will have constipation and a headache."
Also, they redub the boy's need for surgery because whenever he is aroused the semen goes to his head, and it will explode.
The sister says, "I want to give you a big french kiss, but i can't because it will arouse you and your head will explode."
Personally i think it is better to watch this in two parts because it gets tiresome after a while, much like i thought MST3K did.
Also, prepare for culture-shock abound because as they say - 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'.
I love this show because it creates a lot of drama when people can get eliminated and because it's cool to see all these different places they get to go to.
Mainly because it's so global, mixture of different cultures and traditions.
*****CONTAINS SPOILERS******* There's no way for me to discuss this movie without revealing plot points because the way the script squanders its cast and an interesting storyline is what disappoints me most.
They have actors who radiate intelligence and charm and, because of their past works, carry a lot of goodwill--especially with audiences who are old enough to want to watch this film because Peter Falk is in it and not because they want to see Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s early work.
Why I say this show is so funny is because he's Jewish and doing this.
*Shudders* The only good parts of this whole movie, if you want to call it that because it's an hour long, were "The Whore" and "The Amazing Racist, Part I" Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
You should probably also avoid moving to San Francisco, because he's not really that unusual by SF standards.
As Berlin talks candidly about the losses he experienced as the seventies faded into the Reagan years, it's impossible to look away--partly because there are so many men whose experiences are reflected in his story.
I rated it "1" because there's no "0" or negative numbers available.
The title creatures of the film do not kill anybody, because they can't.
The filmmakers must have realized that little frogs, even in vast quantities, are not the terrible killers they wanted them to be, because they set them up more as the masterminds, urging alligators, snakes and scorpions to do most of their killing.
Milland, as Mr.Grumpy, plays a ridiculous character who, even when faced with a catastrophe, finds the time to grumble about trivialities, and everyone around him has to take note of him because of the testament money.
However, like many of the animals running amok films of the 50s, 60s and 70s, it is also strangely watchable because it is so silly.
I remember seeing 'Frogs' on some horror channel when I was about seven but I switched over after about ten minutes because it was so boring.
What about those of us who watch these movies because they aren't filled with the same garbage you can find in every other modern movie?
Why did I think because Ray Milland was in it, it might be good?
(Make sure you're not eating when you watch this, because they shoot them out so suddenly that you're likely to end up wearing your lunch.)
If you have sympathy for young petulant pretty girls that invent crises of their own because their life is too uneventful, then you may sympathise with young Leelee, but the fact that she decides life is worth living because her Chinese neighbour cooked her some spring rolls with chop suey and then washed and ironed her dress properly pretty much sums up the vacuous nature of this character and also of this turgid film.
She rejected him because he had frustrated her melodramatic moment of suicide.
I say first viewing because you will want to revisit these characters and return to see this expertly measured film all over again.
But I would feel uncomfotable watching this with my kids in the room because of the strong pro-homosexuality message.
Don't complain that Hollywood is trying to convert everyone because it simply isn't true.
This one is for the innocent in the audience- or the people who can overlook one bad point for the big picture, because in the long run, this movie is awesome.
In spite of that, I gave this a 10 because I am so happy to find out there are a boatload of Poirot's that I have yet to see, and because I liked the chemistry between Elliot Cowan's character and Amanda Douge's character.
I think that Demi Moore was bold to go with the little known Ocracoke, NC accent because most people will probably (wrongly) think that she was doing a very bad job at a North Carolinian/Southern USA accent.
I rated this show a bit higher because during the first few years it was on, I didn't know anyone who didn't watch it.
I asked this, because I recently saw another UK film called "Stranger from Venus", which was a cheap knockoff of "The Day the Earth Stood Still".
The streets of London are eerily empty of people and traffic because no one is willing to venture outside.
I hope to see a DVD soon out there with some nice extras & more then one version of the film an Audio Commentary by Ray Harryhausen & Ken Ralston would be nice because they did one on King Kong another Willis O'Brien Stop-Motion Classic!
And that's because it isn't a Otto-Film but a film with Otto, who is not the but one of the main actors.
Maybe it is because the movie has a very good director: Sven Unterwaldt, who has worked for many important TV-comedies and has a nice feeling for timing and a believable look.
The last time I saw it was about 15 years ago, man,I miss it,It's a shame, because this film will have you rolling in laughter for at least 3/4 of it.
i watched with my girlfriend and it's -two thumps up- just 9/10 because maybe some other movies try to top this
His wit still can be seen through the screen of the more strict narrative line seen in this movie but because the characters need to seem reasonably sane, their range is a bit restricted.
I won't bother to recount the plot here because I'm assuming most people have already seen this one.
So this is nothing but an exciting film, now a true cult classic and Carpenter teach us that you don't need the biggest budget to make one of the best sci-fi/action films ever because this film budget is $7,000,000 so is nothing if we compare to Hollywood latest films.
Particularly because the first hour is so great, the ending seems quite tame.
You can sit back and laugh at this film if you're not welsh, or you could be utterly confused for two hours because unlike Trainspotting, the accents are not toned down for American audiences.
Off-puttingly touted as the "Welsh Trainspotting" - because who wants imitations?
It can make you laugh harder than you could ever imagine, mainly because the characters are like  people that you know and love.
All in all, this is my favorite movie because of the wonderfully warm and funny cast and the never-say-die attitude of the Lewis brothers.
I don't know why really, i guess its because i'm Welsh (and proud of it).
And don't think i don't notice because i do.
I was surprised there was a storyline in it, because its supposed to just be a spoof of the Snow White story, but the story is pretty good-- I especially like the Tupperware container-- whoever thought of that was a genius.
I am giving this show a 7 because it is extremely entertaining to watch.
I've never heard Anne make a comment that could not be taken all in good fun, but she maintains her hard exterior because the show is supposed to have a no-nonsense approach.
This episode worked so well for me because Duryea was a very (sym)pathetic figure.
All is not lost, however, because he and his adversary are left to live normal lives because their gunfighting days are over.
Maybe it is because I speak the language and can much easier detect when something sounds a little quirky - whereas I am not as good at English and therefore might have trouble detecting their flaws.
Sofie GrÃ¥bÃ¸l made toes crumble but not because of bad play but because the character she played was so embarrassing clumbsy.
  I was somewhat reluctant when my girlfriend wanted me to see this film with her, because danish comedies has not been that funny in the last last pair of decades!
- I guess it's because he was played by a Swede rather than a "real" Italian.
That's because this movie is just plain funny.
Sandler is great in it & all you people that say he mumbles his lines, it's his style & it's that which attracts the audience to him because he seems so non threatening to the audience.
Like in ZAZ-Movies or simple Gross-Out-Comedies, you better leave your brain outside in the car and enjoy, because it is a fun event to watch this kind of movie.
It's good to see, that this movie is no typical Otto-Movie, because his last two outings were flat or plain bad.
Not so funny: German Talkmaster Harald Schmidt who plays himself as a candidate for the court jester job, ÂTraumschiff'-Veteran Christian Tramitz, who has (as the hunter) to deal with a lot of weak lines and Ralf Schmitz, who can't show his talents from TV, because his dwarf ÂSunny' is definitely a weak point of the whole movie.
And don't think to much about kind of Âmessages' in the jokes: after films, which should be funny because of racial stereotypes, excessive drinking, puking, crapping, re-animating dogs, eating dog-shit, drinking sperm in beer and f**king apple pies, I don't see a problem in the (absolutely funny)ÂHitting-Women'-Joke, when all the male characters are hitting themselves through the whole movie.
I guess, the problem is, the jokes used in that film are really old and pretty used for us Germans, because Otto Waalkes used them since the beginning of his career.
I'm very sad about this film, because there are a lot of great comedians, but they all played only there Stand-Up-Roles...   absolutely disappointing...
The role of Val is problematic, because how does one keep him from looking like a complete bastard as he shuts out Armand, who raised him.
Happy, after meeting Chubbs (Carl Weathers), goes to the Waterbury open where he nearly kills his caddy because he thinks he's getting robbed.
It is full of non-stop laughs for me, because I love this kind of comedy.
But this is only his character's ironic name, because Happy is really quite angry and extremely frustrated at getting nowhere in his amateur hockey career.
Anyone who is a golfer would appreciate this movie more than others, because Sandler says and does things we'd all like to do on the links at times but, thankfully, don't.
It is true that people don't want to hear the truth because it is too boring.
We didn't keep the tape because we thought we could always buy a good one.
As usual, it fell by the wayside because of a bunch of self righteous "critics".
I just need to find a version that will work on USA DVD players because I want to share the joy this movie brings with all of my friends and family.
Very good movie with a multistar cast unique to cinema viewing 6 stories only 4 of them which are really good the 2 stories which i don't like are the homework story and the apple story first of all the homework story isn't that good and well it's different from the other stories and the apple story is just wow bad people turning into apples come on and the ending isn't strong enough either and stupid because the movie would have been interesting had it had a different ending besides the ending and the 2 crappy stories this movie is a pleasure to watch and can make for great cinema and can be quite a great entertainer good movie great directorial debut by Prawal Raman and great script written by Ram Gopal varma's selected writers and driectors and for the first time Ram Gopal Varma did a great job a t producing a movie hats off to him and Prawal
I watched this movie, because I had promised my little sister to join her.
I have seen all the other Otto-movies, because my family loves him, but I don't really think he's funny.
and not because my belly was laughing so hard.
I hope this crap will be forbidden because of the possible damage it could do to your brain.
To the people who hate this movie because it presents an unrealistic idea - please.
Do you hate Dragonball Z because it presents an unrealistic idea of aliens that are human-like in appearance and speak English?
I don't want to give to much away regarding plot because all you really need to know is that somebody screws somebody over in a BIG way, and revenge will be exacted.
Let's face it...this generation is "smarter" because technological tools have changed the way they (we) think..(including cinema)...
I seen this movie at the Library like 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really want to pick it up, then I picked it up this year because I read the entire description that meant like Indigo children have powers and I just thought that it will make it a wonderful and inspirational movie, but when I first turned it on, I felt like I fell asleep in a nightmare of demon spirits until when I got to the part where they were in the house and a little girl was in the car.
People with ADD/ADHD apparently make good executives, because they're impatient when other people start discussing things, and they'd rather make their own decisions, which they have sufficient confidence to feel are correct.
My girlfriend rented this movie because our friends hosted official screenings while we were out of the country, and we were somewhat curious.
I do not want to say much because this one holds a few surprises (you wont forget the opening sequence, actually that is if you can sit through it!!)
Don't think that kids will like it because it's about Indigo children.
I love the story of the Indigo Children, and I cannot do anything but hope that most of the cases are true, because, if they are, these children represent a new wave of society that is very promising.
In the beginning of the film, we see Don Ru scold his son, Chava, for seeming "too gay" with his friend Abel because Chava is spending too much time with Abel when he was supposed to be working at his father's bar.
Alma is the gaze of men in the film because she is young and vibrant, however, that is all she is allowed to be; an object of men's desire.
I think the same scene placed at the beginning of each synopsis that shows some older men playing dominoes in Don Ru's cantina is symbolic because it is representative of an ordinary day and also shows how people in the community gather together and share stories and get to know one another.
I think it was very fitting to leave things the way they were because the movie was a portrayal of everyday life.
I feel that the scenes of the men playing Dominos at Don Ru's cantina are the most important scenes of the film because it tells the viewer that although the characters presented have complex lives, the actions they take to reach their individual happiness are mundane when you take a look at the bigger picture, especially when you realize the men playing dominoes are older and have gone through many life experiences, perhaps they are trying to tell us to relax and not take life so seriously.
It's painful to watch at times, because the story grinds your nose against stories of people who are getting through some unpleasant times in some unpleasant ways and the pace does not let you escape - it is clear they want you to endure something of what the characters are going through.
The last chapter, the Return, ties all the strings together as best they can be, because this is life and the strings simply don't tie together that well.
This movie is an impressive and exciting story about the people,their feelings,love,desperation,anger and hope.Although the scenario is a little bit melodramatic , the film is a must indeed.It is quite different from the blockbusters with happy ends because it is real and outstanding.Several lives and fates are mixed in it.Every character has his own unique personality.They all have to take decisions for their lives and have to fight for happiness.The actors are very nice.The stunning Hayek makes a good performance .Gomes Krus is also convincing as a man who becomes gay after 30 years marriage.The supporting roles are also well-played.Don't think that this is some kind of soap opera- it is something deeper...
This is clearly a movie that will survive because of its universal themes.
I mean i cant remember much of this film because i saw it a while ago and its totally unmemorable but i think he meets a girl and decides to put off killing himself for a bit.
In this, you're seeing the Genesis story of Jacob and Esau...this includes the parents who 'played favorites', the 'elder brother serving the younger', and the behind the scenes double cross ("Is that why he is called Jacob, because he has deceived me these two times?").
Then ultimately you will be justly rewarded by film's end because this is one of the few, and I do mean few, American remakes (and a comedy no less) that is worth watching time after time!
Toni Collette's narration is annoying, precisely because it is obvious this is her coming of age story.
The four temps who look so playful and happy on the box cover are miserable in the movie, partly because they're temps and partly because they don't possess the ambition or skills to be much more than that.
If we have the ability to take that thought seriously, and investigate it for a very long time (dozens of years), without succumbing to the fear (or possibly in most cases, the reality) that it will lead to depression, or insanity, we will become more complex, because we will operate on a different level, and see things as they are.
Wilbur might seem selfish, but I think that Wilbur might be sick of being judged based on some silly sexuality archetype that he carries because of habit, rather than real desire for it.
We understand the flames of love they feel for each other because the film has made the characters sympathetic until this moment.
For Harbour, it is happiness he never felt, and you can tell because of how he sounds when he says "I'm going home with my wife and daughter".
And for Wilbur it is rediscovering a life he gave for done; it's feeling againÂIn the wrong circumstances and place, yes, but feeling; and the only thing life ask from us is that we thank her for being in the world, because there's nothing more beautiful than being alive.
I like the film, not because it is on love or it is funny, but because it tell a story of mutual dependence of the characters.
Just watched this film for the first time this evening mainly because the brilliant Julia Davis was listed as being in the film.
That's because this movie is as divorced from any reality of any human heart or mind as possible.
No one can give a reason for living to Wilbur because life is just "here" with no ultimate reason or reference to God.
The setting also made it very enjoyable (the bookshop), possibly because one of my favourite characters (the kipling fanatic) only appeared in this location.
I'm just saying, go into this flick ready for anything to happen because in the world that Mr. Fallon and Mr. Viel have created here even the kitchen sink is scared to come out of hiding.
One can understand why he would hesitate to kill a child, not least because he senses the boy's admiration for him.
The kid is only likable because he is fat and ugly, and you cant help but feel that he's the type to be bullied.
I, like most other contributors, had bought this film for 99p merely because Michael Caine was in it, and then I read that someone else paid only 97 pence, I was indeed robbed!
I believe in years to come this film will be very valuable and rare because so many people would have thrown it away in disgust, and it will reach record prices on ebay, I am keeping mine just in case.
That's not to say that either the script or direction are outright bad, they aren't, it's just that neither has the impact, style or strength to carry off this type of film or story, and because of this it all just comes off as rather flat and unexciting.
Performance wise James Woods is very good in the title role, which is good because it's basically down to him to carry the whole film, a feat that he almost, but not quite manages to do.
I remark that I saw this film at Sitges because 5 years ago I saw there Kim Ki Duk's "Address unknown".
The story line is classic, a vengeance movie about the payback that an ex cover policeman, that becomes a drug dealer because of his job, takes against the punks that rape his wife (with a baseball bat in full detail!)
His facial expression is what you're remembering during the picture, because (and that is very intelligent way of using the expectations of the public by the filmmakers) we have seen lots of vigilante films   (spoilers!)
And to you upcoming filmmakers and actors you must support Viel and Fallon's movie because it is made with little money but with lots of love.
I hope that their next feature will be at the same category of that one, because "Deaden's" cult has just born.
Hopkins' partner warns him about them and tells him that he is at the top of their Âto retire" list because of his shaky family life.
Maybe it's because he hasn't starred in enough 'classics', but there's something fundamentally troubling in his personality that discourages full recognition.
It's not because he usually plays villains - audiences have had great affection for the hateful throughout movie history.
When she leaves him, Hopkins stays put because he is married to a job that consumes him.
The direction of James B. Harris is right because he gives the viewer a good story.
Like other reviewers, I laughed at stuff that was probably not supposed to be amusing just because Woods was so damn funny.
But I enjoy the simplicity of the stock market, the characters are also simple but you don't care too much about that, because you're inside a story thats goes around different dramatics situations to finalize with a happy ending.
I guess one of the reasons I liked this film so much was because my expectations were so incredibly low.
Why he did this was partly because he was a nice person and part of this was so that he could rebuild his fortune and regain his old factory.
A two is rather generous for this, and it only gets that much because of Davies and Warner.
Most of the bad acting can probably be blamed on the script, because it is hard to conclude that what is up on the tv screen is nothing less than corny.
She and her on-screen daughter are the only ones to escape from the script alive and only because of Nastassja's screen presence that carries most of the scenes that she is in.
If the script were actually realistic, then we poor American citizens are in a world of trouble because the so-called national security is not even second rate, but probably fifth rate.
If the writers are smart, they would be wise to never admit that they wrote this script because it has been very poorly researched with god-awful dialog and situations that only a real professional like Nastassja can escape, including a scene that seems to have been lifted out of "Paris, Texas."
Most of the acting is hammy and some might find that amusing or something to laugh at because it is so bad.
What went wrong was unfortunate because it seemed to be all things that should NOT have been a problem in film for that time.
I also found the Foley annoying, because it was noticeable.
When I say older I mean mature enough to recognize culture differences, and I say non African because I think the director was aiming more towards SHOWING colonization to others.
There were minor lapses in scenes that confused me a little and some of the scenes seemed to drag, but I could have felt that way just because I am used to the fast passed American cinema.
It was just because I am an outsider looking in.
The fighting between the quarrelsome children was over not because anything had been settled, but because they were sick of fighting.
I really enjoyed "The Birdcage" because it had a lot of serious issues, yet managed to turn into a fun joke.
By the end, I nearly turned off the movie because I could not handle the unfinished story line, poor acting and predictability.
All it was about was two teenagers wondering around a dark creepy house and Nami discovering secrets about her familyÂ it's too bad because it came across as very atmospheric- but it was really tedious sitting through this drag-fest.
The flashy camera-work (something you would associate with Sam Rami) is quite out there and very arty at first- but it was over-used to a point that it became real choppy and distracting, because at times you couldn't tell what was actually happening.
That's because they're given nothing to work with and they don't do anything of any interest.
With this atmosphere, the story really didn't need to be to strong because the viewer is captivated by its visuals.
They're part of a team of video game designers, and they transmit their findings to the rest of the team because they want to use the house & some ideas for a new game.
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is based on the bestseller by Jack Ketchum, which is based on the torture and murder of Sylvia Likens, a case which I did extensive research on to understand what this film was about, and compared to my research the actual events were certainly more brutal than what is shown in the film, but the film still packs a powerful punch, think of it as a semi truck packed full of mixed emotions, because thats what you'll feel like after you've watched this film, like you got hit by a truck and you're left with a bag of mixed emotions.
I'm writing this at 4 a.m. because after watching this show, I can't sleep.
His agony rises even more with the feeling of guilt, because in his childish understanding he sees himself as responsible for the start of the worst tortures.
The only reason this film should not receive a 1(awful) is because the story is so grotesque it draws you in till the very end.
However, sitting in judgment while watching the torture scenes I find myself drawn into their world because I too want to find the offspring of everyone involved and break every bone in their body and burn their skin and dismember their sexual organs.
After seeing this I know this for sure, we are the filth of this earth, we are an infestation that does not deserve to live because all of us can turn a blind eye to cruelty to save our own asses.
This film, 'The Girl Next Door', I would choose to not show them simply because it's a bad film.
This is ridiculous because the boy continues to go over to the house time after time watching (and sometimes partaking) in said torturous activities.
The only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because the last 12 minutes or so were actually intense.
As painful as it may be to become party to David's anguish and Meg's suffering, our identification with their plight provides the only tolerable way to participate in the witnessing of a crime that's all the more shocking because something so very similar really happened.
Like "Last House", this film is scary because of its realism.
Perhaps this film even trumps "Last House" in a way because the events really did happen, and actually happened worse than depicted here.
As the torture worsen you feel more and more sympathy for the girl; this is what makes the movie excellent because it captures the audience in a very powerful way.
I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie before they go to bed because it will be hard to sleep having to think about the poor girl being tortured.
I have a feeling this movie will be banned because its too explicit for the general public to watch.
A friend of mine who watched this film with me told me that he was unable to sleep for the rest of the night because of this film...and we're talking about a grown man in his late thirties!
The culmination of the acts they perpetrate are some of the most shocking I have ever seen in cinema, all the more shocking because they are perpetrated by children, against another child, encouraged by their mother.
I don't know for sure, because I really couldn't stand this pathetic estrogen-fest masquerading for psychological drama.
I was just watching it because I ran out of sleeping pills, and it sure did the trick!
I gave it two stars because the bad acting sufficiently pulled me in to watch the whole
As i only started watching the movie half way through because there was nothing better on, what struck me was how compelling the story was, as it was a a B-Movie with hammy acting, it spotlighted the issues that occur amongst teenage girls-its scary how powerful envy can be & how it can drive someone to such a horrible act- but i found it hard to believe ( as manipulative as Ellen was) how Patty Duke's character could not see through her -although i have to say that Patty Duke did a great service to the movie And Ellens character being so 2 faced and Clingy makes you detest her.
I remember seeing previews for it and I think i was 10 or 11 not sure but I remember waiting so anxiously to see it because I loved Tiffani Amber-Theissen.
The Terrence & Philip movie introduces the kids to a whole world of swears and insults they never knew before (because they couldn't use them on TV) and they start using it in talking back to teachers and their parents.
i can't even begin to tell you how obscene and vulgar this movie was, because the audience and i were laughing so hard, we'd miss parts.
Which is proably why the rating committee wanted to give this movie an NC-17 rating because they slam on them so much.
The songs are so funny (specially Terrance and Philiph's one) and we have great scenes, like Saddam Hussein and the Devil fighting because of sexual problems, or all the students who are classmates of Eric, Kyle, Stan and Kenny saying lots, but LOTS of cursed words!
7 out of 10  To all the people who criticised this movie, because of it's bad language, violence etceteras: You have NOT learned a thing and you'd better watch this movie again.
the animation is also the same which must be great news for the studio because by doing that the movie was made very cheaply.
As for the humor, don't watch this if you are easily offended, because you will be offended.
This does not include the people who feel brave because they survived "There's Something About Mary."
Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life.
Kenny dies (thats not a giveaway because on the TV show Kenny dies in every episode) and winds up in hell to find Sadaam Hussein and Satan as gay lovers.
It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech.
You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.
It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here, because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater, but there is more to this movie than just humour.
When they asked for South Park, the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film.
But be careful, because it's certainly not for the weak of heart.
But once you understand the irony and surrealism which this movie possesses, you realize that it doesn't matter; because, as we have seen through the terrible camera-work and exaggerated emotional reunions, this is not the real world.
Apparently, the company did a very bad job of porting the film over to digital because the soundtrack of every film is off by about 2 seconds.
This fantastic but formulaic Japanese-animated science fiction adventure epic takes place in a futuristic society where robots perform all the menial tasks and are discriminated against because they lack humanity.
Eventually, the father cannot stand the sight of the robot because he knows that it is not his son.
to the iconic boots rocket boosters, because of a guilt- reflex that he had let down his son, and have left him exposed without being there to protect him properly.
I think the animated series Astro Boy is more reminded because of ts cultural meaning than for its intrinsic attributes, because it was the first "anime" which found popularity outside of its natal Japan.Personally, I have never seen that series, so I went with zero expectations to see its film adaptation.However, the movie ended up being a boring, bland and cloying clothing which combines elements from A.I., Wall-E and Peter Pan.
I can see it through the eyes of the makers because we have house-helps here... and I would say that sometimes, they weren't treated as they are supposed to be.
We must never forget that any time we discriminate someone because of their race, social status, culture, economic status, or even gender, is an insult to humankind.
Let's not forget that God has planted a longing for every person to do the right thing because that's exactly what gives life its direction.
This isn't a bad movie because you could find worse.
Nevertheless, it's dull because it lacks a story.
Overcome by remorse, he creates a robot duplicate into which he transfers Toby's memories (as well as rocket powered flight and assorted weaponry), but then finds himself unable to accept the substitute because he is a robot.
I'm still not too sure of the impact that is likely to have on youngsters, but maybe that says more about me as a Dad than it does about kids, because those in the cinema seemed to enjoy it.
When I had first heard about this movie around about last summer, I was pretty excited to see it, even if people were saying it was a waste of time, I still had to see it because I knew it was based on an actual anime/manga series long ago, and because I'm so heavily into that sort of stuff it was definitely something I was going to see and believe, I walked out of the cinema smiling because I felt really happy and cheerful and I knew it was because of that movie.
It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)  Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me.
And to finish off, I have some idea my review is just pathetic and just goes on about how 'great' the movie is.. when it actually is, but I just don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, it has so much in common with the original series that you wouldn't believe, it's rare nowadays that new animation movies have any background history (meaning any cartoons made and shown on TV before the movie) or even anything in common with its previous shows, so it's pretty good to see something like this come out, makes me happy to be the age I am now because when I was young CGI animation just wasn't this good... and that says something cause I'm only 17 ^^ And even if you have never heard of or even watched the original series it doesn't matter because the movie practically starts from scratch anyway if you know what I mean ;) So yeah, enjoy the movie (:
But it's just generic, which is fine but the outcome in every scene felt a bit flat because of it, like if you seen the trailer you will probably get the whole story down, but some of the sequences while being predictable was cool to watch, so it's sort of forgivable.
Fortunately, the little boy in this computer-animated adventure doesn't have to worry about parental separation, because he's dead.
It's a shame because I wanted this movie to be better.
Arguably, Astro Boy is the quintessential children's action hero because he is an ideal mix of pure innocence, a loving heart, and an explosive little dynamite when the going gets tough.
That is because Astro Boy is like a national figure in Japan, as much as how Mickey Mouse is towards Americans.
"Se7en" also works because of its two main actors.
Even if none of the murders are portrayed on screen, the aftermath is horrible anyway, mainly because of the nauseating pictures shot by the crew of director David Fincher.
Yes, it was very directed at kids, you know, the far off humour and such, but when I saw Toby, the genius' "kid", I felt that the movie was after all NOT just a Pinocchio rip-off where an old man made a robot-boy because he was bored or lonely... the reasons behind the creation of Astroboy were tragic and even mature.
Well, because it's flat of course.
It gives the film an odd pacing but it worked quite well for me, simply because it's a fresh approach.
She thinks she deserves credit, because instead of living on the dole (welfare), she's trying to crate a business, to 'make something of herself'.
Keep educating us Ken, because we badly need it!
Luckily she spoke at the screening because if she hadn't I wouldn't have been able to believe she was acting.
This might be partly due to the involvement of Ken Loach himself but also because it is a rather poignant essay of the one crucial aspect of globalisation Â the richer countries exploiting the availability of the cheap labour available from the poorer countries.
He is too weak to wait justice, so he goes and gets it by his hand because he is a slave for his excitability.. his emotionality.
He was despising the extremism of the human lusts because he wasn't one.
I will remember this movie all my life.I watched it twice on the 80s in a movie club.One with my friends and the other with my dad,a real fan of Tchaikowski as myself.Two days in a row because it was so moving,so wonderfully made,I had to watch it again.I wonder why I didn't find it on cable in all these years!
This is an excellent film for music students to watch, simply because the acting is top-notch (the actor playing Tchaikovsky is hauntingly like Tchaikovsky himself) and although this is not an accurate and detailed account of Tchaikovsky's life, it's an impressive film worth viewing by anyone who loves classical music and that of Tchaikovsky, the Romantic from Russia.
Best thing was you never knew how it's going to end, because the show was chaotic, and some stupid endings were resolved with "Cut!
The show is funnier for me today than when it first aired, mainly because I now understand that the main target were not children but people of more age, something that is relatively unknown.
Watched that noir horror movie Se7en on the weekend because I was stuck in a household without many commercial-free alternatives.
*F/X Amazing effects team on this film because the there were moments that were just so eerie and even one scene made me cringe so bad my tummy flipped!!
Everyone blasting this movie is bummed because they were taken in by the slick cover art and the "Lions Gate" name.
And now, because the movie itself isn't as slick as Scream, or The Ring, everyone wants to blame the filmmakers.
I bet you're the same folks who bought all those Dracula, Wolfman and Mummy movies because the packaging was cool.
The sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as Desdemona in 'Othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have Iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('Othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (Horatio perhaps in 'Hamlet', or maybe Father Laurence in 'Romeo and Juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel.
Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this.
The LAST thing this movie needs is a big budget, because it's better off the way it is.
Although I would have thought this movie was made in the 80's, that is not a bad thing - because most good movies were, so cudos to Cross for capturing a mood that is so hard to find in modern day horror.
half way through the film i sat there dertermined to watch the film to the end, not because i was struggling to stay awake or anything like that, but simply to see if the film would at all improve just slightly.
Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope.
This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.
Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity.
Also did you have to put the A. in your name because of the other David cross from Mr Show, or have you always done that?
Anyway, if you are a horror movie buff, then watch it just because.
I rented this at blockbuster because it had professional looking packaging and even though I figured it was a "B" grade horror movie, I at least thought it was done professionally.
So, she sticks around because she wants to help.
I liked it because it was so terrible it was funny; I felt bad for the people who made this movie.
Two out of ten, because, as usual in Bigas Luna's films, the photography is very good.
These sequences don't work because there's no logic or character behind the comedy.
Freeman is perhaps the only person capable to tracking down John Doe, simply because he has seen so much sadness and horror before.
'The Hobo' is probably West's best film -- funny in its own right, and extremely Chaplinesque -- because West places the Tramp in situations that emulate genuine Chaplin sequences.
i love this film so much it has a great story line and the actors are amazing.it helped that the film had Zack Efron in because he is a talented actor who recently the lead in high school musical i gave this film 10/10 because it was amazing and i dint want 2 blink because i did not want 2 miss a second of it i also thought that the film was heart warming and it made me see a whole new side of Zack's acting skills i no that i cant wait to see him in his new film hairspray because if it is as good as this it will be at the top of the charts the only downside to this film is that Crystal Hunt who plays Jill Overton got 2 kiss Zack i was so Jealous if only i lived in America i would of auditioned for that part but i live in england for now

I had avoided The Derby Stallion ever since it came out, because I was so much more concerned with other movies(but of course), and one day it was about time to leave the movie rental place, so I just grabbed it and ran on, and now I'm glad I got it.
Of course there was some things wrong with it, but I decided to overlook them and not pay attention to them that much because the movie entertained me so much.
The acting was great and Zac Efron did some really nice work.I was drawn to this film because I ride horses and like racing.
My mother liked the film too, and said she would recommend it to her friends to buy for their kids because its a family movie that she enjoyed watching with me.
I will begin by saying that the only reason I watched this movie is because I like Zac Efron and was curious to see his other work.
If it is a cult movie I think it is because it speaks to the heart.
But perhaps it is appropriate in this case, because Seven attempts to be a statement about humanity: no one is without sin.
I must have watched it at least 10 times in my life because it's just that good.
Usually when I watch it, it's because I recommend it to somebody who has never even heard of it, so I feel the need to let them see my copy.
Not that people don't like it, I guess it's because most people never heard of it.
This movie is so good because it manages to be funny while having some real good points.
This episode, like so many others, is great fun to watch because it didn't take itself very seriously!
That's why I liked it because it was about people and some universal ideas.
It was also neat seeing them "in person" because they portrayed a different image than I sensed from the books.
It stars out with Fredric March as a reporter who is demoted because his last story was a fake.
Unlike many of the screwball comedies of the 1930s, this one is a bit different because it is both funny AND excellent social commentary.
I personally preferred the 1937 version because of its excellent acting and fast pace.
At a mere 77 minutes, this delicious serving of pure hilarious cynicism still seems a bit long while you're watching it -- maybe because the writers at times invest too much in milking all they can from certain scenes.
This is a story about Hazel Flagg who lives in a town called Warsaw, Vermont and Hazel has been advised by her physician in town that she has a very short time to live, because she has a radiation in her system and it will take her life.
I'd heard this was an outstanding screwball comedy of the sort common in the mid and late 30s, so the first time I saw it, years ago, I thought I had caught the wrong movie because it wasn't very funny.
I hate to say it, because so much effort is on display and because Carole Lombard scintillates in the role of the deceptive but fundamentally decent Hazel Flagg.
The plot itself has a lot of built-in tension because, after all, both Lombard and the audience know she isn't sick.
Actually, it leaves a thoughtful person a little uncomfortable because what we have here is an example of an aborted rite of passage.
The reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin.
The sole weakness of the film is that it is seriously dated, some scenes are funny now simply because of people's clothing.
I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that.
I think people are sleeping on this movie, because I think it will be a cult classic.
I don't take points off the movie because of the graphics.
Matt Marraccini has the role of Jerry, someone amazingly well-versed in the town's(..and Bloody Bill's)history, poetically telling the story to his friends, foretelling their possible doom because of entering this godforsaken place.
I can only assume that the director was waisted when trying to edit this movie, because there are so many scnenes, that has plot holes and errors in them, that you just want to turn of the movie and lie down meditating over your whole existence, and why you ever wanted to waist 70 minutes of your time on this crap.
I had to check twice to be sure this was not an Ittenbach movie, because it easily could have been one.
I'll give it 2 stars for Bloody Bill only, because he was OK... at least he was the best actor in this movie, and thats saying a lot.
You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.
I rented this from Blockbuster because I could get 3 films for 7 nights for Â£5.
I only gave it a 3 because of the fact it was on for little over an hour which meant I didn't have to suffer for much longer.
This goes without saying that the whole color scheme in general, whether applied by Werner himself as DP or in post, is annoying because it makes it obvious that he doesn't trust anything regarding the actual space being used, or maybe using some natural light or shadows to make atmosphere, instead of splashing on this crude red- often in a blurred vision (FOCUS!
2 out of 10 (only because of the opening chase scene prevented it being a 1)
It's not worth going into the plot, because there really isn't one.
Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing.
That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays.
The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.
i give the writers and the director a little credit just because this is a rather knew idea.
The stories ring true, and I can attest to the validity of them, because many of the same things happened to me.
I have many ties with Jonathan Taylor Thomas (Toby) in that movie -- It, I felt was well acted, and NO I don't like the movie because it has him in it :) But I only wish I could've seen the whole thing and I don't have cable.
But the courage and fortitude he showed to everyone made me feel proud - and relieved - because I know there are people actually like him in the real world!
When the locals find out that indeed she was expelled from the Navy because of sexual deviation (i.e., lesbianism), she is discriminated and rejected by them.
When I watch a movie, I never read anything about it, because I want to have my own opinion.
Kurosawa didn't like this film because he saw it as a failed effort to make a detective film in the style of French detective novels.
It's a shame Kurosawa lacked trust in his audience because this film might have been his best if it had had a little more gentle of a hand.
The lives of unrelated people touch because of the dress and totally unrelated events suddenly fit into the story because of the dress.
I could not discover a message in the film, probably because there is none.
It is very evident that everyone who has a line in the movie has a story: the hotel worker is suffering because of the heat, the police units are tackling several other cases, and several other characters give hints about their own lives and how they are dealing with problems, which all brings life into the film.
It's completely the right thing to do, because we are suddenly at one with the hero's concerns.
I can no more imagine an American cop in the anguish of Mifune, and offering to resign because his gun was used in a crime, than I can imagine, well, I just can't image anything more foreign.
First a man loses his job because he doesn't agree with the choice of design (it's a pretty blue with an odd leaf design).
The robber, who ends up with Mifune's gun, commits the crimes exactly because he too had his bag of belongings stolen.
This early Kurosawa film interested me not only as a historical object, but because, as in every one of his films I've seen so far, the moral and philosophical implication of the story carries as much weight as the dramatic and poetic aspects.
I've seen this movie three times now, and not just because i had some pretty bad experiences with ticket collectors and bus drivers too.
I bought this DVD because I mistakenly thought that the premise had some interesting mystery/suspense possibilities, that the attractive, well-recognized cast would deliver entertaining performances, and that, even if the plot and acting failed, there still might be enough to make the film one of those movies that is fun to watch because of how bad it is.
During the trip, one of the singers takes an unreasoning dislike to the sailor, picks one childish fight after another with him, rummages through his possessions, and comes up with a theory that he killed the person on the earlier voyage because of a love triangle of some sort.
I did find Kensit very annoying throughout most of the movie which was a shame because I generally enjoy her work, but she was not helped by a pretty terrible script.
While my drama instructor tried to avoid using the word "motivation" because of possibility of clichÃ© I can think of no word better.
This is a true sleeper in the film noir category, because so few people saw it in original distribution.
Man, this is a different kind of film noir story, mainly because of the ending.
Clive Owen is responsible for bring a photographer back across the border, because he was injured.
9/10, simply because they TOYED with my heart by giving us some great X5 action, just not enough of it.
The photographer's character starts to develop when he says he would like to have time to play with his kids, which he doesn't have because the life of a war photographer is very demanding and he hasn't had the chance to start a family which he regrets.
He knows his passenger may be dying from a gun shot wound but he doesn't want him to because he believes his passenger is key to preserving human life.
There is nothing bad I can say about this movie because it was never cheesy, never dragging, and never melo-dramatic.
I was very surprised after watching the other films from the BMWs films "The Hire", because although all were clever and entertaining, none had the emotional power of this one.
So unlike other comedians who climb the ladder from dive to Broadway we feel sorry for him in success because it took him away from what he loved best.
It's impressive because of the story, that is helped by its gritty atmosphere.
Quel maledetto treno blindato (aka Inglorious Bastards) has risen from the ranks of the rest of the obscure Italian made, American acted cheapies first of all because of Quentin Tarantino's reverence for the film and the fact that he plans to a remake of sorts under the same title; second of all even though Tarantino's word is enough PR to get any obscure film to raise from the depths of the unknown into popular culture, it wouldn't work if the film wasn't any good.
No problem there because this film is superb.
This is basically the sort of war film that I would have made because unlike the typical other films in the genre, they are not really out to defend their country, only themselves.
Fred Williamson is easily the strongest member of the cast because of his extremely affable tough guy persona but the rest of the cast members seem to either overact, looking like clowns, or are about as animated as a shipwreck - Peter Hooten is especially bad, managing to both overplay and underplay his role from scene to scene.
I say finally because I received the 3-disc DVD of "Bastards" I ordered I don't know two or so moths ago and between this and that I didn't saw it till last night.
Anyway, in "Bastards" the bastards ain't some sort of special team of soldiers, ain't on a really big mission, the bastards are well just that, a bunch of inglorious bastards that will be together just because, well I was going to write the word destiny but I better write that just because some Nazis attacked the prison convoy they were part of.
It's great because at first it was just more of the same, I mean more killings and more lies with the bastards, now they killed a bunch of American soldiers thinking they were Germans and took advantage of the confusion of the French pretending to be, this time, certainly not Germans but other Americans, the American soldiers they just had killed, the American soldiers that were especially trained for a mission.
The film works principally because rather than focusing on the war itself, it focuses on a group of people thrown into the war; and their personal experiences, which principally consist of blowing German heads off German shoulders.
The only reason it get's a seven because it just is nothing special.
Much of this film doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but you won't realize it doesn't make sense until after the movie's over, because while you're watching it it's easy to be distracted by the energy of the storytelling and film-making.
Enzo Castellari's B movie "Quel maledetto treno blindato" is nowadays probably most recognizable because its English title "The Inglorious Bastards" inspired the title of Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie.
I viewed this movie because the QT movie of the same title came out in 2009.
My mate and I watched this movie in a series of War movies but deliberately saved it for last because we presumed it would turn out the most fun one to behold.
Appropriate because he's pretty much playing himself Â a cigar-chomping, one-line spewing, gun-toting badass.
Really liked this game because of the great story.
Not to those who would turn off a film because its so poor (and this film is by no means an exception) But to people who thought that The Exorcist was more of a comedy than a horror and who watch it because of this reason - this IS the ultimate movie for you.
You can't even make fun of it, because it's just dull.
Many people seem to regard this film as important simply because it is a living testament to Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontaine's acting.
In reality, however, the film is not only historically important because of the legends in it; it is one of the most fresh and funny films to emerge from the pre-Code period.
The surprise of the film is it focuses a great deal of time on Honey, which is fine because I am all ready very familiar with the entire story of Lenny Bruce.
This one is tauter and more dramatic than most because it was edited by Ed Dymtryk.
(2) I recalled a critic's remark about a later legendary film (in an entirely different way), HEAVEN'S GATE -- to paraphrase: In Hollywood, the poor are more virtuous than the rich because they're more photogenic.
THE SOUTHERNER was widely praised when it came out in 1945 (and continues to earn admirers) because it was so different from Hollywood's traditional portrayal of "the South" and played on the liberal, proletarian sympathies of certain audiences and critics.
In the end, THE SOUTHERNER fails to convince because the filmmakers failed to deal with the real dilemma of the family whose cotton crop has been destroyed by a flood.
The family nearly starves during the winter; the daughter can't go to school because she doesn't have a coat; his son falls ill with "spring sickness" (probably rickets).
Based on a novel called "Hold Autumn in Your Hand", it stands the test of time largely because of the performances.
Many of the older children did not complete elementary school because working to put food on the table was much more important.
Perhaps this is why he chooses these types of romantic roles - because he is such a superior actor and is so comfortable in the role of an attractive, sexy, leading male (and always has going back to his Dr. Kildare years).
It must have been hard to come up with the idea of two homosexuals running away from the Sarajevo, because Sarajevo was never eager on homosexuals.
I guess because actors and the rest of the crew were quite scared for touching the topic.
Not only was the lead hated and oppressed because he was Muslim, but also he was further despised because he was gay.
Religious leaders in the former Yugoslavia have been condemning this film, because of the same-sex love story.
It was one of Guinness's personal favorites among his parts because of the Catholicism of the actor.
In fact the role really hit close, maybe too close to home, because like the character he plays in the film, Guinness was a child of a prostitute mother who escaped into acting as a refuge from a really bad childhood.
A classic sadly almost ignored and forgotten probably because of it's small scale being a quite simple screen version of the popular stage play.
They are great because they are cheesy, and this my friends takes the cake and kicks a grenade into it.
Not sure what to make of the ending, though, because up to that point, it was utterly realistic.
That's because some magnificent person at the TV networks decided that the books MUST be made into 2 separate mini-series mega-events.
Anyway, after Winds of War I remember someone saying in an article in TV Guide or someplace that they would never make War and Remembrance because it was just too big.
The only possible improvement would be to the special effects in the naval battle scenes because of how far we've come in 20 years with CGI graphics; but that's it!
Precisely because of the change in actors.
The scenes in the concentration camps are horrifying and terrible, but this adds to the excellence of the program because you want to be able to emphasize with what is happening to these innocent victims and feel their pain, anguish, confusion and bewilderment.
In one way, it's good, because so much of the time is spent on inconsequential scenes just to fill time.
The only reason I haven't given it a "10" is because there are so many characters that somebody who has not read the book might get confused.
They have even formed outside discussion groups because the allotted class time is never enough to accommodate the forum required for voicing and digesting their thoughts and feelings brought on by the film.
wasn't Czech) I assumed that her mother (Irina/Rula Lenska) must be Russian or Polish because these couple of words she uttered definitely weren't Czech, rather this Slavic universal mixture.
Normally there is a point in the script where it might say, 'you killed someone' but of course everyone knows it's not real because people don't actually get killed in films.
Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home and one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint.
Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with.
Hunt and Nicholson falling in love is an easy out because then Brooks doesn't really have to deal with the more difficult (and more interesting) ideas brought up in the first half.
This is a touching film because it's centred on a man that you will initially dislike and may continue to dislike.
That doesn't matter though because it's about non-conformists being able to fall in love without sacrificing their individuality.
The timing to watch such movie could not have been better because recently only we lost the most popular human being off all times and I was comparing hisÂ.MJ's life to that of Lenny and they seemed quite similar especially the end.
The movie also looked good probably because I did not how big of a personality this guy Lenny was (was written about in Time magazine n all) and my previous experience with such biographies hasn't been that great.
Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that isn't stuffed with special effects.
This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real.
Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens - happens because of what they are.
The director needs to go back to film school and study suspense again because this movie doesn't have any.
I picked up this movie because I'll watch any horror movie.
Not many people have heard of this, but still give it a go because it is much better then some of the other horror movies out there.
So if you find such filthy hobbies offensive turn off your TV, pick it up, and throw it out the window because this program is as tame as it gets.
And it's worth watching again because it's so beautiful.
I give it only 7 out of 10 because I was disappointed that the story that I loved wasn't fully realized (IMO).
I like this movie because we're learning about the world at the same rate as the four kids here (assuming you haven't read the books, which I haven't).
I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.
I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV.
I found the film quite good because of the allegory behind it.
The best character in here is Tilda Swinton because her character is vicuous.
A human, pantomime, Aslan would be to me blasphemy'  Nowadays, because of technology, animals don't turn into buffoonery like C.S.
At the time, I ran out and purchased everything I could find on Lenny Bruce, because Cliff Gorman was that funny.
While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.
I hate to say this because I really wanted to like this movie but I was somewhat disappointed.
Or did he die because he overdosed on heroin when he should have known better?
See this movie - especially if you're easily offended, because you need it the most.
I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven.
Although it doesn't seem possible, you can suspend disbelief and become engaged in the story because the artistry and technology are so outstanding.
I always love Surrender Cinema's movies, because they have some of the best-looking girls EVER!
I mostly felt sorry for the film because you can see how hard the director is trying to make a good movie, but just misses the boat completely.
Not because the film was funny, but because the film was so very bad.
The representative (hero-boy) immediately and constantly antagonizes and confronts the photographer because of the harsh treatment of the girls.
Aryoung picks South Korea, mainly because her mother is Korean and now lives somewhere in that country.
One of the funniest foreign films that I've seen so far and most probably, one of the best Korean films that I've seen but that really isn't something because I haven't seen a lot of Korean films, only Taegukgi comes to mind so this easily takes one of the top spots.
I kind of liked the movie because it still has a story to tell despite bad directing and low budget.
Inspite of all the bad things I had a good time watching this movie on DVD and I can recommend you to rent it or even buy it because it's an old movie and the price is really low.
Today, Bruce is best known for revolutionizing the face of stand-up Â paving the way for such future talents as George Carlin and Bill Hicks Â but not many people are actually familiar with his comedy, and that's a shame, because there was a lot more to it than just swearing.
Grant fans will probably enjoy this one because there's really nothing to dislike exactly, but fans of Loy may be disappointed.
It plays like a situation comedy, which is not surprising because it was written by Sheldon, who would go on to create TV sitcoms.
Grant and Loy are at their best as two grownups falling in love, but trying to deny it because of Susan.
But when Shirley goes to his apartment because Grant fed her a line about modeling for him and Myrna catches them there however innocent, it's big troubles ahead.
The whole scene involving the town picnic with Grant in a three legged race, a potato spoon race, a potato sack race, and finally an obstacle course is funny in and of itself because it's Cary Grant doing it.
The situation then become complicated by Nugent's appearance before a high-school class as speaker, an event at which Margaret's daughter falls in love with him despite or because of the difference in their ages.
Trouble finds Grant everywhere, because he is a magnet to women, and men get jealous.
Not so much because of the shock value that surrounded them, but just how relevant his work is still today.
Living with an English teacher, I am constantly involved with the English language, but I am also shown information about those that have no interest because they do not see how it relates to "real" life.
And aside for a few moments of being at a loss (more because we're American and its a French film), it was a great film.
But by chance (there are a number of plot furtherances in this film that come about by chance--but that is not a problem because the chance meetings seem natural and are events that would probably happen eventually)--and so by chance he is hooked up with a young woman fresh from China who speaks no French, but is an expert pianist who needs a little money.
Duris is interesting enough to watch, but I was disappointed in this film, and not because of the absurdity of the conceit about musical performance.
My hopes going in were high because of Jacques Audiard's earlier highly suspenseful films, "Read My Lips" (2001) and "A Self Made Hero" (1996).
I am a normal human being who went to the cinema to see a film very hard to tell friends about without blushing (because it has such a poetic title, lyrical, as some put it).
He DID render the whole thing believable, because I am not a fan of classical music either, and I had that music from that film in my mind ever since.
The reason why this episode worked so well was because of the solid writing.
I bought this film on DVD in a local secondhand DVD shop,ours being region 2,i was surprised that you can not get this on region 1 area or region 0 which a lot of modern dvds are now,i suppose if you really look around you will find them.I thought the film was very good for 1954,the photography was good,the horse riding scenes on the cliffs were exciting,and the music was good,it was subtle and gradually built up to a climax,but never became to intense,the film was quite atmospheric almost as if you were with them,the directing was clever.the characters were interesting,five very different types of people all brought together.However i think i am the only female so far to wright a comment on this film ,and my point of view may differ.What i see is that the female character is acting in a very paranoid and agitated way ,and is trying to distance her self from them,which is how you would react if you were a woman travelling with four men you don't know,to her the enemies may not just be the Indian's in the mountains.The scene in where she is riding her horse and she looks round because she can hear Hooker and Friske laughing,believing it must be about her, says it all.I mean ,every time she makes a move to go anywhere one of them follows her,i don't think it has occurred to them that she may just want to go to the toilet,the only ulterior motive i can see her having is get me out of this uncomfortable situation,thats why she wanted to stay behind and stoke the fire,she was probably thinking give me some space.A good intriguing film any way.
There's little suspense here, mainly because the men fill out the casting stereotypes we've come to expect from them.
This brooding western has an uneven pace and meanders in places but is no less interesting because of the star power of Gary Cooper, the film's centerpiece.
Grant and Dunne look Hollywood, but we can believe them as genuine married couple because of the affection and genuine warmth to be found in their performances.
Their financial situation changes when the child is about 2, and before the adoption is final, the adoption head honchos threaten to take her away, because now they are poor.
It's only been THREE DAYS since the little darling's death, and they are splitting up because they just can't handle the grief (this explains why Dunne is packing to leave Grant throughout the current time scenes in the film).
It is as though the movie is almost a warning to parents, enjoy them now because the little ones you love maybe taken from you at any moment, except, just kidding, that does not really matter because you can always have another and poof your grief will be gone.
It's kind of strange that this film made such an impact on a little kid, because there's either no action or adventure and there are no "showy" melodramatics; it's a sensitive film not a sentimental one, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps, but I have some thoughts that I think are worth sharing, or at least I have a bone to pick because I feel I am owed some time back.
Also, the main character's best friend says he needs to get out of town because he can no longer withstand his father's abuse.
How could the director think that her oddly wandering eyes and contrived "sensuality" (I put it in quotes because I do not find her to be sexy at all) are pleasing to either the story or to an audience's eyes?
I just think that the story is clichÃ©d, boring and long-winded and the acting by the ingÃ©nue is...I won't be rude and say it again because I don't want to burst her bubble.
As I have been studying a few Cary Grant film over the past semester I wanted to watch Penny Serenade because I thought it may help an essay I am writing currently.
The film is worth seeing because of Cary Grant's invaluable contribution to the film.
Near the end, when the couple is ready to divorce because they couldn't handle this tragedy, another baby is offered to them, they accept and live happily ever after.
Some parts of this are stupid - certainly the divorce angle - but this soap opera works because of the actors.
Honestly I cried like a baby during and after this movie, just because I saw how painful it can be to live as a trans gendered teen.
We would hope that religion would bring us tolerance but most wars begin because of religion and who believes they are more right.
They beat her for 5 hours strangled her, cut her, and buried her because the rumors of her being born a guy were true how can that not be considered a hate crime.
I mean, she messes up the dinner because she can't use the microwave?
I liked the flashes of the future in black and white though.And the explosion at the start looked pretty good, I think thats why it's disappointing, because the first five minuets were more entertaining than the rest of it put together.
Schultz wants to leave more than anything, because he's in an abusive home, but Matt still doesn't want to fully make up his mind.
There couldn't have been more than about 20 people there but it didn't matter because I got so wrapped in this film.
It is so good because it is such a fantastic story of the courage of these pilots, the support from their wives and the desperate race to beat the Russians into space.
I was upset to discover that the great Chuck Yeager was not chosen because he was not "of the officer class" or "education standard".
I was an ideal audience, partly because I built models of fighters and carriers, flew model rockets, and was eager to see lots of military hardware.
It is such a story that is told extraordinarily because of how it takes itself seriously as a historical document, but never so much so as to get in a great joke - the kind of natural joking that people do, such as the few quips done by Yeagher in the cockpit to whoever was listening after breaking the sound barrier, which actually happened - or some sliver of satire to the mix.
The veneer of pure heroism is shown for what it is, as something of not always a tricky thing; the film was criticized by some of the original astronauts for the depiction of Gus Grissom (if only because Grissom had passed on in tragedy and couldn't do it himself), but his story of going into space, and the aftermath with his wife, is important to show for the story the film's trying to tell.
While it had an over three hour running time, and I actually had to get up to turn over the DVD because of its length, the pacing was such that I never once considered that any particular scene should have been shortened.
When seraching for astronauts Harry Shearer's character praises Yeager as the ace of aces, but goes on to say that he "doesn't fit the profile" of the type of man Washington is looking for because he never went to college.
He's famous because he's an astronaut alone - not because of anything he's done.
He's trying to set a record because that's what he's made of.
This is because he dares to do what we never would.
it would have been better if Billy or the Rock had won because Stone Cold was way overrated at this time.
There couldnÂ´t have been a better pay-per-view for the WWF to open the year 2001, because it is almost perfect.
IÂ´m not a favorite of womenÂ´s wrestling because most women in the WWF canÂ´t wrestle all too well.
The best royal rumble ever, because there were so many great superstars involved in this match, such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane, Rikishi, etc.
The villagers down the river eventually come to call him the Dolphin Boy, because he's often seen swimming with dolphins and they even believe he can become one and swim away if in danger.
I found this movie so amazing because it always had me on the verge of tears but never made cry.
So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films).
Most often, the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation.
I don't rate in comparison to other films because I take each film on its own, and I couldn't fault this film one bit.
I was thinking of rating it a 9 just because it was a bit short in length but then again I thought that it was that good that I wanted more.
But because this film is an animated film, the influential combinations can take almost anybody by surprise.
I loved it because it said a lot without being too heavy-handed.
It's sad, in my opinion, that such a good film as this will remain lost to so many because of simple thinking like that.
Yoou can't choose who is effected by war, because everyone is, and these are the things that this movie causes you to realize.
And I canÂ´t help feeling like Seita, her brother - because my daughter and I are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.
I found one of the most touching scenes was the one where the dying Setsuko starts sucking the buttons she collected, because she ran out of her special sweets.
You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn't miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn't good enough.
I say that hesitantly though because I have to say that I was very disappointed that almost all of the humor shared between William and Sarah was taken out of the movie.
I remember when I read the book, I had tears rolling down my cheeks because I was laughing so hard.
Placido Domingo as Alfredo Germont and Teresa Stratas as Violetta Valery were a perfect choice for the couple because of their attractiveness and the desirable chemistry.
I never finished reading it because the names are too long and the Chinese is too literary, I was bored to death by it.
The movie is banned from tv nowadays because of some racist-related links and impressions, but nothing to get too excited about.
Now if it's true that Warner Brothers DID pull this from circulation because it might be seen as culturally insensitive, then the people responsible for this are total idiots.
This is a very good Bugs Bunny episode which is banned because it has some racial references to Native Americans.
It also includes some old live-action clips of Hollywood (because of this I recommend this short to people who are interested in history).
Bugs is convinced that he will win because he can do impressions of all the stars.
Bugs IS greater than them because he can do an impression of Cagney AND Crosby; they can only do impressions of themselves.
STOLEN was one of the most disappointing film experiences I've had in a long time, more so because it had so much squandered potential.
Not merely because the pace was slow, or because of the pointless changes they made to the plot in places.
I was unable to believe the passion between them because of their huge age difference.
But it would be close-minded to reject this film just because it's not a full-fledged chiller.
It's difficult to pinpoint a real demographic for Bebop because each episode is so different.
Part 1 of a two-parter is usually absolutely brilliant, building up and up and up to something, only to nosedive in part 2 because of some deus ex machina or untied plots or just not reaching the level you thought it would (think Heroes or Doctor Who; even Battlestar Galactica let me down a little).
The show is stylistic, in fact one of the reasons i was drawn to it from the first episode was because of that very stylistic nature.
you know why cartoon network imports anime (japanimation for you old schoolers)for adult swim, because there aren't that many if any American animated series like this one.
I have watched this movie a number of times over the years, mainly because I love the music.
In the beginning, it is bad because they are supposed to be bad actors on a showboat.
It's "the best" because it has "multiple-layered storytelling", a "freely-flowing story", and so on.
The heroes in this shows aren't pure of heart, and don't walk around catching bad guys because they feel it's the right thing to do.
They catch bad guys because of money and they live their lives the way they want to.
The creative team behind the show made a very smart move by doing that, because we know it's an action scene so we don't need loud music to tell us that.
Maybe I liked it better because I haven't seen a stage production or most of the 1936 movie.
Please add "Runner" to this list because it is extraordinary.
After adjusting to the American accents (which add to the humour, because the "Scottish Play" is never actually performed with the appropriate burr anyway), I settled in for an enjoyable 90 minutes of sight gags, over-the-top characters, and word-play that was reminiscent of some of our better television programmes.
The Demon possesses one of the group, and gradually they all start dying one by one...  Its not a typical slasher movie, and is different because its getting into your head, and is a very psychological based terror, although there a plenty of jumpy moments.
I thought because it was released in the same year as two other very well regarded British horror movies , one featuring a squad of British soldiers as good guys fighting a bunch of werewolves and the other featuring a squad of British soldiers as bad guys battling against crypto zombies , that LONG TIME DEAD may have got lost in the market place but after finally seeing it I doubt if the merits of DOG SOLDIERS and 28 DAYS LATER had anything to do with its failure - The reason it bombed is that it's a rather poor horror movie  First of all can we please stop seeing movies where horny , drug taking teenagers get stalked and slashed .
Okay SCREAM and FINAL DESTINATION used the same plot but the producers at least tried to do something a little bit different with the plot where as in this movie it's just well worn clichÃ© as is the set up with a ouija board  Okay I'm in a generous mood so I won't put the boot into director because it's a debut and I imagine Marcus Adams had a lot of enjoyment shooting the picture and it is fairly stylish .
Many other 1920's shows have not, principally because of the quality of the scripts, although their songs remain famous and popular.
scared me a lot, good story line, the only horror to date that scared me,  acting was good, some well know actors i will be buying on DVD,  will watch again, music build up was good but to much blood,  had us holding to on to our teddys tightley i was to too scared to go downstairs too get a drink on my own,  had a to watch another film before i could go to sleep, surprise to see to was make in 2002 because i have never heard of it before,  10 out of 10 it a must see movie but watch it alone if you dare if not watch with a friend
Well obviously not enough, because director Marcus Adams uses it five times in this movie; I know, because I counted!
I mean, it turns boring because it is the same we have seen a million times: A group of people where an unknown entity kills the others one by one.
I rented it because it was all that was left (that I hadn't seen) at the Video Shop.
Oh yes, it takes a lot of guts to end a film like this, and I enjoyed the ending only because it ISN'T a Hollywood ending!!
Generally speaking Long Time Dead is rather slow & uneventful & the characters are so bland & similar with most of them looking & sounding exactly the same & the only one's I could really distinguish between are Lucy because she's black & Joe because of his hair!
If I sound unsure, it's because Adams is not able to clearly establish the characters, their relationships to one another, or the relationships of one location to another.
I ended up granting a 4 (equivalent to a "high F" letter grade) because of the adequacy of some of the "scare" and death scenes, the good ideas in the backstory, and the slightly more engaging climax.
)Further, while the movie is deemed 'positive'--I guess because nobody gets killed--the dialogue actually reveals the writer's disturbing assumptions about Black women and their view of self.
For some odd reason, and I don't know why I felt it was a chore to see it again (maybe it's because The Musical isn't exactly the most world-changing genre out there).
I saw this movie on cable today because there was nothing else on and actually enjoyed it.
And although I had to tone down the sound because I didn't want the neighbors to hear all the profanity, in spite of this, I thought they did an excellent job.
Hav Plenty is a clever romantic comedy that is appealing because of its unique cast.
I liked the one year later thing because if they had gotten together at the end of what happen it would have been too cheesy.
Now to penetrate (alone) a Mafia Don's home, with more button men than the Corleone, Tattaglia and Barzini families combined, it takes a few minutes because of the numbers involved and the size of the estate.
My rating for this film is 8 out of 10, primarily because of the impact it had on me as a child.
My rating for this film is 8 out of 10, primarily because of the impact it had on me as a child.
I finally bought a copy of this movie off of eBay because I had heard the Roky Erickson song of the same name like a billion times.
I even loved his naughty, mischievous, little daughter Gosalyn, because she was spirited!
I wish Disney had made a Darkwing Duck movie because I loved this series from the beginning to the end!
I wish they had a fourth season or even more, and I could have seen, "Pranks for the Memories," if they hadn't canceled the good series after the end of season 3 because it was a very good series.
Many people think that Duck Tales was merely an 80s TV show and never went further than Saturday morning but in reality it has a very rich history going back decades and if you think that it spoofs Indiana Jones you'd be wrong because it's actually the other way around.
I don't like Quackerjack because he is so annoying because he uses toys as weapons and his plans are not clever!
The whole aspect of playing with expectations is somewhat disturbing because everything we see in the movie could happen.
That only happens because we are judging sons of the Earth and we love to point fingers and name rights and wrongs.
Can you give a reason other than saying "because it crazy, weird, disgusting"?
I recommend this film to everyone because in it BuÃ±uel and CarriÃ¨re break up the routine film formula and simultaneously entertain the audience.
I will not describe what happens in the film because you need to see for yourself, but I would like to say why I like it.
He would analyze ones desires, urges, thoughts, social behavior, and when we go deep to ourselves, we discover that, yes, we do have thoughts similar to what we see in his film but, most of us, we keep them to ourselves because we are afraid to voice them loud out.
From the beginning, he plays with his audience, building up our expectations and when we think something might happen, he leaves us stunned and laughing, showing by way of absurdity and satire things we never would have thought possible because of the preconceptions we have demonstrating that we are not as free thinking and open as we thought we were.
This movie is definitely not normal, it is really a bunch of shorts put together, each transition is just a character followed to another scene and can at times seem confusing; because its right when that short climax's and you are about to find out, and then it switches and you are on to the next one.
But if you try to analyze it and pick it apart, you will realized that there is nothing that makes sense and as if it almost disintegrates because you are not suppose to analyze it logically.
But in reality it is continuous time because there were no edits in that scene, it was shot as one continuous scene.
This movie is a good example of where the directors names start to become adjectives, because the director follows the same theme in their own movies, to the point where they are recognizable and distinguishable, almost expected.
I really liked it because it truly made me think about why I am the way I am.
I can easily imagine many cops joining the force not because of some moral duty to society, but just so they can continue to play cops and robbers into their adulthood.
It often provides a dreamlike feel to it because it shifts absurd situations and scenes so quickly.
My favourite scene is when a couple are told to go to their daughter's school, because she has vanished.
Luis Bunuel's "Le PhantÃ´me de la libertÃ©" is a movie whose episodes are only loosely connected, because the watcher is a part of the society whose liberty and freedom is a phantom.
It is called "second order" because this theory has an environment in which subject and object have a space of liberty.
And this is exactly what happened in Bunel's core-scene: The teacher speaks to his students that laws have exceptions because they are depending on man, and man is depending on evolution.
Therefore, there can be no laws at all, because they also stay and fall with evolution.
And finally, in his regular bar, the teacher explains the girl who resembles to his sister that this sister died because her intestines exploded.
This three-times occurrence of faeces, the mentioning of Pasolini and the insight that form and function must abolish only because of human evolution leads the critical watcher to a conclusion about the sociology of human life that is not too far away form that of Pasolini: All mankind is able to produce is faeces.
Sometimes I laughed cause I felt terribly uncomfortable, other times because there was a real pay-off.
It could've gone anywhere and introduced me to any character - it still would've been enormously interesting because it was made by the master who had never lost his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his memory that consisted of the strange and amazing images, his sense of humor, his childhood dreams, his fantasies, dark and shining and who was able to throw them all on the screen like no one ever was able or will be able to do.
I think Bunuel wants to show that complete freedom is impossible because even if you are willing to detach from everybody and everything, you still have your own inner-nature to answer to.
They just leave, like BuÃ±uel wanted them to, perhaps, but in this film is an important factor because it confirms BuÃ±uel's non-human view of the people of this class.
Facts pop out randomly and characters that started out in the story just disappeared because of lame reasons.
No one can replace Julia Stiles as Sarah Johnson--angry ballet dancer with the hot black guy chasing after her(ha-ha) The only reason I sat thru the whole movie was because Columbus Short was in it.
(of course we could keep Columbus Short in it because hes hot).
I just recently saw this movie because I really was looking for a movie to watch.
I can't even remember the dancing or the music because all I could think of was how bad this movie is.
I honestly only watched it because it was on t.v.
Most Hollywood dance movies are very poorly done, simply because they rarely cast anyone with the requisite training to make the dancing sequences enjoyable, believable, or even worth watching.
But because of the rest I give it a high-ish rating.
I believe it is because Chevy is unique in his talent.
This show was extremely pathetic, but I would buy the DVD of the aired shows in a minute because they are unintentionally hilarious!
For one thing, Chevy Chase seemed to have been strung out on antidepressants, horse tranquilizers, or something; because he was so inept as a host as to seem deliberately horrendous.
But she also was in her job because somebody's hormones went into overdrive.
While I have not seen the other versions, plus 2 more done later in the 1950's, this one is stronger than your typical western because of the talented cast & the tremendous fist fight scene between Wayne & Scott which takes most of the last 10 minutes of the film.
Incidentally, in both THE SPOILERS and PITTSBURGH, Scott is clearly depicted as being interested in Dietrich Â but she seems to prefer Wayne (maybe because she did one other title with the latter, SEVEN SINNERS [1940], which is to follow).
Rex Beach's novel has been adapted five times thus far, and it's not hard to see why because the story is as solid as it gets.
I like films like THE SPOILERS because they have absolutely no pretense about them.
You need someone like Scott around because even though John Wayne's the good guy, he's just a little too sure of himself where Dietrich is concerned.
I hope there will be a sequel, I think they can do better than that because there is a lot of potential in it.
He's been getting the same fate as Seagal and Van Damme only because no on likes martial arts anymore.....so sad.
Martial arts is more worth watching because it's something that can be done and its a practice.
I enjoyed this movie but only because I'm a big Wesley Snipes fan.
Point 3: Action movies always have those unbelievable characters and actors who have been hired not so much because of how they act than what they look like and what they can do physically.
Expectations are too high only because they see Wesley Snipes at the opening credits.
The only real reason everybody is hating on this film is because it's a DTV movie.
But you could watch it and not know that at all because it's just about as good as other Action movies currently out there.
Anyway, this film never lets up on the thrills and is probably worth seeing for anyone into Crime Thrillers as well because this film is all about heists, car chases and back-stabbings.
because it's a decent hour-and-a-half of your time.
This failed, the ending especially, weak, the usage of British Actors, if I don't say so myself was poor and if I were you, I'd stay away from this film, because if you don't and have any personal thoughts of appreciation of how great Wesley Snipes is and how he can make most films look amazing, this may just damper that.
First of all, I'm glad I was at home, because some of the actors mumbled so badly I had to keep adjusting the volume.
Wesley also does a credible job if you can call it that with this scrip, though I use the term credible lightly because he should have his head read for choosing this script !
And I have to say I was sorry that they didn't do better because it was shot in my country and I was looking forward to what they had done.
That's partially because he has fans that wouldn't be disappointed no matter what he does (from the straight street dramas of the Black Society Trilogy to the messy violence of his more famous cult classics and lately to the more surreal works of "Big Bang Love, Juvenile A" and "Zebraman"), and partially it's because nobody really has a handle one what he's doing except that it's bizarre.
This is one of those things where I really wish I could get more people to buy/rent the movie at work, simply because it's so much Goddamn fun, but have to settle for the fact that for the most part, the incredibly sincere Japanese acting and the over-the-top Western landscapes (including a painted backdrop that purposefully gets blood sprayed on it) won't mesh with the average viewer's careful expectations of what they want from a movie.
For shame, too, because this is actually precisely what you want from a Western.
SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO, while it boasts some incredible production values (from the town itself to the pyrotechnics to some absolutely beautiful cinematography), suffers badly when it comes to story (YOJIMBO has been emulated so many times over the years that it must be tied with MOST DANGEROUS GAME by now) and character (it's impossible to pull for the hero because he's rarely little more than a bit player; we never get to know him to the degree that we do, say, Toshiro Mifune in YOJIMBO and SANJURO).
It's hard to pin down, though, because the film doesn't really concern itself with such matters.
I quite enjoyed listening to them speak English in their own voices even with (or maybe because of) the accent.
The language is really a minor issue for me, because the whole movie itself was pretty poor.
I think they dumbed down the dialog to make it easier on the actors, because it was something I could have written up in the time it took to watch the film.
The jokes failed because the actors could not deliver them naturally.
To it's credit, there was some cool style and cinematography going on, and if the whole movie was like the first 5 minutes, minus Quentin because he's a bad actor, This movie would have been awesome.
I'm not entirely sure I understood the plot of Sukiyaki Western Django, mainly because I couldn't understand the dialogue very well, but I still can say it's unlike anything I have ever seen.
This didn't really disappoint me as much as it does in other movies, because blood isn't really needed in Sukiyaki Western Django.
I think the reason this film is getting so many negative reviews is because people don't get it.
The entire Japanese cast, minus Tarantino, worked because they all spoke English, which just added to the cool-weirdness.
That is the view a lot of people are going to have, and I can't deny people will think that just because I personally disagree with it.
Japanese themes and references are inherent because the director is well...Japanese!
Production, cinematography, scenery, costumes, art direction and sound design aren't even worth mentioning because they're all done so well, you don't notice them.
I saw this movie and it was not a successful one but i liked it because it was O.K.
It was a funny clichÃ© of James Bond and it was extremely funny because of making funny of the established series.
I wasn't expecting much of it since i only went to the theatre to see Alexandra Mutu who was sooo hot, but i was far worse than i had expected it to be.A poor plot, poor characters(except Garcea who makes you laugh a few times only because of the stupidity), crap acting and crap directing.The beginning made me wanna know what the heck i was doing there in the first place, the Skol beer advertising was horrible and the character - director interaction from the movie, which was intended to be fun was just bad taste.The TV show is far better.
However, simply because it's below the expectations is not a ground to consider it automatically the worst.
I saw American movies supposed to be good because of directors, scenarists, actors and/or main characters and they were worse than this Garcea.
Maybe in "Garcea si oltenii" some of the more trivial expressions could be avoided, it's clearly not a movie to view with your kids and some people got a bad impression because of that, but we should keep in mind that the whole idea of this movie is to illustrate and make fun of what really the current way of life and thinking is for far too many RomaniansÂ  It's a satire, not a documentary!
Lot's of horror fans of '70's movies will be disappointed by this also because it isn't really an entertaining one to watch.
It's a real shame because like I mentioned before the story had more than enough potential.
''SPOILERS''  When one of the girls come in and say 'Dinners Ready' with a bunch of plates there is nothing on the plates at all and why does she drop them all just because she can hear what sounds like a flute playing?!
I gave this movie 3/10 because of the clothes.
The scene was good because it wasn't all hair flipping, long kisses, and loss of innocence.
That's because this is a perfectly dreadful film in just about every way--particularly in how the characters were written.
That surprise was because it was shown on Turner Classic Movies--a channel that rarely has nudity but even when it does, there's far less than in this film.
Oddly, the nudity made little sense because the film was set on an island in Britain (and you DON'T want to run around naked there--especially at night--it's just too cold!).
Also oddly because if you DO want a soft-core pornographic movie, you should certainly hire better looking ladies.
They aren't sure if she was the one who murdered the others or if she just panicked and killed the rescuer because of her mental condition following the massacre of her scantily-clad friends.
It only manages a 2 because at least, on rare occasions, it does offer a few decent chills (aside from those experienced by the nudists at the beginning of the film).
Oh, and by the way, this isn't a huge plot problem because they guy was not supposed to be a forensics expert, but at the beginning when the two men discover the massacre, one says to the other "how long have they been dead?".
This film becomes better because it was made on a tighter budget, when the crew had to come up with inventive ways to create atmosphere, menace and a sustained mood.
Surely this movie was made by content bisexuals because both sexes bare enough flesh to make your engine hum.
Third: A research team is sent to the island because one of the boys was murdered with an antique sword only found in southern Europe.
Tower of Evil has become a cult film, probably because it's so bad that in some ways it's perversely good.
If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos.
You'll never, EVER hear mention of such a thing in a Hollywood movie because they assume that the audience is way too stupid to know what a 64 1/2 Mustang is, and they would become confused and disoriented.
One who has to cultivate an outgoing and accessible air because that's how she makes her living, and one who keeps his emotions in and tries wherever possible to stay in the background as part of his.
I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason.
So don't look at this hilarious 5.3 rating,and if you haven't already, go and watch this movie because it really deserves your attention.
I will probably need to rent the movie, because Sci-Fi blurred out the two hottie-boom-bottie zombies together in the bathroom.
It was obvious that these two could not be together at this point in their lives, because they got in each other's way.
The film now seems like a myth to me because it's rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture.
That's a shame because as undeniably nonsense as it is, it's got a great thriller heart to blend in with its romantic core, the good ship Bodyguard may dock at all the formula ports in the genres, but it's one hell of a journey getting to the end, with that song that seemed to top the charts for years {the soundtrack to the movie selling 17 million in America alone}.
I think I only watched this because it was an obscurity.
I know I saw it because I remember the alien folding up into a nothing.
The TV guide described this as " Fast and furious " , well I`d describe this film as diahorrea because it`s fast and furious faeces .
So they carry on with their mission which confused me because if they`re posing as Syrians then that can only mean the action is taking place in Syria or the Lebanon ,neither country being at war so why`s this taking place in the middle of a war zone ?
It gets worse though because one of the team says :  " This jobs easier than that twenty buck hoe I had in Las Vegas "  Yup there`s nothing more endearing to an audience than knowing one of the heroes has to pay for sex .
I won`t finish on the old cliche that I wasted ninety minutes of my life on this crap because I only wasted thirty minutes of my life on it as I turned it off when the guy got blown out of the window
this is my favorite episode of star trek simply because it a side story with Spock and Scotty on the enterprise and Kirk, McCoy and Sulu.
over all it is a must see for any star trek fan and if you haven't seen or heard of star trek check your pulse because you have been dead for 40 years.
My main problem with this episode is how annoying Spock is because he's my favorite character in this series.
Many hold that Fawlty Towers was so special partly because it appeared just 12 times, and that multiple seasons of the Torqay sitcom would have diluted its appeal.
The newer episodes are good, but it's not the same without those lovable characters, because Peter Sallis I think is the only one of them still alive, and over the years is subdued to cameo appearances.
After a while, you don't really care if Banderas' character is going to die or not because his character has lost all the respect you had of it; and you don't care about Jolie's character anymore either because of what she's tried to do in the film.
Therefore, when the only thing that remains in both these characters is the love for each other, and when they have left their jobs, friends, integrity, and should I say, mental sanity (because they become guilty of murder) to stay with each other, you can pretty much guess that from there the movie can become vulgar and raw.
some of you said that you wanted to watch it because of angelina jolie and antonio banderas as headliners.
You are going to save 1000 dollars on the car because of it.
The only reason I gave this movie four stars out of ten is because of the attempt by the actors and the very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie that really pushes the R rating.
There are a few twists and surprises you might not see coming but then again you might expect it because I for one did.
It was not because the actors sometimes could not be convincing enough.
It was not because the actors sometimes could not be convincing enough.
In fact, having seen the Tomb Rider recently, and bearing in mind Girl interrupted, because of Jolie alone I had some mild expectations going to see this summer afternoon time killer.
A female beauty is really not a matter for discussion because everyone has his/her own taste, but I can't sway away the feeling that there is a way too much hype about Jolie's physical appearance than can be justified.
But that absolutely doesn't matter, because it may just as well have been the con artist who answered the man's marriage ad as any other woman.
Unfortunately I saw this marvelous film on TV last night-unfortunate because it was on the small TV screen and not a large movie screen.
Any viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released.
I rented the unrated version because of - I admit it - the sex scene.
because they sure didn't act like it.
Vargas, who at the start of the film is marrying for convenience alone, because of his business, finds himself emotionally capsized by the sumptuous Julia Russell, played to the hilt by the fulsome-lipped Angelina Jolie.
Moreover, the characters are introduced as stock archetypes and are mostly undeveloped; Don Andres the cruel capitalist, Meche the unassuming maid, Paloma the adulterous wife (Katy Juardo, in a performance that, looking back, boarders on misogynist in its hypocritical implications of female sexual aggression), and of course, Pedro, the beast turned from his wicked ways because of a good (looking?)
It is not a simple, beast-man changes his ways and saves the day story, because Pedro's motivation for change seems to be attraction to Meche, not benevolence towards the lowly tenants.
All I can say is brush up on your English Ms. Valette, because Hollywood is going to be pounding down your door any second now.
Her mother is a widow that left Tunisia; her sister Mathilde (Elsa Zylberstein) is having troubles in her marriage because she repressed her sexual desire based on her misunderstandings of the principles of her religion.
Every dialog rings true, and the superstitious mother, who initially comes across as a domineering harpy, is revealed as a woman of depth and dignity : not because she evolves or "sees the light", but just because we get to know her better.
I'd really like to see what they could do with a real budget and hopefully they've gotten one by now because these folks have a shot at doing something great in horror if they're given the chance.
My advice to all of you that are reading this review after reading all others is to watch the movie, because i loved it, Antonia and Vivek are going places and after this movie you'll know it  It's just plain beautiful, just them looking into each other's eyes is sexy, just the kind of feeling you need in a love story, follow Kisna as he goes in the paths of 'Dharma' and 'Karma'....Though if one thing has failed in this movie it was the late Amresh Puri, his last film was no big phenom acting wise, but Kisna is a film to remember, and hey i didn't even think about falling asleep during the 3 hours it was on, or the songs, it is unforgettable, if you got a girl......take her to see Kisna, i think she'll love you for it ;)!
I remember when I watched this with my sisters, the oldest said to me that Hindustan people aren't gonna like it because the hero is falling in love with a British (white) girl.
As per her lack of conversations with Kisna, well maybe that was due to the fact that she couldn't because she had devoted herself to worshiping Krishna and he was always a warrior in training.
He didn't love her but had to obey his parents when they said "marry her", because of tradition.
But you couldn't because the majority of the film was being told from Rose's (the heroine) perspective.
He seems to be very proud of that fact because its there in BIG letters in the film...perhaps he should concentrate on just one thing and leave the others to professionals.
She can't act and the only reason it seems she's in this movie is because she can dance on a rope.
Rather I think the only people who can give 10/10 are Subhash Ghai, Vivek Oberoi, and the remaining cast of the movie, purely because they were in it.
this movie is fantastic, the story, the songs, the acting its something never seen before and really well portrayed i don't want to give away the story but it is a good portrayal of the obstacles and difficult decisions faced by a traditional villager hoping to uphold justice for a foreign woman - its a magnificent portrayal of morals' victory over backward thinking i really recommend the movie because of the excellent acting by the male lead and the great support from the English lady leader.
its not like Ur old style Indian movie where the British were shown equal to a devil like ruler, but the understanding was there why the villagers didn't like their presence their yet some liked them because of their work - the frictions between members from both sides who are able to accept the other side is also well shown
The rest of the cast were so so, because the story and the movie were so so.
The plot is quite simple, Daniel Day Lewis can't be with the adulterous slut)Michelle Phfeffer or however you spell her name) because he is engaged with Winona Ryder.
For some reason when they parachute from the Hercules in the beginning and hit water it changes from day to night in under 30 seconds and some how they have rubber dingies with huge boat engines that someone had to have had in they're pocket and blew up, because is isn't visible that anyone had any packages when the dove out from the plane.
The icing on this crap-fest is the highly intense bus chase, because there is nothing more exiting than two buses driving in circles.
I really liked this movie because it was so rich in every aspect: from the acting, to the setting and the costumes, the cinematography and the score, everything was beautifully crafted.
His technique forces us to really watch the story, to look for details, overt and covert, since like the opening montage of roses in bloom at the beginning of the credits, this is a movie of deep contemplation -- not because of the lush images, but because of the subtle game of tradition which is being played behind the curtains, just out of the camera's view.
In a way I am disappointed after reading the comments because I thought I was alone in adoring this ravishing and masterful film, and I thought I would get to be the sole voice in the wind proudly proclaiming its brilliance.
I think the film may have been ignored at its release because of the slew of other "period pieces" which were so popular (an eventually common) in the late 80's/early 90's...
Perhaps, they did not show it in many American theaters because they were afraid that westerners might not be able to appreciate the movie.
This movie has terrible everything: The dialog is corny and clichÃ©', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team).
Serial Mom worked because we knew what we were getting into when the film was released, but since there was no real clue in the promos, it was baffling - and I love that.
I enjoy a good suspense but usually am freaked because they are too graphic or beyond belief...I found this story realistic and scary enough to put me on the edge of my seat without going beyond my scope of endurance.
While I have of course heard the name Mizoguchi Kenji, the only films of his that I have watched are Ugetsu (1953) and The New Tale of the Heike (1955) and while I did enjoy both of them, mainly the former, for the most part I did not have a particularly strong interest in watching Mizoguchi's films because at the time I was embroiled within the filmic worlds of Kitano Takeshi, Iwai Shunji, Miike Takashi, etc.
Mizoguchi is well known in the world of Japanese film, because he was one of the first Japanese directors to put the role of women in Japanese society on the center stage.
He is often criticized by later film viewers and critics because his women, while strong, only could find true security in the world of men by adaptation to the males around them.
She states that she only does so because she owes him for helping her become a full fledged geisha, but it is obvious that she loves the destitute ma.
Omocha, young, better educated, and brash dislikes Furusawa because he is sponging off Umekichi and decides that she needs to be rid of him.
I won't hide this was a huge surprise for me because it is the first pre-WWII Japanese movie I ever lay eyes on.
The older sister is loyal to a man who supported her in her youth, a shopkeeper who is now broke and helps him on account of loyalty not because there was something in it for her.
They are unable to change their situation not because of personal fault but because the tension between old and new, between the traditional Jpan and the emerging industrial Jpana is not something they can control.
The younger sisters opposition and departure from her sister is in the end pointless because she tries to fight the war of a whole culture trying to adapt in a new world.
I gave this film a 3 only because of Bela Lugosi.
Now while this is all super silly and bizarre, the film is even worse than you'd expect because the actors playing the morons are, in fact, real morons--in the form of the "comedy" team of Mitchell and Petrillo.
That's where the superlatives end however, though as other reviewers have pointed out, this one merits viewing just because it's so goofy and entertaining.
There's nothing here to be taken seriously at all, and Bela Lugosi must have known that too because he spends a good deal of time smiling broadly in the movie.
Okay, if you can look past the fact that the "comedy team" (a term used very loosely here)is just a rip off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and the fact that Lugosi is only here because he was taking any and every role he was offered at this point, it's actually almost funny on it's own, even though most of the time I laughed at the parts that weren't supposed to be funny, and groaned at the parts that were trying to be funny, but were ultimately just embarrassing.
The characters run around like idiots for awhile, and the movie ends with a great, disappointing cop-out, presumably because the filmmakers couldn't figure out a better way to end it.
It is worth seeing just to see how they copied Martin & Lewis and because of the wonderful Bela Legosi.
I'm familiar with this old song because I found it at the archive dismuke.org last year, recorded by Al Lentz's Dance Orchestra.
One out of ten, because I can't go lower.
The sad thing I believe was that Bela probably took the part because he was going to be billed in the title of the film, the way his rival Boris Karloff was billed in Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff.
And praise be that Zalman King has left the acting business for directing because I would rather watch his erotic flicks than sit through another painful Jerry performance.
King gets the blame for several of the murders because he is trying to find out who has taken the blue sunshine, arriving just before the homicidal effects kick in.
I suppose the main reason why I'm not Jeff Lieberman's biggest fan is because his films often lack bite and don't move swiftly enough.
In fact, I had to buy the DVD in order to see it because no video store carried it.
I didn't mind spending the $12 to buy it used because I collect off the wall movies.
For a low-budget production is stands up remarkably well and it's rather sad it's gone by with little impact, because Lieberman shows impressive talent here.
The thick 70's vibe takes real control, but the cheesiness doesn't overshadow it, with a scene occurring in a groovy disco when a bald guy goes out of control because of the music.
Otherwise, I love the film for the French language and story line in Paris because I love French, France, and Paris!
Watched it late night only because of the excellent James C. The most striking thing is when ever there is a violent scene, the director choose to fade out and loose all natural sound and simply play a simple but striking piece of piano.
Particularly, because Salman tried hard to acts funny, but he wasn't able to make quite an impression.There are just too many co-incidental events which makes the film illogical.
Raj is not given a chance to explain but then he realizes that this is the opportunity he's been waiting for because her family was very rich.
She falls for him but doesn't do anything because she thinks that Raj is Pooja's husband.
You PROBABLY THINK THAT I'M always saying good stuff about all the films i comment on because the truth is I don't really have anything bad to say about these films because their just so good.In the film Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherji are like sisters and they both like Salman Khan but Salman Khan likes Preity Zinta.
After patiently waiting a year and a half for the corrected DVD release of DOTR, I was excited to buy it because I heard a better DVD was coming out.
I gave it a 4 rating, because the reason you buy a concert DVD is for the concert, and that is what I would rate the first disc.
And when I mean "sprung up" I mean "sprung up" because zombies appear almost out of thin air - in the church, in the video store and in a living room (where one zombie comes right through the door without any of the five people in the house seeing it and one zombie comes up from the basement where one man had said was empty not five seconds before).
I used to stay up to watch it, although my parents set a 10:00 bedtime for me because I had to catch a 6:30 bus to school each morning.
The mornings were tough, but I was always sure to get up without having to be told because I didn't want my parents asking why I was so tired.
The filming was very interesting because it was done on location in small town Alabama.
If no other reason, than this show is great because it featured a clip of Doctor Who, and played Metallica.
I would probably watch this show if it were real... because it's pretty funny.
You have Jack Ausin (Jack Black), a NASA astronaut, who become supersmart in sunlight, because he came to near the sun during a NASA mission.
This has a rather ambiguous ending though, but other than that it's pretty damn funny and while my review may not necessarily reflect that, that's because it's more one of those movies you have to really see to appreciate.
Always looking to be king of the hill in the match business Kroll went as far and having the socially minded and somewhat naive chemist Christian Hobe committed into a mental institution because he invented a match that was self sustaining and would never burn out.
It shows that products are successful only because they have a limited life.
I hope it is brought back because there is super potential in this show.
I think people didn't really like that show because they kept hoping that it would be the same characters of "That 70's Show".
His girlfriend (Mala Powers) at first feels there is no place for her in his life because of his mother.
I would definitely recommend this movie not because it's perfect or wonderful, but because it's funny and has some new zombie moments in it.
He's also a one-note actor, like Bernie Mac in a way because his acting range also consists solely of gulps and looks of surprise in response to stupid, artificial situations.
But Meet the Parents was funny because it had a lot of funny jokes and situations, and it honored its premise.
The reason I said that is because she couldn't handle Kevin being engaged to Charlie.
I'm kinda a romantic and like the fantasy chick flicks, but this one is probably one of my favorites because the relationships and situations are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in-laws.
Yes, the jokes weren't necessary but they were part of the script and movie, and I think no one should have gotten offended because it was just a movie.
He knows it well because, he, himself, is from Uruguay and has found a home in Buenos Aires.
"Bolivia" is a small film, but it holds our attention because of what director Adrian Caetano has done with the story about human beings that roam the globe in search of a meager salary, for them and their families, only to get the scorn from the people that benefit from their labor.
Jen's professional life is going well, but she is depressed because her two older sons are gay, and she believes her youngest son may be gay as well.
It certainly deserved this prestigious honour because this dramatic comedy has a solid story, good performances, beautiful scenery and amazing music.
I was glad he didn't use JUST 70's movies because there was a great piece of music that opened and closed the movie.
I am usually bored by coming of age movies, but this had a lot of surprises, and I think it was because the director was really feeling with his characters.
I miss this show a lot and wished that NBC Network never altered the programming because I think it really ruined the station.
Some of the things she makes are not very practical, but that's OK. My sisters and I joke about what the perfect meal would be from her, and we always argue because there are so many to choose from!
When he gets sacked by the horrible hypocritical Monseigneur, we want to cheer because he is free of the crap and now has time to take more interest in - which twin is it?
That's really the whole story, but my point in watching it is because the sex scenes are not bad at all.
I gave this film a 10, not because it stands up to Citizen Kane, The Godfather or Mulholland Drive, but because for this genre (soft core porn/erotica) it's the best.
This sexual encounter could have been a rape also, but because she is not afraid, there is no rape, just a consensual act that she derives great pleasure from.
The marketing was more exciting than today because you could easily determine what was 'forbidden', you picked up on and couldn't wait to be old enough to see these films for yourself.
There are ones I remember so vividly because they were done SO well such as "Midnight Cowboy", "M*A*S*H", "The Lords of Flatbush", "Myra Breckenridge", "The Exorcist", "Jaws"...and yes even: "Deep Throat", "The Story of O", and "Emmanuelle"!
People masturbate for many reasons, some people masturbate a lot because it is the best they know of to the truly transcendent moment from which we come and to which we go.
The human soul is sadly unattended to in our contemporary culture because of the moral bankruptcy of the conventional religious institutions.
You gain sympathy for certain characters and you realize the reason none of the adults act like adults is because...well..they have real problems.
While the book addresses homosexuality, it only looks at the lesbian side of things because in the book Loulou is a woman.
On the DVD there is an interview with this seemingly untalented artist in which he says that he used that selection of music because the mother and son could only be happy when they were together, but this makes no sense given the plot and ultimate outcome.
Rahul wants to become successful because he wants to make his mother happy, and it is evidenced in many sequences through the film.
especially if you like john Ford's movies, because this film was so beneath him that i suspect he was brain damaged by alcohol during the shoot.
The script is ace because its written by Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Total Recall), and the director knows exactly what he's doing.
The story is interesting and has a sense of paranoia, because you never know who is a Screamer (a killer robot), and who isn't.
It starts when a priest(Henry Fonda) attempting to flee from a Centroamerican country, because Christianity being pursued by a totalitarian govern.
When Herbert J. Yates of Republic Pictures made a deal with John Ford to produce The Quiet Man he first made Ford agree to do one of his cavalry epics with John Wayne because he wanted a surefire moneymaker before taking a chance on The Quiet Man.
The Fugitive is based on a Graham Greene novel The Power and the Glory and it is about a priest in an unnamed South American country who is a fugitive because of his calling.
It was not the type of movie I would usually go see but I went because it was adapted by P.T.
Anderson (still think he was robbed) and because I always enjoy seeing J. Statham beat up on people-heh.
I gave it a 10 because of the enjoyment factor.
It is a future time and prisons are now run by private companies for profit because the economy went to hell.
Her acting abilities surprised me because at first glance she seemed like she was just going to be "eye candy".
The ending also surprised me because it was--shall we say, "impersonal".
You can see why the for-profit prison puts on these races, because I calculated that they would make a tremendous profit of $12.5 billion for 3 pay-per-view races.
I watched this title because it was a spur of the moment kind of thing.
Watching those shiny little cars race down the racetrack at full speed sure is exciting, and is an edge-of-the-seat pastime activity, because it sure gets your adrenaline going.And it's also nice to see every single tiny space of the seating capacity packed 'till there's no seats for more people is nice, because it's interesting to see how many people would have spent hard earned cash to see this big event.
Having wanted to see it since the trailer showed with Wanted, I was excited when I walked into the theater to see it because it looked fun and cool.
It felt like it was only 40 minutes to me really, but otherwise that must be a good sign, because it's a fast paced thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
Regardless of the politically-correct finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes, this was a fun film to watch simply because it entertained.
I just saw this film last night at a premier in Portland Oregon.Im not gonna give away any of the story because there isn't much of one which is fine in this case.
I went into this film expecting it to be disaster,and i say this only because I'm anonymous... it was good.
I don't know why, but we just need action movies like that and one of the things that I did enjoy about this was that it reminded me of those old grind house films that have quick editing and fast paced stories that are just awesome stories to watch because of the stunts.
If there is a plot to this picture it went over my head and apparently others as well because some of the audience walked out during the picture.
Robert Peel formed a Tory government, but it only lasted for a few months because Parliament by now had firm control of the Treasury.
I know Lepage a bit because of works he did in theater (and the fact that he usually does plays is pretty obvious in the way the film is made, if you pay attention, specially the way he uses the background in many scenes).
If you forget about "authenticity" and whether or not the bullet left the body at the right angle or that no-one can shoot straight because they've forgotten their training and just panicked and started shooting wildly or that someone needed longer arms than are humanly possible or whatever and just had a look at the story, you'll find a good movie.
The hot young cop who owns the nickname Cowboy (because, you know, they want to be original) looks about 40.
Sadly, IMDb does not allow me to rate it lower than a 1/10, because LAPD does not deserve even a tenth of that point.
Only one friend remains standing at the end of this film and his remark to himself is that HE TOO WILL START OVER because after all there is always hope.
YET Fukusaku also shows us that YOUTH by it's very nature is NOT a time to RAGE (most likely because of how simple it is for disaster to strike) BUT a time for introspection, a time to TRY and challenge oneself--- to be something one may not believe one can be.
This movie fits right in; yet still stands out because of the originality, at least in the west, of its story.
Thai are a very proud people and this shows in their film making- they make a few nods to American movie making but the script continually resounds with a centrism on the Thai, probably because the story is in Thailand :-).
That's probably good because you really don't want to be wasting time fumbling around with matches when you are single handedly taking out a large group of cattle rustlers.
I thought he was only mute because of the traumas he had experienced.
Madonna is successful because she "re-invents" herself, we tell ourselves, but is a DREADFUL actress......well, maybe "Evita".
The ending scene was surprising to me, because I suspected that OTHER justice-dept guy......
When a judge commits suicide and his secretary is found murdered in a river, a homeless and deaf-mute man, named Carl Anderson, is arrested for her murder, because all indirect evidence points to him.
The scenes where Pat and Bill attend a Santa Barbara fiesta are almost painful to watch, not because of what is said, but because of what isn't.
I don't even think it's tragic because the filming of their lives perhaps accelerated certain unpleasant events, leaving Lance to decry later, "Television ate my family."
I hate watching news, and these days no amount of disasters, riots or war stories affect me, because I simple don't feel like watching them anymore.
Fortunately, the hype was well-deserved because this is indeed an excellent movie.
this journey of hers took all of ten days from the time she worked for an old man (that dies because of this kindness),was "recruited" (forcibly ) into the talibans training camp for boys (10 yrs up, if not younger)where they teach you the qua ran's rituals such as how you wash your genitals in three different direction, (and allah help you if you didn't preform each ritual in the exact order and way in which they dictated1), to the time she is discovered.
However, I would recommend it simply because it is as good a method as any to educate the world on Islam and its treatment of women.
I added the "according to the film" reference because this film doesn't try to convey it's hatred to this regime and although I'm hardly a Taliban devotee, I am skeptic enough to know that film can depict anyone they want anyway they choose (just the other day there was a story on 60 minutes that showed how North Korean kids are brainwashed to believe that George W Bush is the 21st century's Hitler ) so one must approach this film under a very critical point of view.
In the film, however, the quote (in Arabic letters) refers to Doctor Shariati who was the ideologue of the Iranian cue (I didn't get the chance to read the actual quote because my Arabic is a little rusty).
The story focuses on a young girl living in an all female family, and since they live in an area ruled by the Taliban, they are not allowed to leave the house, because women walking around unaccompanied by a male are promptly arrested and subjected to inhuman punishments.
Maybe because the cast are not actors and it starts with a boy talking to the camera as if it's a documentary being made it feels like what unfolds is actually happening and this makes it a very real and chilling experience.
And it's all because the various Powers (Eleni's soliloquy of "guards" in different colored uniforms) didn't allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, i.e., the Movement, the Cause).
This film was written by him, longtime Fellini collaborator Tonino Guerra, Petros Markaris, and Giorgio Silvagni, and even though- like the other films of his I've seen, this one is spare in dialogue, the story coheres because of the way the scenes are written to allow the actors' expressions convey what words need not.
There was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion playing, that brought tears to my eyes, just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today.
All these allusions to Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Homer are only here because they make the poet Angelopoulos dream.
The film: Greece roughly between 1920 and 1950 (but it is so current and contemporary because it deals with global, recurring themes).
I've stopped two movies because they were so awful.
Perhaps it's because I'm a 'lower-class Midwesterner' and not from the GLORIOUS city of New York...gah.
But 'Metropolitan' is actually quite delightful, in fact because of the very quality of the dialogue - the characters are elegant show-offs, which gives the writer the freedom to indulge them with clever lines.
One funny segment shows the big hurdles that the characters Tom and Charley have to overcome when they try to drive from Manhattan to Long Island--most of us wouldn't have as much trouble, but because of Tom and Charley's privileged background they don't have an easy time of it.
"Metropolitan" isn't as polished as Stillman's other two excellent movies, "Barcelona" and "The Last Days of Disco," but its my favorite of the three because of its characters.
The truth of Townsend is immediately obvious to members of an upscale social set that call themselves the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, but they take him in anyway because he knows their world and seems like a good audience.
"This is probably the last Deb season..." one of them observes resignedly, "...because of the stock market, the economy, Everything..." Yes, everything...the huge smothering subject that hovers all around the plot itself and from which its characters are only temporarily insulated.
He is truly a Hollywood radical because he argues for good old fashioned virtues in his movies like friendship and chastity.
I'm not so sure my only finding Metropolitan was such bad luck: It's a fantastic film and, because I've watched it four times since Thursday, I probably would have had to return Last Days of Disco or Barcelona to the video store before watching them anyway.
The film is compelling not because of a riveting story, special effects, or manufactured suspense, but because of sharply written characters whose personalities drive the story, rather than vice versa, extensive knowledge of its subject, and beautifully written dialogue.
The dialogue, by the way, is great not only for its intelligence and wit, but also because it instantly identifies a proudly unique writer.
We can tell Mamet, because of his fractured phrases and rhythmic line readings.
We know Smith because of his rapid-fire, fiery and profane writing, as well as his sensitivity.
Tarantino is recognizable because of his pop-culture references.
MGM used to be known as "retake valley" between the 20s' and the 30s' because the studio used to res-hot and/or reedit their films until they were good enough in order to turn out a profit.
The film probably flopped in 1926 simply because they probably did not change it at all.
Later, when the company goes to the town where Jack was from, he hides because he doesn't want to get caught.
TCM said that it was because movie making lacked the audience interaction she so much loved.
As a kid, I hated this movie because it trashed my favorite slasher characters, Freddy and Jason.
Well...at least not intended humor, because the stupidity and incompetence definitely will make you chuckle more than once!
Which is a shame, because it deserves an airing from time to time.
Unfortunate, because the score, though minor Goldsmith, does have merit.
While Santiago stayed basically a good guy, most of his former colleagues have turned to crime because the atmosphere they found once out of fighting the war with Ecuador.
I don't know much about the actor who portrays Santiago (whether is very brilliant or brilliantly typecast) because I have not seen him in anything else.
However, the films are incomparable, because the style and substance are very different.
Historically, I'm not sure if it would have gone down that way, but Annie admitting she didn't have the heart to beat Toby Walker in the shooting contest because he was 'just too pretty', was a neat way to set up the rest of the story.
While I am a history teacher and my friends and family HATE watching historical films with me because I often find fault with the way movies often handle the facts in a fast and loose manner, I still managed to like this film and kept my mouth shut about its many inaccuracies!
Part of this is because when I watched the film I didn't know that much about Annie Oakley and another was because I was having too much fun to complain.
Despite this, I still am not complaining because I liked the film so much plus Miss Oakley is a rather mythic figure already and little impact on history (though she did a lot for women's rights--at least indirectly).
The theme of society verses love is an old one but always fascinating because it is a true choice.
Be warned it is six hours long, but well worth it.All in all a great movie and anyone who loves a good romance, treachery, or murder mystery should see it because it blends all three.
Virginie Ledoyen was chosen because she is absolutely gorgeous, not because of her acting talent.
I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good "soft" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).
I didn't even want to give this title a 1 because it just really sucked.
The only reason I even rented this was because Bill Murray was in it and honestly I want the 2 hours of my life back.
Everyone will hate Sal, which means she's a good actress, because you're supposed to hate her.
The only reason I am even wasting my time to write a review is because someone needs to counter the endless stream of 9s and 10s on this sight.
He can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment, but because this might result in the community's existence being revealed to outsiders, Sal refuses to permit this and Christo is left to die.
In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie "the beach", mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role.
I didn't want to watch 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews, but when I accidentally came across it while surfing through the channels, I couldn't stop watching.
There is no ending because their lives didn't end.
I found her intriguing, and not just because of her face Actually, all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.
This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself, because he wants to forget his past.
Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters.
He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating.
That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch.
The film looks like an old documentary you'd watch in elementary school because the teacher was feeling lazy.
I am a wrestling fan and it's the reason why I love so much Smackdown and dislike RAW since 2002 because all the entertaining, wrestling and interesting story lines are.
Nearly every time he would say "one more", we would watch 4 more hours because the cliffhangers were so good, he couldn't stop after any given hour.
On very rare occasions, part of the storyline seems a little thin, but those moments are so few and far between that you can and must overlook them because you want to see how it's going to end.
My parents had rented this show because they heard it was good, and there was nothing on T.V., so I decided to watch it with them.
I stopped watching it because Tuesday nights became bad for me, but later on in the season I saw the episode when Bauer and Palmer finally met.
This show is the best on television because the writing is impeccable as well as the acting and the music.
I'm impatiently waiting for the next season because this show is truly one in a million.
I never thought I would ever say this but I hope "24" doesn't stay on the air for a long time because the power of the show comes from its innovative 24 episode arc: a day in the life of agent Jack Bauer.
- what the hell is that all about i think that they should bring this series to a hasty conclusion because its done its time now!
I've given the show a low rating because it too often misses the target, like a lot of the bad guys.
Throughout its four seasons, 24 provides a cliff hanger at the end of most episodes to keep you attached and has provided some of the most unpredictable twists that I have ever seen, including the ultimate shocker at the end of the first season (which I won't go into because somebody may read this before watching the first season).
I would strongly recommend that if you do not already watch 24, start now because you're really missing out.
It would be one thing if the show demonstrated the horror of such tactics, but these methods are glorified because it's Jack Bauer who does them.
It also seems like the writers tend to resurrect one-shot characters from previous seasons just because they want another familiar face to show up in the new season.
The show should be renamed "2.5", because that's about the total of viable screen time that was stretched out into this daylong abomination.
Not for any plot reason, but because Leslie Hope couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.
I bought it on the big DVD pack with the complete first season, because it isn't available in German television right now.
Anyway, I love it because it's not only the concept which makes it thrilling, even without that real-time style it would be extremely exciting and suspenseful.
The show always uses multiple split screen camera shots and this is innovative work because it helps to make the show seem realistic and also in real time.
not because Orson Welles directed, and co-starred.
Caruso is great fun, notably because of his caricatured acting (though he plays exactly what he is supposed to play, and he does it very well - his lines are so stupid... poor actor), but such obvious manipulation in filming is off-putting.
People call this "movie" literary, because of (the great great) K. Blixen - I. Dinesen.
I suppose the French TV company who commissioned this film was able to afford his services too because the cast was so small: apart from those mentioned above, there are only a few Caucasian listeners in Rey's audience, and half-a-dozen silent Chinese menials who would have cost little to hire.
Maybe he didn't because he was a perfectionist, even though the character portrayed is not a native French speaker   There are just two further points I should like to make that nobody else has touched on thus far:  First, the story for the script is from the pen of Danish raconteuse Karen Blixen, magnificently portrayed by Meryl Streep in "Out of Africa", who, Sheherezade-like, beguiled her lover and his friend with her fluent and fascinating tales.
The colour palette Stone uses is also incredible (especially the green tone for certain emotional charged scenes, because green represents something in the movie ... when you watch it you will figure it out), but he was also experimenting a lot with this film.
Natural Born Killers is a very violent and controversial film.The two Columbine school shooters were said to have have watched this film over and over again.Its a very violent film and not recommended for children who cannot handle this type of material.I am 15 now and I saw this film when I was 13.It didn't affect me in any way.I play plenty of violent video games and watch violent movies and they don't make me want to kill anybody.This is because I can separate fantasy from reality.Anyway that was my rant...now on to the film review.Natural Born Killers is an underrated and excellent movie.Im surprised its only 6.8, I think it should be in IMDb's Top 250.The performances in this film are great.Woody Harleson the actor who played Mickey Knox ironically had a father who was a hit-man.Anyway the story is great as it shows how the media portrays murderers.The film basically shows the life of Mickey and Malloryy knox.In a comedic "I Love Lucy" spoof, you see Mallory's life at home with her abusive father.Mickey is a butcher who delivers meat and delivers it one day to Mallory's home.The two both led disturbing lives and basically they kill Mallory's family and start going on killing spree's.After a while, they get caught and go to prison while a reporter wants to do an interview with Mickey.A prison riot breaks out and basically they are set free.A cool aspect about this film is sometimes during the violent scenes of the film, you see some trippy images.Natural Born Killers is a great film worth watching for anyone who can handle it.
I think it is a violent movie and if there is any controversy with this movie it was invented by the media because it makes them look really bad.
The audience is supposed to laugh at the fact that there is a German, a Brazillian and an Indian on Steve Zissou's crew, simply because these people are not Americans.
Some refused to show it because of it's violence.
I'm gonna watch it again because it is a little confusing, but never the less a good and recommendable movie!
The violence (and the whole film) is completely over the top because that is what Stone is telling us; "We have gone too far."
Based on a script by Quentin Tarantino, the film follows two young lovers, Mickey and Mallory (Woody Harrelson and Julliette Lewis) as they travel across America killing because it's what they want to do.
Of course, this is also where the film makes itself vulnerable to attack because anybody who goes out and murders somebody, and happens to have a copy of the DVD, can be said to have been "warped" by the films 'pro-violence' message.
Instead, Mickey and Mallory escape from prison and are last seen walking into the sunset, so therefore Stone must like killers because he lets them live.
Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they're trendy, dude?
The film's "message" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results.
The reason I bring this up again, after so many years, and so many more violent films later, is because Entertainment Weekly has published a list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies of All Time and Natural Born Killers is ranked as #8.
So because Natural Born Killers did not have a perfect righteous ending with a "good guy" shaking his finger and telling you that this was unacceptable and having the bad guy repent their crime, some people took this as homage to serial killers.
Secondly, Natural Born Killers shouldn't have inspired this much controversy because, while it often exaggerates to get its message across, it is realistic to the coreÂand why should realism be labeled controversial?
Having media glorify violence is even more so, because that is what is happening.
Yet, somehow, it was still funny because it was so close to the average sitcom.
These two are only killing because it's what they grew up with.
That's why teeny-bopper movies are all pointless and stupid: because the audience has already seen the same actor(s) do the same performances.
When I first saw Natural Born Killers, I thought there was something wrong with the movie because of the editing.
I remember "Natural Born Killers" making a huge fuss when it was released because the media and conservative families were in an outrage over the level of "glorified violence" in the film.
Stone's film-making has gone somewhat awry over the years (look at the pointless excess of his films after this), but this fits the bill because it IS a story of excess.
This is troubling, because while the film works hard to analyze the dubious process by which violent killers are turned into romantic heroes in the mass media, NBK seems unable to escape from the same orbit, ending with the killers as living happily ever after, justified by the brutality of their backgrounds, and morally superior to the prison officials and popular journalists who pursue them.
This is a tragedy because "Natural Born Killers" really is a sharp and funny satire that helped to usher in the 90s with Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction".
It also asks the question - 'Is that guy on television crazy because he's killed 90+ people or am I crazy for watching a white bronco cruise through the streets of Los Angeles?'.
The critics despise this film because what they see on the film is themselves in Wayne Gale.
Another reason why the critics hate this film is because of the subversive message that it portrays in the script.
'Natural Born Killers' subversively explains this, that THEY are the problem, and many members of the mainstream media didn't like because they were what the film was about.
Personally I think most people don't get this movie (and hence rate it lower than they should) is because the endings are not pat like most Hollywood shows.
I'm not even sure why, I think it was because he was cool and laid back.
I'm not even sure why, I think it was because he was cool and laid back.
I didn't list "The Red Shoes" simply because I was of a mixed mind about it.
I didn't like the sketch because it was poorly done...I didn't like the sketch because it deals with a subject matter you can quite easily relate with on a grotesque level.
If you like this kind of movie, you should rent a real porn, just like last poster said  give 1 vote just because no zero.
This is because the director showed his obvious carelessness and sloppiness by not attaching logic to actions which are clear in the book.
Half a dozen ordinary-looking people slosh around in a tub pouring wine over one another and laughing giddily because the director told them to act as if they were having the grandfather of all good times.
It deserves dismissal, true, but only because it lacks any substance.
In the mid-seventies a relative gave me a big stack of old Evergreen Review magazines, and I started an interest in more counter-culture things from the '60s because of that, since I was just a child when much of it took place.
That might have been better actually, because instead we then mainly get characters meandering around Paris and Luxembourg, laughing a lot and wondering why they are never satisfied.
--Hoping there would be a resolve to the story, instead after a naked woman can't have sex with them because she was crying over the memory of her late husband, the others just sit there naked and laugh while the camera zooms in on their genitals.
It's just that I think some people will find any reason to say it's poetic mainly because Henry Miller is involved -- if this were not based on him and just a film of its own, I doubt as many folks would be worshiping it.
I loved Bill Murray in Scrooged, Ghost Busters, Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, & The Man Who Knew too Much; but I wonder if his latest films are bad because he's feeling old?
I hope not because I think he has a lot more energy than he's showing on the screen, so he should stop taking boring parts.
In a way it would have been better if this film was terribly made, because then nobody would pay attention to its horrible message.
However, despite the talent that went into the production, I cannot give the movie a higher score, because of its intolerable message.
Joe kills his mother because she throws away his necklace of Mary, and because the priest tells him his mother is the devil.
I hope that others will not be turned away because some have said it was not executed right.
and great hope If you haven't seen it, or been avoiding it because of the subject matter, I completely understand.
It's a shame that this film at this time has an IMDB "rating" of only 5 or so, because 31 of the 44 votes cast have been "10"s, including mine.
I rented it, because it was a freebie... but I should have known better, because anything that Maverick puts out is gonna be some garbage..!!
I think I could have made a better film because it look like they were acting like actors instead of getting into their role.
I recommend seeing it even if your friends say that its bad, i only rented it in the first place because it was all they had at Video Connection one lonely Friday night and i needed something to watch, and all of my friends, none of whom know what their talking about, trashed it never the less i found it beautiful, hilarious, and over-all an absolutely stunning work of art by Mr. Wes Anderson... also, if you saw it and liked it, you should check out the Royal Tenenbaums, also directed by Anderson, it is almost as good as the Life Aquatic.
Alfredo is shocked because since he is not participating, Carmen will have to perform with the leading man!
Candela PeÃ±a makes a good suffering Carmen who is lured into the scheme because of necessity.
A believable film about two people who are attracted to each other and because both spouses are gone- follow their hearts- though they are breaking vows.
Iron Jawed Angels is an exceptional film because it tells an important story in a fresh, engaging way.
If nothing else, watch it because it's entertaining and will make you feel good.
Our country should not ignore its problems (past or present) simply because it makes us uncomfortable-- the movie is a lovely parallel for our times and this administration.
I firmly believe the only reason men would not appreciate this film is because they do not want to recognize their gender's disgusting role in subjugating women (As seen in other reviews).
I think this movie is important because it shows the women of today how hard their ancestors fought to secure us a luxury that so few practice today and how important it is.
It's almost impossible to imagine that less than 100 years ago, our country's government did not allow its female citizens to vote, and what's sadder is, the men in charge at that time would NOT have amended the Constitution to include women if it hadn't been for relentlessly driven, fiercely intelligent and humblingly courageous people like Alice Paul, who was depicted in this show as being deeply conflicted about how far she knew she would have to go to push the envelope, but she did it anyway because it simply had to be done.
He gives us those long pauses and obscure references that will either force you to think or create frustration because you do not understand his meaning.
I sincerely hope this film receives a properly legit and worldwide DVD-release soon, because avid fans of the genre are guaranteed to get a kick out of it.
Sonic Adventure 2 is a game that will last, not only because of the classic Sonic Team gameplay, in which they never fail, but the sheer size of the game impresses.
The climatic Sleeze Sister concert and the inevitable parting of Nikki and Pammy is true for all first loves when people realize that they have to let go of someone because they are growing apart.
Despite some poor editing I still have to recommend the film, because of the performances and the gritty feel.
As luck would have it, the channel's sister station carried the movie the following night and I watched it again only to be disappointed because this station had a censorship policy that left the movie edited down.
So, Nikki suggests that Pammy audition at a sleazy nightclub as a topless dancer, because she thinks that Pammy is 'the pretty one', in their dynamic duo.
I prefer classical music, but this music was good because of the content and it was catchy.
Their scenes while corny at times were on the most part touching When Nicki suffers a breakdown, I had tears in her eyes, because she was so convincing.
In part that is because the originally intended version would never have approached the perfection of the original "Amberson's".
Moyle now wishes he had not left the production after a dispute over including additional songs (so they could have a double album) because his continued presence would at least have had some damage control value.
This was probably a commercial mistake because a public controversy might have actually increased attendance.
Ironically, if the lesbian angle had remained Moyle would have been accused of exploitation because it is really unnecessary for the storyline.
The hospital exit scene only works credibility-wise because the first scene set us up for it.
But, just because the last 2 minutes before credits is great, I wouldn't say that justifies BLOCKBUSTER rental prices.
Also, the film deserves no better than a 4 because some excellent dance scenes with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson were in the film but they were cut before it was released!!
a good film with good acting performances, i would say it takes an open mind to really see this film for what it is because what seems ridiculous really has a meaning behind it.
this is also seen by the cars going fast, i think this shows that he is being left behind going slower then everyone else because he has no charismatic qualities.
I say that because a lot of it takes place in an office and it's like we are watching it from Milton's perspective.
Very, very clever movie and not easy to film because it's situated in the realm of psychology.
The movie is more reminiscent of Julian Po (mixed with quite a bit of Boxing Helena) and Christian Slater was clearly chosen for the part because of that particular movie.
While by no means one of my favorite actresses, it was a delight to see Elisha Cuthbert in a role where her gorgeous looks are only part of her performance and are not THE performance; here is a beautiful woman who freely admits to using her sexuality as a means of getting ahead in life and now she's been reduced to nothing - a fact that she freely admits to having accepted - and finally having to take things extra slow because her most valuable asset has been taken away from her: her own body.
I give 9 out of 10, because Capello rudely and savagely ruined my hopes for the better ending :)
The only reason I couldn't give this a full 10 stars is because of the fact that it may be a little confusing to some, due to the fact that it is left very open-ended.
I give you some examples: 1. heroic main characters are often good looking, handsome (which is not really what disturbs me) and know how to use a gun or knife 2. the characters are mostly simple, straight-forward, there is the good and there is the evil 3. the movies make us believe that the wild west bustled with a few reasonable and righteous people and astonishingly out of 200 adult inhabitants of a town, 190 are cowards or villains or lynchers and of course miserable people or everything altogether which one could find in the gutter of humankind (outside town the rate is a little more favourable)- something I cannot believe,because I do not want to believe, that we Europeans only sent the sludge of our civilization over the ocean.
gives characterization reasonable depth: Scott and Lansbury are married but she had left him because of his dangerous job (a situation which she has to live through again now); Scott tells Donnelly that he hears The Beast (which symbolizes the scourge of the town) every morning until it's replaced by church-bells at the end of the picture.
I give this movie a 10 because it touches so deeply on the most important life issues: how we think, make decisions, and how narrow minded we are when taking care of our daily problems.
Not just because it won many prestigious awards in the country as well as abroad.
That is because it is one of the deepest insides and observations of the modern Poland and the costs of changes going in it.
But it would be impossible because of the surrounding, this relations evolves in.
I don't think it is top tier Lynch but it does feel endlessly fascinating because it allows the filmmaker to use every trick he has learned in over three decades of movie-making.
Actually, I haven't seen one film of Lynch whose philosophical questions wouldn't be covered in Schopenhauer's work, but I like his films still, because he always goes a step further, personalises the questions, links them to his own life.
Director David Lynch refuses to give clear explanations on his movies(with the exceptions of The Elephant Man and The Straight Story)and he prefers the spectator to making the homework of taking out conclusions.I like a lot the films he does but I do not try to find in them a clear explanation.I just enjoy the extraordinary talent Lynch has of creating emotions and producing feelings without a too coherent story.He uses all the instruments to give us something unique which we may not understand it immediately but something which we will never forget.Inland Empire is a very interesting experiment and we can see the same surrealistic style he used on most of his movies.After Eraserhead,his brilliant first film,Lynch continued with more normal films,like The Elephant Man or Dune.But,with Blue Velvet,he backed to show the oneiric feeling he had shown in Eraserhead (although on a lesser degree).With Inland Empire,I had the perfect sensation I was in a dream(or,best said,on a nightmare).But this film is not for everyone:its running time is of 3 hours.Lynch plays with our perception in the time and the reality to create a very interesting experience but which will not satisfy to the people who are looking for a clear story.Lynch makes us taking out conclusions all the time.The film is made with a digital video and that thing helps because it creates more mystery.Laura Dern brings an amazing performance.She always acted well but I never thought she had so much talent.I do not know if I can recommend Inland Empire to everyone:I liked it pretty much and I think it's a very interesting experiment.But I understand some people will not like it.Inland Empire is very interesting and it makes us taking out conclusions.And I always appreciate that.
If you're a shallow person, this is the movie for you because it's Eye Candy City.
The reason I say that is not purely because of the experience of watching the movie's chaos but also because of the process he went through.
Were they filmed simultaneously with the footage originally presented in "Rabbits" because he saw it moving out of that world all along or were they filmed recently to bind it to "Inland Empire"?
But because of the change in medium I will grant myself the freedom to toy with the idea that it may not be just a puzzle to piece together.
What if, added to this, those characters are only remakes of characters from an older film that was never finished because the actors were killed?
Cinema is just an illusion, you can't actually "play it real when it gets real" because IT (cinema) never gets real.
The character in Bergman's Persona (referenced in M Dr) stops talking because she feels the pointlessness of acting, that it never solves any real, life problems.
The confusion maybe never really stops, though I think the Lost Girl character may be the only "real" character because she is the only one watching what all the others play, she is the only one who plays it for real.
Their actions have no consequences, a movie character can die today because the director films the last shot of the movie and he/she can happily make love the other day when another shot is filmed.
Lost Girl, an enslaved woman in Polish hotel/purgatory watches shows on a psychic TV: a sitcom with supernatural rabbit people, scenes from a Polish film that never got finished because the leading actors were murdered, and the life of an American actress who starts in the remake of the Polish film.
It is not clear whether Nikki/Sue was an invention of Lost Girl who had been the real murderer and was in purgatory or whatever; in the final analysis, it does not matter because the movie is empty and lacks any redemptive qualities.
Inland Empire at first is reminiscent of some of Lynch's older short films because of the way it is filmed.
But she won't get nominated because this film will be systematically ignored by the mainstream.
- scenes from the Polish film   - reenactment of the film by Susan - possibly in her dreams or fantasies  - The placement of the Polish actress into a couple seemingly disparate and unconnected roles (which, in fact make the creation of "Blue Skies" and the folklore surrounding its predecessor "47" unite at a different interpretative level)   -The rabbit people performing within the television with an incoherent but suggestive script and an absurd laugh track   - and especially their audience (key to this interpretation because of its chronological placement in the narrative and the identity of the viewer).
For fellow admirers of Lynch: IMO, This is a more coherent film than Eraserhead, a more upbeat and enjoyable film than Lost Highway, a less commercial film than Mulholland Drive (though it does bear some thematic resemblances largely because both films are overt self-referential interpretations of American media culture).
On High in Blue Tomorrows turns out to be a remake of a doomed film, '4/7', never finished because both stars were murdered, and based on a Polish gypsy folktale.
There's a weeping Polish prostitute, watching a TV monitor on which appears a sitcom shot on a stage with people wearing rabbit heads; a laugh track creates a disquieting effect because the laughs come at "meaningless" points, giving the lines a sinister ring.
It saddens me to say this, because i love Tupac as much as the next bloke, but on his form in this film it's no bad thing that he now lies six feet under.
In many ways this is how art should be created because any other way will feel forced and pretentious.
Do not wait to see it on DVD because the experience won't be half as extraordinary.
First of all, the movie is not unwatchable (because of clarity purposes) as some critics had said, although I did see it at the Lincoln Center which has a beautiful theater and top quality facilities.
The movie is completely carried by Laura Dern, and not because she is in 90-95% of the scenes.
The three hour running time makes no difference because the movie moves in and out of itself with no regard for time.
Explaining all this doesn't really matter because you will have to see it and take your own idea from it.
Mark Linn Baker does a good job as Benjy but this film belongs solely to Peter O Toole who plays the alcoholic Allan Swann perfectly.This may well be because the role mirrored his own life in so many ways.
The idea I think is that no one would guess that these two very hyper-kinetic and funny individuals were harboring such pain and guilt, but they are able to tell each other because of the mutual respect that exists between friends.
I really felt like I was watching a film from the classic era Â not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors, but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way; it's a far cry from the juvenile (though occasionally hilarious) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that Hollywood became in the 1980s.
I think it's so very underrated and that's a shame because it has so much to offer.The story is all about young assistant and aspiring comedy writer Benjy Stone(Mark Linn-Baker)who works at the 30 Rock Studios in the 1950's.
Oscar nominated again for his work here Peter lost yet again and that's a shame because he's excellent and shows he has a real gift for comedy.Other performances to keep an eye out for include Lainie Kazan as Benjys mum Belle who tells Alan a few home truths and Lou Jacobi as Benjys Uncle Morty.Funny,poignant and well acted this is one that deserves more attention than it's had and is one to watch especially if you need cheering up a classic.
I really hope that the reruns are going to last a long time, because The flying doctors is really a one-of-a-kind great show.
You might say that, in a way, I went to Australia because of the Flying Doctors.
We got this movie because we have a squirrel.Whoever came up with the original idea obviously had a squirrel as a pet,the character's actions(other than the obvious dancing in a kilt)are pretty close to what a squirrel keeper sees.More squirrel scenes would have been nice,but probably wouldn't have added anything to the plot.Ours didn't like one slightly scary scene(for a squirrel)near the end,but everything was okay in a few minutes.Of course,since the squirrels in the recent Willy Wonka movie attacked the little girl,he didn't like that one(ran out of the room and stayed until it was over),so I'd have to say it's HIS favorite squirrel movie,since the people and animals got along.It's a funny,simple movie that anyone who likes animals would probably enjoy.
I would definitely recommend seeing that one over the black and white version I saw on TCM because as I say there is a real fairy tale feeling to the story and the color will add to that, especially if seen for Christmas.
People looked at me and laughed even more, because a fourteen years old crying at a comedy for kids isn't a common sight.
I cried because this wasn't a comedy to me, this is dead serious.
Afteralls, my vote is simply 1.I can't give 0, and I can't give more than one, because this is a crap!
The two goofy-looking old guys cover it up by saying it was the work of a boating accident (We know this because one of the said goofy-looking old guys goes up to the mortician and says to his face; "BOATING ACCIDENT!").
"Lara Nativo is a really nice Scream QueenÂ©.There is a lot of footage of Catalina Island,Kind of a travelogue for Gorehounds.There is some political stuff because of the tourism problem with so many deaths,Didn't we learn from the JAWS movie that danger BRINGS tourists.The AQUANOIDS(monsters) look like the Sleestak from TVland's LAND OF THE LOST.I liked the movie.Great fight scene between man and woman.The casting seems from a Soap Opera employment agency.Some of the acting seemed forced and other times roles could have been themselves.
I am no fan of anime (I wasn't before Mind Game), because the ones I have seen before seemed either too violent (Akira) or difficult to appreciate because of the Japanese cultural peculiarities (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke).
Perhaps because it has a positive view on live and it is more accessible.
is desperately looking for Romeo, because of his activities, and also intelligence reports gathered by them, speak about a possibility of an organization hiring the services of Romeo to assassinate the President of the United States of America!!!
The FBI refuses because they want Romeo.... Nihaal Singh refuses because........... the FBI refuses because............... Nihaal Singh refuses because................. the FBI refuses because.................  What happens when this Catch 22 situation arises?
Tupac's expressions are scary in some ways because of the things he does to his friends.
I had to sit through this movie because I paid over a 100 bucks for it.
In addition to that, add two UGLY women who only got roles because they can "show off".
Usually when you watch an atrocious film, comedy is there because the film is so bad.
It's not good, but frankly he's probably the best thing in the film because at least his character seems likable--something NOT shared with the other 'stars'.
HOWEVER, I can't give it a 1 because the production values are not 100% bad and, believe it or not, I've seen a few shoddier and more awful films--but not many.
Although rated IIB, Devil Face, Angel Heart is Cat 3 sleaze all the way, complete with seedy sex and obviously censored violence (more than once I could hear the music score skip because of cuts).
one of the problems i see now is that watching it now some of the effects seem cheesy, but maybe thats because technology has gotten better and I'm used to newer movies.
i gave it a 10 out of 10 because of how good it was for when it was done.
Sagoes character, Roland Kincaid became an instant favorite on the Elm Stree series and it's very lame to cast him only because of that and worse, make publicity on him.
Yes, I know it's an ecological plot similar to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (which was said to be an inspiration for this game, according to Amemiya), but just because there is an anti-pollution theme in a story does not always make it a bad story.
That's an underrated Hitchcock movie that contains, as most of his films, a lot of symbolism (I just want to mention this but I don't want to go into it because usually all these symbols are not something a viewer notices himself Â they require literature!).
False Flashback scene is important, because Jonathan (Richard Todd) is trying to convince Eve Gill that he is innocent.
He knows that it is easy to tell a lie, because they were old friends.
I did not watch this because I knew that, it was merely coincidence.
Stage Fright is basically a "whodunit" because you, the viewer, will think you know who the culprit is in this for a while and then realize that maybe you don't, after all.
With a wonderful British supporting cast, centred around Hollywood stars Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich, the film has a distinctly British feel to it, and not just because of the actors and setting.
The support in this film is so strong that by the end, the viewer does not care about the beginning not making complete sense because Hitch & the actors have overcome that with a well made movie.
Hitchcock did something in the film, as he did in his classic Sabotage, which upset filmgoers and critics because it was 'not the done thing'.
The infamous "lying flashback" at the beginning seems far less troublesome to today's audiences than it did when the film was released, perhaps because we're more accustomed to films playing tricks with time, now.
Charlotte's betrayal of Jonathon carries no greater weight, because by this point the viewer has no empathy left for him.
Me and my sister showed this movie to our little brother because he's been caught stealing SEVERAL times from the family business - so we made him watch this and he rather-ed enjoyed it until the killing came along.
Stage Fright has been accused of being boring, although I suspect this is because there is no violence at all until the very end of the movie, and instead it deals quite a bit with dialogue and character development.
This sort of dismissal happens because of financial failure upon first release.
We couldn't understand HALF of what the characters were saying; maybe we'd have been better off if we knew some gansta rap slang, because the conversations made absolutely no sense to us.
Now I regret watching because it was so awful.
I am no expert in vikings or history but i have read a lot about them and many sagas (if not all) from the "Edda", anyways i liked this movie because it feels natural and real.
The script was clever, with the potential for a great dramatic experience, but the director must have been limited by a highly restrictive budget, because it ended up looking like 'made for TV'.
i've seen this show first through a music video and fell in love with it right away because of the good storyline and the worked out characters that are complicated with many problems and dark pasts.
It was such a gorgeous moment because I knew without a doubt that these two really do love each other.
He romanticizes the rape because he is a romantic.
I hope that Matsushita continue with the manga, because it sadly remains on hiatus since 2003, and the manga is FAR superior then the anime series.
Tsuzuki is my favorite, but even the villain,Muraki, that is a very bad guy, cannot make me hate him,because without him, many awesome moments would never happen.
We don't see it, or feel it... We don't care about these people, because, in fact, we don't know them.
Great actors as well, "DULLE, DULLE, DULLE" ;)  I envy all the people who haven't seen it so far, because they can experience it the first time.
Absolute Giganten is the story of a night that is so ordinary and because of that so honestly that you're going to enjoy every minute of it.
After the film you should stay in your seats because right in the middle of the end credits "Das Bo" is announcing the title track of the film following his announcement: "Wer hÃ¤tte das gedacht" from Falkadelic (Doppelkopf), Das Bo (5 Sterne) & Ferris MC aka Fertich MC aka Marilyn Mongo.
Don't think that I just don't like this movie because I'm used to Hollywood.
That's also because one of the strong points of the film is the cast, there's a great chemistry between the main actors and they are able to transport a lot not only by words, but also by gestures and looks.
Sebastian Schipper in *his* debut as a director really knew what he was doing, although (or because?)
No doubt because of this attention to detail, the imperfections reveal themselves as well, but they are forgivable.
The film can get away with a somewhat flimsy story for a good hour because of the captivating presentation, but towards the end, it is almost impossible not to be disappointed by the simplistic wrap-up.
Oliver, as the film would confirm later, is caught under a speeding car and it has everything to do with Petulia and her volatile, unpredictable, "quick-to-rush-into anger" husband David(Richard Chamberlain;he's unfortunately the unsung actor here because all the roles are so great that Chamberlain can be forgotten until his character changes Petulia's life through a horrible beating).
This film shows their unusual relationship, specifically how their differences bring them peculiarly closer because of this transfixing, overwhelming attraction that morphs into love.
"Petulia" (based on the novel by John Haase, "Me and the Arch Kook Petulia") touches neuralgic issues of difficult times in the United States in an oblique manner, not to avoid them, but because its center is the title character played by Julie Christie (excellent as usual): hippie culture, racial conflicts, Vietnam, drugs, illegal immigration, the intrusion of technology in the bedroom, and middle-class betrayal before the reign of so-called "savage capitalism", all appear as variables in the drama of a young woman abused by her husband.
Despite the sweet title and the presence of Julie Christie, or perhaps, because of, this is not the pleasant movie one might, or might not have expected.
It's truly is fabulous - if it sounds like I'm gushing over it, it's because that's precisely what I'm doing.
As for Helena BergstrÃ¶m, she deserves a special mention because it really boggles my mind how she EVER became as famous (even by Swedish standards) as she is now.
I'm surprised really, because in the past two years I haven't seen a movie that touched me so deep inside.
The reason this film is so good is because it is a simple film with a simple message: (For most people) Life isn't easy...things don't just land in your lap.
He might not get an Oscar because of Idi Amin (Whitaker in LKFS should get it) but he is at his best.
I ask myself when the last occasion might have been that any of these critics genuinely had to :spoiler: run, under painful, embarrassing duress, from a cab - because they didn't have the money; or when the forces of life seemed to conspire against them so unfairly that they broke down in tears.
Sometimes, and this is rare, you laugh - because if you don't you'll cry.
Like he says in the movie, and I'm paraphrasing, "People will tell you that you can't do it because they can't."
I hated Tupac because he made the "bishop" character so real... A little too real..
The fact that no one in the film looks down on him because of his sometimes unkempt appearance, much less the color of his skin, is a testament to the unfiltered purity of the real Gardner's story, and what makes the movie accessible to all audiences.
Other people will become angry because they believe that the movie's depiction of hard work leading to rewards, in some cases, is too facile.
Chris is a role model exactly because he moves heaven and earth to be a good father to his son.
I kept watching because some comments said it gets better as it goes on.
I will say though, movies like these are terribly necessary because without them we'd never appreciate good films.
I rented this DVD partly because it's a thriller (and I'm really into those at the moment) and partly because it's an independent New Zealand film that I hadn't heard of before.
But be patient with the slow start and and stick it out, because it gets a lot better.
I was astounded at the storyline, the whole plot kept me captivated because I had absolutely NO idea what was going on, the characters were special in one way or another, you got to understand them well and sympathize if they got hurt or died.
One thing that worried me was there was barely no communication with the group of campers, but in the end it didn't bother me because just their actions, the close-up's of the girls faces, the expressions, it was incredibly masterful and artistic.
I'm curious as to weather people know just how hard it is to write a film, shoot it, edit it, and do post production all on your own because you have no budget?!
But IMDb won't allow me to type what I really thought about Almost An Angel in case it offends the readers....  And now because of the 10 line rule I'm forced to sit here and type even more about the wretched film which is causing me to despise it all the more.
That's a shame because Almost An Angel is a very engaging comedy, the sort of picture that stands up like a Capraesque piece for the 90s.
I rate it 7/10 because it hits my spot when i need a pick me up, perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in, but don't believe the low rating here on this site, it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect, but hell!, it's a heavenly piece knowingly incorporating the serious side of religious belief.
It shows the struggle of black youth in a whole new light; I can't help but feel for Q and his friends because that is something that could happen to anyone.
I had to get my copy from ebay because they have stopped producing it.
Possibly because of Tombstone (basically a film on the same point), having been released only a year prior to it.
Just because someone in Hollywood has the guts to do movies that HE wants to do, regardless of their potential at the box office, we shouldn't slanderize this guy every chance we get.
But, you can't blame Costner for this because Wyatt Earp is not a fictional character, he was a flesh and blood human like you, and most importantly, Costner plays Earp much more realisticly.
But before i move on i got a bone to pick with somebody who said Tombstone was much better because Russel played the kind of Earp that "we imagine".
Now i don't want to sound like a know-it-all, because i hate those people, but, as i said in my summary, if your going to comment on this movie, research the topic, or at least now the facts.
This could have titled "Issac Newton" because the story bears about as much of a resemblance to his life as it does that of Wyatt Earp's.
I gave it a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 simply because the visual effects and cinematography are good.
Usually, the men are upset because those stupid, non-blood-relation women are complaining about having to move and/or be shot at all the time.
He was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target.
But Wyatt Earp is aptly titled, because it is not only about Tombstone.
Any fans of Westerns MUST see Wyatt Earp because although made in the nineties it's the essential western epic and brilliantly done just a little long, that's all.
Ed gets killed because he is "too affable".
Like France and Russia, the corrupt sheriff Johnny Behan (Mark Harmon) tries to get Wyatt to sell out, because there is "enough money for everybody" if he just looks the other way.
I probably am more forgiving of this film since I like Westerns, dark dramatic stories, and admittedly uneven plots, because the characters usually are so great in them.
So this pile of garbage doesn't get a pass just because of when it was made.
Not really fair to call this a Troma film because Troma bought the rights to distribute this low budget film but had nothing to do with it's creation.
He wanders the streets endlessly looking for work or whatever, because thanks to being captured and tortured by the Viet Cong he's not doing too well with his mental health.
Actually, I can't say I dislike this film so much as that I was disappointed by it because with the cast, I expected a better movie.
This guy is cut up because he's seventeen and hasn't lost his virginity yet, and so turns to his teacher friend, Michael McDrew, for help.
He felt that he could get away with it because everyone looked up to him at that school.
But he does do a nice thing for Ponce, albeit in a sick way, in helping him out with his female troubles after Ponce said that he wouldn't touch a dead girl because he hasn't had a live one yet while being questioned by Telly Savalas's character, Sam Surcher.
I think the reason it still hasn't found a home on DVD is because the film takes a libertine view of adolescent sexuality, far more than any other American film has.
Still, I don't think anyone should not see this film just because director Vadim can't go two minutes without fetishizing a sea of young female bodies.
Not because it's some great masterpiece of cinema, but because there's a lot there to talk about.
A good 1930s western, mainly because of Ken Maynard.
Therefore we accept the often improbable story plot elements because we believe the people playing the roles are similar to the those who lived in the real Old West.
Tombstone Canyon is a spooky place that most of the locals avoid because they fear a spectral figure called The Black Phantom.
She arrives, looks around for someone to have sex with, meets a nasty guy (well he thinks he is - he is actually quite a pawn because he totally underestimates a beautiful woman and how far she is willing to go to get some money, her way, revenge, or just to screw with him because she is bored).
People can like the Hannibal Lecter character because he is amoral, but if a female does it they are shocked and appalled?
Some people may not like that one because the dogs talk but that was my other favorite.
People figure out and do things primarily because they need to--and fast--so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes.
Some of the threads should have simply been removed, because it's difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you're introduced to an idea, it's already passed you by.
Not many would come up with The Passage, primarily because it's a largely forgotten film which didn't succeed critically nor commercially even when it was originally released.
That's because you're a woman dear .
The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave shows the problems gays have, because there is no way to have a legalized partnership... they are talking about it, but we still don't have the rights every married couple has... it probably was the best segment of the whole movie!
I guess because I started college in '72 I was somehow drawn to the periodic dress and reminiscent of the in-your-face, anti-establishment, make your point through vocal protest period.
You should see it, gay or not, because what matters in this world is also: love!
The 1961 part was about two elderly ladies that were frustrated because they couldn't express then selves in any way, the second part I really liked a butch girl named Any and a feminist named Linda meet an fall in love and finally the last one was so funny, Ellen Degeneres stared as Kal so it was awesome, Anyway, Kal and Fran want to have a baby so the go to the sperm bank and well you'll see if you watch it!
The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had "male" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well.
This was something I wasn't really interested in and watched just because of the fine cast.
He is not doing all this because it is the right thing, but because he wants to see blood.
And this action was really annoying because it always happened the same thing.
So, it's a little jarring because of the heavy style of Tartakovsky, but generally well put together for the medium.
I could say more but I really feel that I should leave at that because I don't want to ruin the ride .
I won't go into story specifics here because everybody already knows what this about.
I think that is why this show didn't make it, because The Newz was as good as Kids in the Hall and much better than Saturday Night Live.
Well, God must've known this and have been against me, because this is the terrible portable Grand Theft Auto I get.
That aside it's a great game and because of the 24/7 appeal of hand-held gaming it's what gives GTA LCS it's addictive and fun level.
Of course I was mildly surprised by Lundgren's last movie The Defender due to it's good action and solid story however I generally don't rent straight to video movies because I got burned way too many times, however when this came on TV I saw it and was VERY impressed with it.
Paul Thomas Anderson was quoted as having said the only reason he cast Sandler in "Punch-Drunk Love" was due to the fact that he was a huge fan of Sandler's comedies, which he enjoyed viewing because they always put him in a good mood.
I was surprised to find Dennis Dugan had directed it, because he's usually one of Sandler's better collaborators; yet this film is totally amateurish and incomprehensible.
These characters are more excusable in his better comedies like "Gilmore" because we know the romance is unrealistic to begin with and is only there to fit a mold, but Chriqui is so earnest in her performance and displays so much promise that you are left *wanting* her to have a better script to work with.
Sandler should embrace the concept of stronger romantic leads in his films, because I think it would vastly improve the storyline.
This movie is ultimately just disappointing because of how dull it is and how hard it tries -- or perhaps doesn't try -- in its effort to make teenagers laugh.
Indeed, the hysterical horseplay that Sandler and company revel in may distract you from the plight of these uprooted, misplaced misfits that had fled to Uncle Sam's shores because they believe America is a Utopia.
The movie that most closely resembles "Zohan" is "Little Nicky," because both characters boast supernatural abilities.
It gets a four because while it mostly reeks of bad, it still has some good jokes in it, the beginning to film promises a very odd and refreshing new comedy and the first 5 minutes will tickle your spine.
Why Adam Sandler would make a horrible movie like that is beyond my comprehension,specially because he has a potential to be a much better comedian then that!
Also the crude language and the oh-too-much "crotch" view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie, which is a pity, because I find the hilarious fight scenes and the Zohan's "supernatural" cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch.
Deeds" is because of his supporting cast?"
There are several scenes illogically strewn together depicting Zohan doing some more stupid $hit and further cementing this movie as being the most racist mainstream movie ever made that the American public completely ignores because they're too dense to be able to comprehend anything that isn't expressed explicitly.
When there's about a half hour left in the movie (I'm probably not correct on the time frame because I was trying my hardest not to pay attention to the movie for fear that the movie would have pulled me into the depths of insanity, so try to bare with it), Zohan enlists the help of socialite millionaires to aid him in his battle against Phantom.
But I'm still frustrated because of the relentless cameos.
At the end of the movie, the Palestinians led by Phantom and the Israelis led by Zohan have an ultra explosion-filled showdown in the streets of New York as the result of some idiotic subplot regarding Rob Schneiders'affinity for his goat (because every single person who lives in the middle east who isn't a terrorist is a goat farmer), some other retarded subplot, and some other retarded subplot.
I spoiled the entire movie for you because it really doesn't matter.
Overall, I give this movie a 2 out of 10 because there were a total of three times when I chuckled at the movie.
It's a pretty bad ratio because the movie has to have the record of most attempts at trying to make its audience laugh.
I say this because I most always feel the reviews here at IMDb are right on and rely upon them for my movie going choices.
About halfway through the movie, I began to realize the reason I was having fun with the "Zohan" was because this movie essentially gives out an open invitation to enjoy the silliness that was being presented.
Don't expect the bar to be raised, because that's not what this film was trying to do.
It is really a surprise because it has some great little moments in it.
It's as if they tried to make the building into a character, and at a certain point, they actually succeeded, not because of some great feat of direction but because the human characters are so weak and messed up that the building looked positively sturdy and 3 dimensional compared to them.
Yes, Jenny was in her late 30s when she made the movie but because practically everyone is above a certain age, this gave the movie a sorta poky feel to it, which was the last thing THE DARK TOWER needed.
I avoid talking about the film's plot simply because there isn't much to say...
So this movie is worth watching once, because it's pretty hilarious.
I'll give it 3 stars outta 10 because that's about how many scenes caught my attention.
The cause of these supernatural events: the tormented spirit of a girl who is cursed to haunt the building because her father, a funeral director, gave her a clown-doll which he stole from the coffin of a dead child (what a great father: bringing home his daughter an ugly-as-sin present lifted from a corpse!).
The gore is another interesting thing because the murders are something different for a ghost film, the acting is OK in some parts but that isn't a main thing for Ghosthouse.
Shame, because I almost always like what Nicholas Cage does.
What was not presented via the trailer, or hinted at greatly throughout the start is that the film is science fiction and this is why I feel many people think that Knowing drops 'the ball' because it's not how they expect it to turn out.
"Knowing" isn't typical within the science-fiction/disaster genre because unlike every other film I've seen in recent years that has run with this formula it doesn't have any main characters that quite frankly you hope would die.
moments we're all so used to, because there are a few in here too, but unlike all those movies I just mentioned above; the focus doesn't seem to be on trying to make the characters as annoying as possible.
In 2009 the standard is you can watch a movie with CGI visuals that look so realistic that sometimes you get the urge to just rewind and watch what just happened simply because you cant believe your own eyes.
And the end, stupid beyond words... only the kids that can hear the creepy whispering people can go off in the spaceship... no parents allowed... and the kids don't really mind that their parents are either dead or about to die, because they each get to have a white fluffy bunny to hold... most of the audience was laughing, and those that weren't sat there with their mouth hanging open.
I didn't have high expectations for this movie, hadn't even planned on seeing it, but I held out a little hope because I loved Dark City so much.
Out of 10 - I give it 4; and that's just because of the rubbish ending.
But Knowing really stands out from the likes of Next and various Roland Emmerich movies because of its heart (there is a profoundly human element amongst the chaos and destruction), and because of the surprising, riveting turns the story takes.
This movie is worth a 10 because it can show that sometimes no matter what you have to do what is right for you and not the rest of the world.It also shows that if you get caught crying sometimes that it is not always a sign of weakness, sometimes it is a sign that you have just had enough!
Guys, shouldn't be too quick to dismiss this as "a chick flick" because you will be missing an inside to women that can be very informative.
This movie is intelligent because it's very intuitive in its understanding of how most real people relate to one another.
I gave it high marks because the events in which Eddie finds himself in trouble could happen to any of us.
However, the standouts are undeniably Douglas, who is animated and energetic and engaging in a multi-dimensional role, and Lee Purcell, very sexy and appealing as a high society type who comes to Eddies' aid mainly because she wants a little excitement in her life.
Having hoped this would of turned out to be a low grade trash gem along the lines of Giallo a Venezia.I was sadly let down as its barely even a thriller,its purely a shot on the road location skin flick with a few crimes thrown in our pair come across on their travels like a knife wielding guy.The plot as it is,vaguely resembles a cross between Mario Bava's Rabid Dogs and Thelma and Louise with a very slight Russ Meyer feel of lets just get naked because we've got a few ample sized lead actresses.
"Le Porno Killers" has definitely an awesome title,but fails to deliver both violence and an abundance of sleaze.This tedious bore features two female agents(one of them is Carmen Russo of "Patrick Still Lives" fame)who go after Vassilli Karis.First of all the title is completely misleading,because there are no porno scenes and no killers in this flick.At least beautiful Carmen Russo provides some full-frontal nudity.First we see her sunbathing nude then she gets up to walk across the yard buck-naked.Then she takes a shower with her female co-star and they engage in a truly fantastic lesbian scene.Finally we see her in a menage-a-trois totally nude on the bed then briefly getting up.Still the film is pretty light on sleaze and the action is deadly dull.Only for tolerant fans of Italian smut.4 out of 10.
I'm sorry the descriptions put me off seeing 'Keane' back then, because its painful nature made it hard to concentrate on it in my house.
Though I didn't have the patience to review both versions in toto I'd say Soderbergh made a snappier version, and I can see why he would have done that because the original version's first 30 minutes seem interminable, I thought I'd watched an hour and it was half that.
Soderbergh is wise to put the looking-for-work moment very early rather than after 38 minutes, because it is better to start out with that.
This is important because Keane does want to appear normal and is capable of doing so -- otherwise the whole relationship with the mother of the little girl would not have developed.
Because, at one time, I had the feeling that there was a flashback structure, that the beginning was really the end of the story and that Kira was the girl he lost, upon which he lost his mind and mistook her for Sophie, his real daughter who is apparently unavailable to him because of a divorce.
And not just because of my username or whatever; this is one of the Essential Eighties Movies.
I saw Clean Shaven about ten years ago and it has always stayed in my mind not least because it committed to celluloid one of the most toe-curling scenes I have ever witnessed but because it managed to portray a man who is mentally broken.
Keane becomes attached to Kira because his missing daughter, Sophie, would be the same age.
Keane is only 90 minutes long but it feels much longer because it creates a very high level of tension, but it is a subtle, constant tension, not like a break-neck chase scene in an action film.
Keane is a brilliant and unique film and it is, without a doubt, Damian Lewis's finest performance Â and that is really saying something because he is a wonderful actor who is capable of conveying great feeling with his eyes and body and with a minimum of words and without overacting.
You want to comfort William and pat him on the shoulder and say "don't be frightened, it will be alright" and the next moment you want to avoid him and "get away as fast as you can" because he is scary and disturbing and you never know which William you will encounter next.
We were all worried about William and Kira and wondered what will happen to them, as if they were real people, because they are Â they represent many real people who live on the fringes of our society.
I hope I am not giving the impression that Keane is a depressing film because it's not and it ends with the basically decent man that is William Keane triumphing over his illness Â at least for the moment.
You want him to get well because he is a good person.
I have always been taught to avoid such people because they are dangerous and not to give them money because they will just spend it on drugs and alcohol Â nothing that I saw in Keane disputed those beliefs but as I stopped to give the poor man some money it occurred to me that after experiencing this film, I could no longer just ignore someone like him.
We feel sad because even though we already knew it, we know this little girl can't save him, she can't help him.
Especially because the camera is so close on him all the time.
I hope the film receives the recognition deserved because it is a stand-out.
-applause- It's true folks, from all the Inuyasha films, this film is the best of all the installments, (includes the 1st, 2nd, and the 4th) This is because the story didn't resolve around Kagome being a damsel in distress or drama in the never ending love triangle of Kagome/Kikyo/Inuyasha.
(a samurai who battled against Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's dad and lost)   As great as this film is, it only gets 9/10 only because of one character who remains consistently annoying throughout the film in my opinion.
This may be at least in part because of the storyline of the movie, which reaches back to the time of Inuyasha's birth and his father's death.
Tenka no Hadou Ken is particularly interesting because not only does it give us a glimpse of Inuyasha's father, it also provides a peek at the inner workings of his brother Sesshoumaru, one of the series' more inscrutable characters.
I rented it because it had Parker Posey in it, but enjoyed all of the characters.
Maybe because I've had jobs like that before : the sense of "us vs. them" and the wacky little things that the characters did to get through the day to 5:00.
While mostly very unfunny, Date Movie is the best of these spoof movies, mainly because there are one or two decent gags and the fact Alyson Hannigan's in it.
My final comment is a complaint about the 10 line rule, because I have read other reviews of less than 10 lines and, believe me, I've said enough.
I saw this movie because it was free (like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session).
!The only real funny part was at the starting when Alyson Hannigan was trying to be sexy,and that wasn't even all that funny.I think Date Movie was a useless piece of junk that should have never been made, because it hurt's the good name of spoof movies everywhere, basically meaning the Scary Movie series.I thought that Date Movie was one of the grossest, sloppiest movies ever as well.I mean, I can stand some gross humor, but this film went a little to far, and I am ashamed that the people in this film agreed to act in this nonsense, especially Alyson Hannigan.So I warn you, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
But if you're sitting there with a look of disgust because you can't believe that somebody greenlighted a budget for this tripe then you know to avoid this like Paris Hilton with the plague, and you give me hope.
And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like "Date Movie" I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out.
This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie.
I'm glad I saw this movie for free, because I would not dish out $2 to see it.
I feel they must have added in Sophie Monk and Carmen Electra not because of their amazing acting talent, but because they felt the humor was so poor they needed to wake people up from this painfully dumb movie.
I'd imagine that the main reason that people are paying to watch this is because it stars Alyson Hannigan.
And not just because it has a lot of toilet humor and fat person jokes.
I of course identified with them because I myself was also bored with the material.
The reason for this is because of the cinematography.
I consider the cinematography above average in Moon 44 because the director, even though on a short budget was able to create some neat scenery, of futuristic earth, space ships, fighter planes, the base itself and etc.
Now, I though this may sound crazy, but I have to be able to get into a movie to enjoy it, like I enjoyed Blade Runner because of the cinematography.
I won't go into the story because you can get that elsewhere on this site.
I decided to write this review because I felt it's unfair for the movie from the negative comments and ratings it had.
About two months ago my friends and I rented this movie and we only watched the first 5 minutes of it because we got bored so we took it out and watched another movie.
I wish my friends and I watched the whole thing because it's one of the best movies ever made and I was smiling through the whole movie.
I really think this movie should of won an Oscar because it was just amazing..   10/10 [:   GO SEE IT NOW.
We went because she is both a big fan of Jennifer Garner from her Alias days, and she finds Matthew McConaughey charming.
I went because I enjoy relationship stories.
When movies flash back to the past it is kind of fun because it tells something about a character that you might not know or shows what got them to the point they are at now.
None of this is taken into account because - Women Be Dreamkillers.
So... women get married because someone - anyone - ASKS them to, not because they really love the person.
This movie in the UK was a 12a and as I work with kids younger than this regularly, I would not want them to see this movie...not only because it is really bad but it is littered with smut and vulgarity.
The three bridesmaids are dimwits pining to sleep with Matthew and when that fails they scrape the bottom of the barrel groomsmen because they just need a man.
They try to portray him as a mean ass, because he supposedly gets drunk and shares his real feelings about marriage.
The two never got together because of Connor's youthful shyness and Jenny's need to fit in.
I went to see this movie because I am a fan of Matthew McConaughey.
Even though it's an average romantic comedy, it stands better than a lot of others because it uses a different concept.
If the producers actually had an idea of when to release the film they should have done it around Christmas because of the closeness to "A Christmas Carol" and people don't mind a corny film or a corny song because it's Christmas...instead it seems like everyone got it wrong with this one
I'm so angry because everyone destroys this movie for no reason.
FOUND is painful to watch, not because of story-telling power and emotion, but because the plot has problems and almost each and every scene lacks credibility.
FOUND is painful to watch, not because of story-telling power and emotion, but because the plot has problems and almost each and every scene lacks credibility.
I remember him in the old John Wayne movies where he and Harry Carey Jr. (in this movie too) would ride like real cowboys - that's because they were the real thing.
This jumbled, muddled mess of a film boasts cheapness from every angle, but due to the missing story Â "The Young Americans" fails to be anything more than a random Harvey Keitel stumble at the store, or a cheap recommendation because you rented "Reservoir Dogs".
It really is the best little monster attack type film, and you even root for the Gremlins themselves, because of their enjoyable pranks, stupidity and by far their laughs, it just sticks in your head.
I thought Nana and Ah Tu had the strongest storyline and the best character development, naturally so because of the screen time devoted to them.
Just because you expected roast beef and got vegetable lasagna instead doesn't mean the lasagna is bad.
It is mildly amusing, and because it is 22 minutes it is bearable, but that's it.
Maybe because it is so obscure, people feel like they've stumbled onto a hidden gem?
I located and watched this show because I'm a fan of Adam West's Batman, Conan O'Brien and Robert Smigel.
Billy being the typical person that he is breaks all the rules At first gizmo multiples creating 4 more Mowgli who then eat after midnight turning them into Gremlins viscous nasty goblin like creatures With help of his mum Billy succsefully kills off three gremlins except there leader Stripe who escapes to the swimming pool and jumps in all hell brakes loose I'm not really sure why i like this movie probably because of the music and because of the gremlins them selves there cool
I a Spiderman fan since I was a kid, although I stop reading the comics long ago, but this movie is probably the best in the series, mainly because it's superb special effects and CGI.
i was expecting this to be one of my favorite games ever because ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 games are my favorite games ever but this isn't huge let down its just conclusion of the game is bad if you seen the film harry dies he also dies in the game but when its all over they completely forgot about that and story mode is short to atleaset on the ps2 version but swinging around new york is just pure fun so is story mode but its disappointing that it is so short and playing has black suit is fun but its to bad you cant after you beat the game.
I recently rented this game for the PlayStation 2, because it was around $70 and I wasn't sure whether I wanted to buy it.
This means that if you are in a hurry for a mission, it will be helpful to zip around instead of swinging, because the swinging is slow and even the booster (which arrives at the end of your swing as you launch through the air) doesn't help much.
The other super villains are the Lizard (which is fun as long as you don't keep dying, because then it gets rather boring) and Morbius/Shriek.
One that i would personally recommend because it is very comical throughout is Mr. Jingles.
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
Contrary to the countless "gory" movies like 30 Days of Night, the makers of Feast honestly have balls because they do what the others don't: be different.
The reason Feast fails is because it did neither for me while watching.
I also hope he stays in horror and doesn't lose his edge, because there are far too few consistent directors in the genre.
Disturbingly awful because there's simply no point to this aside from the fact that it screams "hey, we're doing a "horror" film here, folks".
I gave this movie some stars because it does manage to introduce some elements that could have been good, if the movie wouldn't have had so many negative qualities.
I give this movie a 4/10 because it simply takes itself too seriously to write it off as a dark comedy, but not seriously enough to be a good horror movie.
The performances are pretty strong because the actors seem so relaxed in them.
The bottom line is that this seems to be a very poorly written film that's full of holes that only scores as high as it does because of the actors and director!
Lang empathizes with Eddie and Jo not because of their purityÂanathema to Lang's worldviewÂbut because of their faith in one another, which transcends the human birthrights of petty malfeasance and self-interest.
If you're a film-noir fan, you shouldn't miss it because of some of his elements that will be found is such masterpieces as "The Scarlet Street" or "The Big Heat".
Even his live-action/animation film "Toy Soldiers" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition.
So perhaps I can continue by saying that this programme left me feeling quite unsettled - a bit like watching a David Lynch movie - but made more potent because its all probably quite true.
I say probably, because one cannot be entirely sure.
It was because of this film that I had to get rid of my rabbit because my rabbit lived in the shed and I was to scared to go there by myself!
Its a shame that this didn't enjoy similar success as Blair Witch because between the two, Alien Abduction is certainly more scarier.
The actors also are very convincing because they do not take turns to talk but argue and debate over each other.
Which is funny, because it was Spielberg himself who had the vision of "Gremlins" becoming a movie.
A farming family is getting ready for a dinner, the son is playing around with the video camera, within minutes the power goes out, they think its a lightning storm, the father and 2 sons (1 has the cam with him) go to check it out outside, they notice a nearby transformer is sparking and sustained damage, they walk closer to see it, they look down under the transformer and notice 3 aliens slicing a cow with a laser, they get spotted, 1 alien fires the laser at them (no beam is seen), the other son is injured, they run back to the house, tell the family, the family immediately panics and wants to take the son to the hospital, the father and the son go to the truck (a really old beat up truck) and cant start it, they notice the engine was completely melted, they run back to the house, and they hear them upstairs, the father and son walk up the stairs and hears a alien in the bedroom (the door is closed), the alien fires a laser through the door, the father fires the shotgun, kills the alien (presumably), they run back down, the family is panicking even more, they attempt to run out of the house, an electrical bolt/laser comes through the window above the door, injures another family member, they run back to the dining room, a loud noise enters the room, they fall in pain, the sound stops, then they notice they all have nose bleeds and what appear to be radiation burns on their bodies, the little girl (no older than 5) says (in a monotone voice) that everything is going to be OK, she seemed zombified and keeps reassuring them everything will be OK and not to worry, she doesn't move or say anything else, the father finally goes out of the house to try to get the truck working or find some other transportation, they hear shots fired, they all run out and notice he's gone and the shotgun is melted, they run back to the house, the son with the camera goes upstairs to change his pants (because he peed himself) he goes back down and notices everyone is gone, he runs back upstairs in the bathroom sits on the toilet, sets the camera to point at him, he says he's scared and doesn't want to die, he starts crying and he says he doesn't know what's going on or why are they doing this, then you see a 3 fingered hand grab the camera lens, a alien grabbed it, looked at it (meanwhile the lens is facing it so you see the alien)it then puts the camera down in a different direction, and that's all you see.
This movie is not worth seeing because it's not the original.
Now when watching this we know that its not real because it shows the aliens craft and what they look like and this would be hard evidence of the existence of aliens and this wasnt in the news.
I would never want to miss a beat because I would know that my footage could possibly change the way the people of our world think about life in our universe.
The only reason it's not getting an 8+ is because the dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, and the reactions are a bit clichÃ©'.
Too many comedians think that they are funny because they curse every other word and repeat the same joke 10 different ways.
I found out it was a fake because of the research I had done on the film when I was looking for it online.
Just as something creepy happens because of the aliens, the frame pauses just on a really interesting picture.
So Er yeah like I was saying I like this movie because it's a movie I enjoy and movies that I like to watch I enjoy watching...........
Perhaps it is because of this that I found the film so convincing, but it is well worth watching even though you have seen that it is not a record of an actual alien abduction.
Case in point: the airline sequence, where he can add another scene because he can use physical comedy.
I gave this movie a 10 rating, not because it was that good of a film (it wasn't), but because to me it brings back memories of my teenage years.
Later, I saw it again because of the same reason plus I usually find Glenn Ford's films entertaining.
The fact he could come back and play after a near-fatal auto accident was amazing....but I would not watch this again because it was too subjective and just not the truth.
It's essentially the blueprint for the monster-of-the-week stories of The X-Files, not to mention the reason NBC agreed to give the show a chance (the original pilot, The Cage, was rejected because it was considered "too cerebral").
While many will knock this film because of the pornographic nature, I saw past that and witnessed the birth of a twisted and compelling storyline.
Not because it sucks, not because its boring, but because you have to question on whether or not the deep, crass, in-your-face approach to its storyline falls within your humor and cinematic appeal.
The entwined undertones of the movie kept me from fully enjoying it during the first pass through, because of having to think a bit too much to decipher the true nature and purpose of the lead actors' (West + Art) dialogue and conduct.
If you don't think its funny then you have no soul, don't like off-the-wall humor, or are incapable of laughing because of too much botox.
I have to admit that the first time I saw this film (the color version) I wasn't too enthused with it, probably because it was 3am on a Sunday morning.
While many will knock this film because of its pornographic nature or constant attacks on society, I was able to see the deep, hard points the story brings out about the world we live in today.
deals with the material raw, because that's how it shows it.
most of the time they aren't even conscious of it because it's so routine for how they live.
I think many people would absolutely hate this movie, partly because it doesn't pass judgement on behaviors that are repulsive to the bulk of humanity, and partly because it exposes us to them at all.
I remember leaving my living room absolutely shocked, and not just because of the events on screen.
Forget that though, and just enjoy the fact that it did, because moments of sunshine are often all too rare, a fact emphasized throughout this film.
It is so so funny, I had to pause it sometimes because of laughing so very hard, before moving forward.
And the real scenes in the film are much better than Jackass or Punk stuff, because it so real and not just a fake joke on someone.
Not always terribly funny, but that's only because of its familiarity.
I have to disagree with the posters who didn't like the film because it "isn't believable".
However, once there it just gets weirder and weirder but you also find yourself transfixed because of the unusual story and animation.
  I'm 18 and a huge fan of Bronson, and alot of you probably know because of the reviews i write all the time on Bronson film.
I can't say anymore because it'll spoil it.
It's very smart for it's time and i recommend it to anyone who loves film made in france and anyone who don't because it's Bronson performance that win you over.
It is too bad that this movie is as obscure as it is, because if it had been produced state-side and been more mainstream, he might have enjoyed a much more critically-acclaimed career, deserving of a lifetime achievement Academy Award.
However, this is not the case and die-hard Bronson fans get to enjoy this little gem while the rest of the world misses out because they were too busy shunning the unfairly typecast Bronson.
They must do things differently in the United Kingdom because I thought they would have had to have a license first.
As another reviewer said, it's like a train wreck, you want to look away and stop watching but you can't because it's so bad.
First he won't reveal where he was at the time of the murder because it is a professional secret.
No one has seen him in Run Ronnie Run yet, because at the time I'm writing this review, that movie has yet to be released because of it's extremely vulgar content (much of which involves a song performance by Jack Black), but I seriously hope they get moving on that.
and convinced that it is, and its silly because its such a great entertaining show.
Hearing about this, Thayer starts going into a mild diatribe against the deceased who was not popular among the magician fraternity because of his greed and trickery with contracts.
I love NCIS because it is a very "figure it out" show with out all the blood and gore of CSI.
show that I will never miss because I love it so much.
I've become very slowly interested in this show because it is sometimes difficult for me to follow the plots.
It is a shame that this show is so under-rated in the UK, where it's been shoved on some obscure Sky channel, because it does have the potential to be great and I think there are many out there who would enjoy it.
I used to see it while flicking through the channels, I quickly flicked over to another channel, just because I didn't think I'd like it but one night when there wasn't much of the TV, I had no choice but to watch it and as soon as the episode finished, I was so blown away by it and I have been engrossed it in ever since.
They clearly have good advisers because the episodes are sensibly concluded and there is never any thought that this wouldn't happen in real life.
I do hope there are more seasons of this programme to come because now I am really hooked and it has become another of my favourite shows on TV.
Okay I'm really starting to get sick of these people who say that this show is a CSI spin off CSI is a bad unbelievable show that is totally fiction they can do forensics in 10 seconds when it takes more then 10 hours, its pure Science fiction CSI is but NCIS is closer to reality its always enjoyable, funny and I'm sure more people would watch it if they could not view it as CSI spin off/Rip off because its not watch one episode and you will see its more about the Federal Agents.
the Forensics are only used to identify chemicals and finger prints CSI is not the only place to use CSI and if they didn't have the Foresics in the show it would be fake, and we should just let out all the criminals as we cant convict them because CSI is the only place to use forensics.
The autopsy scenes, while grisly, fascinate me because they're quite accurate in their depiction and their protocol.
Comes from money, but doesn't get an allowance because if he did, he wouldn't work, and it seems there is bad blood between him and his family.
This is the team (I'm not talking about Ziva and Madame Director because I have yet to see Season 3), and my suggestion is to watch them in action, every Tuesday, 8/7 central, on CBS.
I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.
To me, that quality makes for the best Columbo opposition, because it places the emphasis is on the cat and mouse game, rather than just the simplistic good vs. bad.
But she's depressed because she has to go to the mall with her parents.
As a kid, I hated this movie because it trashed my favorite slasher characters, Freddy and Jason.
Well...at least not intended humor, because the stupidity and incompetence definitely will make you chuckle more than once!
SPOILER however (if you don't already know it) fede dies and flor's prince changes(supposedly Fede returns to earth and enters the body of Max, or something like that) That is quite annoying because after all this trouble they went through they didn't even manage to get married really (unreal weddings-cris morena again!)
Somehow the student is lifted by the Brits because of Bernie's activities.
"I do what I do because I am forced to by circumstances beyond my control.
My enemy does what he does because that's his nature."
If you were a teenager and that scene didn't inspire you to never become an alcoholic (pardon my double negative), then it was only because you'd already had one too many lost weekends.
I suppose I will research further because the intent is to focus on Fidel here and it does that admirably.
Small states are traditionally virtuous because they are weaker, and vice versa for big states, a point Castro manages to put in context without using it as a crutch.
I've heard from many people that this movie is great, but I avoided watching it because it seemed too clichÃ© for my taste.
Note to filmmaker: Just because your movie is inexplicable doesn't mean it's profound.
Like Amy, Rose suffered a horrible childhood and because she put her fury and pain into her character, any 15-year-old girl who has suffered at the hands of those who are supposed to protect her can relate.
I wasn't able to get into the Evil Dead trilogy at first because I watched them all out of order.
It's a fine idea, and it works great, too, because the outcomes of the situations are different, as well... meaning, you see a scene and go "Oh, right, I remember this from the first... oh yeah, now he... what the ...!?"
In the middle of the movie,some totally new characters show up and it's pretty obvious they're only there to get killed by the demons.But then again,what other purposes can characters in a horror movie have anyway?This second movie in the "Evil Dead"-series is kinda different actually,it gets more surreal here,mainly because Ash has really lost it here in the first half,and the demons appear to be even more over-the-top and more evil.However,they both grab themselves together near the end for their final showdown.Ash is accompanied by a bunch of idiots but as they're idiots,they don't help much and get killed in some rather original ways.I'm not sure when this movie is situated,but I'm guessing this movie acts like the first one never existed.Not that it completely retells the story,it merely summarises it.And as I took this walk on gross-out lane,I found myself very entertained,somehow shocked but I don't have a clue by what exactly and I did laugh along with Ash and the deer head I must say.That scene really puts a spell on you.Almost as great as the first one
The first worked so well because it was such an unrelenting and grueling experience and was the finest horror film since "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".
In the meanwhile, a young woman, her boyfriend and two hicks (one of which - a girl - is going to A) get raped by vines and B) choke to death on an eyeball, while her boyfriend is going to leak some massive blood) have arrived in the cabin too, and as it turns out the whole blame of the situation stands on the parents of the young woman, herself, and her boyfriend, because it's them who looked for, found and tried to translate the Necromicon (yes, THAT book) in the first place...  Bloodier and also funnier than the first one, 'Evil Dead 2' manages to be as good as the original, but in a different way.
i understand that Bridget Fonda asked Sam to give her a small role in Army of Darkness because she is such a fan of the movies, and probably of Mr Raimi as well, whom she worked with in A Simple Plan.
I thought this movie was older then actually is, because the character's hair in general looks from the 60's.
The eery feeling is not as terrifying as the original, because the original was a punch in the face of terror.
This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy.
"Dead by Dawn" will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting.
Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through.
Although The Jar contains more flaws than The Unlocked Window, together they remain the only two episodes from the hour-long Hitchcock really worth seeing, and I'm glad the Internet gives viewers a chance to salute such classic episodes, which otherwise-- because of relentless scheduling-- would pass into TV oblivion.
Maybe that's why Bergman writes such strong women, because he casts his mother as the heroine and actually lets her overcome the obstacles, but here we get to watch a saintly intelligent woman get beaten down physically and mentally over and over by her psychotic husband's fetishizing of unhappiness and misery.
He keeps sleeping with his other fiancÃ© without breaking it off when he starts sleeping with Anna, but neither of them can really hold it against him because apparently (though I don't know why) he's such a good person.
This is so because his mother's name was "Karin," not "Anna."
Yet it's not by that much, aside from specific choices in the music (I don't think Bergman would have used the musical accompaniment, not that it's bad but it tells of what is usually different and less frequent for the material), and because of the nature of the material and the characters, it's not surprising if the Best Intentions feels more like a Bergman film than August.
Firstly, there is no proper story line ..... just taking a boy meet girl story and putting it in a historical backdrop doesn't make sense at all .... specially when it is not authentic at all ... its predictable and boring ..... more so because of the constant Urdu dialogs which was hard to comprehend ..... many people are saying that the fight sequence portrayed are good but its not worth it ... when you are portraying a vicious battle a little more gore is expected ... not pushing each other and making them fall to the ground ... thats bogus .... i liked the other films of AG they were good ... but this one is worthless ... the only good thing about the movie is aishwarya her ... acting is really good ... hrithik looks misplaced .... and he is often out of sorts if the role doesn't demand his dancing skills ... so it was expected .... if you do want to watch it ... go with your friends and chat your way ... through the movie .. because what happening on screen will not appeal you at all ... for such a stupendously bad story the movie is painfully long ... on the bright side it gives you a lot of time to talk with your friends ..... and carry some medication it might help .. u may need it ... good luck ...
And yeah, do take a Urdu to Hindi dictionary, because most of the dialogs were just going over most of the audiences head as everyone was asking each other to decode what the actors just said.
The only reason i gave a 3 and not lower is because of the director's efforts to bring out a classic.
The reason the 7 is lost is because he used history to his convenience and imagination.
Inconsistent because I felt like I was watching Hrithik play several different characters in the film.
I don't think this was a result of the character growing because like I said; there really is no growth after his marriage to Jodhaa or any character for that matter.
Now I say the performance is unrefined because of the lack of character in the character (yes, I know that one hurt).
However, this arranged marriage was doomed a failure from all quarters, because of the difference in religion (she's a Hindu) and culture.
Swades hold u till the end of the movie and Lagaan does because Cricket in Lagan was the main lifeline of the movie along-with script  Hrithik, Aishwarya acted brilliantly along-with the entire cast  Technically it is one of the best which came out of India Cinematography, definitely deserve a special mention along-with Choreography   rating 7/10
Lets see it starts out with this whole "Troy-ish" Battle directly lifted out n copied or even remade to an extent..  then we go into the actual movie.. the essence of the movie was totally lost in my sense, The director lost me at least because of the length of the movie.. maybe he wanted to convey something great through his research but frankly what he did was nothing more than inflict pain... that was something i was hoping to forget by watching the movie...  Hrithik Roshan continues to amaze me till date with his varied acting talents n Mrs Aishwarya Rai.. lets just say that i don't very much care for what she does... 99% of it is crap anyway ....
My advice to the audience is to not miss Jodhaa Akbar because doing so would be a huge mistake.
The movie is made on the scale of a classic, but it falls short of the mark because it needs crisper editing.
She fits the role because she is usually stiff and aloof.
I cannot pinpoint the reason for this, maybe it was the bad moustache sitting above his lips, or maybe because I never pictured Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar to have such a beautiful body.
In a way, I am glad that the director hasn't used much restraint within the movie, because it would kill this feeling of 'je ne sais quoi' that flows through my enjoyment of this movie.
The 3 hours flew by because the story was captivating.
The results are mixed but laudable, largely because the script adheres to the golden rule about bringing historical episodes to film: know the history, but print the legend.
"Jodhaa Akbar" is not her best work, but it offers ample evidence of her growth along the spectrum of Paro-type roles she has enacted since Bhansalli's "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" : Nandini of "HDDCS," Paro of "Devdas," the eponymous Umrao Jaan, and now Jodhaa are essentially different interpretations of the same feminine archetype: a Lady Beloved of the Legends, who, having been robbed of all agency because of her gender, comes to embody beauty, suffering, fidelity, and, of course, love.
believed that he was capable of doing justice to this part and also because of his physique.
His natural choice for the lead of "Jodhaa Bai" was Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, not only just because of her beauty but talent as well.
I wouldn't want to compare it with Tare Zameen Par because it deserves to be a unique film in its own aspect.
The action (well that's when it gets around to it) is too little and unexciting martial arts... because we have to wait through long dry spells of talk.
I fell in love with this movie because of its brilliant actors, beautiful photography, intense atmosphere (ranging from serene to depressing) and last but not least because of the main musical theme.
A pity that because it was made in German so few people in the UK and USA are likely to see it.
where being hauled off in cattle trains by the minute, Nazis shoot people as sport and seize control of government, homes, businesses and yet a menage a trois was living a happy dissolute life because they have each other... that's suppose to be touching?!
According to his obituary in the New York Times, "Mr. Seres complained that the success of "Gloomy Sunday" actually increased his unhappiness, because he knew he would never be able to write a second hit."
My father and I went to see this movie he wanted to see it because we are Hungarian and wanted to hear what kind of music would be played.
My expectations were low, only because I didn't have a clue as to what to expect but, I'm very happy I saw this film.
This part was very predictable, since one knows after seeing so many stories like this, it always ends tragically because of Nazis, even friendly ones, as Hans was, deep down inside hates Joachim because he had what he never could have, Ilona.
And it's a good choice because the handsome young man, Andras, creates a wonderful mood on the premises.
I was quite sorry I didn't get to see it on the big screen, because most of the Australian movies I saw last year were pretty crappy.
It's a bit difficult to look at this film, because it's hard to figure out what it is.
Don't get me wrong, because Landau, Corbin, Martin Sheen and the rest of the commission are all very charismatic and a joy to see talking, to a certain extent.
If this film doesn't make you mad, check your pulse because you are not alive.
I have complete faith in him and the show because to me he is an inspiration.
I say that because he has a different kind of sense humor.
The Tonight Show is wonderful because he makes it so entertaining to watch.
To be really honest I hate talk shows and I avoided Leno's shows because well I didn't like him.
When the revelation comes there's not a big moment of surprise, and I think it's because you've not been led too far from the truth, because you're pointed in multiple directions you haven't been taken that far away to be whipped back to the surprise.
Extras Presented: Alternative endings, Audio commentary, Making of, deleted scenes with commentary, pre-visualisation sequences and commentary - The alternative endings are very interesting, and more-so because I thought the perfect ending for the movie was one of these and not the ending used in the theatrical version.
I watched the movie because it is casting DeNiro but it looks like all actors need money and they play also in bad movies.
I was expecting more, because i was missing DeNiro, but it seems like "disappointment" is the word that describes this film.
I surely hope that she will grow to be a first class actress, because we really need some!!
Next time your child tells you of imaginary friend then you might want to think twice because you never know...........8/10
I watched it because I like the people in it, and kept hoping it would improve.
Emily is soon in danger of being committed to a mental institution for the rest of her life because, or her fantasies, of him.
Emily doesn't appreciate this because she said that nothing can replace her mom.
I usually find myself hating characters of scary movies because they are so stupid or have dumb actions, but this movie is not one of them.
I enjoyed the movie because of the twist.
Dakota Fanning is one of my favorite child actors, and she is also awesome in the role of little Emily, not only because of her acting skills, but also because of her new look, with long and dark hair who really suits her.
I don't want to write too much about the story of this movie, because I guess it could ruin the movie.
I liked this movie because it was more psychological rather than chop and slash gore that most horror films use to scare people.
She does play her role well, and it was because of her that I watched this whole thing.
Hide and Seek lacks imagination anyways because the viewer is asked to be confounded by a series of disconnected scare tactics such as things jumping of closets, the last minute awareness of the culprit before the death of an unsuspecting victim, and above all, modern horror-thriller filmmakers determined to creep you out with some weirdo kid.
You will love the end of the movie because she played some great lines and action scenes and it really seemed like a good role for her to fill.
The production values are superior and the sound recreated for the DVD was a MUST because the movie is based on music.
#3- The "Good morning Heartache" scene at her birthday party at the club #4-The scene where she attacks Billy Dee in the bathroom, because he won't give her her dope #5- When Piano man is beaten to death #6-When she gets the call that her mother died,while she was in the middle of getting a fix..I COULD go on.
You may think it strange or inappropriate for my parents to take a 4 year old to an "R" rated film but majority of the films with mostly Black casts of this era were rated "R", usually because of vulgarity and violence.
My interest in Miss Holliday is strictly musical.In my opinion she was a considerable artist despite her lifestyle,not because of it.
The film would have you believe that Billie started shooting heroin because she witnessed a lynching; one of the dramatic highpoints depicts Billie on the tour bus reflecting on the horrors of lynching while we hear snatches of her most famous song, Strange Fruit.
It is difficult in hindsight to appreciate Billie's impact on vocal style simply because she so totally changed the way songs are sung, and every singer who came after her, whether they realize it or not, has been influenced by her on some level.
At first i thought she was 'reserved' because sh was supposed to be a prim,proper doctor, who had no time, even for having a manicure, for any social life.
great performances by Clark Gable-the doctor, and Myrna Loy, the 'high-maintenance socialite', who 'tosses' him because he stays to save a patient's life, rather than attend her party.
Her marriage to George Meeker is in jeopardy (again we see no scenes about this) because she can't curb her spendthrift ways.
We purchased this movie at a drugstore while on vacation because I remembered watching it a loving it when I was younger.
I can't figure out why people are saying that this film isn't melodramatic, because it really lays on the sap.
But as the story evolved, I also started to like this simplicity because of the authentic view it gives us of poverty in the Philipines.
Maybe because most of them here are westernised now, so they prefer to watch English spoken films.....well thats a sign that they are so easy to adapt(positive outlook in life).
It is because most of them(Filipino) has no culture and cant appreciate the real art.... its a shame and sad to admit but its true.
What is so wrong about a film which makes its viewers shed tears because of its sheer beauty?
Blessing, because she is not only beautiful but she is resourceful and  intelligent and lively, bane all other man in the little town man would like to get  to know her better.
Characters are full of charm, flesh and blood, and life... yes, Central European life after WWI (some visits to the area are still a good help in order to take better understanding... but be careful because later the understanding becomes LOVE forever, I can assure)   Just waiting the next one by Menzel, based on another classic by Bohumil Hrabal: I served the King of England.
I wasn't too keen on seeing this because i thought it would be a very kid movie, but i'm glad i did.
The movie is almost *corny*, but you can't help liking it, simply because you like the *people* and because you *want* it to be real.
I can't give it a high rating because of the flaws, but it's certainly worth seeing.
I took my girls, 7 and 5 to see this movie because it was the only kid movie that wasn't a cartoon.
i have just seen the film and it seems i cannot get a clear impression of it.it requires to be seen again because the action is well to take you by surprise in some points and then you discover that the previous lines had a different importance in the new light.
Nanny McPhee is brought to the attention of a man with seven children because McPhee is just the person he needs to end his seemingly awful dilemma.
I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another, cerebrally, emotionally or comically.
Couples who are looking for a date flick, do NOT be put off because it's a U.
Thanks to this, Thompson's endearing loveliness and a cute array of kids (lead by Thomas Sangster, the kid from Love Actually), Nanny McPhee emerges triumphant as one of the better kids movies in recent memory, mostly because the adults will love it too.
I almost missed this one because I was turned off by the commercials and previews, with their emphasis on the silliest parts (the dancing donkey, etc.).
And it was not just because it was an "EROTIC TALE"!
- It's dangerous to jump with a "cape" because you will think you can fly and forget to pull the rip cord.
I think it was because she appeared nude.
I am one of those who quit watching ER back when it was airing because of all the stars who left.
I now recall that I tuned into ER to watch this episode because of previews including clips of Liotta.
An almost flawless example of a certain zeitgeist of the early 70:s. There has been several films made in several countries around the basic theme: in an evil system it's the oppressors that are responsible for creating criminals, who are actually themselves victims of a faulty society, therefore criminals should be set free and the system overturn - a new, better system shall come in which, by default, there will be no crime because we won't have any cause for it.
Despite some hairspray style slo-mo montages and some awkward construction in the middle, the film manages to make it's potentially clichÃ©d story both involving and convincing, not least because of Giovanni's great sense of place and motion, with his fluid camera-work particularly striking.
I see this guy's next movie will star Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, that one looks like it will be one worth watching in theatres, not just because of the talented actresses but because it sounds like it has a great plot and story.
That's because his innocence has an egregious technicality; he had fiddled for the enemy, and liked it.
Plutarco wants to help his son but because he must travel through the soldier's camp in order to go to his small piece of land, he becomes the object of curiosity as the fiddler who becomes a figure of amusement for the commander of the troop.
These men, like most of their friends and neighbors seem doomed because the unfair way life dealt with them.
That little black and white film is in a way fascinating because it is not for us, its western audience, attached to Mexico only but to any south American country where the presence of Indians is important and where these Indians are systematically victimized and pressurized by the conservative if not reactionary governments and their armed forces.
In other words military action is never the right solution because it creates human suffering and it changes nothing : it seems that military action always leads to the victory of the most conservative and reactionary.
An interesting message buried here-in is that the young underestimate the old at their peril because the old are smarter, more sly, more patient and more experienced.
She shows us what the elderly are able to get away with because everyone discounts them and their worth.
I knew that it was just because LL got a bad press in middle America (which seems to be all America these days) so i decided to give it a go.
The only reason I have given it an extra star out of ten is because of the quite inventive gore scenes, other than that it confused the hell out of me, and Lohan may be have a hot body, but she and the film as a whole are terrible.
Is a worthy movie, entertaining, strong scenes, but is intended to see it to enjoy it, not in critic plan , because that way is easily to stick on his flaws instead of have an entertainment moment with it.
But if you are a Lohan fan, I say don't watch this because it does not make her look good.
I wont go into the detail of her life and what we see of it, because you can see that in the movie and read about it in the plot summary... some of the shots in this movie were spectacular... especially in the first half, and the final sequence in the water.. but there were points where her ranting and raving became almost painful to endure.. contradictory, angry, and occasionally insightful, Estamira is a rather unique and confusing person and her story is heartbreaking, although it is difficult to empathize given her temperament.
I really felt victims' hysteria because the scenarios seemed plausible and therefore much more realistic to me.
I gave it a 7 because even though it lacks in some departments some of the torture scenes were new and ones i've never seen presented on film before.
It's silly that some people are saying they don't like the movie because they weren't impressed with her strip dancing.
My advice, don't listen to all the nonsense out there right now because people are negative on Lindsay due to her bad press.
Yes it did have some over the top gory scenes, but isn't that a good thing for adult fans of the genre, i mean how come SAW became so popular and recommended, if you don't like gore then don't watch it, but don't give bad reviews of the film because you are too weak to stomach these scenes, i totally enjoyed it !!!
This film is long and may induce claustrophobia during several scenes, but it is absolutely thrilling because of Estamira.
I understand why Georgia Rule was said to be bad, because it really was...but this movie was really good!
Was he mad because she had a talent and was throwing it away?
I read about how terrible the movie is because some genius knew who the killer was from the start.
If you ask me, the movie reviewers are giving this film low ratings because they are haters.
But you are suppose to see the life of Dakota as story-like because you don't really know what is going on until toward the end of the movie.
:(  I am giving this film a 10 out of 10, simply because someone needs to balance out all of the falsely low ratings.
And, it's too bad, because it could have been better and Lindsay Lohan was really quite good in it.
"That's okay, because I have a twin sister that I never knew I had because me real birth mother had twins, and i was purchased by this guy who's wife had a miscarriage (she doesn't know, by the way).
And she is suffering from this conditioned called "twin stigmata", kinda like the twins on GI Joe (You know, you have to hit one to hurt the other type of thing), which is how I know how to write my only crappy story about her cause deep down inside I know she exists, and that is also the reason that she is randomly losing limbs while she is poll dancing in a strip club where she in the only one who doesn't take off her clothes (of course flashing her hooha to all the paparazzi is totally acceptable, but parish the thought that she flash a teet and get paid for it) is because that when you cut them off my body it falls off of hers.
Enjoy living with your under aged stripper twin sister, because with the way you write your stories, that is about the only place you are going to end up."
Not because I didn't want it - I did.
I think the reason this movie was panned was because "Lindsay Lohan".
Color (mainly the color blue) plays a vast amount of significance in the story, and while it is there for a purpose, it almost seems too obvious because the color pops up continuously in practically every scene.
I was surprised at the amount of violence in this movie, but don't dismiss it if you are thinking it's something along the lines of a blatant torture flick, because this movie has a lot more to it than just that, unlike the recent trend of horror flicks that are nothing but one big gory torture show.
As for the acting, I think a lot of people are slamming this movie unfairly because of it's lead actress, Lindsay Lohan.
It may be a bit of a stretch for some because of the obscure subject (and the revelation seemed to kind of come out of nowhere), but I liked it for being different and not what I'd normally expect in a twist ending.
She says that's the happiest she's ever been, because she had no luck in the world prior to that.
The girl is now 21, beautiful, and she says: "I feel resentment because I was not raised by my mother.
I watched this movie because there was really nothing else on at the time, but I found myself enjoying it.
At the end Camilla and Charles are tearful that he is going to be married, but this still dosen't make them nicer people to feel sorry for, because of what they are doing.
I gave the film 8 stars instead of 10, because I generally don't like these tell-all types of stories based on celebrity dirty laundry, but it was a good film with good acting; enjoyable overall.
However, she is immature because she lacks confidence in herself and how to deal with Danny.
This is my wife's favorite movie mostly because of John Travolta.
I saw Grease for the first time last summer because I was curious about the movie my mother loved so much.. Well, I loved that movie myself!
You probably don't understand Grease because you thought about it too much.
I ended up seeing it three more times while it was still in theatres because it brought back the same feelings plus new ones from having watched the film from an adult perspective.
On the one hand, it's easy for me to watch it so many times because it's a musical and when you find the tunes catchy you can't resist it.
All in all, a film that should be re-released every twenty years so a new generation of children and teenagers can watch it, not just because it was one of the last great musicals but also because it truly captures the essence of what it was like to grow up in the 50s.
  I think I laughed once at this film, watched it when I was ten or eleven, because it has a scene where one dog humps another.
They have made those ridiculous High School Musicals now and that annoys me because they are trying to match up to Grease, but Zac Efron and his Stupid "Crew" will never be able to beat Grease.
because those are both of the mayor elements that makes Grease such a great movie.
Honestly, because the film wasn't that good.
I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myself because of that.
It's funny because I liked "Saturday Night Fever" better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure.
Final Synopsis:  Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it.
It's really no wonder because the portrayal of America and its culture is so one-sided in this movie.
This is mainly because the movie is more based on Mahima's life.
Pity that Shahrukh Khan isn't at his best performance, because Mahima Chawdary is fill the entire screen with her spell binding act.
There's nothing to loose to watch this one, because it have charming plot, charming cast, charming view and charming memorable songs, that will make you on the edge of your seat.
Basically, if you're an ABCD or an NRI who has lived in America for 10+ years, you won't enjoy this movie, probably because many immigrants adopt the ways of the denizens (just human nature to do so I suppose).
I don't think Ghai tried to show NRIs in a bad light, because such differences and difficulties are to be expected in any kind of transition from one country to another, particularly when moving from a conservative and traditionalistic society like that of India to a liberal country like USA.
Although the frame story is - beyond all doubt - not excellent, the movie is worth 10 points in my opinion because it shows the wonderful skaters of the legendary Vienna Ice Revue.
Sometimes its good because its funny, sometimes its so bad its good.
The film earns a maximum of 10 points because it is one of the very few movies in which a European figure skating Champion also plays a main role in the frame story of a revue film.
... above is my email address so as to enable you to contact me if you want to - I know a great deal about figure skating history because I have learned so many details during the time my mother was the first female figure skating sportscaster for the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ORF.
She said no because turning pro would have exluded her from the following yearÂ´s championships.
Although she was - at the first go - the best European skater, she did not win the European Gold in 1948 because non-Europeans were allowed to participate, again for political reasons.
I love this movie because it is part of AustriaÂ´s figure skating history that is unique in the world.
I love this movie because it shows AustriaÂ´s figure skating queen Eva Pawlik.
He can only move one eye because the other one was frozen with a fire extinguisher'," and so on and so forth.
He just keeps rambling on about freezing him, and then it turns out that the fire extinguisher is empty, because Colin had been mucking around with it before the show.
However, just because we don't know who committed the two murders until the end, this doesn't mean Chabrol is only interested in artifical games.
I'm lucky to have picked this movie because with a franchise like _________________________ (insert corporate video franchise of your choice), you'd never know.
Before watching this film,I was thinking in this:''Another Asian horror movie.I think there will be the female ghost with a long black hair''.Long Khong uses that but its narrative took different ways for telling the story,which may not be too original,but at least,they are different than a lot of Asian horror films.That thing made me enjoy the film pretty much because that helps for creating an exotic tone which makes the movie really unpredictable.This film has some fails,like some scenes which are a little boring.Also,the ending was forced.But,in spite of that,Long Khong is ingenious,fun,unpredictable and very gory.And I really appreciated that.
Some of you will be familiar with this film because it was very successful in Thailand and its buzz reached our shores.
I've seen every Ma and Pa Kettle film made because I long to be as stoic, calm and unperplexed as was Percy Kilbride, so this film was doubly enjoyable because also I've always been a big Jack Benny fan due to the fact he had the best timing, on radio, TV and movies, of any comedian.
The equivalent of a MacGuffin, we know at a gut level Blanca is clearly dead, but in Esperanza's mind, she is not because she has just seen the apparition of San Judas Tadeo within her oven.
Sheridan and Benny are husband and wife Bill and Connie Fuller, about to be evicted from their apartment because of their dog shredding the hall rug.
Any fan of Jack Benny and anyone who has access to Benny's radio shows can benefit from "George Washington Slept Here" because you not only get a good look at the man himself, but in this case you get the extra benefit of seeing Benny and Kilbride reprise, so to speak, their wonderfully workable comedy.
He did this deliberately, because Jack had insisted Kilbride play the part when Jack Warner just wanted to insert one of his contract players.
When the director threatened to remove Benny if he continued this, then Benny decided to stay up all night before he had any scenes with Kilbride because then he was so exhausted that he just didn't care.
Perhaps it's because I saw this one first, or because it came first.
Esperanza discovers one day the image of Saint Jude, the patron saint of impossible causes, in the door of her grimy oven, which she has neglected because she has no Easy-off cleaner.
Her body is never released to Esperanza because supposedly it can spread a certain type of virus.
In Tijuana she gets a run around, and she ends up in a series of situations that involve prostitution, something that she does against he will because she is determined to find her daughter.
This sunny actress should be seen more often because she proves to be a natural in front of the camera.
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
And I only liked that show because at the start of the season its episodes were telling but it went downhill, all too willing to settle for melodramatic one shot story episodes in later seasons.
I originally saw the film because of Leonard Whiting (Romeo in the Franco Zefferelli film "Romeo and Juliet," opposite Olivia Hussey as Juliet), who plays a young member of Pizarro's party.
The first time I saw this flick, I was disappointed; disappointed because I'd expected an adventure tale of King Soloman proportions, an Aladdin's cave full of gold, and bloody Inca battles in a Peruvian jungle setting.
In hindsight, I should've read the reviews, because my frame of mind would've been in the right place to enjoy this intense character study.
I wish HallMark Entertainment would re-consider re-releasing the series on TV because I believe it will be great again!
I was however disappointed because the movie had many cut outs of interesting dialog that are in the tv 5 part episodes.
It's easy to tell this movie was made in the 80's because of it's animation.
Maybe because she was in misery as the movie played.
Or maybe because she didn't want to break the mood for her little boy.
I don't even know why I thought so.. maybe because I also dug Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman, and Batgirl.. but I digress.
They were flawed, and still we loved it... because we knew how to suspend our disbelief.
I think Wagner is used better here than in the chopper scene in Apocolypse Now and that is high praise indeed, because that is one of the most magnificent scenes in all of film.
I cry at the end of this movie everytime I see it and part of the reason is because I am sad at the death of Arthur who legend or not was a great man.
The other reason is because this is almost perfection in film and it is rarely achieved and it deserves to be appreciated.
The special effects hold up fairly well because there isn't an over-reliance on them to begin with.
For once, we realize how the Queen loved her husband as a king, but because he was so consumed by his duties, she could not love him as a husband.
They are, it has to be said, very welcome, because without the depictions of desperate, hand-to-hand battle, you might start comparing it with First Knight Â which would be something close to sacrilege.
We watched this the other night because of the reputation of the cast - particularly Mark Gatiss and David Tennant - not to mention the "iconic" nature of the name Quatermass.
The film endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings...
I own it on video and watch it now and again, and I hope that if Boorman ever makes Knight's Castle that he brings back Nicol Williamson as Merlin, because he's just too good in that role (despite the fact he must be really getting on by now).
If anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of Arthur's sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours.
That's because most of the stuff that's popular is the wide-eyed mindless "I fell on you and accidentally touched your boob hehehe" or "Haha the stupid chick found porn under his bed" drama type stuff.
He has a strong dislike for women, most likely because the women he falls in love with die or betray him.. Or both.
Of course, Lupin always forgives her, because he's crazy for her, but Jigen and Goemon knows she's more trouble then she's worth.
I say issues because the whole film does nothing to explain exactly what is wrong with her.
I'm kind of upset because I really, REALLY liked the first hour but by the end, it was kind of mixed up and left me going, "I REALLY hope this isn't the end of the movie" and it was.
I think a lot of people will hate this movie, because there is no a boy-loves-girl-marry-have children-happy ending story...
I was horrified because the violence is very real, I live in a country with a lot of drug problems, with about 16 dead people every day (men and women and children), so everything is possible... and even me was impressed!!
Regina Hall was good and the film earned a 2 because of that, and because Marisa Tomei made an obvious effort to interact with Hall in several critical scenes, keeping her 'angst' low-key while Hall's character got a chance to shine.
We watch Columbo or Monk intensely because we hope that in the end it will all come together; when it simply does not, we are robbed.
The only positive I can say is that I didn't turn it off because I genuinely wanted to find out what the heck was going on.
I admit, there will be boo-hooers who dislike it because they haven't the patience or the depth to grasp the true meaning behind this film, but this is why Danika is a work of art and it's star a true artist.
I wouldn't label it as 'unwatchable', because that would be unfair, considering that there are a few good things that deserve to be appreciated, but it's mostly Marisa Tomei's performance actually.
I'll be honest and say that I bought this because David Tennant was in it.
I didn't like the fact that it was so short it took me two days to beat and the final boss was the easiest battle in the game with the exception of the beginning random battles.I also want to know how they are going to start golden sun 2 (which should be coming out Christmas 2002 for all you golden sun fans)because if it's a different game pack than golden sun will they start with the average level of the game then factor in everything like spells and Items and then maybe start the game on the boat then have a secret closet where you can pick up any of the weapons you may have had.
OK. You get to put some time into puzzling, which is in my opinion, very good, because there is a good balance between puzzling and battling, though sometimes there are just too many random battles.
telling the truth about some people who are are forbidden from loving just because they love who they want to love and not who the society tells them to love.
I enjoyed this film very much because in many ways it was a change of pace; it takes the unconventional, homosexual couple and then puts them in a military setting which provides for an interest backdrop to a very human story.
I enjoyed it particularly because all of the characters from the cook to the main characters were very likable, and in spite of the brief nature of the film, I felt that they were still well developed.
I recommend this film to teenagers because there is a lot of different opinions on gay people and it really does make you look at it from a completely different angle.
The scene in the snow is thus not only the victory of joy and will to live over war (because we aren't allowed to forget these guys are in a war area), but also the liberation one feels when one is finally allowed to express feelings forbidden by society.
(he's the boy every other boy wishes he could have for life -- and i challenge the guy who says otherwise because he's lying.)
=)   as for the flow, the brevity of the film worked well because it really left the viewer wanting more.
Opposites attract: Yossi is a career man who has stepped out of character to love Jagger, is terrified of discovery, and reluctant to declare his love; Jagger, so nick-named because of his seductive rock star looks (Mick was sexy, but never this sweet and seraphically beautiful), is a free spirit who is beginning to demand that they live in the open.
I said it because I didn't expect that much from the movies, I never thought they share a same rhythm of the aesthetics with me, a person from a totally different culture background.
I also recommend it because it is not a shallow combination of gay love and war, but a profound discussion of joy and death.
One can easily relate with many of the characters - people whom we forget are people, just because they are in the army, just because they are in a war.
Maybe because of that particular scene, one can survive as a viewer to the end of the movie, and still feel light as a feather.
Perhaps because this film was made outside of the US it was able to portray its protagonists as people instead of story line characterisations.
I needed more between Jossi and Jaggar - in particular more kissing because it was wonderful.
Furthermore, because there is so much about these characters that we do NOT know (like Lior's mother), we, like her, find the conclusion of the film to be particularly wrenching.
Yossi and Jagger is a bittersweet love affair between two Isreali soldiers, very well played by Yehuda Levi , and Ohad Knoller, you could feel the love they had for each other and the hurt Jagger was going thru because they had to be so careful as they were officers.
These actors make their characters work on the movie because of the intensity of their contribution to the film.
We had much too many of them and they are always hard to swallow because they always end in a catastrophe.
It's stunning Â you wouldn't guess they're a couple because they learned to hide it very well, but when they are alone you get a hint at how much they love each other.
Also because of the two great protagonists: Israeli TV star Yehuda Levi is terrific as Jagger and the charismatic Ohad Knoller is simply wonderful as Yossi (he was awarded for his performance).
The greatest regret in the film is the fresh, forceful performance from Eric Linden as Richard - the boy on the verge of manhood, struggling with the same essential sexual/social issues every young man struggles with, even if they may seem "quaint" and even shallow in this period telling (we only imagine it's somehow different because of the period specifics).
And because we know what O'Neill was going through, seeing this version is not reassuring at all.
Partly because it was live, partly because it was cheap, and partly because the people who created this were completely lacking in intelligence or imagination, it was utterly without even a pretense of supporting special effects (e.g., monitors with important data the actors are all discussing are tilted away from the camera so you only see the back of the monitor), the sets were plain and very few, the audio was terrible, the whole show was dark and dreary looking, and the ending was as uneventful and lame as any movie or television program I've ever seen.
He'd do her in a heartbeat, but he backs off, to a certain extent because he doesn't want her to find out the truth, but what's more because he shamefully likes the way of life with Norma.
Wilder creates an exceedingly absorbing effect here, because when he escapes to see his old pal Jack Webb, and tension grows between him and Betty, Norma's world sure has gotten stuffy by that time and we feel a great deal of solace from her twisted realm.
Sunset Boulevard is a movie about movies; one of the first called FILM ever made by Hollywood - because it's a state of art, a piece in art form... an authentic gem.
The best film noir ever done, no doubt about it (can't be compared to other ones because of its subject, of course!)
Is the movie disturbing because of the interplay of the characters or because we, as an audience, do not want to venture into this world of forgotten stars and empty theatres ?
This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice.
I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her, rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad.
I even suspect that he only allows Joe into the situation because he knows that Joe is weak and no real threat to his power; and that he suspects that it will help placate Norma by feeding her fantasy of a comeback.
The stories about the decline of Mary Pickford, Mae West and Pola Negri to play the part of Norma Desmond, the mysterious beginning of the movie, that, after a disastrous preview, was cut and vanished forever (rumours have it, that Billy Wilder himself had a copy of it, but refused to screen it because the experience was too painful for him).
It's hard to imagine, that Montgomery Clift really left 2 weeks before shooting, because he didn't wanted to be seen as the lover of an elder woman.
For me it only shows, how unnecessary awards are, because often enough highly qualified actors and actresses are overlooked.
The comedy is sly, the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress.
Norma's dream of return, held to for 20 years, is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria.
Usually, Cinema is considered as the most delicate form of art because it has the biggest potential to become 'dated' one day.
Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood.
This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography.
One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage.
If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.
You do have to pay some attention to this flick because the humor is character-based and until they develop it's slow.
How many movies have you gone to see because of the cast,  only to see their talents wasted?
Nowadays television audiences are much more sophisticated and television in the 21st century is more of a bastard child of cinema than theater , but it would be both churlish and incorrect to state that the failings and the lukewarm reception of this remake are down to the audience because the fault lies entirely with the production team   A lot of people have complained about the anachronistic feel of the production .
Of course Miller is directing a live broadcast where anything or everything can go wrong so perhaps we should be more forgiving because of the amount of pressure he was under .
It just leaves me wondering: who screwed up the marketing for Gunshy, because this is definitely a film that deserved a much better reception than it got.
Liam's character, Charlie was stressed to the max, but who wouldn't be, if your life is always on the line because of your chosen profession.
I was reading other user comments and read that the script was non consistant because one minute the character is showing pictures of his wife and kids, but really he's gay.
It deserved a better fate because of the funny screen play Mr. Blakeney created and the wonderful cast that was gathered for the picture.
Andrei Tarkovsky noted there are two kinds of filmmakers Â those who try and (re)create reality and those who create their own worlds; Biller is clearly in the latter camp, and she has to create a world because that is the only way she can get at the truths about relations between men and women, desire, identity, and the ravages of history on individual life.
I watched this with some friends and there were times when we had to actually stop the DVD because we were laughing so hard!
I loved this film because I never knew what was going to happen next, despite it following the model of '60's/'70's sexploitation films pretty closely.
I caught this film at it's Pre - World Premiere at a press screening at the Rotterdam Film Festival back in January of this year and I really enjoyed it, mainly because I have never seen anything quite like it before and don't expect that I will likely ever see anything like it again.
I hope I get the chance to see this film again because I would not hesitate to make some phone calls and round up a posse, Viva is definitely a film experience that would make for some excellent post film discussion over drinks.
And many of these movies were landmarks, because they so perfectly captured a unique time or place, or because of technical achievements or great acting.
and the voice-overs were done by the same people from the hobbit..i think they were way below the voice-overs in the lord of the rings movie .. the hobbit was neat in its time but the return of the king is an unfair adaptation of the remaining 11/2 books ...i heard they are making a live action version of the lord of the rings in 3 parts i hope they use generated effects for some of the characters because midgets arent the same as hobbits ...i look forward to seeing all 3 movies
Now I'm really glad that New Line is coming out with this new trilogy because Return of the King was a farce.
I don't believe people are giving this movie the benefit of the doubt, because it seems simplistic compared to the Peter Jackson extravaganzas.
This is not just because of the well-compressed storyline, but because the design for both Frodo and Sam is just so cute.
I gave this a 4 ... only because it is still Tolkien somewhere there in the background.
A lot of elements that could have been very cool, like the Army of the Dead, are completely missing from this film and I have to assume it was because they would be too costly and difficult to animate.
This film in particular was very sought after in the 1980s, because unlike the other two it was not widely available on video.
Intended to wrap up the story-lines of the incomplete Ralph Bakshi version of The LOTR, it fails because for some unfathomable reason it omits a HUGE chunk of the storyline following the point where Bakshi's film quit.
And because they were the only production entity that had pioneered the "dramatic animated television special," they could take this type of story and put it into the context that was its rightful due.
This "film" caused such a bliss here in MÃ©xico just because the female lead role, Patricia Llaca, appears full naked at the beginning; you wanna know what's the worst thing about it?
), or was it because the movie poster has a photo that shows Llaca's butt cheeks?
Audiences in the 1930's might have appreciated this work because of the rights of women suffrage but it totally dismisses the black struggle.
but I would definitely check the remake out for changes in plot and theme because of social change (the predominance of the civil rights movement.)
Peola, Delilah's "high yalla" daughter is in constant torment, because Jessie, Beatrice's daughter of the same age as Peola makes her aware that she has a percentage of black "blood."
I suppose I prefer the pancake story better, because I get sick of seeing pretty women become successful actresses in movies.
She is simpleminded, seems to be able to function only in a relationship of dependency, as is illustrated when she turns down Miss Bea's offer of a 20% stake in a multi- million dollar business that was based on her pancake recipe because she wants to stay a housekeeper.
Poor acting is often as much the fault of the director as the actor, because it is the skilled director's job to "pull" the performance from the actor no matter what it takes.
Sadly, this seems to be because the Beavers character has accepted her downtrodden role in life.
This starts an unusual partnership both personal and business because Claudette's late husband was a seller of a cooking syrup and Louise makes a melt in your mouth type of pancake.
Stan Musial when he was making big money as a baseball star had a mother who took in washing back in the little steel mill town of Donora, Pennsylvania where he came from and not because he wasn't willing to provide.
I knew I had seen it on tv many years ago, guess it's not shown anymore, possibly because of racial overtones.
Based on a Phillip K. Dick story (the writer of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep," which was the background for "Blade Runner") this movie delivers, but suffers because of the apparently tight budget.
Beavers, in the story, is luckier than most of her people because she has made a large amount of money as Colbert's business partner.
I purchased this movie because of Louise Beavers.
This Bea Pullman is easier to take because the way she makes her money by going into business, capitalizing on Delilah's idea about the marketing the perfect blend for pancakes.
I love her in Cabaret and I refuse to see any production of the musical because I can't imagine anybody but Liza as Sally Bowles, the sad Berlin singer who craves the love of a good man and the love of her own father in the film.
Woody Allen's sex comedy hasn't been well received, and that's a shame because it's actually quite good; one of Woody's funniest films, in fact.
The transvestite segment borders between hit and miss, but it's a hit on the whole; it's one of those sketches that has you cringing and the only thing you can do is laugh, and it works because of that.
The two best vignettes also work well because Woody plays them close to the style of their inspirations.
But anyway, none of the segments are long enough to make you go bored or loose interest just because you don't like one of the segments.
Other actors that really draw your attention in this movie, also because you just don't expect them to see in this movie and in the roles they play (such as Burt Reynolds) are Gene Wilder as the doctor who falls for a sheep and also John Carradine in a crazy scientist role, also no doubt as a fun homage to his horror movies past, from mostly the '40's.
The only reason why I picked it up in the first place was because of its cover.
There's this Gothic kid in school and he goes crazy because of the fact the teacher didn't like the fact that the kid made a horror flick instead of what he was told to do.
The death scenes are very poor (little gore, chills) and that's a shame because some of them had potential.
Now, forget you read all that because you are never going to want to sit through this horrible movie.
I will just assume it is in Orange County, because that makes me feel a little less disturbed when teenagers die.
For instance, when the coach dies (which is cool by the way because the coach is an ass clown), the killer tapes up a picture of Mr. Hadden.
And he also has to to take his shirt off because he seems to be really proud of his chest.
Funny enough, Serbs see him as stereotypical Albanian... Toni GojanoviÄ... is chosen for this role simply because he's Croat... Croatia have much better actors than him (is he an actor at all?
Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories.
may-bee because it was good for living?
Actors are perfect, maybe because it's a true story and it's not very different from what happens in their real life.
I recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to the Yugoslav folks who enjoyed their life in the Former Yugoslavia because it will give you a good feeling of being there for 90 minutes.
It would probably be rated NC-17 in USA, or at least a very hard R. Especially because of the pubic hairs, lots of graphic sex scenes, penis shown etc, hard swearings...The story is good, nice and funny dialogs, great swearings.
This is because one of the characters that doesn't shut up is the Great Prince, and he's voiced by Patrick Stewart.
This movie actually sucked so bad I had to turn away a couple of times, because the acting was so corny and ludicrous!
Sure, "Bambi II" is not better than the original, and that's OK because it doesn't try to be better.
It was mediocre music and it didn't take away from the movie itself because the animation was so true to the majestic original.
But don't take that as meaning that this film is bad because it was actually a pleasant surprise.
I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!).
Bambi 2 is a definite recommendation, it's a different Disney sequel than I've ever seen because it seems like this one could have been in the theaters.
I was so afraid to watch this movie, because Bambi is one of my favorite cartoons ever, and I was afraid that this sequel will spoil it.
Perhaps it's because there's a legitimate gap in the original story for this to fill (Between the death of Bambi's Mother and his return as an adult), or maybe because of the creative details that were added (Several ideas and sequences were taken straight from the book, which was a nice surprise), but I found myself genuinely enjoying this movie.
It is hard to figure out who Bob's wife was in the later show ("Newhart") because of this.
This is a weakness in the plot because it would be better suited for the shock of a civilized couple to relocate into a red-state.
I've never thought of him as an actor and that's simply because an actor would never have the skill to appear as natural as he does.
But because of the intensity of his love, when the lad vanishes, the soldier must hunt in the Thai jungle for him.
Nevertheless, the film still connects with us Occidental types, possibly because it explores that universal belief all humans seem to share - undoubtedly implanted onto our DNA way back in our primeval days - of a so-called enchanted forest, a place where evil in a monstrous form may be lurking beneath the dark underbrush ready to jump out and devour us at any unguarded moment.
Even if every single moment is not comprehensible to us, this is still a wonderful film to watch, primarily because Weerasethakul brings such a lyrical, impressionistic style to his direction.
And the faeries begrudgingly let her keep him, because she held on to what she loved, despite the way it changed with time.
but because he wasn't a boy he had to leave.
Seriously, the movie deserves to be watched because putting this into words is almost like betraying its spirit.
As a point of interest, films like this one tends to irritate viewers and one watches as how a theater empties out because people don't want to sit through any more.
This ripoff of "King Kong" has got to be one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen, just because of how it never takes itself seriously.
For years I waited for some movie to be made about Rubin Carter, because I loved to see him box at the old MSG, and to see this movie was very disappointing.I have alot of respect for Mr Washington, but he was awful and boring.There is really nothing good to say about this movie except I did like the song.
Robinson , Hagler , Ali or Hearns he was not   Oh yes he was WRONGLY convicted of murder and just to lay it on with a trowel a very early scene has the sadistic warder from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION telling the wronged but noble Rubin to keep calm because he knows a cruel injustice has been done but there's nothing he can do to help .
Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist .
We know they're racist because the arresting officer states " Your black ass is going down " , but that doesn't worry Rubin because he defiantly replies " I know I'm innocent " and he is , such a pity that the twelve jurors were all white and all racist and decided he was guilty simply because he was black .
It doesn't play hard and fast with the facts because there's little in the way of facts .
You can also forget all about the racist arresting officer investigating the murder case because he's a composite character that includes at least one black detective so racism wasn't at the heart of the case .
Rubin Carter was dishonourably charged from the army and never had a distinguished military career , the jurors in the case included two blacks and he was found guilty by a unanimous decision so having " a black ass " wasn't a motive for finding him guilty , he was finally released on a technicality not because he was innocent and there's umpteen other revisionist aspects to the story .
Sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture.
The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*SEMI-SPOILER*) hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.
I do not like movies (especially Hollywood interpretations) that are based on "true" stories because they usually distort the "true" parts into something else, something not so true.
Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello.
Went into the cinema with absolutely no preconceptions of the show - hadn't heard of it, or its sequel, and chose it because it looked like it might be good, brainless entertainment.
That never happens because Cena is never established as a badass in any way besides just being jacked.
The action, when it happens, isn't bad, and it would seem that the only thing John Cena CAN do (because he certainly can't act) is beat the crap out of people while grunting and growling like a caveman.
Well, that can be skipped for this film, because the plot is so ill-thought out that there might as well not be one.
The foul language sounded so ridiculous because of horrible acting, and often didn't fit with the context.
Looking over the posted comments here regarding this one, I can't help but feel that Television has wrecked havoc with the taste buds of most viewers- because MIGHTY PEKING MAN, more than anything else, reminds me of an episode of a really bad television show (take your pick, from day first to this- and they're still being cranked out with mind-numbing regularity); nothing more, nothing less.
And of course its action because the WWE wrestlers just want to prove their masculinity.
But the special effects team must've been on crack because the blasts look like splashes of Sunny Delight, and the gunfire looks like it was made from a home computer with just that stupid orange X and the annoying sparkles that we see.
I didn't give this the lowest score because some of the fist fights here were alright and I liked some of the pop-culture references such as the ones to Terminator and Scarface here.
The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable.
But about 1/3 of the way through this poor excuse for an action film, I was very happy that they had him wear a camouflage Army cover (hat for you non-military types) instead of a cornered Marine issue cover when he saluted that officer because neither he nor his character deserved to wear a Marine uniform.
There's an almost interesting interplay between war-weary Brits and callow Yanks; almost, because nothing's investigated in any depth.
OK, the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale.
The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it.
Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by Ben Mezrich.
I say almost, because the film depressed me completely by it's badness.
In fact the one argument in their favour - that replacing the one train with loads of bus routes and motorways would have huge environmental concerns and destroy the countryside - is mentioned once and then forgotten about; it seems that we're supposed to support them simply because, well, they want to run a railway and it's quite a nice hobby.
A young girl (9 years) named Ociee Nash from Mississippi is turning out to be something of a tomboy, which her father worries about because of her lack of a mother (died from measles).
The book answers some of the questions the movie raises but because they are so dissimilar it might not be useful to use one to answer the other.
Baywatch might have been corny but it was a guilty pleasure loved by millions because it was light-hearted fun.
The dog ended up having to be shot after contracting rabies because.
Even when I was a kid, I had no problem with that because I knew that rabies just wasn't treatable in those days.
Score: 1 because it's the lowest score I can give.
But all credibility which this movie may have had, washed away for me because there was no dirt, no mud, no decay, no rats, no lice, no corpse stink, no depiction of the truly terrible conditions in which these people fought and slogged and died.
This film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually address any issues.
It is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the Palestinian side, while displaying the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side.
I will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me.
This movie is rated to high in my opinion, because there is no explicit cruelty in it (which is a plus!
However, it was not in huge amounts, was not horribly addictive and did not leave people shells of their former selves because of drinking it!
I sure hope that some other video company releases the film after some restoration work--it was interesting and I really wanted to finish it, but couldn't because the print was THAT bad.
Unlike some real Western classics like "The Searchers", "Rio Bravo", "Open Range" and others, this film left me with a bad taste in my mouth both because of characters and the so called realism.
Just because the cowboys are dirty and dusty instead of clean and in fancy shirts, doesn't make it realistic.
However, the way it plays out is that she doesn't seem too concerned about it, because frankly she is not too invested in the character.
Due to a rival drug dealer the boy cannot make it because he gets kidnapped.
I couldn't help but laugh, partially because of how ridiculous he was acting and partially because I wasn't connected to either character in either way.
I decided to give this one a chance because it is by the same maker as Angel of the Night which I thought was pretty good.
This may be unfair because we only watched the first 25 minutes of this movie.
I bought this movie because Jan-Michael Vincent made a appearance in it.
No, its watchability is because it is so bad...so incredibly lacking in any subtlety that make it a must-see for bad movie fans.
The film begins with a judge lecturing two parents and basically saying that any time a teen goes bad it is because the parents are to blame!
Oddly, however, they are not caught for the longest time because you can only assume everyone in the town (especially the cops) are idiots!
Overall, because the film is so earnestly stupid, it holds a near and dear place in the heart of every bad film fan--you know, the sort of people who enjoy laughing at horrible films as an exercise in self-torture.
In short, it's the fault of the parents that Paula turned to a hobby of crime because they didn't give her enough love or force religion upon her.
(possibly because Ed Wood only wrote it, didn't direct it) but it's still terribly entertaining.
The movie deals with a newspaperman's daughter (who looks about the same age as her parents) who has become a wild child because her father is too busy at work to notice that he keeps giving her the same birthday present every year.
I only bought this one because Gary Busey was listed, and figured...Even if he only has a small part, it might be interesting.
The only thing/reason why i'm giving this one 3stars is because of the beginning and the end of the movie..it starts okay...and ends in a way that I didn't expect.You do wonder how it's going to end, and look at every angle...but that's it.
After a lengthy pause on the phone, his response was, "because there's an audience."
It is absolutely hilarious because it's so bad.
Hm...u So let me sum it up: Bad characters, bad story because old old story with no fresh material in it, bad actors, movie FULL OF stereotypes (people who smoke weed are like this, cops are like that, people living far from the cities are so AND SO ON!)
A shame, really, because the premise is solid enoughÂhulking maniac Jeremiah has spent thirty three years hiding under the floor of his cabin after witnessing the rape and murder of his mother by rednecks, and now kills anyone else who should stumble across his homeÂand although not great actors by any stretch of the imagination, the cast are likable enough.
But the couple that was having the baby annoyed me at the end, because they had a 2nd chance to get away and they're doing the "Run!
And after he almost loose the race because of the engine trouble he suddenly got the machine together and wins the race in the last second.
Then a zombie comes knock down the boy (the girl were enjoying with her eyes closed) and started licking the girls toes for a little time when it Bytes her toes and she starts screaming because she thoughts that there was the boy licking her.
The only reason this got made was because the businessmen behind it (I refuse to call them film-makers)knew they could secure a DVD deal in the States.
At times it comes across as a decent flick with good angles and some good cues of music but these things are all made useless because there is no pacing.
And as bad as SON OF KONG is, I still like that one more; it's more enjoyable, more relaxing, and there are way better fights because there are dinosaurs and giant bears and you can at least have a good time.
It was disturbing because you expected her to become "tough" and she does, but in such an unamusing and forced way.
Additionally, Wong's character was a real negative because she never really could make up her mind whether or not to be evil--spending so much of the film bouncing back and forth---and in the process losing all the cruel menace that SHOULD be part of any Fu Manchu picture.
At the end of it you think back to the film and although most of it was less than mediocre, you still class it under "Ok" simply because of the ending.
OK this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than Peter 'Robocop' Weller but that doesn't matter because what it does have is a good story well told.
Do we have to applaud this film because it is a foreign film (read: 'Art-house cinema') or do we praise the film for dealing with the holocaust issue.
But, for some reason, many film watchers think that they must automatically heap praise upon any foreign made movie because it's the "in" thing to do.
Sure, I would not like to be a Holocaust survivor and to be forced to watch this movie, because I would be probably deeply offended.
In "Life Is Beautiful," however, Roberto Benigni's character Guido is Jewish only because the film announces that he is.
It's too bad she's only got 10 or so minutes of screen time because I dig some of those costumes.
You're not laughing because it's fun, but because it's bad.
Most people seem to despise this and it's predecessor, because they seem to ask too much of a B-Movie - This, like the last is NOT supposed to be of Indiana Jones quality for Pete's sake - All a B-Movie has to do is Entertain, something which this does from start to finish.
You know it's a pretty screwed up place because one of its twin queens is played by Elvira and the evil high priest is Henry Silva in one of Diana Ross's old Afro wigs that's seen much better days (as indeed has he).
I can see the first film as a parody of the INDIANA JONES series, but this one just bad because... well, it's bad.
However, there he is, in scene after scene, in filthy clothing, telling people that their ass stinks, and then throwing himself pity parties because the other kids don't like him.
Now the fact that the DVD is one day over due, makes me sick to my stomach because not only could i get a 4piece chicken nuggets for the price of that DVD, i could have helped a starving child.
I feel bad because there are people out there who wait tables work in restaurant cleaning just to get an acting gig.
The only reason I would give it a 1 is because of the murder scene in the woods (you know what I'm talking about) and the broom stick scene.
If you're a fan of the series, give it a look because everyone has their own opinion but don't say I didn't warn you.
Unfortunately, my guess is that these three cast members and the director, only returned because they needed the money.
On the other hand, if you are sensitive, please refrain from watching 'Return to Sleepaway Camp', because it's a major disrespect to the first film and it hurts a lot to see a sequel that is so incredibly inferior in every single way.
I mean I've seen some doozy of some bad movies but this one takes the cake and not in a good way lol Granted some of the violence was like the rest of the sleepaway camp movies which was cool.But they edited it like crap because half the deaths you didn't even see just an aftermath which absolutely sucked I expected this sucker to be pack full of gore but I didn't see much of that which was also a disappointment for a Sleepaway movie especially.
The movie was unintentionally hilarious literally I was laughing my ass off throughout most of this movie it was as if all the actors were reading DIRECTLY off their cue cards it was hilarious lol   For instance 2 actors I can remember off the bat because they were BARELY ON lol   Girl: stiff lifeless and wooden delivery: Stop it Allen you retard.
He's either starting trouble or the recipient of it, but Allan is certainly a lightning rod towards the inner-workings of the plot..the film displays many embarrassing scenarios featuring the flabby whiner and people die because this.
Fans of the franchise(..which I'm not)might find this irresistible, because RETURN feels positively dated, attempting futilely(..in my opinion, at least)at sophomoric humor, failing miserably.
This movie had absolutely no balance whatsoever because the one person we're supposed to feel sorry for ("Alan") is such an obnoxious and hateful tool himself.
I gave this movie 3 out of 10, and that's because a few of the murder scenes were somewhat creative.
I rented this movie because of the Kevin Smith connection, since I'm a huge Smith fan.
Low budget film is a wretched mess made only because filmmaker Kevin Smith has a heart for fellow filmmakers and helped produce this abortion.
We feel a little ripped off because the trailer really set us up to expect something else.
Smith has to be a nice guy, because then he helped few Jersey friends with their projects.
Just one conclusion at the end Â responsible for this mess is no one else but Kevin Smith, because sometimes helping your friends can lead to creating a really smelly monster.
(This must have been directed by the Barry Levinson who worked on the TV show "Storybook International," because it can't have been the other Barry Levinson.)
Do not watch this movie expecting to see any monsters or vampires because all you'll get are some bats.
I apologize, but one of the few reasons that I liked House Party was because they followed the K.I.S.S.
I used the word "repetitive" several times in this paragraph because it demonstrated the annoying repetitive nature of this film and completed my point about using that element as a cheap trick.
After the first twenty minutes of this, it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.
Strange thing, too, because while I was watching this I couldn't find a single positive redeeming quality to raise my opinion of it - even the locations are not photographed very attractively.
Not that he should have been doing silly things because of his age, but because he didn't show the passion he should have.
I find the use of the constant swearing distracting because it is anachronistic.
Greenburg, despite his dashing, cute puppy looks, could not carry the leading man role because he seemed afraid to take the reigns.
All of the romance that is supposed to touch you and bring you closer to the characters really just pushes you away because the scenes presented are so hard to swallow.
Despite the fact that Rafi insists to her therapist/Dave's mom that she is serious about this relationship, it is hard to believe because you see nothing that Rafi and Dave have in common besides art and even that link is iffy and seems tacked on just to draw some connection between them.
Honestly, I had a lot of expectations for this movie, because of my fondness for Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman, and I was pretty disappointed.
When I first heard of this movie I couldn't wait to rent it because the previews made it sound hilarious.
At times you want to strangle him because he's so bad of an actor.
Dave throws a fit because Rafi expects him to act like a grown-up.
*Shudders* The only good parts of this whole movie, if you want to call it that because it's an hour long, were "The Whore" and "The Amazing Racist, Part I" Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
Perhaps it's because I'm not over 40, but I did not enjoy "Something's Gotta Give".
When the male nurse solemnly walked into the mother's funeral with a RIBBON-WRAPPED WATERMELON (because we saw ONE scene where the nurse "smuggled" watermelon to the mother in the hospital.... is fruit really contraband in a HOSPITAL!?!)
The main character, an old Jewish man, is so annoying, and everybody just adore him "because hes so magic" (blaaaahhh), so I actually cheered on the Germans.
You'll need a program to tell you what is going on, because like most modern actors, these bores cannot enunciate.
Which is just as well, because it is garbage by any standards.
There's a lot of killing and action, but it doesn't work, because you have no idea why it is going on, or how it is going on.
The action doesn't work, because it is just another neo Nazi idealist director and writers contriving every instance to save blonde women and butcher brown eyed brunettes.
Kudos to Kal because he is always entertaining, but this one sucked.
Some people might be tricked into watching because its called Van Wilder.
The most amusing scene comes somewhere in the middle, and that's just because it's ripped of from the first one.
And even then, I was forcing it just because I felt like I forked down $10, and if I didn't even laugh once, I'd have been bamboozled of my money.
I really don't know how anyone who read this script could agree to do it, especially him, because he was the only actor with a future in this movie.
I can only hope that movie studios will forgive him, because it was difficult to watch this.
The lesson they learned, supposedly, is not to get a big head because they aced it going forwards but couldn't cut it backwards without power(believe it or not!!).
NOT because it was good, but because high noon is a complete disgrace to the other 3 movies.
Three brothers who happened to be in an amusement park will save the day because the amusement park is taken over by terrorists!
Not a bad plot because it introduces some fun scenarios.
I hope they don't keep it in the video stores, because kids don't need to see all that bad acting.
I like a lot of character actors because they tend to get the most interesting variety of parts.
All in all I would say watch this movie because it's got Hulk Hogan in it.
This is one movie where I was actually wanting the villains to win, because of the annyoing, constipated sounding screeching noises that "Tum-Tum" was making for karate yells and what not.
the only reason i rented this garbage excuse for a movie is because i am a big fan of the original 3 ninjas movie.
  I saw this film with my daughter (6 years old) and her friend (7), none of whom are Rugrats fans, mostly because they consider the Rugrat's humor to be too immature and inappropriate.
I'm not giving this movie the worst rating, because it might be enjoyable for a few Rugrat fans.
A deserved 2/10 (because it had the Thornberries, which are better).
and on top of that it was rude..i felt bad because they would get more and more personal to the person that they are up against.
The story even becomes predictable, because every scene is merely a vehicle for Milch-speech.
an actor with a wide range of possibilities who fails to work his charms on you because he is given very little to work on.
This was the responsibility of T. Guerra, a name that I have come to hate because, even if I agree that La Notte was a masterpiece and L'Aventura comes pretty close, I see them mostly as the result of Antonioni's vision, and Guerra's later projects convinced me he wasn't much of a screenwriter after all.
This is a very bad movie because Muslims should stay with Muslims.
I gave it a 1 out of 10, only because 1 is the lowest # I could rate it.
To some extent, this is acceptable, because Yella isn't given any good explanation of what's happening, and so, we can also be left in the dark.
When Yella proclaims her love to her new-found companion, I lost any sympathy I had for her, because it is obvious that she is the typical weak female, falling for 'the bad guy', and she doesn't even try to change her fate.
None of the actors were in any danger of drowning during the making of this show simply because they were all so horribly wooden and would have floated without a problem if they'd fallen in.
Which is a good thing, because the last thing I need when I get hold of the actual books to read is to have the awful scenes of this production spring into my mind's eye.
First I will admit, I did not watch the whole mini-series all the way through and jumped around bit after the first part because I was so disappointed.
Anyway I don't have time to slate this really, I'm only reviewing it to give it the one star it doesn't even deserve to take the average rating down, it's much too high because of all these people who don't know any better reviewing it without having knowledge of the book.
They can't do it because there is no possible good reason.
Authors should be allowed to have final say about how scripts adapting their works are developed, instead of having to sit back and watch the monstrosities that are created just because they sold the rights to their works to a studio.
it's a great movie!I loved it!I am not to old but I may answer a few questions...the kidnappers hijacked the VPs plane because it was more important then another plane.They did not use a bomb because they wanted something(the fellow terrorist to be released)...if they had used a bomb of course they didn't have to tell because everyone would know what to do(capture them or stop the bomb).I totally agree with Michael Mays!Maybe if people would not want to see an EXTRA MOVIE then they would like it...it's a great movie if you know how to enjoy good films.Of course it borrows something from 4 movies but come on it is great the way it is.I liked the acing especially the terrorists.
On the other hand, things that aren't do, because if everybody's first impression would be their most lasting, it would not be a good one.
These plot holes were not pieces of the world left out because of time and budget constraints.
Wait, maybe he couldn't because the evil king was on board one of the ships, and the king needed them to advance the plot.
The Sci Fi channel should have put some of their marketing money into production, because this was not only a BAD adaptation of an incredible book, it was the worst I've ever seen.
Unlike some, my dismay is not because they changed the story from the books - screen adaptations do that all the time, sometimes to an extreme degree like here.
Even my husband, who is not a fan of the books, didn't want to keep watching it (we tuned out after about 45 minutes and then looked in twice more for about two minutes each), purely because the script was so wooden (oh, for the lyricism of Le Guin's original prose!)
I started out very nervous about this, because Ged was cast with blond curly hair - but I couldn't have possibly imagined how profoundly awful it would be.
This film is a criminal oversight on the IMDb's Worst 100 films ever made because, without a doubt, this film should be included in the top 10 of that chart.
Maybe because we didn't see the start but all kinds of plot lines didn't appear to make sense, nothing seemed to follow on from each other, I never felt any tension in the movie and upon watching the scene near the end with Grace Jones water skiing (?)
even the crew realized what a turd this movie was....one guy just walked off the set, and i had to double for him, look for when the kid falls of the back of the boat and two guys haul him out of the water, they switched us mid scene, because they were to lazy to do a reshoot, and i look NOTHING like the guy i switched with...I'm at least 60 pounds more than him and a half a foot taller...i was the only extra that would get in the water without a fuss, i worked as a plumbers apprentice once...a little water doesn't bother me
Of course so much cricket sound was recorded probably because they used the camera mic rather than a boom.
So this is an example where a movie is made basically unwatchable because of such poor sound quality.
Also, don't use you friends as actors just because they are your friends.
However I am strangely compelled to give this movie a 2/10 just simply because it is so mind-boggingly heinous in its marginal attempts at acting , plot and story that this is without a doubt the most awesome god-awful movie I have ever seen....
The movie is about 40 minutes long, so that is a plus because usually movies like this that are too long are hard to watch all the way through.
I am a fan of B movies because they are so darned corny and funny, and this one fits the bill.
The plot is poor, there's some crap about a zombie cult which in a way exonerates the racists & what they are doing, the character's are poor, the dialogue is rubbish with every other word being a profanity because that's as imaginative as the writers can be & the film never elaborates or builds on it's central premise & the issues & ideas it first brings up.
It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him.
I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast.
All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless.
I made my husband stay because I was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts, but there weren't.
- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something -  I went to see this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny.
The fact that she is supposed to be some folksy singer-songwriter is laughable because I've met this character time and time again in the downtown art scene.
Tecnically the film is OK, the cinematography is adequate despite what many say & just because a film is shot in scope doesn't automatically make it brilliant.
Dench, Scott Glenn as Jack Buggit, Pete Postlethwaite (one of the best character actors around) as Tert Card, and the Welsh guy as one of the best characters Nutbeem, and the best guy in the movie, maybe because he's from Newfoundland, Gordon Pinsent as Billy Pretty.
The stooges are launched into space, land on a distant planet and (after the usual stooge shennanigans, save the world from alien zombies (a young dan "hoss" blocker") The only reason i give this movie a 1 is because that is as low as the ratings go.
And that's really too bad because despite the fact that Joe Besser refused to take any of the traditional pokes and slaps that Moe used to hand out to Curly and Shemp, he was otherwise a fine comedian.
OK so what happened because he had Broken English?
Some films seem "long" because it demands the audience's attention at all times, others are so because the audience is bored.
But watching this is even more painful, especially because it is as predictable as it can get.
That's too bad, because at the begging, it looked like if it stayed in the domestic realm it could have made for a perceptive, moving drama about family and childhood.
I'd normally give this one about 2*, but will add another because it was filmed in its portrayed locale, Phoenix.
You don't have to praise a dramatic presentation simply because the subject matter is significant  The story presented perhaps the two most prominent components within "Lifetime's" resources: its most ubiquitous thespian, Meredith Baxter; and its likewise most ubiquitous theme, the completely wacky, psychotic neighbor.
its there because it looks something like a Swazi, although its really 3 number 7's connected, meaning 777 from Christian dogma.
so, he gets caught with the Torah in his room, his fascist girlfriend finds it, and he makes her get dressed because being nude in front of it is a sin, according to Judaism.
Well, it's just one prize, but because of that, I think less about the Sundance Filmfestival.
Better ask the 5 star reviewers, the fanatics in this website all these questions, because after watching the movie I can provide you with none.
One last thing: the realistic ending of the movie would have been the 747 crashing and burning in Santa Monica and having half the population of Los Angeles killed either with the fire or the chemical toxin, because it is impossible to land a plane that easily (and so nicely aligned with the runway)!
Maybe it's because those Arabians don't do anything throughout this movie except sitting in a castle and riding horses (yes, indeed: Boring!).
She comes along, of course, because she is an Alpha female, rich, corporate executive, which qualifies her to fight against Arabs with machine guns.
After seeing it, I just couldn't stop laughing because it is just too stupid even for a pornographic film.
The positive characters are just too stupid, the villains are evil because they have just one face, et cetera.
If it is possible... After a few episodes even the 'actions become long and boring, because everything is just repeated, and I think that there is nothing that could possibly make me believe this is a horror.
This is because the plot is very thin!
Frustrating for me because I really would like to see conditions in gang infested communities improve but by the end of the movie the message is clear: gang members and the people in high crime communities are doing nothing wrong and should not change a single behavior.
I also resent the idea that gangs were formed because blacks couldn't get into the cub scouts, that's absurd, silly and utterly ignorant.
One problem is that because Potter's original story has been retrenched, important characters have been diminished.
It is NEVER okay to cheat on your wives and expect to be forgiven just because you're sorry.
Then there's this Ian who broke his leg on a pathetic skiing stunt who cries like a girl eventually going gaga over Laura because she was the one nursing him till he gets well.
The handful of scenes which comprise the framing device, some mumbling business about a psychotic guy and the people trying to cure him, are certainly inept and boring enough, but this is actually a relief, because the hallucinations are pretty overwhelming, and you'll be happy for opportunities to catch your breath.
I hope he is only on a vacation, because the show falls flat without him.
I watched through the movie only because I didn't pay anything to see it, and im sure glad i didn't.
I respect Ed Harris as an actor and I went to see the movie because I am fond of all the people who starred in the film.
First of all, to everyone who said this was a great movie because of originality: I would like to direct you to The Ring, or to Ringu, which is what The Ring is a remake of.
1) FOOLS RUSH IN, and that's because I'd had NO sleep the night before and shouldn't have been there in the first place.
Actually, it deserves a half point for showing boobs and another half point because Natascha McElhone gets hotter as the movie goes on (BUT THIS IS NOT NEARLY A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO WASTE ANY TIME ON SEEING THIS MOVIE!!!).
I have always loved going onto this site to check user comments because i find them interesting and helpful.
And, largely because of that miserable excuse for a script, it winds up being not a good ANY kind of film: When the bloody hell are film makers going to realize the rather elementary truth (as in Kindergarten level) that if you don't have a good script, you don't have a film?
I'm glad I didn't follow my first impulse to shut the show down at the end of the "first reel" 20 minute period, because I can quite honestly report about this disaster of a movie: Dreadful!
First, as a dramatic story, chiefly because its main character is irredeemably weak (and the vicious, stereotyped anti-gay viewpoint portrayed tacitly builds strength on this weakness).
In fact, at the end, the film really lays its cards on the table in a terrible, facile scene back in the USA, where Adam is shown to be victim of blatant American prejudice because of his religion.
Maybe it was because of how confusing the movie got afterwards or my mind just doesn't choose to remember it at all, or maybe even both but I can't remember too much of what happens in the second half right until the predictable climax.
In the first 1-2 minutes, I was hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo Kier in it!
Was he angry because he didn't get a part for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 6 or Ghoulies 7?
Quite possibly the most scary film ever made, mainly because some idiot studio exec thought this might appeal to some audience, any audience.
The crowd that recklessly spends their money because they don't care?
Well, they all died 48 hours after logging into the site FEARDOTCOM.COM....yes, it's feardotcom.COM  Sounds like the ring eh, well it is and it isn't, because with the Ring, you get more into the reasoning behind the video tape, in this movie you have some guy filming himself killing people, then people die from their worst fear after going to feardotcom....sorry feardotcom.com.
The script and directing in this movie really brings it down because it has no idea what's it's doing.
A film so awful that I got a headache - not because the plot was so complex and intelligent, but because the plot was so ridiculous and unrealistic.
A medium that kills because you watch it (in 'The Ring' a videotape, here an internet-site), a little girl that is probably the key to solve the problem, a woman and a guy searching for the answer, both saw the site and therefor they both have to hurry, and why they have to hurry has something to do with earlier events.
Olyphant did a good job because he was calm, yet you could feel the fury and rage burning inside him.
You know he's haunted because he walks around with a 3 day growth of beard.
We know she's a scientist because she wears glasses.
(but just for grins they (the unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds, and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up connection.
However, these great actors were not able to make this film a success because of the screenplay by Charles Bennett.
It will make you doubt your faith because of the people that share it.
He just doesn't come across as a mad scientist/philosopher because he never says anything scientific or philosophical.
It does feel good because it has that angsty virgin thing who gets together with a gorgeous woman because of his ideas, and that is something we can relate to, but it's just not smart.
Griffith was just plain awful in the lead, Modine was almost as bad but i'll put him ahead of Griffith because he tried.
Its lead characters are a young couple who acquire a squatter, bad news because they need to rent the basement he is occupying in order to pay their own mortgage.
I heard that is was because of Mischa Barton, that she wanna leave the show and make some movies.
But yesterday I read an interview with Josh, the creator, and he said that it was not Mischa who wanna leave, that they just killed of Marissa because of all the bad things who happens to her : that was the only solution.
In addition, all of the themes are telegraphed so ineptly that generally you don't need the scene at all, because you already know exactly what will take place before it starts.
Showing the mundane and seemingly inconsequential becomes the focus and is seen as genius because any hack director can have a plot written, then tell a story.
The film tries to drive some meaning into the reasons for these two to be out there in the wild for emptiness in significance of their own lives, but the cultural complications are brushed aside because the filmmakers do not quite get why there is any of that sort of experience in the first place for these characters who should not have had any need to spend any time out there at all.
I was hoping for a sensual, spiritual and moving journey through the outback, not some b!tchy angsty crap that thinks it's good because it's got people screaming in it and call it acting.
His death is unique because the movie never fully explained the use of the character before killing it.
There had to be a lot of scenery because there was no script and no real plot.
She has nothing else to do because there is no script.
I thought he was making fun of Sandy by playing dead, but it won't happen because there is no plot remember.
Me and my cold, black heart laughed because it was so very very excruciatingly stupid.
Don't worry, I didnt spoil the ending for you - because there isn't one.
I didn't think the sequel was going to be good but I figured it would at least be a little interesting because it's the sequel to an awesome movie.
I watched this movie out of curiosity, because i liked the first one.
The reason the Rock can carry movies is because he has a personality...he is this big guy with vulnerability.
It also appeared that there were multiple crews working on the set because there was a clear difference in the film quality between scenes.
The screenplay by Steven Seagal collaborator Joe Halpin and newcomer Brian Strasmann borrows from Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West," because the primary villain, Harvey Morris (A.J.
Nick and his father Sheriff Charlie Prescott haven't seen each other since his wife's death because Nick felt that his father didn't press the case hard enough.
The photography is nothing special, I believe this is because Stimpson made no choices in preproduction so as to color correct it later.
Prior to the screening, the director explained to the audience that it was "based on a local legend in his own backyard", and because he seemed like a nice guy I really wanted to enjoy it.
I'll give Stewart some credit--hence the rating of 2 rather than 1--because he assembles some compellingly gruesome footage of shark finning (and beheading and gutting) to drive home the point of finning's barbaric, wasteful nature.
Another thing that bothered me was when the photographer had to be hospitalized because he had a "Flesh Eating Disease", they didn't show the his leg and to movie makers that would have been the "Money Shot".
On top of that you sometimes didn't know what you were being served because the narrative didn't always give a well-rounded description of what was going onÂ   Why did this movie get such a high rating on IMDb?
I think Â and this is entirely my own thought - that people, because of the importance of the theme, thinks that this movie needs to be seen by so many as possible.
The shaky camera was annoying because it was prominent for the ENTIRE film, except the final scene, where we are back in the States.
I can only figure that they were in too much of a hurry to use a tripod, because the constant blur does't add anything to the dramatic impact of the film after the first few minutes.
I watched this because of the high rating on IMDb; shortly after it started I realized that all those good reviews were no doubt done by him.
He defied all odds against him, saving his own leg, ripping out the IV tube from his arm, and and then immediately rushing off to the very country that had an arrest warrant against him for attempted murder, just because his cause for saving the sharks was more important than his health, leg or life in prison... For these reasons I found this movie extremely pathetic.
In general, compared to volume 2, the shorts on volume 1 aren't as well-made--because the DVDs are arranged chronologically.
Perhaps because of how much I enjoyed the book, I absolutely hated the movie.
They make us laugh because it's self-parody.
I saw this movie when it was first released and I was so excited about it because of the profound effect the books had had on me.
Just as an aside, one of my exam questions years ago was to compare a book and a movie adaptation and I chose this one because I felt so strongly about it.
If you have read the book, don't watch the movie because you will be disappointed.
I hope they make another adaptation, because I think flowers in the attic could be a great movie.
The only knock I could have against it is that you have to be really careful who you let watch it because it is not for family/children viewing at all.
A hot mom and her four bratty kids have to leave their suburban home because the bread winner (i.e.
A shame about the movie because if it was done correctly, we could have saw the whole series on film.
However, the relationship between Cathy and her father seems almost irrelevant to the whole feel of the movie, from what I can remember, because unlike in the book, their relationship is not developed well, not much beyond that one scene in fact.
Petals on the Wind was my favorite in the series, and the rest were really good too, better than the original because the characters were more complex.
Though perhaps that's because I originally bought the movie tie-in copy of the book, and the kids on the cover were modeled after the actors.
"The Dresden dolls" because they are *that* striking.
For anyone who has watched the film and is ready to dismiss the books because of it - seriously; don't be fooled by such an obvious lacklustre attempt at a book adaptation.
I haven't seen it yet, and, truthfully, I may not bother, because it looks like it's more of exactly the same.
I personally think it's because of the cooperation between husband and wife (madonna and sean penn).
There's a scene with the girlfriend talking, being very cold and cruel, and the main character is a wearing a mask of disgust because he is so emotionally spent.
He soon learns that she cannot because she has been kidnapped by Muslim fanatics.
At first he thinks that all they really want is money, because they use him to loot a savings account left behind by his father -- one that holds $ 75,000, a most princely sum -- but eventually he figures out that they want him to be a mule for a terrorist bomb attack.
Most of the time the cell phone tormentor is speaking Tagalog, or a mixture of Tagalog and English, and the subtitles for that seem to fly by ... meaning, once again, that it is impossible to grasp the size of the problem facing Adam ... because we know after the first four times that the caller says he is going to kill the mother and the sister that this is a bad hombre.
But then again, I took the time to screen this film on DVD twice, because I wanted to be sure that it wasn't just the herky-jerky camera work which was upsetting me.
She was terrible and so was Sean Penn(he is so damn ugly) how could they cast him as a romantic lead.Guess because they were going together at the time.
... but there is no way to spoil this movie, because it is already spoiled to the point of being compost, and is ready to be spread out on the fields.
I give this movie a 1, but that is only because IMDb will not let me input negative numbers.
This movie, like "Mommie Dearest" or "Plan Nine From Outer Space" has immense camp value because it's so deliciously awful.
Gritty post modern Irish neo-realism or me kid sister making a film on her cell phone because she's got the grant money and it has to be finished by Tuesday and in the mail.
I would imagine that most people will go and see this film because Matrix was sold out (do studios deliberately do this ie.
This movie blatently tries to rip off Star Trek's Borg (Machines turning humans into robots) and trying to do a little Alien and Terminator like, but fails because of the depressing way the actors were talking.
If only they'd taken their time with this one and spent more time developing the alien creatures (personality wise) because they do look pretty good but cannot carry this film, which sinks long before the end credits roll.
(4 out of 10 just because it looks good.
I never actually write reviews but this absolutely undeserved score pretty much forced me to; I'd hate it if you passed on this one just because some people are easily influenced by the news they're fed (note - I'm still going on my totally uneducated guess).
But it makes sense, because to anyone else this film is just mind-numbingly dull.
I only decided to finally watch this movie because Geena Davis is so good at playing the U.S. President in the ABC network TV drama "Commander in Chief".
Well, I guess I am exaggerating a little, because their was a storyline but ultimately it becomes secondary to the subplot of adolescent sexual discovery in the desert.
The story almost resembles something that could be a little interesting, but it falls apart because of bland direction and absolutely ridiculous acting (especially from Aames).
But I must be ridiculously stupid, because I missed the point.
Fulci gets a lot of credit for "atmosphere", and I have to agree: Even when his films lacked a plot or a point, movies like Gates of Hell were just amazing because they gave off this weird, uncomforting feeling.
I rented this because it had a zombie on the cover and it said on the back of the box it was about zombies.
Like most people, i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box, and the assumption (from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film) that this film is all about the Beast from the East kickin' ass for 90 minutes.
If they both died, that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing, which in the end really made me mad, because that is also what I predicted was going to happen, and if they both didn't die in the "true events", I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.
This movie was BORING, BORING, BORING, because most of the time you're watching it, they are just floating in the water not doing anything and it's completely pathetic!!!!!
I felt embarrassed for the actress because it was so unnecessary, despite what the Producer said in the optional Commentary on the DVD.
Despite my big surprise when I saw that this film got a low IMDb score (only 6/10) I decided to see the film because the preview looked promising.
Some Philipinno reviewers got offended because they consider that the film misrepresents the Philipinnes because it shows the miserable aspect of the country.
However, having lived in various third world countries it seems to me that what is portrayed is a very real part of the Philipinnes, Also it does not matter because in a film we should be looking for art rather than for advertising a country.
Okay the plot is okay 2 people want to make it big but can't because they have no money and their scenes at the start are nice but the robbery part is so stupid  How does Rani, Abhishek get the expensive clothes for the first crime?
Irene Dunne is the lonely ward of Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland who accompanies Boland because Boland fancies she can sing.
It's not in her character to throw Dunne out of the house because she was upstaged.
I saw it once because of the director, lead actors and wonderful character actors (still I think the best part of this turkey.)
She's reluctant to accept because Stingaree has been captured, but the highwayman insists that she do it, telling her that he happily gave up his freedom to give Hilda hers.
I say attempts, because this film is ultimately a bunch of parts that don't add up to much of a whole.
No, the reason it's badly acted is because these people cannot act!
His acting isn't too great, but I think it is because he was not given a character to act out.
This character trait does not hold true, because, up to this point, his character has appeared arrogant and overbearing, with little or no regard for those around him.
The only reason I went to the screening was because of star Gary Oldman.
It was interesting to hear Gary Oldman speak some Spanish and I give this movie 3 stars because of Aitana Sanchez-Gijon and him.
This movie is the first English language movie for Virginie Ledoyen since "The Beach" and I think it is fair to say that she will always be known as the girl from "The Beach" because she is a bland and boring actress.
Even in french films she is dull because she lacks the range that other actresses her age have.
We all know it is set in the 70's but the directing should always be related to the story because style is cheap and easy and anyone who works only on style with no script should just direct commercials and music videos.
I have to laugh at the guy above who wrote that he's not gay, so he likes the movie because it doesn't threaten him.
Giving it a three, only because of the weird casting.
They will hate you forever because this is anything but!!!!!!!!!!
The quality of their Bosko series was clearly light-years behind Mickey Mouse--mostly because the cartoons weren't especially funny or charming.
We weren't shocked or surprised by the ending, because by that point in the film we just didn't care Â apathy had set in, and we were dumbstruck to resist it.
After watching this film I felt cheated, because I love Dean's body of work and what he represented in Hollywood, but this film captured nothing of the sort.
It was shallow, disrespectful, and pointless to the end because you walk away knowing less about Dean than when you started.
Nothing congealed in this film because of both the shabby acting as well as the under-developed (which is a word I used too many times and is not shrew enough) story which completely debunks itself as the final credits roll by using the lines, "Most of this film was based on fact... some was an educated guess."
It made watching him very difficult because it was hard to believe.
Unlike most everyone else who commented here, i saw this film because I am a major (and a bit obsessed) James Dean fan, not a James Franco fan.
The story is simple: Adam (Ian Gamazon) is called home to the Phillipines because of a family crisis.
I was predisposed to liking it, because I was a fanatical G&S enthusiast first, but it was a relief to discover that this film was a worthy tribute to their legacy.
We only stayed for Act II because we had a friend in the show and there were others who would have "ratted us out" if we had left.
Its awful because it sounds like you're listening to the same song for two hours.
As far as the reviews on this website go I feel that films, especially small films like this, are reviewed favorably primarily because of shills.
The bottom line - a bad film that ends up, inexplicably on Sundance, because it probably cost them little to nothing to get it, and well, the director gets the visibility.
This is a laudable effort at sending a positive message, and many people will give the film high marks just because of the attempt.
Don't ask me why because it isn't explained.
I even had to pop two pills of Ibuprofen because of the massive headache I had obtained from listening to these two girls screaming nonstop.
(drew doesn't count because he just left the movie)   the girls meet up, run away, scream, run away, see him again, run away, and eventually have a final showdown where the killer, a mixture of the girl from the ring, Michael myers, and the butcher, who walks literally 1/4 of a mile an hour, gets nail-gunned to the head, not defending himself in the least.
This movie was horrible,and I pride myself on loving all kinds of movies,but this was just terrible.The actors were very good looking the actresses were pretty with cute little bodies,but goodness I would rather them put in a few uglies than to have a ucked up script and story line.These people CAN NOT act!OK who drops down and does the nasty in an unknown barn,with a buddy missing?Not even in the worst horror movies has this happened.The story makes no sense.But if you can get a copy with the bloopers at the end,those are pretty good.The best part of this movie was the bloopers.The unfolding of the story was way too slow,the plot DOES NOT thicken,the actors can not act,the music sux,there's no "boo moments" as my friend calls them,everything that is going to happen is so freggin obvious its sad.This was a TOTAL waste of production dollars.Someone suggested that this seemed more like a student film,but as I'm sure that person knows,student films have been so much better than this before,as he said,that is no excuse.I recommend to try it because everyone has a different opinion,but ewwww!
I saw this about a month ago because it came on-demand and I was bored.
I know some of you like it because it has a lot of blood and gore and mangled bodies and lots of stuff gets blown up.
I don't really know what it was because I was fast forwarding, but the movie ends.
I liked the car driver character only because he made me laugh.
Well, move over, because we have a new contender in town!
This movie really deserves a 0 vote because it was so cheap.
This movie was not even close to being a horror because I could not stop laughing about the horrible acting.
Maybe it is because this movie had a low budget.
I wasted $4.86 to rent this at Blockbuster mainly because on the DVD box there is a quoted from IFQ magazine stating that it is "The most terrifying movie of the last decade".
It would not even make a good college film project because the acting is so horrible.
I'm not going to say any spoilers, because there are none to say.
This is as bad if not worse than anything he has ever done because it's supposed to be serious which makes it all the more laughable and embarrassing.
This might be something like the First Officer suddenly developing a passion for early space exploration five seasons in, when it was more in keeping with the helmsman Paris, all because its the First Officer who has the rank to ignore the Captain and get everyone in trouble.
How many times can one ship get thoroughly beaten in combat because its crew can't be bothered to shoot back.
nothing makes sense because there is no consistency, characters are dull, the series is turned on its head by 7 of 9 and becomes "the 7 of 9 and Janeway show" at the cost of other characters.
But it's sad, because, for a show that was supposed to throw all conventions through the window, it surely was the most conventional of them all.
This movie deserves a rating of -10/100 but I rated it a 1 because I had to.
Remember that dog food commercial that had dogs magically doing hip hop dance steps because they were so excited about Kibbles and Bits.
I rented this movie one day because I was frightfully bored.
Why this precedes the film is quite a mystery, though I can only suggest that it's because the film itself is too short.
In fact because of the success of this film, two sequels are on the way.
So, they throw aside all the characterization inherent in a movie, because it has already been showed on the show (quite redundant, huh?).
You can assume Ash and company are the heroes because... well, they just seem the hero-type to us.
Let's put it this way: when it was shown on the cinema, it was a tie between the public, because half of them were children who loved the show, ergo they loved it, and the other half were the parents who went with them, and they probably fell asleep after the first ten minutes.
I would give this 4/10 because of Mewtwo, nothing else.
I mean first they acknowledge that fighting is bad, and then they go back to fighting because they have no problem with exploiting these poor creatures.
Project Greenlight is a failure only because of the people leading it.
Not because of the people who enter it.  
I don't know if it was the script...or the directing...or the behind the scenes things that the Hollywood Producers did that we don't know about...but I didn't like this film...mainly because I didn't believe it...I didn't believe one minute of this film...everything seemed fake.
Kelly is an odd character, he's a war buff because hey he has a vehicle and wears the clothing, and he works at a supermarket when there's nobody there, and he has a friend/co-worker named Sarah played by the adorable Shiri Appleby, another grossly under developed character who has a combined total of five scenes in the film and is never focused on.
I rated it a 4 on 10 because there are much worse horror movies and because it has a great background idea (some chick being terrorized by her dead aunt and the inhabitants of her bungalows).
Enjoyed this horrible horror film mainly because I just wanted to find out what it was all about and since I have been a big fan of Dorothy Malone for many years and enjoyed her performance in the great film, "Inherit the Wind".
Maybe that's why this movie is seen by some to be authentic in its demented convolutions, because they think that Boll has created some postmodern masterpiece here.
And because war is all about brutal ugliness, Uwe Boll just naturally happens to have the inherent lack of vision, honesty and skills to drive that point home involuntarily.
And it certainly fails as a message movie, because it has no intellectual honesty or artistic merit to speak of.
The side-story of the priest-king and his priestess-sister doesn't add anything to the plot, it's just boring too, and I guess the quasi-Shakespearian ramblings-on of the priest are the result of the gasses he inhales because they're blurred and silly.
I rank it 4 (because of the looks of the creature) out of 10.
Just because something or someone goes blind from decades in total darkness doesn't mean his eyes fall out and where is his lips?
I give it 2/10 because it had quite nice looking actresses.
but all the others only say the same (not kidding) "Surprisingly better than most Sci-Fi originals" something around that.. anyway i only gave this movie a two, because the minotaur wasn't so bad made and it was sooo cute...
They tried to build backgrounds and personalities to the characters but failed miserably, maybe because it was done very lazily, ie having two actors discuss all the characters for our benefit while they eat.
It is a shame because the film started well and the scene in the tunnels involving the mother and kids was genuinely tense but it seemed so out of place with the rest of the film which was, badly acted to say the least.
because if there ever was a more liberal group of people, It's jackass literature professors).
This is because this is actually the movie "Full Impact" ripped apart with crappy added flashback scenes from the first movie, and called American Streetfighter 2.
Well, the title says it all; NIck is a sore looser, by some strange and uneventful coincidences, he starts to work in a psychic hospital as clerk/janitor and because of his lack of tact, gets fired after a few minutes.
But that was mainly because I didn't want to lose my friends.
I actually had to start this movie twice because I stopped it at the first try after 15 minutes not being able to concentrate on the "storyline"(there actually is not really much of a storyline to begin with).What I am trying to get across is that this is just not a movie that captures you in the first couple of minutes and also this is definitely not a horror movie.
Altogether a very unpleasant movie not only because of its content but because it is very hard to follow and even harder to connect to any of the characters portrayed in it!
The movie banks on you being emotionally affected, and if you're not, there really is no point in watching it because you'll be bored out of your mind.
The Living and the Dead is relative in every aspect of the word, and I can't give it a definitive "this sucks" or "this was good" because it varies person to person.
This might be an indication that the distributors need extra reasons to convince people into renting/buying their film, because the plot summary and the still images on the back of the box aren't convincing enough.
However, the film suffers from numerous plot holes because it feels like Rumley has absolutely no knowledge of caring for a terminally ill or disabled person.
The sorry piece of movie will of course give us all some bad taste in our mouth when they make awkward and embarrassing scenes like seeing a retarded son trying to help his mother when she is seriously ill and crying, scenes where the retard tries to force his mother to eat pills because "the more you take, the better you will get".
The only reason I came across this film was because it was likened to "haunting in Connecticut" (which I found to be a relatively entertaining no-brainer)here on IMDb!
I regret to say that my comments cannot be positive because anyone seeing this documentary would be profoundly discouraged about the possibility of a successful cochlear implant.
It is much too easy for people to become discouraged because of this kind of movie.
Seed was way more cynical than what we've seen from Uwe before, but still had some silliness because the absurd comic book-style killer.
The tunnels are small, because the Vietnamese is small, so it get's extra claustrophobic for the bigger built Americans.
They just hate it because it's Boll directing.
And because we intuitively know that this phase of America's history is based on violence and brutality, lawlessness and heartlessness did abound and this does not fit well into the self-image that the so-called Heartland so cherishes.
I don't know and cannot imagine why Chow Yun-fat made this movie (he does not appear until more than 50 minutes into it) because he was successful already...he should have done commercials and sold floor wash or denture cleaners, done anything except this movie.
I'm really glad that I own this DVD because it feels like a bootleg of a practice gig.
Which doesn't make a lot of sense because there's a scene where an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm (yes THE 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm) kills some broad in the house and the babysitter cleans up the blood the next day to hide it.
But no matter how you look at it, they all die and you'll also die a little inside when you go to google this house so you can stay there for a night and make your own bootleg ghosthunters TV show and try to sell it to the travel channel only to find out that you can't even find this house because nobody cared enough to put it's real location anywhere on the internet.
Bob remains stuck in the door up to his elbow because HE KEEPS TRYING TO CLOSE THE DOOR ON HIS ARM.
Was i ever disappointed, this film is ludricroious, mainly because it doesn't even resemble a horror film.
Its sad because the locations look quite good, and this could have been an effective movie if he'd had the skills.
I just got it on DVD because I read of all the positive hype, and loved movies like "Stepford "Wifes", "Desturbing Behavior" and "The Mansurain Candidate", and I hoped to find more movies in this genre.
I stumbled over this movie, and though I had found what I was looking for because of the good reviews and interesting plot, but I was really WRONG!
i only watched it because i have a thing for scary movies but i definitely would not recommend it to someone and if someone asked me about it i would say watch it if you have nothing better to do.
Its a shame because i wanted to like this movie too.
That just because the main characters of this show are a bunch of animated posers that keep surfing all the day people would consider this show "cool" ?
I might be so wrong,because I haven't seen this show in years,but how is this realistic?And what the hell is with the slang?I'm around lots of gangs nowadays,and I've never heard anyone say I've never heard the word "shoobee"or whatever it was.Even when I was at the beach in Maryland,I never heard one surfer kid say that.And what's with he word "lame-o"?Honestly,these kids are like 13 or 15 and they are still using baby ghetto talk.I haven't said "lame-o" since I was like firkin ten!
His dad is an idiot because I said so.
She likes "Squid" (Another character) and pities him because Otto decides to be a scum bag and make fun of him, but she almost never does anything about it.
I give it a three out of ten because at least McNamara owned up to something, though not nearly enough, while Henry Kissinger still walks the streets with his goodies intact.
They fought because governments can't simply learn to live with their differences, or they can't just sit down and decide to have a poker game instead.
In a couple of years there will be more films like this about the war on terror because G W wanted to line the pockets of his suit at the expense of young men and women because he can't tolerate other countries disagreeing with him.
I guess this could be considered as a prequel to the series because it tells the story maybe a week before the series starts, but it's nothing that couldn't have been picked up just watching the show.
It is sad because the story was really decent and had possible potential.
I wouldn't rate this movie a one out of ten just because the tunnel scenes were good and kept me in the movie.
You watch the film because, like the men in the tunnel you don't know what is coming next.
I almost wish that Boll had used a different name when he made it since I doubt the film will ever get the attention it deserves because of who he is.
Well actually I love watching horrible movies because then at least i can laugh and wonder why anyone would ever make this.
Just because you're pretty and nice?
I rated this one a little high because of the nice scenery.
When I saw the remake I was nauseated and upset because the later ending was completely changed.
I bought the VHS just because of Wil Wheaton, from Star Trek, but it is only indicated to fans of trash-movies.
On a scale of ONE to TEN, THE CURSE gets a 3, because the guy from Stand by Me is in it!
Poor Zack(Wil Wheaton) has to rough it on his own once his mother, Francis(Kathleen Jordon Gregory) becomes "under the weather" and his sister(Amy, Wil's sis) is assaulted by manic chickens, as Nathan(Akins) and his antagonistic jerk son, Cyrus(Malcolm Danare), both even worse after being infected, torment him through insults and harsh treatment..you see he's not their blood(..his mother married Nathan, it seems, because they needed support he could give) which means they feel little pity or affection towards him.
Nathan is a hard, strict, bible-quoting fanatic who doesn't want anyone "butting in" to matters he considers private, even if disease and death spread because of the infected water, or what's evident before him, the fact that his family are afflicted with a plague.
Tolerating Claude Akins for the duration of this film proves to be difficult because he's such a loud and repugnant creature you just want to see suffer in the worst possible way for the problems he causes.
And, Wheaton is certainly easy to sympathize with because he's caught between a rock and hard place, little wiggle room to remove himself as madness evolves all around him.
It's a shame because the leads hold up their ends and are terrific, particularly the actor who played the brother.
Avoid this one at all costs, and for heavens sake, do not rent it because the guy on the back of the cover looks so funny.
But still because of the reason that this movie is a completely silly one, the movie remains still far more entertaining and watchable than just the average B-horror movie.
the only reason i watched this movie is because of the rate it was given.
Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, two Hughes regulars, star in this Cinderella story about a sixteen year old birthday girl whose parents have forgotten her special day because of her older sister's imminent wedding, and whose dream man doesn't even know she exists.
I must've blocked out everything inbetween because I didn't understand it at that age...
This scene is made even more over the top by the Krader boss with the hunting rifle who tries to kill Ernest but can't because of some Indian powers that protect him from bullets.
Why is it so bad, because you have Ernest as the main character, plus very annoying children, and a silly subplot involving some company trying to take over the camp.
I gave it a 3 instead of a 0 only because Virginia Madsen is beautiful to look at, albeit she is a whore in the movie.
they were a waste of time and should have left after they dropped them off because they were totally out of place.
It should have been named Sisters of Talk , because thats all that happens.
Now i don't say this because of the possible getting shot in the head in an initiation to a sorority (yeah, i know.
it's stupid) i say this because if you join this sorority, you may end up in the movie "Sisters of Death" and that my friend, is worse than a gun shot to the head.
because they're retarded.
Well, quite simply because it's crappy!
I think this is partly because the pacing is good and doesn't allow it to get too boring.
Paul and Joe sneak back into the estate because, well, they're men and that's exactly what I'd do, and soon the seven of them party into the next day.
This one is so bad, it can't even be rated as "good" because of its badness, absolutely, positively, without par or equal, the worst film ever made (And trust me on this, I've spent 50+ years screening bad movies, and this one made me put down my beer, sit up straight in the chair, drop my jaw, and say to myself: "THIS PIECE OF S**T IS SO F(*&^%G BAD< I"VE GOT TO HAVE MY OWN COPY TODAY!!!
A real hard case, who at one time was probably a captain or major, but was busted down to lieutenant because he's too stern with his men challenging them to boxing matches if they step out of line.
Hollowborn is in charge of a group of young soldiers who risk their lives everyday where one slip is fatal even being warned not to smoke the night before they go into the tunnels the next day because the VC can smell the smoke on them.
They stay away from the FNG's(F-ing New Guy's) because all they do is talk about home and that's a place the Short Timer's want to be.
The monsters such as Godzilla escape from Monster Island because of an alien force trying to take over the world, and enslave the people.
Don't waste your money folks... it's better to go out and buy a "tickle me Elmo" doll because, at least, you can punt this baby around your yard and feel good about it!
I managed 30 minutes and that was just because I was in shock!
I fidgeted through it only because I was with someone.
I'm giving it a 2 (and not 1) because it has given me such inspiration to write this review.
I realize that this is a personal opinion, and perhaps a bit slanted because I am "European", and perhaps because I am such a big fan of Red Dwarf.
To me it seems as if this film is being instructed by two VERY different directors, because the depiction of Alabama population in the last 2/3 of the movie reminds me most of all of cartoon characters rather then actual homo sapiens.
You find yourself majorly worried by the immoral (inevitable) walking out on a really nice guy at the altar, who is just supposed to accept that because of Witherspoon's nice smile (which he does "oh my heart's broken I think I am OK with you leaving bye").
I avoided this movie because I thought it would be merely fluff, but a girlfriend brought it over for movie night, so I decided to give it a try.
I must admit we laughed a lot because it was so bad.
Once in a while I like to look for the worst looking title I can find because bad movies make you appreciate everything else in life more.
Super gay Stephen joins forces with catholic schoolgirl ninjas to fight dumb as rock cheerleaders because they didn't let him be a cheerleader in this beyond retarded little waste of celluloid.
I know there are a lot of people out there looking for terrible movies to watch, because they have great comedic value...this is not one of them.
Yeah,I sound silly,but its all because this film was a good little solid war story and it had no feel of a low-budget production.
I gave the movie a 2 because awful implies that it should never be watched under any circumstance.
Cheerleader Ninjas looked promising mostly because of the title and there was not a girl in her underwear on the box.
I did find the use of a body double for the main character somewhat funny because I can't imagine how the stand-in could have been a worse actress.
The only reason it gets one above the lowest is because it made me chuckle once.
Another unfortunate film meeting "we hate the director because the internet told us to" preconceptions, 1968 Tunnel Rats is a complete success in what it sets out to do - create an overwhelming sense of fear and claustrophobia.
It's too bad because the plot about a woman who was a gorilla in a previous life is so goofy I wanted to see more.
Put it on the shelf for a while because you won't need to remember it again until you get to the end.
It's too bad because this one had a chance if they just stuck with the original plot throughout the film.
So many film goers and critics (professional and armchair) are going to dismiss this film as if it is some plague carrier, and only because of the name that goes with it.
I feel sorry for those people because they will miss out on a great many interesting and even inspiring film experiences in their life time.
My biggest guess as to why the name was changed is because the film itself is nowhere near as intelligent or perceptive as a film with that risky a title should have.
There is no intelligence to these characters as in a scene when Lowe starts yelling at Moore because she won't throw her tampons away which 1 minute later results in Moore storming out of the apartment.
This movie about what at the time was considered one of the most horrific murders ever because of the circumstances, was a waste of time.
I used to catch all the made-for-TV horror/thriller stuff in the 70's, because there were no VCR's or DVD players & this was all there was (well, except for movies at the theater, most of which I couldn't go see because of the ratings and because I was too young to have money to go see them).
The scene is filmed in Moorpark, California in front of the Cactus Patch restaurant on High Street (the restaurant is still there and I highly recommend the breakfast plate called the "Riley Special")  The movie would put most people to sleep but I enjoyed watching it because it was filmed almost entirely in my home town of Moorpark as well as Piru and Fillmore, which were all combined to comprise the fictional "Finleytown."
The London film remained interesting because of the difference between how it was seen by Keiller 15 years ago and how it is today.
The studio was wise to make it a straight-to-video release because it would have made about $40 in theaters.
I was thoroughly disappointed in this film and therefore rated it a 1 out of 10 because it didn't have any suspense about it at all and the acting was terrible as well.
We later find out that Flash is upset because he has been left behind twofold: by Hollywood (he was a former gaffer) and by his family.
It seems that way because the protagonist is "mischievious"/morally ambiguous (like a mild John Connor) but his crimes are not taken seriously.
Foul language throws a monkey wrench into this because now the script tries to be realistic and 'non-fluffy'.
But this is negated because the issue isn't graphically explored within the context of the story or its characters (with the exception of one elderly character's apartment being infested).
This strange idea seemed to impress most of the reviewers but I couldn't get into it--mostly because it all seemed rather fake and I also thought that children playing war and acting as if it's all lots of fun just seemed a bit grotesque.
It looks pretty, but that's a problem, because even the ghetto Tokyo has turned into is pretty to an extent.
Honestly, it feels like this is supposed to be part of the universe "Appleseed" exists in because I get the expectation that we're supposed to already know who Vexille and Leon are (especially since it comes across much like Deunan and Briareos), so I seriously wonder if this was a retrofitted story that was rejected for the "Appleseed" series.
We have an evil genius type of bad guy with thin motivation for...taking over the world, of course, because he needs test subjects for an experiment.
It is a stretch to call it uneven because it is evenly ordinary.
As a matter of fact, it is not really comparable to any of the great westerns because it is inherently small and my bottom line is that to the extent that it is worth watching, it is because it was a sincere effort but that is the best I can do and it is faint praise indeed.
I don't think that it is a neglected masterpiece but think it is neglected precisely because it is not a masterpiece.
Max's speech implying that we the viewers are as bad as him because we have watched the killings didn't really seem relevant when we had been talking through most of them they were so dull.
Not because its shocking, or depicts anything that hasn't been seen before.
But because it believes its saying something important.
I only give it a 2 out of 10 because it's not as bad as "Salsa" (truly the worst film ever made).
Some centuries ago, one of his ancestors lost his beautiful daughter because she was raped and abused by savage men in the woods.
There's some extensive scenes of open heart surgery, for whatever that's worth, because it's not clear who its on nor who is doing it, but it's about par for the course with this film.
She says she deserves leniency because she's been good in prison.
Funny to see Klugman in this piece of crap because I recall him in "Goodbye Columbus," the movie version of Philip Roth's novel, in which Klugman played father to a luminous Ali McGraw.
That movie made me uncomfortable, because it rang true.
I watched 'Buffalo Girls' because of the Larry McMurtry 'Lonesome Dove' connection.
This movie is made with extraordinary outfits which are really imaginary...characters are imaginary too i mean the whole movie was full of CRAP (said 50 times by Saif) ...cmmon Indian film makers...just because Hum Tum was a HIT does not mean you can make us fool.
In closing, this is a very poorly constructed film that probably generated audience interest primarily because of the controversial theme of the two leads living together and becoming pregnant before marriage.
This movie was the first zombie movie which i stopped watching because i was bored and resumed later on, just to see that the end sucks too.
casually tells his "good" friend Ricky that he initially killed the woman because she tried to bite him.
it's supernatural, but just because there is some gore in it, you cannot class a film as horror.
The acting is okay, but the story and the script absolutely stink more than the titular character, which is a shame because the film rally had a lot going for it.
I watched this one because the violence was reported to be NOT gratuitous.
Not only to they rape her but they beat, sodomise and sexually "poke" her in the infected bullet wound one of the boys gave her a week previous because " it's wet and warm" I am only thankful they didn't treat us to a viewing of that particular scene.
I am by nature creative and as such have a vivid and abstract imagination.I an able to enjoy a book over the film in most cases because my imagination is better than what the movie producers often create.
Seemingly lifeless, because the girl is alive and apparently can't even be killed.
I'm writing this comment because I've been looking on the internet for over a year to find if there has been a home video release.
The guy has gone psycho because of the violence he witnessed in Vietnam, and the fact that a Vietnamese prostitute (Charlotte Littrel) taunted and laughed at him when he couldn't get an erection!
I joined because after having seen this movie I was anxious to see just how much other people hated it too, alas, they seem to like it.
Sad, because it starts out with a bang when the prison fakes Liotta's execution and he is then transported to Dafoe's lab to begin his transformation.
Yet, perhaps I am being unkind, because I think there will be no other great beauty like hers.
That is the main reason why I keep saying see the Joan Hickson versions instead, because Hickson was born for Miss Marple, and her interpretation was the truest to the Marple in the book.
Unbeknowst to them, a Catholic priest was murdered in a confession booth that is now stored in the basement, and the man who killed him hung himself because of guilt.
The story itself is weak, even more so because of the series it was randomly placed in and the unrelation to the other films.
Crappy movie after crappy movie all because one family couldnt pay their bills so they had to concoct the most infamous paranormal hoax ever.
(they stop by the house because it is the first right not the second, huh?)
and the running "joke" (because it is never funny) of Pegg locking himself out of his flat isn't even funny the 1st time it happens.
Plus anything I say isn't really going to make much difference because the film's been showing for well over a month now and by the looks of it is still really continuing to rake it in.
Unfortunately the over worked idea and the clichÃ©d plot devices take its toll on a film that would have been better if it the characters had been more distinctive, which is a shame because given the films short comings Schwimmer does manage to evoke heartfelt performances from his leads.
I don't understand why it was ever released on DVD...maybe it was an attempt to capitalize on the study hall market- bored kids watching the movie because they can't be bothered to crack open the book...Why on earth Robert Wagner chose to get involved with such a lame project is beyond me...
BUT, unfortunately, it's not because they are saints.
For being the introduction to one of the most enduring horror series in European cinema, FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR is rather lame - apart from being an edited variant of the original Spanish cut, bearing the more accurate title THE MARK OF THE WOLFMAN - but one tends to forgive Paul Naschy the many shortcomings of his script on this occasion because here he was still treading the waters, as it were.
It seems almost mean to criticize the particulars, because this is obviously not a film that any professionals were involved with.
I gave this film a 2, only because there was an effort made to make a film and because it seems that the actor that played Eban, has some talent.
I happen to be gay, but, refuse to enjoy something simply because its subject matter contains characters that also happen to be gay.
The paperhangers go to work in a sanitarium, and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness: one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he's a poached egg!
Which was good because otherwise I don't think I would have made it all the way through.
I watched this mini-series because I had seen Paul Gross in Due South and Slings and Arrows.
I hope, i was clear and under-stable, because English is not my native method of speaking.
Stephen Churchett has retained the duller members of the coach tour but because they don't have much to do in the book, this have given him scope to completely re-write their characters (the Lumleys and the Waddys).
This movie was like some haiku from a drunk guy that everyone in your freshman dorm thought was deep, but only because they were swimming in a cloud of marijuana smoke so thick that you could use it for building material.
Well if that is the case, than we need global tragedies more often because they really make the world think about life and become better people as a result.
Maybe one needs to be a New Yorker to get the film, but I just didn't see the greatness, just exploitation about how the Twin Towers falling changed a few people in the city and made their lives understandable in its context because they weren't good enough people to see their wrongs without it.
This disgusted me, but most likely it was because this was an affront to my highest held beliefs.
With the exception of Gaffigan, who gets a pass because I like his stand-up and he seems to be the only actor on the show who isn't as awkward as a boner-afflicted 14-year-old at a jr high dance, there isn't one person on My Boys who does not, within the first 30 seconds of being on screen, make me want to punch a wall or kick a dog (and i love dogs).
I'm guessing that the guy who plays the loudmouth jackass is probably a monk or a stenographer in real life, because he sure as hell doesn't know the first thing about being a genuine loudmouth or delivering his lines in a way that doesn't sound like he's repeating testimony.
The writing is the worst part of it, in fact, though the writers did accomplish several feats I had previously assumed were mutually exclusive: they made the plot over-the-top yet unimaginative, the dialogue simple-minded yet smug, and the punchlines clichÃ©d yet unfamiliar (clichÃ©s are clichÃ©s because at some point there were funny, but the ones in My Boys lacked any vestige of humor).
That's because, in a way, you HAVE seen that episode before, and it's going to end exactly like any episode of any unimaginative half-hour sitcom based on some vaguely idiotic premise.
This show couldn't be further from reality if they had the "boys" become bionic cyborgs with the powers on invisibility that can bend space time and had flesh eating incest's that fly out of their mouths, in fact that would be more entertaining because you wouldn't need such a huge suspension of disbelief.
But that's okay because there's enough actors acting more goofy than her.
However, use caution because there are a few scenes that may be too scary for young children.
We excuse Ving Rhames for such a terrible performance because we understand times are hard and he just needed a little extra money.
The movie is almost like Nepolean Dynamite according to my sister, because of the long pointless pauses.
Rhames just saved a woman from a fate worse than death and she had a hissy because he called her "baby".
Now keep in mind, the only reason I undertook to see this film was because Gary Oldman was on the cover.
She just starts going on about how its his DESTINY to do this just because he had seen it all in dream.
though he couldn't think of reason why because hes like that..  My mother who is 40 didn't understand it and my father (born on the same day and year as my mother) though it was really really weird.
I think that most of the reason that so many people hated this movie was because it raises your expectations because of the people involved but did nothing new within its genre.
Bella, played by Alicia Coppola, is someone that we want to root for but may hesitate because of the, ah, sinful nature of her occupation.
The only reason I watched the entire movie was because, as a woman, seeing the massive revenge against rapists was very satisfying.
I say 20th century Yorkshire but I am very confused as to the time period because characters wear relatively modern clothes , have electricity and have access to tractors but often cut wheat with scythes .
Maybe there might have been if the wheat grain the farmers had collected had been ergotised but this type of food poisoning would have been rare in the north of England ( But not perhaps 19th century France ) whatever period it's set in so it seems it was included by the director because it seemed like a good idea .
We'll never know if that's true however, because the picture is just too dark.
I imagine the studio probably tweaked it a bit but maybe because Jordan's original cut was even worse, I just don't believe this 'it would have been brilliant if the studio had left it alone' rubbish., anyway I guess we'll never find out either way...
Greek cinema is known because of masters like Angelopoulos, Pantelis Voulgaris etc.
An average Lone Star film -- built on convenient coincidences (Gat Gann just happens to walk into the scene and dies, and, as luck would have it, just happens to bear a letter of introduction to the man, "Gantry" who, as fate would have it, just happens to have killed John "Ted" Wayne's father and for whom Ted goes to work because Ted just happens to look just like Gannon in his "Wanted" poster, etc., etc.)
Save your money because the boom/mic coming into the scene every five minutes will drive you crazy, what a waste of good talent from Bruce Greenwood and some other veteran actors.
The only reason I've never pitched it is because there's very little with Linda Manz in it to begin with.
I kept watching to see where it was headed, because I had no clue.
The movie is the worst I have ever seen, not because the dialogue, pacing, script, acting, sound or editing are weak, which they are, but because after watching the movie you will feel like you need to wash something off... and you will know even if you do, nothing is going to go away.
You never root for him, because he has nothing to accomplish.
I give this movie a 4/10 because it could of not turn from original so much and the apes in the movie are really misfit.
Well, it's supposed to be a tropical resort, but they must have been filming during the off season because the scenery isn't even all that great in this one.
I hate movies like this because the germ of a good idea is there and you can see some talent in front of and behind the camera, but the final product is so far off base that it makes me really irritated.
Why does a abandoned asylum that is barely standing because of fire damage need security cameras you ask?
"The Blair Witch Project" worked because it felt real.
There is no suspense because some of the things that unfold (particularly the ending) are so implausible that it is an insult to viewers.
I only hope that the filmmakers really did not expect people to believe this was "real" footage because they failed miserable.
This is probably because their source materials were the musical and some sick fanfiction.
The genre of horror comedy is very hard to pull off & the makers of this fail in spectacular fashion, the horror elements are none existent, the romance is so cheesy & predictable I almost threw up & it took me four sittings of twenty odd minutes each to get through this because I literally couldn't get through it one go.
Then a member of the audience yells an expletive that clearly should have been deleted because it makes the whole scene look ridiculous.
That's because there isn't any, or for that matter any evidence that the level of birth defects has gone up in affected regions (with the exception of babies of pregnant women who actually worked on the cleanup at the time).
Emma, the 21-st century Alice, is a "pure soul" who can help the future, perhaps because she recoils after learning the hamburger she eats was once a cow.
At the end, the Gestapo FBI/Homeland Security forces, who track down Emma and her brother because they caused a multi-state power failure, instantly break off their pursuit and suddenly leave, immediately after witnessing Mimzy the robot rabbit disappear into the sky (a la E.T.?).
(1960), Unknown Island (1948), Robot Monster (1953), The Wizard of Mars (1965) & Tagani (1965) which is where the real reason for the 'Spectrum X' colour tinting is discovered because some of these films were Black and White so Adamson could just tint the whole screen one colour & it would match the rest of the film, brilliant stuff Al.
The monsters are rubbish, there are some stupid looking bat-men, a half a crab man, I say half because he always remains half submerged in water so we never get to see below his waist & the Vampire cavemen have the most fake looking plastic fangs in film history.
We have an alien atmosphere that changes colours constantly in order for the movie to incorporate old black and white footage seamlessly with the colour bits, or because of radiation or something.
It's a shame, because the premise of the movie seemed so good.
I must have  missed him, because no one in this movie even remotely  resembled the comic strip character.
Obviously, the director is trying to advice us, because the film is so bad that when I went out from the theatre I thought: "I shouldn't have come".
However, I don't think we have to praise what we feel is a mediocre presentation simply because it addresses a serious problem.
It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs.
I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie.
No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team.
Capra's movie was seriously overrated because there is a need around the Christmas holiday for people to feel good, be close to their families and friends and so on, things they generally do bad or unconvincingly around the year.
The story doesn't manage to be more than trivial but some people like it because they are conditioned by years and years of watching junk in the cinema that this is what a masterpiece should look like.
I watch the movie because it's been rated in my local magazine.
I think the scene is the worst part, because the earthquake made me laugh rather than be scared of Jun's fall...
Despite all its hype in India (may be because it's one of the first times a movie is without songs and all of sentimental flicks here and there), I can't rate this movie at par with Italian, French or Spanish classics.
But still, I will rate this movie good, because it is of one of the first and boldest attempts to revolutionize the trash-can Bollywood stories and movies.
Or maybe, it has got away with rave reviews and house-full theatres because it has no songs, has many English dialogues and an unusual story line.
Michelle joins a university where the teachers are not trained to deal with a student like her, and because of this, Michelle graduates only ten years after she joins.
Simply because her typing speed on a Braille typewriter is too slow for her to finish her examination within the time limit.
She is a normal person, who gets an abnormal lack of attention from her parents because of Michelle's constant needs.
It seems like entire scenes have been cut because they didn't "move things along" in the way some action-adventure genre film might need.
Evolved is so bad that I finally stopped it as the evening wore on because I wanted time for an antidote, something ELSE to watch before bedtime so I wouldn't think my entire day had first been wasted by work and now THIS.
Which is probably for the best, because the acting is so terrible that you're better off not seeing them.
Haunted House isn't even one of those terrible movies that you rent and laugh at because it sucks so badly.
The movie crew found out that some scary stuff wasn't due to them and they ran away because a friend of theirs got cold.
You may even find yourself rooting for the cannibals, because at least their hammy performances hold a small degree of comedy value in a "This is Uwe Boll-level bad" kind of way.
Throughout the showing i was surrounded by nothing but drunkards laughing at inappropriate times, this was annoying at first, but by the end, i had joined them...not because the movie was entertaining in any sense, but they seemed to have found the only way to enjoy it, and i wanted to try as well.
I only watched this one because I have owned it for so long now when I quit watching the second series of Afterdark films.
p.s i don't think its acceptable to elect a leader as the intelligent one purely because he wears spectacles, the vinnie jones laughing scene was pathetic too.
you can past that the general conceit of the whole film, America turning into a barren wasteland simply because they used up all the oil, is a straw dog impossibility and if you push aside that character's this stupid and ineffective could survive when nearly 2/3rd of the population have passed on, then this certainly had the capacity to be a fun little flick.
Actually, for a good portion of the film, it's quite intense and suspenseful because there seems like such little hope for these kids, without a head once he's removed(..the kind of leader who was quite smart with goal of starting over, competent in his abilities, whose weakness was trust which leaves him vulnerable)against such amoral brutes with a nasty visage and even nastier weaponry..they resemble extras from the second Mad Max film, THE ROAD WARRIOR.
I'm not too sure how much of this is 'real', because it looks like every shot has been superimposed over an Adobe photo edit.
Altman's project was actually probably doomed from the start, because the subject of weddings just isn't important enough for the brand of scathing satire that Altman brings to his movies.
As aunt and niece depart from the boat in the harbor, Stefania first learns about Megghy's plan to lose her virginity with some random guy, because the former girl scout who ditched her troop at the bus station, wants to be practiced for that other first time; with some boy she is actually in love with.
You couldn't add any spoilers for this film because there's nothing to spoil.
Its worth three stars simply because it's a period piece but you spend most of your time looking at the cool cars and the clothes, your mind wandering.
Humphrey Bogart does Humphrey Bogart with no surprises at all and although he's enjoyable to watch you just get bored because he's the same in just about every movie you've ever seen him in.
School's Out was only a good movie because it was the Degrassi people.
I guess I'm a tad on the puzzled side WHY, because SHE'S the one that seems to have all the money, the big house, etc., so I'm not sure what the motive is.
I've been after this movie for a while, though mainly because of the cool VHS cover and the fact that Yvonne De Carlo is in it.
The film is kind of watchable and semi-interesting, but isn't much of a horror film because there are no violent deaths.
She holds a *slight* grudge against her family because she's convinced that her sister stole the one true love of her life and now she developed the fiendish plan to use Greta's killing capacities to get revenge.
Greta also has voyeuristic tendencies, because she observes a young couple having (overlong) sex not once but twice.
Hester is rich, and she is angry at her sister and her niece and nephew, because she had had a relationship with her sister's husband prior to their marriage., and she feels she would have been better for him.
Well, you can't openly declare that you like (or even enjoy) watching this type of movies because then Â let's face it Â you automatically get a stamp on your head that says 'potential threat to society'.
This is the type of movie that would be financed by the Hungarian state these days, because you can sell it partly as artsy, partly as `a movie that explores the boundaries of human life and concerns deep social and moral issues'.
It works because we know intuitively that children are often the only ones with the innocence and purity and that certain clarity of intelligence to communicate seemingly impossible ideas - the faith of a child in action.
Some have commented on that his career failed because of his homosexuality.
Maybe this is because the technology that was our imaginations has become a reality today and there is now no need for these dated action shows.
Probably because they just didn't seem that much in love, but more in love with the idea of "maybe" being in love "somehow" ...because both of them wanted to be in love so badly.
That's all there is to say about this, but I will keep writing because I have to submit 10 lines of text for my review to be accepted.
I wouldn't have bothered because the film doesn't merit it, but I want to try and stop anyone else wasting their evening watching it like I did, so I'll keep on until I make the 10 lines needed.
And the argument that it must be good because Book Club was doesn't wash either.
It does not really work as such, largely because the two protagonists (and most of the other characters as well) are so unlikeable.
how dumb, come on people... i can't see this is a funny show at all, i even watched a million little fibers episode and it was not funny at all... they didn't respect Oprah's character and they made fun of her, i just wonder why we laugh to something while other's cry when they watch it... u know y i cried simply because media shows Americans and the whole world another face of Islam...a face they created especially for them.
The plots all involved him trying to trick people into giving him money or trying to trick women into sleeping with him or usually both of those things, all he did was con people and it always backfired because he was very bad at it and thought he was a lot smarter than everyone else when he wasn't.
The ideas were only half baked and none of the jokes were funny because the performances were so bad and it was just badly written, you could see exactly where everything was going.
I've watched several episodes of Jeff Ltd., because it can take time for a new series to find its rhythm.
None of the characters are likable and that is okay because you can have a comedy show with unlikeable people but the characters aren't funny either.
I hope it gets taken off the airwaves soon because Jeff Lts is pathetically bad.
I'm an avid Oliver Kalkofe fan because of his satirical "Kalkofe's Mattscheibe" TV show but I feared that he and his partners would not be able to deliver a good movie nor live up to the expectations of the fans.
- If your sister kills herself, it's because your grand-grandma wouldn't marry that guy in the desert.
The only value in watching the movie is that it is quite funny, unintentionally, at times just because it is so horrible.
Maria is a neurotic mess whose sister committed suicide and is being stalked by El Charro because of some wrong done by an ancestor.
If you're into cheesy horror films because you're bored and you need a good laugh, this would give Troll 2 serious competition.
By the time El Charro actually begins his work, it's a good bet that you'll either be asleep or, in my case, toughing it out because you don't like leaving things unfinished.
It wasn't easily discernible because the film was not that interesting to watch.
The girls, after having a brush with the law (avoided because the driver takes the mutter into her own mouth, er, hands), decide to stop in a bar and drink before continuing their ride.
When the girls want to leave (understandably so), the police officer makes them sit down because they will "miss the show".
The movie then proceeds to show us a goth guy in a suit screeching in an old microphone lyrics that apparently should tune us in the movie, because they are relevant to the heroine's situation.
This is a shame, because this movie does have a couple of nice scenes (when the crew doesn't go wild with the camera, that is).
I rate this a two, because I know some of the actors' are better then the material, and there are a couple decent kill scenes in the end, though nothing special.
), while her old house is on fire because of a car crash involving Louise Fletcher.
"Exorcist II" was a huge disappointment for me, specially because "The Exorcist" is one of my favorite films.
I don't want to give away anything about the plot because the surprises that gently unfold are what you and your family will enjoy about the movie.
If you are a fan of great character actors or just excellent acting in general, this is the series for you because Deadwood is all about the people.
I'm always more curious to see the movies that are unanimously panned by critics and audiences alike, because half of the time I end up finding out that these movies aren't that bad.
I stopped following the plot after a while, not because it got too complicated, but because I didn't care anymore.
Not because of the possibility of theft of his music (this, from a band that gained much of its initial notoriety through tape-trading).
Rather, it is because MP3 to a large extent levels the playing field in terms of exposure.
The former because he shows us that just because you have a number one single and multi-platinum album does not mean you are more successful.
The latter because he speaks the mind of every truly musical person on the planet when Lars plays him the track the band is thinking of opening the new album with, by telling Lars quite plainly that he would throw it in the trash, never to be heard again.
I am, however, replacing one and a half points because at least the film makes the link that people who are gratuitously cruel to animals are likely to harm other humans.
I replace a further one and a half because the heroine fights back.
This is the sorriest piece of garbage, that I've ever watched, and it should be trashed, because it is nothing but trash.. A waste of film on a bunch of apparently no-talent bums who wallow in the filth of their own minds.
Actually if you want to see the best part of the film, watch the accident that opens the film then turn it off because it never gets better than that.
No-one caught a beating or a dick they didn't want because of a drug debt.
This film is among the worst I've seen in ages--not because it's bad, but just because... well, there's no one to care about.
Apparently the book is quite different and has vampires in it or something so god knows what the screenwriters were thinking here because there's no undead chomping on the lifeless actors faces, although this actually would have made the movie vaguely interesting.
I would tell you what happened, but frankly I don't really know myself because the whole thing is so disjointed.
Overall, it was probably too late to scrap that one but I strongly suspect the only reason it got made in the end is because of many people who are fans of the writer and his work.
And that's really disappointing, because when I first heard about it, before there was a trailer, before the characters were nailed down, when they were still talking about one of the Olsen sisters as an actress, I was thinking this film was going to be great.
As in most of Ellis' work, the protagonists are a bunch of shallow, pretty rich kids (Jon Foster, Lou Taylor Pucci, Amber Heard, among others) and their just as shallow elderly peers/parents (Kim Basinger, who played Foster's lover in "The Door in the Floor", now plays his mother, who's depressed because of her husband's Â Billy Bob Thornton Â affair with the confused newswoman terribly played by Winona Ryder; less serious is Chris Isaak as Pucci's womanizing father, who seemed to have fun playing his character), in 1983 Los Angeles.
I rented it because it supposedly starred Australian actor Jack Thompson, a long-time favorite of mine who, it turns out, has almost no role in the movie.
Such plot contrivances are irrelevant however, because Feed makes little sense.
The philosophical note at the end rang empty, because, frankly, we just didn't care.
I use quotations because I'm fairly sure the makers of this film just asked friends and possibly strangers on the street to be in this movie.
At least I consider it irresponsible, because people will come to the movie not knowing the facts and come away thinking they've learned them.
Not in 1914, or whenever the scene is supposed to be taking place because the flashbacks are indistinguishable.
I'm giving it a four because 2 is usually reserved for pornos.
I had my opinions of this series booted off of review sites because of my "bias."
I give it 3 out of 10 stars, because it did have a good start.
The Musical" work: because the actors act as if they are in a serious drama.
If you intend to watch this film because you're a fan of Keira Knightley, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
The film is terrible because it shares no feeling about the real world that is much deeper and wider that can be beyond the imagination of the poor director.
If this sounds messy it not because I can't write a cogent commentary.
It's because this is a mess of a film which doesn't really ever make sense of itself.
The main character just die because the film need him to die at the end in order to continue the stupid script,if he's still alive, audience will not cry and the movie will not have the strong impact on audience.
I was very disappointed by this film, perhaps in part because it is South Korean and I've enjoyed Joon-Ho Bong's work a great deal, as well as some others.
We rented this movie because my 5 year old daughter liked the DVD cover featuring a "girl with the arrow".
at one point (forgive my non chron account) he even agrees to see this one girl who is not very pretty and who kind of masochistically insists on making it very clear that he doesn't really like her, in spite of which though of course because there is something seriously wrong with this guy he's willing to be with her...in fact when she's shooting a gun it really makes him think she looks "awesome" OK sure why not, look on the bright side why don't you.
I heard the director had a few issues with Koreeans when he made this movie, because he is believed to portray his country in dark colors.
It's really a shame because this style COULD have worked very well....with likable and more interesting people.
I'm a little disappointed with this movie because I thought that it would be better.
I'm prompted to write this review because my cable company is promoting this... feature film... as a PAY PER VIEW.
It's not one you can watch alone because part of the fun would come from joking about it with someone else.
Maybe this movie should have been called "The Living Dead who Refuse to Rot" because the majority of the "actors" talk like zombies!
I bought this (for $3.75) expecting at least the fun I had with Troll 2 because in spite of that movie's long list of shortcomings it had some very funny elements.
It had many built in messages, most of the hidden ones recognized by the older audience, but children still get the same type of impression of what is going on and why the outcast, goofy looking bird was left out of the group of all the other birds that looked alike, because children start to build social groups at younger ages than what most people would think.
True there are poverty stricken areas in SD, but Moneni was the wrong choice.First, because it's a township under the town council not Gov.
Your documentary is not the true reflection of the people and the beautiful kingdom because it doesn't give different views so it appears that it is a tool you and your friends(lousy political parties of Sd)are using to spark violence in the kingdom.
Sir, you need to know that the people who always cram the stadiums on the His Majesty's call are not doing that only because they love their culture but because they seriously love and support their King.
I think He should be on fire if he does not do anything about this documentary because it is not an insult to him but the whole Swazi nation, so if he really loves us , he should protect us from such.
That he should attend all international duties without food in the stomach because the Swazis are hungry.
Are we actually supposed to buy that people spoke and behaved in this mannequin-like manner, simply because that was what the era "dictated"?
Simply because it was saying nothing.
Of course politics won't burn their hands on this problem because of the powers of religions but the real problem are Too Many People, that is why the wild animals are leaving, dying out, there is not enough space.
I'm glad the movie was made, because I always wondered what happened to Robin and Marian after King Richard's return.
Simply because you can't believe anyone would make a movie like this.
I'm not sure if that's because they realize how stupid the film is or because the director is trying to use them as a moving laugh track.
Avoid watching this series, because it really isn't that good.
I gave it two stars because I felt generous.
I give it a 4 because of the "Field of the Cloth of Gold" sequence and the spectacular wood and canvas palace.
and gives him a blow job, and then throws a childish tantrum because Cute Neighbor wants to leave the next morning.
Again, this looks like one of those films that Andy Warhol would have produced over 30 years ago because it looks like it was filmed many years ago.
It also fails as a drama because we really get no explanation for the behavior of the characters.
Problem is it wasn't that funny really in the areas I should of probably because of the set of repugnant characters on screen no matter how dysfunctional and stupid they are.
Though I'm not a big fan of either Christian Slater or Richard Dreyfus, I have to say that they did their jobs and were just fine...which didn't matter because there was no real movie for them to act in.
I understand that just because I don't happen to like a movie doesn't mean it's a bad movie.
Throw in Portia De Rossi as Dreyfuss's daughter (and the 'I hate him for no apparent reason, no wait, now I love him for no apparent reason' relationship with Slater - and I use the term 'relationship' lightly; Tom Cruise had more chemistry with the fish in 'Jerry Maguire'), a painful cameo by RuPaul, a moderately funny though sadly underused Billy Connolly, a mob boss with all the menacing screen presence of American Pie's Chris Klein, two mob button men more cut out for a Home Alone sequel and a soundtrack that sounds like background music from a computer game, then have almost the entire movie played out as a series of flashbacks that Slater is telling mob hitman Critical Jim (played by Tim Allen, who is constantly quoting classic movies a la Remington Steele) and have the audience needlessly wonder at how much of what Slater is saying is true, if anything, and what kind of plot twist might be in store (needlessly wonder because *Spoiler* it's all true and there is no plot twist), and end it all with a cliched train station finish...  Well, what can I say.
Most of these 30's thrillers/murder mysteries have been forgotten by now because, let's face it, they haven't got much to offer apart from Â occasionally Â a good story.
This little film has a very decent story, fluently written dialogues and some really adequate acting performances, yet it simple can't be called memorable because of the shabbiness of the production.
I'm not really sure how to rate this one because it is so bad.
My best friend rented this because it had a scary cover and we watched it tonight for halloween.
Seriously, it has nothing remotely worth your time to offer... My wife and I wanted to see it in part because we just returned from our yearly vacation in Maine, and we hoped to see some Maine scenes in addition to watching a good New England horror flick around Halloween.
The Off Season...sounds like what the director was thinking before he started this production because this is not something I would want on my professional resume.
The only reason I sat through it was because some reviewers said it was so bad it was funny...It wasn't, it was painfully bad.
I don't think someone should watch it alone because it isn't as fun that way.
because It was very funny and it was just a hilarious story and well thought out.
The oddities soon take a toll on their relationship physically manifesting mainly against the girlfriend (probably because she doesn't walk around in the hotel room naked like any respectable B-Horror actress should).
No worries for her though because a dead relative that talks through the answering machine (only after the beep) to her will help guide her through the advances of dirty old men wielding small cactus, long haired freaky wet men cowering in the shower (don't get hopes up for any nudity!
this movie isn't scary or sad funny nothing this is more of a ghost story then a scary movie i wasn't scared but i wont give it a one because i thought it was good to watch there's only one or two good reviews on this i say its OK but   scary film so go rent that or this there are thousands of scary movies though more scary then this like high tension saw and much more and its nothing like the shining this is not a scary movie but if you like old like scary movies that are like this i say you rent it and wacth it and like it but if you like scary movies you can get something eles.rated pg13 for mild language
The bf freaks out and leaves, and the gf, jobless (because she has been sick for so long), is left to face the supposed evil of the room alone.
If I paid full theater price for this waste of film I would never go to another movie.Watching cartoons would be preferable.I was lucky because the DVD I rented was defective and only about fifty percent of it was viewable.
Then he meets the black girl (who apparently slept with many, many men) who seduces him - not the other way around - and she does so in spite of the fact that he suggested to her that he can't (screw her) because he has a date.
(Supposedly she sleeps with him only because she believes him that he is gay and needs curing; a faint comedic touch.)
I don't even understand why he was hiding the other two girls from the black girl; this is illogical because she, of all three, really shouldn't care less.
Not even halfway through the movie, my mom and I started laughing because it was just so pathetic to the point that it turned into a comedy.
It's very conventional filmmaking with very little personal, artistic touches to it but it's not 100% commercial filmmaking because of its low budget.
I wonder why they called it that because there's no shed to be found anywhere in the entire movie.
This is a low budget movie and it has it's flaws but I liked it because of the way it showed how loneliness, alienation and a bad upbringing can turn a man from being a quiet introvert into a peeping tom and then a murderer and then full blown insanity.
I thought of a couple of director Takashi Miike's movies while watching Full Metal Yakuza- Ichi the Killer and Izo- because of what they have sort of in line with it.
Its only real argument is that it had to kill people no matter how harmless because he was angry at other people.
If this movie were shot in America, I'd give it a 7/10 because too many things are simply formulaic and not done very well.
I was actually impressed with the producing because the movie looks very good for a small budget (under $1 mil).
Colour Me Kubrick is the same type of story, about a nasty little loser who pretends to be someone else because A.)
This movie has nothing to do with Stanley Kubrick so if you're intrigued because you are a Kubrick fan, don't waste your time.
The movies fails, because the Alan Conway character is never explored in any way.
She herself has probably been hunted, running for her life from baying dogs and humans who only want to destroy her because she would look good on a wall.
I felt sad for the white chick (grilfriend), not because of her colour, but as a women I could relate, when you think you know somebody but and realising that you don't and in such a matter is just so painful....., but on another hand....there was that element for me, of our black brothers going for white chicks... when they are loaded....even though in this movie that wasn't what brought them together.... interesting story indeed...
Just because there are some well known "names" in the cast do not believe that will save this film, because it does not.
The story, the plot and the players are all unrealistic in the extreme and just because they have made their career by other films will not salvage them or this picture.
Its a shame because the rest of the cast was stellar.
Part of this might have been because she was relatively new to America or perhaps she needed better direction.
I found them disappointing because they were just more of the same found in any number of other T&A duds.
This movie's plot was of a murder mystery, but the creators don't leave the audience in suspense because they reveal the killer as he is slaying his victim.
i thought this movie was kind of funny because david keith had sex with pamela anderson after a high speed chase.
This Martin Sheen film went almost completely unnoticed on its release, probably because the film company knew it wouldn't be worth promoting it.
It's more of a serial killer film than a supernatural thriller like the first (probably because they didn't have enough money for visual effects).
And if you're worried about violence and gore, you should be because it's just very nasty, disgusting, and mean-spirited rather than scary.
The only reason I am giving a 2 is because some of the actors managed to pull through the script.How they managed half of these scenes without bursting into hysterical laughter is beyond me.
With only a passing reference to Tim, the main character in the first Boogeyman, this film should not be classified as a sequel because when a second (or third) film in a series is made, there should be something there to make a positive connection.
This is the story of how a intelligent kid with the same hopes and dreams as anyone else; an education, work hard, get a degree and live his dreams through legitimate means, succumbs, despite himself, to a life of crime because it is his only course available.
The dialogue is unlike any on television, and because of this the show seems more realistic and engaging than any Western movie or series ever before.
Boogeyman 2 is the sequel to one of the worst horror films I have seen during the last 10 years.This sequel is better than the first part...but it also is a pathetic crap.Besides the good presence from Tobin Bell and ReneÃ© O' Connor,there is nothing to recommend in Boogeyman 2.The screenplay is horribly bad,the characters are completely generic and the movie is tremendously tedious from its first scene to its last one.Jeff Betancourt,who was the editor of some very competent movies (like The Good Girl or The Ruins),made his first work as a director in this movie,and it would be better if he goes back to editing movies,because the direction from Boogeyman 2 is pathetic for many reasons,but mainly,because it never finds a good tone and it is very chaotic.Boogeyman 2 belongs to the worst kind of horror cinema and I suggest you to avoid this big piece of crap.As I said,it's better (or,more properly,less bad) than the first part,but it's still unbearable and painful to watch.
I say Jeepers Creepers because the "Boogyman" looked a lot like he could have been the Creepers' brother in this movie.
As for the plot, it's a little bit incoherent because you actually don't know who killed the children's parents in the beginning of the movie.
Was it because Aishwarya and Abhishek had other business after sunset?
It's not worth bothering with reliving much of the story because there isn't much to tell.
I would stick to 'Step by Step', Satcha, because as an action star, you're pathetically weak.
Perhaps this movie failed because it was too sweet.
Given the choice between the "Sprocket" and her lovesick, obsessed ex-boyfriend, it's no wonder she chooses to go back with a guy who at one time refused to drive her to work because he didn't want to move his car from the opposite side of the street.
Eventually he does come clean and admit that he has a real problem because he can't have a meaningful relationship with his sexy and dynamic wife, and his affair ends just like that.
The film was supposedly modelled after the Woody Allen films like Annie Hall and Manhattan, but it's light years away from them because it's boring and the characters are completely unlikeable.
I rented this movie because of the great cast.
This is even worse than those because Bart Freundlich thought it was going to be about something important, and it's just absolute junk.
Spain's great filmmaker, Almodovar, complained this week that American movies have year by year become worse and worse because of their scripts.
Instead of making things believably come from the characters the film just pushes us this way and that way making things happen because it might be funny or it helps tie up loose ends, but it doesn't work with the stark realism of the New York setting.
Which is a shame because these two couples actually have chemistry.
I went to a preview screening of the film and I wish I could have talked to the director afterwards because with about 25 minutes of trimming they could have had a much tighter, old-style Woody Allen sort of film.
Smith's movies are great because they are daring and avoid formulas.
This guy is a fantastic actor and I say that because I didn't know that this was the SAME guy who played "Warren" (Mary's "special" brother) in There's Something About Mary.
I guess that if you watch it uncut nothing happens because in the full uncut nothing really happens.
This has nothing to do with what's going on in the movie and if it does, someone correct me because I haven't figured it out.
There is about as much entertainment value in Sleuth as there is in watching a tree stump rot, and that may even be an overstatement, because at least doing that you can use your own imagination.
The reason I put the word "fooling" in parentheses is because the husbands are basically just sitting close to their servants and talking and playing with each other though that's enough for the wives to get suspicious.
Kevin Williamson refused to write the script because he was satisfied with his ending.
"I Know What You Did Last Summer" was OK, specially because of Sarah Michelle Gellar (the most beautiful woman in the whole world).
In short, this movie deserves completely the title it has been given in Italy: 'Incubo Finale' ('Final Nightmare'), because it IS a nightmare of a movie, and to use a pun, it's not a horror movie, but a horror of a movie.
At the end we had to check on the internet the duration of the movie because we were sure a part were missing... but actually not,  ;-) So to summarize, here we go, a sexy girl from a town want to be an actress, and once her boyfriend cheat on her, she and her best friend go to Madrid and spend all their money, buying clothes, making new tits... then she is sad because she can't be an actress so go to her boy friend, and once the figure out that he is still seeing the girl he cheat on her with she go back to Madrid crying, that's more o less the whole movie.
I do this so that I can get my 10 lines published because they won't publish it unless I submit 10 lines of commentary for publication.
I give this a full star instead of a half star (My lowest rating) because i'm feeling generous.
And I almost forgot to mention the overacting... oh boy...  None of the characters seem real anymore, because their lines worked against them (with the exception of Christopher Judge who did a good job with the piece of crap he was given).
Which they manage to find because Daniel Jackson has visions about its location!
The family trashes poor Jacob because he dares to have feelings, questioning the masculinity of a child.
It's classified as a "reality TV program" when in fact Pauly Shore himself admitted a great deal of it is written because he is bored by reality TV.
I use to watch this show only because there wasn't anything else interesting on at the time.
CSI Miami is a much better show because it's their job to do forensics and they're also police officers at the same time.
The Miser brothers seem almost in the story because they were in the first one.
And to be honest, most people are going to watch this movie because the loved the miser song from the first one.
Another person commented that because they were an extra, they know what a great movie it is.
Furthermore, having a bit part in a film often colors your thoughts on the film because few people want to announce to the world that they were in a film that was a complete piece of garbage.
It's not just because they're old and people remember them nostalgically, it's because they connect with the audience and actually resonate where the modern TV movie wannabes don't.
An abomination so heinous, so repulsive, so reprehensible that the excess amount of bile that my body doesn't process because of my missing gall bladder creeps up my esophagus thinking about it.
I think the director and writer were going for the opposite of the animated version, because that is what they got.
The grand kids weren't disappointed at Christmas because I had recorded many of the "good" Christmas specials for them and didn't make them suffer through this one.
It's a shame the movie studios all closed down their TV movie units in the 80s because TV movies need all the help they can get.
The idea of this evil wig has quite a potential in fantastic sense (It is interesting to see how the wig was created and why the wig does what it does) and on a psychological level (The effects of wearing a wig can be quite substantial especially on people who have lost their hair because of an illness!
AFTER reading some viewers reviews HERE I DECIDED to watch this feature because it is reportedly "balanced".
it definitely targets young "stand-up" guys and attempts to give people a subconscious reason as why we have to AGREE with what is going on( even have a speech about "choices" people have in America and take it for granted because the youth is the "pussy" generation apparently).
(i doubt that will happen simply because this administration will prefer private armies ,"blackwater" for example, that are not responsible to the any international tribunals upon killing civilians)it is doing so by TRYING to make choice easier for you to the point you actually could believe that it IS your choice for the "best".
at one point it even tells new-yorkers that they should be more concerned with doing the "first-strike" because they would be the first target if "someone" acquires "weapons of mass-destruction"( so wait... this actually must be about Iran since everyone knew, by the time this feature was produced,that Iraq had no such "evil" things?).
That's no longer true because of Cream.
I believe that the only reason he even had a part in this show was because in a Sonic show, you pretty much have to include Tails.
Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.
It was so painful to sit through the movie simply because I don't understand it at all!!
After 70 minutes I was completely bored but I watched the end because I am sure I will not watch this movie again.
If you want action try somewhere else because this will leave you under whelmed.
I am kind of upset about it too because I generally enjoy indie films, there is a freshness to them.
Maybe these critics were smoking some cigarettes with some weed-induced nutrients because this film was all wrong.
I didn't really like the characters in it because they are stereotypical and simple, but I guess you have to make them like that because if you don't it would be difficult for the audience to get to know all the characters since there is a lot of them in this film.
This film had to have been written by a junior high school student, because that's the only mentality that could enjoy it.
It seems to me that the only people this movie would appeal to are those absolutely void of any semblance of a brain, because this movie is kind of like a slow-growing fungus.
Their storyline was the most interesting to me, probably because they had the most intellectually stimulating conversation.
I very rarely give a film a rating below 5, (gave this one a 3) not because there are no bad movies, it's just that I don't watch films that I think are going to be bad.
I taped this one just because it had Justine Bateman in it, and I had liked some of her stuff on TV.
He was NOT a filmmaker, just a guy who felt like making a film because of his love for movies.
I do not have a problem with the film's low budget, because so much creativity can happen in a low budget movie.
Why risk poisoning an entire area of wildnerness just because two agents haven't reported back?
In their boss Briggs (Paul Haskin) office, we know it's a Feds office because there's a big table, swivel chair and an American flag, he tells agent Phillips (John Amplas) to spray the whole area with an experimental, untested, toxic, chemical herbicide called Dromax.
However, the film can't capitalise on this plot base; I'm not sure if it was because of the budget constraints, or merely a lack of talent on the writer's part, but most of the film is made up of tedious sequences; and even the parts where the zombies get to munch on human flesh aren't up to much.
I've got no idea why this film was banned, as while there are gore sequences in the film; none of them are particularly gruesome, and I reckon that whoever made up the actual 'Video Nasty' list decided to take this film out of circulation because it's a zombie film.
Also, adults seem to like this one more because it is less "cutesy" and more "dark," but I disagree with any such opinions.
I don't especially enjoy or appreciate kid/family oriented stuff that much, but I don't find this any more appealing to me because it is supposedly more "mature."
The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 instead just 1 is because I found acting pretty solid and good old "jumpy" effects a la John Carpenter copied pretty well (like she is walking back and bumping into someone - simple but still scary).
The second part, however, turned into a supernatural slasher and I was actually quite thrilled, because the first part of the film had been really bad.
I believe he told Buffy that she does not love him, just because he knew that he would die and he wanted her to leave so that she would not die as well.
I never watched it on TV because when the Buffy movie came out, I hated it (of course, a lot has changed since then).
In fact it's so bad that you no longer even root for Annabelle's happiness because she becomes such an annoyance.
I watched the film hoping for redemptive quality; instead, I stopped the film when they kissed passionately because it was evident that the plot progressed beyond the point of no return.
It is never acceptable simply because the student makes the first move.
I had to give this movie a 1 out of 10 because IMDB.com does not allow 0 out of 10, which is what this movie deserves.
I initially rented this movie because of its high rating and I just want to contribute a low score to prevent others from renting it solely because of its high rating.
It would have been more effective this way because it would have showed that it was not the lack of creativity and variety in bed that made her feel uneasy with her boyfriend -- But it was just the unfortunate fact that he was born a male.
OK its a lesbian film, fantastic there should be more of them, but this is not a good film just because its made by a lesbian for lesbians.
Believe me i never comment on the internet on films and stuff because, you know, its peoples choice to like it or not to.
actually i am dumb enough because i paid 3 bucks to see this movie because i thought it looked halfway decent, like an actual good slasher film.
Not to mention that, after Tea's mum died because of Irena, Tea continues to write to Irena while she is in jail and pick her from prison years later.
No - it is a true description of this film because that is the word that jumps to minds on seeing this film.
Each fleeting moment of contact is so sexy because it never actually leads to anything between the two.
Firstly because I had been woken up to suffer it, and secondly because every time I see the beautiful painting that inspired it, I will be left with the painful image of a mute Scarlet Johansson and a mute Colin Firth in a room together, with not an ounce of tension between them.
By all accounts, his marriage to Catherina who he did in fact paint several times (in contrast to what is suggested in Chevalier's storyline that he never painted her because she did not understand or appreciate his work)was a happy marriage.
The heavy metal soundtrack particularly made me laugh, mainly because it reminded me of the horrendous 80s rock.
Which isn't really a bad thing, because it's so SO SO bad it's almost kind of interesting.
But you can't like him because he is not getting rid of the whole cast fast enough.
I say this because I was the first guy to die in this movie.
In what began as a kick back movie to have some laughs ended up in feeling uncomfortable with the whole movie because of the constant reminders.
In conclusion, the constant moral reminders of the film killed many of the laughs because we are reminded that we really shouldn't be laughing at that.
But it has to be the most stupidly bad comedy film ever made, while watching the film you cant help but think that if the story was put in the right hands it probably would have been a good movie (with Jim Carrey in the lead and maybe David Zucker directing) but it is one of those films that is so dumb SO badly acted and directed that you actually cant help but laugh all the way through it, so does this make it a good comedy because its funny for all the wrong reasons?, NO!
Wind Chill, like last year's The Strangers falls flat on its face because it is incapable of suspense.
Pity, because Emily Blunt is terrific.
This was a painful movie to watch, not because of it's depth, but because it is so inexcusably horrible.
Half of the time, you can't understand what is being said because the characters chime in and say random things that drown out what someone else is saying, or the microphone doesn't pick them up.
Later on in the movie, we learn that his motive for going on a killing spree is because he never received payment for the house those teenagers are staying in from one of their father's.
The only reason I checked out this movie is because in the credits it states that China Kantner is in this movie.
This was a painful movie to watch, not because of it's depth, but because it is so inexcusably horrible.
Truly a pity, because this could have been a great film.
I thought this movie was almost a waste of my time and give it a 1.5/5 mainly because I am usually a fan of Susan Sarandon (She was the only reason I was interested in seeing this movie in the first place !)
Mr. Connolly's bad day is not over because he takes off from work in search of adventure and runs smack into Sharon Stone.
You will be marking your DVD with your thumbnail early on on this clunker because about 5 minutes of this stinker is 5 minutes too much.
I hope DeNiro made a lot of money because he lost a lot of my respect by involving himself in something so crappy.
and the director expects everyone to laugh because, hey, it's Robert De Niro, and that's FUNNY.
Rene Russo is wasted too although then again I don't think she was put in the film for her acting skills - they just got her because she looked like the character.
Overall this is a disappointment because it begins so promising and turns into a dud.
These types of films like Scooby-Doo not only aren't funny because of this but also completely miss the point of the original.
Scooby Doo wasn't Scooby because the ghosts were real and Rocky and Bullwinkle are not R & B because the celebrities gushing all over theses cg shadows are real.
I watched R&B because Robert De Niro was in it.
I admit that the reason I watched this was because my cousin, Tim was involved heavily in its creation.
I think DEADWOOD is an antidote for all manner of propaganda, because it was pointedly intended to illustrate the evolution of orderly society from anarchy.
More clearly than in two seasons of DVD commentaries, he justifies his use of profanity in the series, explains his resistance to modern settings, and places the responsibility for understanding the DEADWOOD phenomenon on the audience, because the networks can't be bothered to re-educate anybody.
why... because it looks like its a high school play gone bad.
it makes me think that people are still searching for that dare to be unemployed situation because if anyone ever try's to sell this they will surely end up in the unemployed section of the world because of traumatic reasons.
It's because the sound engineer had screwed up and you couldn't hear any of the pathetic dialogue, so they'd just upped the volume in general to try to get round it.
I couldn't believe this film was made in 2006 - it seems much older because the general quality of the film is so poor.
The fights in the movie are done pretty naive, but there is one definitely good thing: it lasts 1 hour and 15 mins, so that is good, one cannot get bored so much, but that is too short for a movie, because the story is cut to a bunch of scenes which go one after another without cohesion, well thats my personal opinion.
I decided to watch this movie on a Sunday night because I had nothing to do and to be honest I expected a lot more.
If you are in such a dire need to see a pirate movie because Pirates of the Caribbean is no longer doing it for you, and you find yourself desperate enough to rent probably the worst pirate movie ever made, by all means, rent this movie, but do yourself a favor and watch the version with the commentary with the director (who plays a small part in the movie and actually does a decent job at it) and some other guy.
Whoever decided to cast the blond girl as the part of the pirate who had killed 17 men and was supposed to look like a boy, must have been doing some serious hallucinogens at the time because this girl was so bad, she was the epitome of the word 'suck.'
I gave it 4 stars out of 10, only because the scenery is fantastic, and so is some of the artwork depicting fairies and other such creatures, but the position the film takes on this subject is all wrong otherwise.
Sometimes when i hear a bad review about a horror movie, I just blow it off because I like to experiene the movie myself, but this time I should have taken the advice.
Just because their are interesting hills and trees does not mean fairies exist.
And it's hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him.
One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business.
But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them.
This comment is on behalf of everyone who has watched Soderbergh's "Solaris", didn't like it and were told they didn't like it because they haven't read the book or seen the original.
If you want to watch this film, promise to let me know how you liked it because I would rather not have suffered alone.
I'm going to stop there because if I go on, I'll blow the whole plot.
I have not read the novel on which the film is based and I have watched Tarkovsky's version twice (because it demands it), but by judging this 'Solaris' on its own merits, I think this version is simply a load of old plop.
I liked it because of Lems very detailed description of the forms which Solaris creates and the accidents which happened there.
After I read the book I found out that there was a movie about this book and - because I really wanted to see those forms, the surface of Solaris and to compare them to those in my imagination - I watched it.
That he detested FBI director J. Edgar Hoover but couldn't bring him down because of his "file" on Kennedy has been buzzed about in the media for at least thirty years.
Basically the scenario is this: Mengele (Peck) clones Hitler about 100 times, then kills all the clones' adoptive fathers because Hitler's father died.
RATING: 1 out of 10 (ONLY because you can't have 0 out of 10).
That lesson would be decent enough to take in except that in the case of Livin'Large,the lesson becomes heavy handed.Dexter,played by Terrence Carter,changes more and more and becomes more remote from his ghetto neighborhood roots as he becomes successful.When a realtor shows him around a new townhouse he is going to buy,and his girlfriend tells Dexter that she can see the old neighborhood from the townhouse and Dexter replies,to his girlfriend's dismay,"and that is the way I prefer to see them from",the movie shows how much he is changing because of success and not for the better.
This one's a 2* presentation; the second "*" because it does have some mild "fascination."
It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension.
This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely.
I checked out the DVD at my library because I liked Benji, but I hated this film.
Kids will not like this movie because nothing happens!
My husband rented it because the box said something about a "menage a trois" and he thought it would have some sex scenes.
That movie gave me a headache too, but I was able to sit through it, because it had the one thing going for it this one didn't, at least in the first half hour, i.e.
I thought it was a good use of symbolism casting Joey Budafoco in this movie because just like him this movie is TRASH.
The jokes all fall flat, including the excrutiatingly unfunny "bank" skit, that just went on and on until I was squirming out of my chair - not from boredom (well, not ONLY because of boredom) - but because like many of the "jokes," it outstays its welcome to a point of discomfort.
I actually prefer the horrible ones because occasionally they do actually make you laugh unlike Claude and her pals, complete misfits who's characters have been done before (the white geeky guy and the black strong mama type) it's all very safe, unoriginal and boring.
The movie's soundtrack is so sentimental, so heavily laden with strings to overemphasize every moment of incident with its crescending bulge, it takes away the possibility of the unexpected, because "Aideista parhain" is essentially a European version of a prestige film meant to secure multiple Oscar nominations.
It's a far-fetched notion that Eero never broached the subject with Kirsti in all those years, because if he felt like a consolation prize to a German, logic dictates that he'd return to Sweden and seek the real love of a devoted mother.
Not that this story can't be turned into something good because with a decent writer, director and cast anything...even the most stereotypical of stories and genres can be made fresh and new and interesting but Nearing Grace doesn't even try.
Long time TV Director Rick Rosenthal isn't used to making something longer than 45 minutes and isn't used to the fact that we need to know about these characters in the run time of a film because they won't be back next week to give us more.
They should have left the story and character building to his character because if anyone in this cast could have pulled it off it would have been Morse but he falls flat with this script.
I don't know who to blame but I think it's mostly to rest on the shoulders of the writers and the director because they tried to create something that at best might be an "R" rated episode of Dawson's Creek but even that was far more entertaining than Nearing Grace could ever be (witty title by the way.)
Steer clear of this indie film because it has Brad Renfro and Dominique Swain written all over it and if you know what I mean by that you'll know how bad this really is.
He manages to bring the stitched together monster (David Prowse) to life, but because of an accident the brain was damaged by shards of glass and renders Victor's creation near uncontrollable and extremely violent.
This is supposed to be a remake to Hammer's original Curse of Frankenstein, it is not counted as the sixth in the series because of this fact, and because it is a little ridiculous.
The film fails on both counts because of the cheapjack production values and the general air of mockery, and because Bates plays the Baron as an arrogant, dissolute youth with few redeeming features, completely lacking the ice-cold authority of Peter Cushing in his prime.
While an interesting idea, the film falters not just because of the lousy payoffs for several characters, but also because the film was so stark and cheesy (though some of this can be attributed to the fact that this was such an early Talkie).
There is a climactic moment, at which Howard finally guesses the secret of the voyage, when we can almost sense a first-act curtain descending, because of the way that Howard delivers his lines and the fact that the camera lingers on him several seconds as he stands frozen, a demented, untinentionally hilarious, pop-eyed expression on his face.
Most of the other interesting action of the film happens off-screen, because Bindler and the other film makers failed to capture it.
All in all, this movie is bad because it doesn't make any sense.
I had a feeling when i rented this movie i may not like it because of all the horrible straight to DVD movies these days.It reminded me a lot of the movie "room 6" that came out a year earlier.Literally the exact same plot in almost the exact same screwed up hospital which no longer existed.Hallucinations and weird nurses running rampant as some chic is trying to escape encountering other weird patients who are trapped.Finally some soul ripping creature dressed in a black cloak is killing off each patient in her dreams.This movie makes no sense.There is no way to tell what is really happening and it has no continuity.She wakes up from a nightmare to find out she's still in it.
After we finished the book, our class watched this movie...while I had fun watching it because its so terrible at points I couldn't stop laughing, it's really a travesty.
That was the saving grace of the DVD because I'm Canadian.
Sometimes, these really bad films can also be accidentally hilarious because of how poorly created they are.
I recently watched Empire of the Ants because I like Joan Collins, but also because I wanted to see if it was really as bad as everyone says.
That's being generous, because I would have rated it a 1 if it weren't so hilarious.
Ms. Collins outdoes herself and it rates a 2/10 only because even I, in my eternal cynicism, can't believe that those involved in making this film intended for it to be taken seriously (as much as it seems that they do).
These two films are more enjoyable to watch than "Empire of the Ants" because they are so awful they at least provide some laughs.
I figured the director would kill them off because it was slowing down an already slow pace to the movie - but not like that!
Good old Gus is reduced to an extra with a few lines (like passing on that 'Flicka' is Swedish for 'little girl) instead of a caring and involved farmhand who disobeys his boss because of a little boy's love.
I've seen a little boy injured because he hid into a strange horse's stall believing it was his "friend."
Nobody but a 12-year-old girl should find "Flicka" appealing, and I would recommend against letting any 12-year-old girl see it, because it rewards bad behavior and sets a terrible example.
We may give "Flushed Away" a chance, only because the guys behind the beloved "Wallace & Gromit films, and "Chicken Run."
With his most recent film Bells of Innocence (quite enjoyable actually), he used no martial arts at all and I noted how maybe now because of his age, he was phasing this out of his act and concentrating more on expanding his range.
Problems with the general plot (of how, dragons that dissappeared because thier food was exhausted, managed to stay alive below London for millions of years - and come awake the instant a human touched them... and then only one male exists on the planet) can be distracting.
The greedy people in town are in the dumps because their supply of 'ice-money' is melting and the Russian dictator down the block wants the hottest girl in the village to be his chick... or something like that.
I only knew about the movie because one of the Looney Tunes DVDs showed a scene from it in which Bugs Bunny, Doris Day and Jack Carson tell a boy to wake up to the tune of Franz Liszt's "Second Hungarian Rhapsody".
In conclusion, unless you're one of those people who thinks that any hokey movie turns into a masterpiece just because a bunch of people start singing, you'll definitely want to avoid this movie.
By comparison to that footage, the final scene looks like a lame coda: whatever its artistic merits, this scene did not grip my attention because there is no build-up to it.
Almodovar did this kind of Z-movie jokes decades ago because he started his career shooting those cheap yet energetic movies on his way to polishing his skills as a wonderful director with lovely stories to tell.
I can accept movies like Lord of the Rings and Spiderman because they aren't actually supposed to take place in real-time.
I would like to know what Pacino was on while reading the script, because I don't believe that an actor of his caliber would agree to do this film while stone cold sober.
The 88 minutes gimmick made no sense, because the film was not shot in real time.
Not because of the story per se, but because: 1. director Avnet of the B-variety, has problems to stick to the basics and instead tries, probably with an award in mind, to create a work of art, and 2. the script (which should have been used as 2-ply by Pacino in his powder room after reading).
Man... Well, first off I promise I'm not a 'Troll' and I'm not going to say something brainless and general like 'worst movie ever' because it isn't : ) However... after thinking about it honestly, I THINK what this film is, is a good example of what probably could have been a good film and I don't know WHAT the hell was done to it, but man oh man... the result is literally STUNNINGLY awful.
Now, apparently there must have been serious trouble with the production because of it being delayed so much in addition to the change in directors.
Funny too, because there IS indeed a good film in here somewhere; the story itself is very good, the actors obviously are good.
I was thinking 'Was it the script' because so much of the dialog and interaction was so awkward; but a good director can work around that and fix it enough so that it doesn't turn out THIS bad.
Not because of the hideous script, crass emotionally inconsistent acting (including Mr Pacino -Sorry Al!
), banal-but-predictable plot (complete with by-the-numbers set pieces - someone had a checklist) or even because of the painfully inept direction but because it reminds you that there is a part of the film industry out there prepared to make and release terrible films such as this for a quick buck and willing to pull down A-list(ish) talent to it's grim level in the process.
Despite all the horrible reviews, I do recommend 88 MINUTES because the screening I attended was filled with so much non-stop laughter.
Over the years I've watched boring (Simone), long and preachy (Angels in America), and just bad (Oceans Thirteen, Two For the Money) movies primarily because he's the Godfather, Lt. Frank Slade, Serpico, and Scarface to me and he always will be.
A shame, because the basic story showed some real promise.
This movie did make me feel for the woman because of her illness, and for the cancer it made me feel like she has hope... of dieing.
We get no information about their musical backgrounds, and their idea of jamming is to feign a version of "Iko Iko" while driving in their stolen van (I say 'feign' because the sound of their unison vocals is distinctly studio-enhanced).
I can't belive another title for this was night of the demon, because there is no demons in sight.
I'm not going to call this a turkey because the whole thing is not even funny bad, it's just bad bad.
Currently over 58% of this films votes are "1", probably because it appeared on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
No worries this time though, because I'm keeping it short and sweet.
Honestly, I rated this film a 1 because of this horrid plot twist at the end.
The whole movie is just kids bummed out because James Dean died.
No, because there are none.
For example: Why was the father running around town disrupting everyone's life who were strangers just because he was having a baby?
This worked out pretty good a few years ago when Pixar released "toy story" and "a bugs life" because then it was original and groundbreaking, the new visual style made you forget flaws in the story.
Simply because the aforementioned movies were all bad enough to be good.
The producers knew it would make money because they had good voices, like Halle Berry and Ewan McGregor.
This is why this movie failed, because it's exactly like every other cartoon movie made over the last fifteen years.
"Robots" treats us to a pastiche of set pieces stuck together by a plot that is so clichÃ©d it's virtually impossible to put a spoiler in here because you've already seen it all before: Evil corporation, valiant naive hero, funny sidekick, "you're okay just as you are" theme.
And it's really too bad because "Robots" is a visual treat.
It's one of those "near miss"" movies that will frustrate you, because it could have been great.
I give it a 4 out of 10 because I'm midway with this movie.
The "writer" helps Tiuri "because strange things are happening in the country".
But please, rent it, or much better, try to lend it from friends or family or any one who was drunk enough to buy this one, because in all honesty, the idea the creators of this flick receive any more money makes me sick: they should be in the TV business, not the film industry.
There are elements that could be part of a better film in either genre, but because the tone is so inconsistent, it fails in both regards.
The most intelligent reaction is for the audience to realize that it has been "put on", because we sure have a campy result.
The quality of the picture is pretty dismal throughout, with the ending being almost unwatchable because it was filmed outside in the dark, the few effects are for the most part non-effective (except one involving poor ol Preacher).
Settled for 7.5 and rounded that up just because I like dragon movies in general.
Get a breathtaking novel, cross out everything except the chapter headlines, write a complete new story, add some Actors who really don't get the characters right (and really don't have the chance, because the story and their character were crucially changed by the director) and - voilÃ  - you've got Timeline.
Although happy to have watched it, I'll never watch it again primarily due to the unnecessary and continual arguments and, secondly, because I could not understand why the 'bad guys' behaved as they did.
The effect is bad, because the whole team is all the same panicking, without someone wise and calm.
This movie is only getting two stars because nobody gives two stars for movies and I wanted to distinguish myself.
Now, maybe it is because i grew up watching her as lipstick lesbian Beth Jordache in Liverpool soap Brookside, but as a french graduate, i certainly am able to say that her accent is pitiful and incredibly stereotypical.
Another reason I had decided to rent this is because one of the other users here who had posted a review made a comment about how great the acting was.
She must've been high, because this was laughable.
Stuck in traffic because of downed power lines and a man who refuses to move his wrecked car?
I stayed with this film because of the direction, but I ended up watching a cinematic Hallmark card.
The homage, whilst being a nice idea, serves nothing to the story and feels like it was placed in there simply because one of the writers has a soft spot for the work of Howard Hawks.
In most instances, I like to begin one of these "reviews" (I put that word in parentheses because I'm not sure that what I'm doing here would actually constitute a "review") with a plot summary.
Its initial publication caused controversy in some quarters because of a startling trick pulled by Agatha Christie.
Unfortunately, I doubt that ITV will ever go back and do this one properly, because subjective camera-work could lead to a very atmospheric film version of this story.
Maybe it's because I am not an Aussie, and I did not get all the subtleties of this film.
This is the first review I have posted, and that's because this is the only movie I have ever felt angry about wasting my time trying to watch.
I would have liked to recommend this film because the acting is good and the story is interesting, but the disappointing way the filmmakers chose to wrap up the story puts too much of a damper on the overall enjoyment.
I remember seeing the ad campaign but I never saw the movie because I was too young back then.
at the prologue of the movie (accompanied by some of the most annoying synthesizer music ever recorded) and is not seen again till he returns there in the epilogue, because those scenes feel like they were pasted in from a different film.
I like old B-horror because it's different, because it's outlandish and rebellious, because it can be refreshing compared to all the big-budget, super-hero garbage of today.
Actually, I wouldn't mind a DVD release, with some audio commentary, which might shed a little light, because I just know I missed something.
The only reason this film gets 4 stars and not 5 is because, being a film about human struggle, it could've done with a bit more character development.
He seems to get away with it because, sadly, not that much happens in the movie, anyway.
Joaquin de Almeida's stuff is really well done, it would probably hold up well in a good movie but looks even better here because of the awful stuff that surrounds it.
But "No Vacancy" is a must see for her fans because of her physical appearance.
Christopher Walken was occasionally funny, simply because of his delivery...and well, that's it.
I give this movie a 3/10 because it had Christopher Walken in it, and because it had a plot that could have been used to much greater effect.
They weren't necessarily realistic, but they were believable, because they established a set of rules and stuck by them.
Not only does Daytona lose the championship, but also his coach as well as father--U.S. Marine sergeant Pete Daytona (Robert Patrick of "We Are Marshall")--dies at the hands of the infamous Asian criminal, Feng (tough guy Christopher Walken of "Pulp Fiction"), because he cannot pay off his debt.
He solicits a volunteer from the audience to participate in a gag, and the guy drops dead from a heart attack because Randy's ping-pong balls strike him in such rapid succession.
And because the director lacks most of his humorous sense, he found it amusing.
The director deserves this criticism because Lopez' character has so much screen time.
Not because the show was disappointing, but because the show ended.
I have watched it and I do have a copy, mainly because I already have the miniseries.
I could only watch half of it because it seemed to have little in common with the original "Thorn Birds"; it simply lacks the romance and the characters do not possess the emotional depth of the first series.
Hercules seems to hold a grudge because as Lucy is walking out of the club he jumps out and puts a curse on any future child Lucy might have, he says "your child will be as big as I am small, and will be possessed by the devil!"
I think the film fails slightly because the idea just isn't developed at all, the whole film is basically the baby being violent and killing the odd person, other characters like Lucys friend Mandy and Dr Finch are introduced, but nothing is done with them over the bare minimum.
There's also some scenes involving women being in the buff, because of the main character's ex-occupation.
Well that's what any sane person would do because you'll be struggling not to find this whole concept to be simply droll.
Anyway, because of turning down a dwarf's advances the child is cursed to be possessed by the devil.
Horror films were a major feature of the British cinema in the sixties and early seventies, largely because such matter could not be seen on television, the broadcasting companies regarding it as being unfit for family viewing.
The genre declined in importance in the second half of the decade, largely because the broadcasting authorities were becoming more permissive about violence provided it was shown late at night, and in the eighties the industry, freed of its addiction to horror exploitation movies and silly sex comedies, underwent a revival when it returned to making intelligent and watchable films.
I'm not because this is one of the most totally inept British movies from the 1970s .
Well, it's because it falls into the "it's so bad that it's funny" category.
1 out of 10. only because they won't register a zero.
This story is supposed to be funny but it is not, not even because of the bad language used that is supposed to be funny you can really laugh.
Attempting to explain the plot would be in vain, because this film was made solely to concentrate on Chesty's breasts.
Honestly, the only reason I watched this movie was because Mark Harmon was in it - for like 3 scenes.
Part of it is because we have no idea what's true and what isn't.
Something like the Chinatown she's my sister/my daughter, Henry is either Augusta's son, her nephew, or she just lied to him at the funeral because she needed someone with access to money.
She faxes a scan of it to her evil boss (we know he's evil because he's got a beard) before driving to meet her husband.
It's not particularly funny, it doesn't work as a 'documentary' because you learn nothing slightly interesting or fascinating about the characters nor do you gain any insight when you see them or him in action, and the acting is so unnatural that it comes across in some parts as a bad improvisation game, it doesn't work as a gangster film because the majority of the film is spent on dull conversation.
This film is called the Magician because obviously like Shoesmith's dead bodies (which you never see but he does talk about) he makes things disappear, however a Hit Man knows how to hit his target, something this film certainly failed to do.
Being a 16 year old teenager at the time, it bugged me, because the movie in no way represented my generation.
I think movies like this one, did little in trying to persuade teenagers in the 1950s to be good, because they failed to keep it real.
But you got to love Mamie Van Doren as Tamblyn's 'aunt' who tries to seduce him since she's not getting any because her husband has flown the coop.
It's clear he inherited the family talent, which he was to squander, because he also inherited the predisposition to chemical experimentation.
I say seems because they are all of a sudden spending time together.
I'm very disappointed about this film, I actually expected something from Gael GarcÃ­a, but I can say that without question is the worst film I ever watched: - There is no plot at all - The characters are very weak - The direction is awful, even Gael as an actor performs very bad - Edition & Cinematography are below an acceptable film - The difference between social classes in the film is not clear and it doesn't exist at all, in Mexico we can consider all the characters in the film from the same social class (only different life-style)  After watching it, you'll get the feeling that you were watching a home video of one of your so-so parties, because even most real-world parties are a lot more fun and interesting than this film.
I did not feel sorry for him because his affection for Chuck was not returned in kind.
I'm giving this movie a 3 only because some of the acting was good.
Although the film has its moments they're few and far between simply because the story is so boring.
I can only assume people enjoyed this film because it gave them some kind of emotional response and it offers the illusion of depth and complexity where none exists, but "Chuck & Buck" is the kind of film that's more or less throttled independent cinema in its crib and paved the way for similarly dire work.
Did Chuck do it because he really thought it would end it all, or because he was many martinis deep and horny?
okay, no i don't really feel feel cheetah-ed, because i knew this was going to be really dumb and bad just from watching the commercials thay were running all the time.
they are all really shallow and spoiled and whiny; kind of like those rich Disney girls must be in real life, so that is why i don't understand how the acting sucks so bad because probably they are just playing themselves anyways.
I loved the sense of fashion in the film; girls dancing routines were great, some girls gained weight and it's OK, which I liked the most because it sends out a message to kids-teens who are pressured by the Media to loose weight and to be skinny.
These beasties are quite randy too, because at nearly every opportunity they go out of their way to impregnate the women.
Either the actors are poor or the director is, because there are bad performances all around, and it's the director's job to make sure that these types of performances do not happen.
I got out this movie because it has Scott Bakula, a talented actor, who for some reason ends up in terrible and cheesy roles.
Why didn't someone come up this concept before you might ask, because its STUPID!!
I couldn't feel sorry for the people who ended up as worm food because they were all so icky.
The problem with this movie is not the worms per se, which apparently go on the attack because a power line is down (that happens all the time, and I have yet to see killer worms) it is the thoroughly unlikeable characters.
It's dark alright but not it's only dark because the lighting is horrendous.
Candyman 2 is a very unworthy sequel to Candyman 1.The beginning scene where the fat guy gets slaughtered in the bathroom is basically the only good part of the movie because the way to destroy Candyman was very cheesy and stupid,and the end was crap.SPOILERS,they killed Candyman by breaking a mirror,that was bad.Most of the movie wasnt interesting like it can be lead to believe,and the whole thing where Candyman can only be destroyed by breaking a glass was very half assed.Seriously,the only thing that this movie can deliver is mediocre acting,and a straight gore fest from beginning to end.I tried to like this movie,I tried,but it just want good enough to surpass the first one.Its not scary or anything.A very bad,and very cheesy movie.4 out of 10.
Third, there are numerous red herring "boo" scenes, even Condon admits this, which greatly limit the fear factor after a while; because, we're just waiting for the next false alarm to "scare" us.
Many die-hard horror fans (myself included) absolutely worship the original "Candyman" because it's so genuinely scary and intelligently adapted from a Clive Barker story.
There seems to be a belief that "The Best Man" is not a movie for me because I'm white.
If you were skeptical about seeing "The Best Man" because you're not black, ignore those fillings and go see the movie.
Don't miss it because you don't think it's meant for you.
After repeated viewings, I still can't remember whodunit, not because it is so cleverly hidden from the viewer, but because the solution makes no sense at all.
However, despite all the shortcomings, this is interesting because it's one of the very few times you get to hear Miss Brooks speak on film.
However, this isn't a great film if you want to hear her talk because the film quality is very, very poor---which is the case with so many early nitrate films.
This film is included with DIARY OF A LOST GIRL and the producers of the Kino video admit that the film quality is a mess but include it because of its significance.
The story is about a fellow who ends up in the wrong place, directed by someone (fatty Arbuckle) who was in the wrong place because he previously was in the wrong place.
For those people who believe that I can't comment on this because I haven't seen it or that it is actually a good movie, or that I've been brainwashed by action movies, think about the author who originally wrote the story.
I suppose they ran out of money because it looks like it began as a fairly well-budgeted movie but perhaps the budget got cut.
President Grant orders Barbicane to abandon the project because it is considered an act of war by other nations.
Probably because both are set in the 19th century and both feature a female stowaway (played by Martha Hyer in the later film).
I only watched it because Terry Stone is in it and I thought Rise of the Footsoldier was excellent.
In the end, I gave it one star, because awful REALLY IS the best description for it... and that's why you should watch it.
Most of the reason for this is because it is, in fact, a video and not a film.
This is an important distinguishing feature, because the use of a video camera here has made the piece look amateurish despite some decent camera work and far above average editing.
I watched this movie because of the fond memory I had kept of it when I watched it when I was 12 and that peplum movies were my favorite genre.
Why they chose to combine the story of Jason and the Argonauts seeking the golden fleece (a Greek tale) AND Hercules (Roman) dealing with an annoying king and his really annoying son is beyond me--especially because both characters could easily have several films of just their own adventures.
Even when he puts his foot down, like a mischievous child she circumvents and tricks him, which inevitably turns out badly because the thing he was standing for indeed held disastrous consequences.
This movie is vile, which is a real pity, because it could have been really interesting.
boredom, repetitions, predictability, ..) I think it is a total failure because it is a political agitprop piece and not an actual movie.
Those in the Mainstream have surrendered Principle for a living death (because anything outside La Vie Boheme (tm) isn't living at all).
There's no reason to change an artistically unproductive life, especially to something in the Mainstream, because if you're living La Vie Boheme, life is Art; artistic contributions are irrelevant.
Tom Collins was sensitive because he got beat up, smiled a lot at Angel, and is also brilliantly quirky because he stole from an ATM he re-wired, theft being so much more fulfilling than any larger sums derived from engineering jobs in the Mainstream.
Joanne was a control freak - we know she was, because Maureen sang so.
Somehow, despite Mainstream mannerisms and a Mainstream job, she was Bohemian, because the others wanted her to be.
The only one I could stomach was Joanne, probably because really, she was largely an outsider and she had an actual gasp job!!!!
I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because I didn't want to be mean to the rest of people in the theater.
It assumes that because the script has introduced us to them that they are friends.
I blame the writing of the script because the actors did a decent job with what they were given to work with.
But I have to admit...I went back to see it two more times (so far) because of Terrence Dashon Howard.
Far too noisy,far too long,far from subtle.And it had Lance Percival in it.I don't really need to go on but I shall because "Too late the hero" or 'ero as our professional cockney might have it, is one of the worst kind of movies.The kind that pretend to be one thing but turn out to be quite another.Here we have a bash - crash no prisoners war movie full of squaddies with gritted teeth firing machine guns at other squaddies with gritted teeth accompanied by belicose music ,dramatic sunlight through the trees and much crunching of the undergrowth.One by one the good guys are killed off until only the professional cockney and the smug yank are left and then there's a rousing climax as they race across a huge expanse of open ground the Brits have inexplicably left unmined outside their camp until one of them gets his and the other collapses at the feet of his lantern - jawed C.O.
This movie is nothing but sheer disappointment nd nothing can change that(yes,even a remake).The blood wounds are cheesy for a movie that was made in 1969.I don't know what the deal was on making this movie,it was probably seen as spectacular for its time.I was going to give it a 5 at the start but the boring parts made me give it a 4 instead.Mostly if you see a war movie you are expecting to see a lot of action but this is a war movie that should be avoided because there is barely any action in this movie.War movie fans will be disappointed with this heap of junk.
I watched this because of the same reason I watched the first three, they were on basically...
First I thought it was offensive (more because of the acting than the way the disabled were treated).
Really not worth my time writing this, typically I'm the type that keeps negative opinions on films to myself because I still consider movies an artful expression.
Although this was an early film, it is completely boring because of the proselytizing done by the supposed "communist state", which was in reality only an elitist central committee protected by the elements of the army and a secret police, much like America today.
Some interesting shots but over all, very boring and empty of any substance which keeps the viewer interested......For the agricultural student, its dated because the machinery used is now obsolete, some nice seeds/crops in the film though and shots of animal husbandry are included, especially a titillating scene where a peasant babushka milks a cow.
This is by FAR the worst movie I ever saw in my entire life.I saw many bad movies and terrible movies but this is just something unbelievable.I use to watch movies without any pre-judgements and I give a chance to each movie I watch.In this case it was hard because I've read all this comments here but nevermind.So I watched it.Dear God.I did.
I am really sad that someone gave to this movie 10 because I think this is king of bad movies and it should be at 1st place in top 100 bottom.
Actually it can, because suddenly a myriad of the aforementioned dwarfs - sorry, I meant goblins - appear.
I highly recommend watching it after an obsessed friend of mine (who actually owns a t-shirt with a picture of one of the movie's goblins he calls googly eyes, because it has weird eyes) made me watch it drunk.
I'll just tell you this, because I think it truly summarizes how equally terrible and hilarious this movie is: There is actually a scene where you can see one of the tech crew, or someone else who's not supposed to be there running off the scene in the background (I rewound and watched it this part three times with friends because it was too unbelievable for words).
The old man has the ability to appear to the boy to provide convenient warnings regarding the trolls just because he hates them that much.
The R rating the nudity would have provided would have actually been a public service because it would have kept impressionable children from watching this mess.
He eats it, because apparently the Gobbys are vegatarians and just can't stand meat?
The acting is so bad you'll want to jump into the movie and take over because you know you're Oscar worthy compared to them.
Joshua pees on slimy food because his family is blind and about to eat it.
Although far from being good, the Dad here delivers the best performance, but maybe that's because he reminded me of Craig T. Nelson, who can actually act.
I have to conclude that there's a satirical undercurrent to this film because it's just that random.
The movie progresses at an equally bad rate: A family comes to a town called Nilbog, and not a single one of them notices that Nilbog spelled backwards is Goblin, which makes no sense, because the title of the movie is, I believe, TROLL 2, not Goblin 2.
1 star because I am in a good mood.
Unfortunately, it is funny without meaning to be, simply because it is that bad.
Not even for insomniacs because I'm afraid they'll never wake up.
In spite of Friedkin as director, in spite of great special FX and in spite (or maybe because of) Chevy Chase as the star, "Deal of the Century" is more of a swindle.
Part of my disliking this movie so much may be because I just haven't enjoyed any of the Chevy Chase movies I've seen, whereas many of my extended family members think he is brilliant.
I watched this movie because it was on late night and it was free.
It is not particularly well done, however, it is very interesting to residents of the Treasure Coast because of its historical significance.
I'm amazed that it did not hit the 100 worst movies list, I can only assume that it's not there because not enough people have seen it and endured its awfulness.
I can boldly state that because I had actually seen it in the movie theaters when it came out, and on MST.
Apparently this mysterious visitor made people sick(literally), because he had some kind of weird fungus growing on him..Or something.
Well, you have to assume that, because you can only hear her scream, sort of, but it is not shown.
If you're watching because your class is reading the story... well then tell your teacher that the class should read a more interesting Henry James story.
This is one of those movies you can watch over and over because it plays like a TV movie of the week, but I always feel a little used afterward, this was really just a rip off and a money maker on the Beatles name.
I'm glad they left some production money in the Valley because they sure didn't leave any laughs.
Feels she is not taking seriously because she is a pretty female.
With so many new comers in this, it is kind of cool to be in the story because it seems more real to me.
My five year old did not enjoy this movie because Pooh and friends spend most of the movie scared and in perceived peril.
The reason I gave this movie it's single star (aside from the fact that there is no option to put 0 stars) is because it has certain educational purpose.
There is not single aspect I can start you off with, it's bad globally: every line is a clichÃ© stolen from Buffy, Blade, or some other B vampire movie (and the ending is a word-for-word rip off from the first Blade -- I can't spoil the movie with this, it hits the bottom on the first line); the image is terrible, either they used magnifying glass for a lens or rented a wrong camcorder, because this is not shot on film with an HDCAM, not even on HDV or DVX from the looks of it; the cinematography is ...well, I don't think they thought about lighting; the set pieces and the makeup is admirably expensive for such a low budget, but the actors wearing the suits couldn't act their way out of a noose on the day of their sentence.
I guess you have to be french to understand that, because it's just a matter of culture...
Such films as CHILD BRIDE, MAD YOUTH, REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS were all schlocky trash that skirted past the boards because they were supposedly educational.
Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education!
If not, then the local drug-dealing skank (her cousin) will inherit it because no one knows that this blonde floozy is evil.
So let's talk about the bad--because after all, that's why people today would approach this film--wanting to see and laugh at the bad.
Such as when the doctor is called because the Dumb Girl's sister is "in a bad way" after using pot.
When her mother asks the doctor how the girl is, he declares "she's a hopeless psychopath"--all because of the evils of marijuana!!
The irony here is that truly terrible dope-soaps like REEFER MADNESS and MARIHUANA are much more entertaining, because they don't waste time with dramatic niceties.
I don't want to spoil it, but it would be difficult even if I could because the last 15 minutes (even compared to the rest of the film) made absolutely no sense to me at all.
This is a movie to watch with friends, but only because it's more fun to laugh at this atrocious piece of budget movie in company.
I'll give it 2 out of 10, and that's exclusively for the graphics, because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating.
I finally had to watch it on fast forward, because NOTHING HAPPENS time and time and time again for minutes at a stretch.
I don't envy a director/scriptwriter who takes Proust on, because so much of the richness of his characters and stories is interior.
Worse, she is barely a witch, because there is no training, no finding of a new skill, barely any discussion of other witches, nada.
The only reason I did not give this movie a 1 is because the drawings are lovely.
Or, perhaps people who hate Godfrey Cambridge would want to see it because this film couldn't help but sink his career.
Let's say she killed him because she could no longer stand the abuse and wanted to protect her children, that might be believable, but no she did it for the money.
And because her husband was "killed" in the line of duty, she got double the money.
I kind of wish they had made a spin off with his character because he was really interesting.
I would have liked to have seen the relationship he had with his father because from the way him and Harper talked it seemed his father was always on him about choosing a career and the last thing he needed was for Harper to be doing that to him.
I rated it 1/10 because I couldn't rate it lesser.
Filming it in black-and-white was appropriate, because it comes off as a low-class, dingy story.
I probably won't watch this film again very soon, because it's not my idea of entertainment.
I just saw the movie and it made no sense to me because so much was missing, the whole thing was so hard to believe.
I have a friend who worked in a factory and was pawed, bullied and had her work deliberately disrupted by a minority of her male co-workers very much like the women in this film so to see this behaviour shown as acceptable and funny is pretty depressing and to see others call it harmless because there's no swearing is doubly depressing.
Not because of the constant woman chasing - lots of shows have that - but because of the demonising of work women and the pantomime level humor.
I don't mind programmes like Till Death Us Do Part in which a character is bigoted but their attitudes are shown as wrong and I also don't like extreme political correctness partly because when there are cases like this and people comment on it others defend the sexism by complaining about "PC madness".
Those who say that On the Buses wasn't bad because it was popular should remember that Baywatch was once the most popular programme in the world - though even Baywatch wasn't as embarrassingly awful as this.
But of course I'm just spouting a load of feminist rubbish because we all know women were treated much better when their were no laws protecting them from sexual harassment, no refuges for battered wives and a woman could be ostracised for leaving her husband even if he hit her which is what happened to my great aunt.
I'm not sure what Stewart is trying to communicate at that moment because crossing one's arms is traditionally a defensive posture.
Believe it or not, I do hate to be so negative because I respect Patrick Stewart and have enjoyed past performances (my mom absolutely loves him).
Actually, I sense this is the director's fault, because he has relied so heavily on special effects to carry the story.
I think it is because the direction is completely lacking instinct for the mood of the piece.
Compare to the rich, exquisitely-lit cinematography of the George C. Scott version and you will see that just because this was made for TV didn't mean it had to look it.
I rate this film with a two only because of my reverence for the story.
or because the writer apparently thought he could do better (A large amount of Dicken's dialogue has been slashed and warped in this version)...he couldn't.
Conservative females probably will not like this movie that much because of the strong sexual content.
Also Alison Pill did well as lola's best friend, Ella.I really like the character Ella, because she was a goody-tow-shoes who thought she was going to grow up and be like her parents, but she goes past that and faces her fears with Lola.
I got so mad at her when she was telling everyone that Lola didn't go to the party and everyone believed her, because I know how Lola must have felt.
Maybe it was because I didn't see My Fair Lady.
I found myself wondering what on earth this whole story was all about and i never got to the end because it was making me severely depressed and i couldn't stand another twenty minutes of this rubbish - it would have made me suicidal!
Somebody give the screenwriter who came up with this concept a few million, because that's absolutely brilliant.
I generally don't believe in the concept of guilty pleasure because i don't think pleasure should ever be the source of guilt (at least in the realm of film).
two out of ten, only because i cannot deny......  and god wept....
In the end, Mary gets everything she wants because she is the so-called "protagonist" of the movie.
Lohan plays this part amazingly well, mostly because Lohan is a drama-driven slut in real life.
This is a very bad movie to show your daughters because it gives them horrible impressions about appropriate behavior for girls and it teaches them completely horrendous values about life and getting what you want.
The only reason why someone should watch this is because of Lindsay Lohan.
At her new school she becomes friends with Ella (Alison Pill), mainly because they both like the same rock band, Sid Arthur.
Lola is a nice person but lies too much because she wants to be liked.
An ex Czech priest who was thrown out of the Church because his methods were to 'severe'.
And of course they couldn't just call the white house and tell them of the plan because they don't know how deep it goes.
XXX the sequel is not really like the first film because XXX played by Ice Cube is not a daredevil and doesn't do all those x-game type of stunts with snowboards or motorcycles.
Hint to all young producers and directors: just because someone is named ice something does not mean he can carry a movie alone or even act.
The movie can also be looked on as promoting an unhealthy stereotype of the goofy white guy that knows nothing because the token comic relief in the movie is a white guy that's always out of whack.
Wilem Dafoe needs to fire his agent super fast because the man has played way too many bad guys.
The action and stunts aren't even imaginative,.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?'
For me it was kind of hard to get a grip from the beginning because there was nothing that would have explained who were the main characters and what was their goal and so on.
The cast isn't much good either, although it's fun to see Peter Strauss as the President (in spite or because of his not sounding like he believes a word of this); Xzibit not only helps parts of this seem like "Pimp My Ride: The Movie" but he can't act, Dafoe is Special Guest Villain level, and Jackson phones it in.
I have clear ideas how to fix it up, but my ideas don't matter because I don't get to re-film it.
There's a major difference with Moll's previous opus: "Lemming" doesn't match "With a Friend Like Harry"'s brilliance at all because it's too woolly, incoherent to hold water whereas the former work was absolutely clear in its script and didn't present the single mistake in its logical way of thinking.
After being unable to gain employment because of his criminal record, a young man fortune suddenly changes.
James Marshall stars as an ex-crook trying to go straight however this is hard because his criminal record keeps haunting him and ruins his chance for any decent employment, however when he gets his hands on a counterfeit plate, three sets of mobsters come gunning for him.
I rented this film tonight because there has always been so much hype surrounding it.
And because of that, you just couldn't invest yourself into any characters.
I rented this movie because Jackie Chan produced it, and I figured I was in for a real action movie, Jackie Chan style.
I use quotations because I don't believe either to be true.
Somehow, through writing, she becomes Christian again because she could hear God in the wind and chalkboard.
He doesn't even do his own fight scenes anymore, because anytime a fight occurred, the cameraman curiously ensured we never got to see Segals face during the fights.
The only reason I even bothered to watch this 'movie' was because it had Steven Seagal in it....
It is very sad for me ,because I practice martial arts and I admire Seagal's Aikido abilities .
As for me, the reason I enjoyed this film so much because it was - by definition - awfully good.
In summary, 2 out of 10 (it saves itself from a rating of '1' because I thought that part of the looooooooooooooooooong final fight between Zorro and the bad guy Stanley Baker was slightly entertaining.
To me, a guilty pleasure is some awful movie you sit through just because one of the performers is hot.
This rates as high as it does for me because of the cinematography.
You can see why "Golden Age" came out in October because it's not going to compete for Oscars in categories that anybody cares about.
My best guess is, he's related to the director or casting director, because how else could such an unappealing and untalented actor be cast in this part?
This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who directed (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick.
During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.
In one instance a family is given the meat from the butt of a seal by the tribe because the hunter was unsuccessful that day.
It's mostly because of the writing, but it is also because of the casting.
I know it was more than just voodoo because I had tried to loose weight for 20 years before then and nothing had ever worked.
The most troubling part of it is that some person is actually going to go into this show with an open, unbiased mind think that this show is objective and journalistic, and because they have to fun-loving, non-confrontational goofs starring the show, they won't take this show for what it is, just a piece of propaganda.
The best one is when Derrida rambles about how he'd love to know more about philosopers' personal lives because its so strange that they never speak about them.
Funny, because this film doesn't really say much at all about Derrida's personal life and Derrida himself admits several times he has a hard time talking about it at all.
The mass persecution of Christians still goes on, and many are continuing to lose their lives and their freedom, simply because they are Christians.
I'm giving this 4 out of 10 because while agree with the other posters that the film lacked any sort of clarity or even a reason for being, there were a few moments in there that were sort of interesting.
Upon arriving at the theater I was very excited because the two Directors, Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman were to be hosting tonight's viewing at the Nuart Theater in West Los Angeles.
Making a documentary about a philosopher is a particularly difficult proposition; with most other subjects, we welcome and enjoy varying interpretations, but, with philosophy, we tend to resist variance, because the very aim of philosophy, at least until Post-Structuralists came along, has always been to arrive at the Truth.
You may argue here that I have just made a logocentric statement by defining what deconstruction is, that I have just centered the definition of deconstruction (note the appearance here of stepping back); you are right (and I'm leaving it at that, because I'm only a hack philosopher.).
There are some golden moments but they are few and far between and could easily have been summarized in a 15 minute documentary rather than a full feature that seems only to try to prove, by "deconstructing" the documentary process that it is virtually impossible to do a documentary because the subject is aware of the camera and then doesn't act completely naturally.
2 women start fighting dressed, in the next shot they are naked (because a lesbian scene in-between has been omitted).
Rating: 0 out of 4 stars, pushed up to 0.5 because Linda Blair with a machine gun is sexy.
I saw this film years ago - so am a bit rusty - but since I'm reading their book at the moment I feel compelled to write: The thing that I remember most about it is this: The main characters are two despicable types so you don't care for them - I found my self not caring what happened because there was nothing about the characters to like or admire or empathise with.
Just be sure to avoid "Keoma", because it offers nothing new, is not entertaining, and clearly is the end of the "spaghetti western" line.
I totally agree with the message of this movie, because it gives hope to Christians who feel pressured by society, and it also shows Christians in America, that they should be thankful for the religious freedoms our government allows.
The reason that the crew members' names are incorrect is because a Hollywood lawyer advised that they not use their real names in order to avoid being sued.
1 Niro~Star (out of 10, only because there's no ZERO, apart from the director)...  
Well, because you have your hair cut like a boy, you silly thing!
Rage At Dawn does have a sense of seen it all before about it, but that's not in detriment to it because it's possibly a picture that has been copied more than it has copied from itself!.
Basically a professor and his assistant are kidnapped and it's up to john (kirk ripoff) (god i hated that guy) and his crew to save them because apparently the aliens kidnapped at just the wrong time when if the professor's gone, the city will explode.
And all because fans wanted to know who Christy was going to marry.
In writing this, I fear that I have completely repeated other posters, but I feel my comments are necessary, because I want to more fully represent the people who were disappointed in these movies.
Although Mike is definitely a primary suspect both Kate and Detective Sergeant Turner, who is officially in charge of the case, think Dr.Steiner, a lesbian teacher of not only Anna but also Kate, may know something important because she was the last person who met pre-attacked Anna.
This is partially because the whole story is so horizontal that there is no space for audience to enjoy his or her own detectiveness, and partially because the character of Sally, who helps Kate to investigate, is a meaninglessly non-stop talker and badly adds not well-organised half-comical quality to the latter half of the film.
I've given this mess two stars only because of Sue Lynn Sanchez, who is gorgeous and puts in a spirited performance despite her horrible lines.
(Funny, because the Indians, the Sioux, and Northern Cheyenne, thought that the land was theirs, and that we were the intruders.)
She just isn't that credible as a dowdy, naÃ¯ve post-graduate perhaps because she has already been seen in past films as a savvy and often world-weary bombshell.
It's too bad because the book was big and had lots of fans but this movie did not live up to the book and should have been made by someone else.
Such a pity, because the book is brilliant, and part of what makes it so good is Nanny's apt social commentary, not her shock of being thrown into the deep end of nice, normal, Jersey girl vs rich, stupid, Manhatanities.
I found myself searching for other things to do during the movie because it just didn't grip you into the story.
The sharpest detail of the novel is when Nan leaves the summer cottage, and Mrs. X has only paid her $50 for a whole week of 24/7 work -- because, after all, wasn't it a "free beach vacation"?
What made the book good isn't present here and it's a shame because it is a really fun book to read and this is a really boring movie to watch.
Also, it showed how Joseph didn't leave his wife because of her divine revelation of carrying the Messiah.
He moves to his sisters (and nephews) house, away from his trailer home in the mountains, because he has murdered 5 hikers already (as a werewolf), and believes that only family love can save him from his destiny.
*Bad Moon SPOILERS*   Ted (Michael ParÃ¨) is going to be our lycanthrope for today, a young man who has this 'curse' upon him, and tries to do as less trouble as he can, but his nephew (Mason Gamble)'s dog has other ideas, and begins to attack poor Ted, and Ted's sister (Mariel Hemingway) doesn't understand a thing, because she's as dumb as a rock...  Am I going to believe that a mere dog can kill a werewolf?
Only because he's been out of work for so long, he's probably desperate.
I will admit that I watched the movie all the way through, partly because I was bored and the other part was because I like Devon Sawa and wanted to give the film a chance.
This so called romantic comedy sounded somewhat promising because of its twist.
But to suggest that he was persecuted because he was black is not only unfounded (it is not in the Bible), but it is ludicrous.
He was persecuted because He was the Son of God: God in the flesh; and to suggest that the motivation was anything else, including His race, is to undermine and dilute the entire message of the Gospel.
The only aspect of His ethnicity that is pertinent is the fact that He was Jewish: because, according to prophecy the Messiah was be of Israel and to be king David's heir.
"Quite possibly" because I haven't seen all his early work yet.
Apparently some woman got divorced because she got her portrait painted by some artist who disappeared after shooting her husband....or something.
She's miserable with her new husband, on her new estate because the mother-in-law doesn't like her or something.
2 stars because I know there's something worse out there.
Maybe because the scripts were better???
I know the film has been maligned for anti-semitic content (perhaps because Jews make mistakes in the film and are seen as persecutors instead of victims?
The narrator mentions that we spent two billion dollars on the Skylab project, apparently because it was a neat idea.
The first time I saw it, it threw me for a loop, because it violated so many of the conventions of intelligible moviemaking that I almost felt shell-shocked.
The script formula is always the same, the characters might as well be the same in each episode, because the story doesn't fluctuate.
And the guy works for free, no matter who hires him, because he never gets paid or if people do offer to pay him, he doesn't accept the money for whatever reason and gives it back.
The only good episodes where when Don Knotts came on - because he naturally is great.
Jean-Claude La Marre writes, directs and stars in a version of the last days of Jesus that posits that Jesus was killed in large part because he was dark skinned.
The notion is of course more than likely going to anger many audiences simply because Jesus is black, which is a shame since the poorly made film is bad enough on its own to deserve brickbats being tossed at it.
I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it.
The movie alters the reason for Jesus' death by crucifixion, not unlike a joke I have heard about Jesus ("he must have been black because he was lynched by a mob of white Romans"!).
I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 rating, and that was because I could not give JC a rating of 1 (even if the movie sucked).
I was hoping to be scared, because (as usual), the previews made it look good.
And to all people who think that Christians are just making propaganda, you should just watch TV once and see how much crap Christians have to watch because of you.
because the latter had implied that Peter was the traitor.
If any research was actually done for this story, it was certainly only on the religious angle because Bill Pullman's astrophysicist is not only a shallow character, but a horribly generic Hollywood depiction of what science is.
While this is true, they already know it's impossible because the baby is male...a woman has no Y chromosome.
Since Charlotte's attire wasn't conservative and she was seen dancing with Jim and because she didn't physically struggle with Jim when he raped her, it is not surprising that no one believes her when she claims that his advances were unwanted especially since, by this point, Jim has already bragged to his entire fraternity about his encounter with Charlotte.
The Invaders by Quinn Martin with Roy Thinnes was successful because, in my opinion, we never saw the true form of the alien beings from a dying world.....
Paranoia was rife because one could not be certain that anyone from the paper boy on his bike to a high ranking politician on telly was human.
With things like Mary being turned away from the Inn because she was black, and lines by the centurion "you're not black enough" its not hard not to see how poorly this was put together.
They invariably suck because of poor writing coupled with bad casting.
SS Experiment Camp was banned in th UK from 1976-2005 because it was thought to controversial.
it was eventually passed uncut in 2006 because there was not anything in the film that was thought unsuitable.
This film was, like The Driller Killer, banned in the UK because of the cover art; and that's hardly surprising, as aside from the aforementioned transplant and a few sex scenes; there really isn't anything here to warrant banning, or seeking the film out for.
Or at least more inventively, the survivors of the first film had flogged the story of the first film and then admit to the new members of the cast that 'it actually happened and to us and that's why were in trouble because we decided to shortcut through the same bit of desert and got stuck'.
I recently acquired this via the full-frame Image DVD in anticipation of the HTF Halloween challenge; I knew the film was nowhere near as well regarded as the 1977 original Â but I wasn't aware that Craven only made it because he was hard-up for cash, that he later disowned the result and that the picture was even shelved for two years (by which time he had re-acquired his stature with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET [1984] which itself developed into a franchise and, ironically, the director would also return to much later after another lean period in his career)!
That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick.
I only watched this because my friend attempted to rent part 1 but accidently picked up the sequel instead.
Presumable because most of them are about money, pure and simple, rather than an interest in saying or doing anything new with established characters.
The original 'Hills Have Eyes' was a genuine classic, was frightening because of its realism.
The first film was a piece of excrement, with flies on it and all, and the sequel should not even be described using words because no language has words bad enough to describe it.
I can't recommend it because it's at the bottom of the worst.
I just watched The Hills Have Eyes2 1985 and the soundtrack sounds like Friday the 13!Someone tell me if they think so too.I was just sitting around and thought I'd watch part 2 of this little miniseries and I'm a big trivia buff.I told my husband and son this should be good like the first one right?Wrong think again.This was so corny and i kept getting the feeling the music in it sounded so familiar that i gave some thought to it.i don't wanna give any major parts away but like save your time effort and money because it is definitely not worth it.I love most 80's movies and music mainly because I was a teenager to all that corny,quircky but amazing stuff.
They didn't explain some of the deaths, they never explained what happened to the rest of the family from the first film, we only see the brother, and he has a pointless role because you don't see him for the rest of the film.
That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick.
This one's a 2* presentation; the second "*" because it does have some mild "fascination."
It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension.
This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely.
Only a few letters out, but it should've been BOREDOM, because that suits it down to the ground.
It did start off with a nice dark tone, but never went anywhere and budget restrictions can hardly be blamed because there's no problem with the look of the film, it's simply the screenplay that's lacking.
maybe he should try the lonely hearts ads in the local paper, & this time it might not be a bad idea to not actually kidnap & mutilate said woman, you know because that sort of thing generally doesn't help fledgling relationships does it?
Let's get something straight, I don't think it's "awful" because it's violent.
I think it's awful because it was made by a bunch of hacks.
That's because the acting in this movie was an abomination.
They say they don't like American horror films because we have to explain everything and we have to exact revenge on the antagonist.
I've voted just a single point in its favour (only because zero is not an allowed option).
Since just the scene before she was waiting for a male friend, the bartender and bouncer in the club, to walk her to her car because Yule was there and eying her.
"A Kiss so Deadly" is only worth your time watching it because it's just too bad to be true and at the same time too good for bad-movie fans, in a cheesy and unintentionally funny sort of way, to be bad.
I only watched Lion King II because I taped it from TV.
And I'm hoping it's just me, I found Kiara very annoying, probably because of her sometimes-nasal voice (that always gives me a fake-cry impression).
I want to believe that this is different movie, which has nothing to do with the first.In my opinion the film was probably made because of money, nothing else.The kids like it perhaps, because they often like all kind of cartoons, either it is rubbish or not.
I loathed "Fear.Com" because it wasted an opportunity, I own "House on Haunted Hill" because of ... the house, not the tale.
I don't mean to pound Malone because I genuinely believe something is stirring there and maybe his "Parasomnia" will let it loose.
After riding the clichÃ©d story to the revelation of the FHC, I said aloud "Oh, &*^%" because it was just a tremendous letdown.
Nadja starts in New York one night as a Vampire named Nadja (Elina Lowensohn) talks to a man (Nic Ratner) in a bar & explains that she & her slave Renfield (Karl Geary) have travelled to New York from her homeland of Transylvania because her Father Count Dracula (Peter Fonda) is dead & that it is hard to find good food in New York after 10 O'Clock.
Van Helsing & Jim become aware that Lucy is under the control of Nadja & in another bizarre coincidence Van Helsing's Sister Cassandra (Suzy Amis) is looking after Nadja's ill Brother Edgar (Jared Harris) who Nadja intends to visit, both Van Helsing's & Jim's desperation to kill Nadja becomes even greater as the people they care for the most are in danger because of Nadja's blood drinking activities...
So the story & character's are crap can the film deliver in other areas, well no because Nadja is one of the worst looking films I've sat through.
I became interested in watching the film because David Lynch had produced it.
He is fun to watch because he is clearly enjoying himself.
So, why did I watch it, someone can ask: because my kids (11 and 13yo) asked us to watch any movie in the TV with them.
Did he start out with a ton of gory scenes, but then cut them out because he was aiming for a PG?
The only reason why this film went to theaters instead of video is because of the cast.
It's a shame, too, because "Firewall" also features the talents of veterans such as Robert Forster ("Jackie Brown"), Alan Arkin ("Slums of Beverly Hills") and Robert Patrick ("Terminator 2: Judgment Day").
It is now time for the makers of "Scary Movie" to make "Harrison Ford Movie" in which for two thrilling hours Ford can't find his family because they're standing directly behind him.
Some may find "Firewall" a difficult film to dislike because it plays all the clichÃ©s.
The loyalist characters like Uncle Andy, Big Mervyn and Red Hand Luke make me laugh till my sides are sore, simply because there is extra thought incorporated into all their characterizations.
This is because they rarely need to name check politicians or continuously remind us that they are loyalists.
They constantly sell the nationalist/republican side and although I am catholic and from Ireland I find it really annoying because it is nothing we haven't heard or spoofed before.
I first picked up this movie purely because of the cover.
The story is totally uninteresting which is unfortunate because the women are attractive and non-plastic.
There is an alien subplot but no one should care much about it because even the characters treat it listlessly.
That's because the character of "the Little Tramp" was far from perfected and the films really had no script--just the barest of story ideas.
Not because every moment was great; any given program had its ups and downs.
On the other hand, it was quite funny because of it.
It's a shame because i really enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat film.
OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use "We needed to make money" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.
Ah well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like "I have to see MK annihilation" because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something "good".
I shan't start off by saying "I used to be an MK fan", because whenever I read those I want to fetch my violin and start playing.
It is all too, "it is so because it is so"  The special effects truly are tragic.
You will hate this.For the rest of us this is a hilarious bad film that everyone should have a good laugh at.This film has so little to offer in terms of film but it could show a lot of bad expensive films how to reach a level of drivel that you just have to watch it.This film could never be accused of being an average film because it stands out so much.Exceptionally Bad is all I can say.  
MK1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3, a trio, a team, and their "teacher" Raiden.
If you really feel the need to see this movie and be surprised, then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead.
My guess for this is because he wasn't in the 3rd game.
I hope that this has been an accurate rendering of what my feelings are for this film, because I actually haven't seen it in several years.
I liked the minimalistic directorial job and some scenes (particularly the end) were rather interesting, but all in all it's hard to believe this film is from the same director of "Bullit" because it lacks of nerve.
This made the fact that the episode was such a lackluster product even harder to bear because Claire was my favorite character in the show.
I, for one, am a political conservative and straight, but this series captured my heart -- not because of its politics but because of its strong characters and rich narrative.
Oh man, I have to give credit where it's due, because when this scene unfolded before my eyes, it was the equivalent of cinemtic masturbatory bliss!
Bad like finding out that everyone you have ever loved was murdered by your dog because you gave it rabies.
Basically, you find out that these girls will steal money, but not motorcycles, because they walk to a hotel.
The biker gang gives chase, because the dirt bike the girls have stolen from them has a whopping six thousand dollars in stolen money hidden in a pouch (where the money came from isn't explained, or maybe it just wasn't interesting enough to remember?)
The kind of film that you spend 30% of your life watching, because you can't help yourself... especially when you have nothing to do late at night except to channel surf and watch B movies...  Good premise of a film, got me interested, forgave the cheesy acting, didn't mind the simple FX, but the script was real bad.
Later, the brilliant Chinese sends a division of soldiers to invade a foreign country because that country wasn't "big enough" to have a say about who comes into their country!
Nor one of those shows about how the evil alien which is about to kill everyone in the world and suddenly learns to love us because some w****r scientist kisses some gal in the heat of the moment, and leaves despite the fact that it's been shot full of holes by missles and been exposed to nothing but a constant stream of violence from the majority of the "dominant" human population (remember, we are great, while dinosaurs sucked!).
Asks Keith early on in the film.. although he is called in to analyze the thing, almost everything he suggests is summarily ignored, laughed at, or cast aside because, well, I suppose your average 12 year old viewer finds constant machine gun fire much more compelling viewing than a lot of talking or philosophical speculation.
This is *exactly* the kind of film for people who hated 2001 because they didn't get it.
I saw it just because i was ill, and it made me sickier...
must be because I laughed a lot.
Don't take reviews that say any of that too seriously, because those are all things the movie was going for.
You can't laugh at it for being so bad it's good, because it's a little too slick to be that bad.
Danielle Mason is cute, but you just didn't want to hear her talk, because you just knew she was going to say something stereotypically hippie-ish.
It's terrible really because the girls are great and it looks good most of the time with plenty of sexy kills.
There's an interesting movie to be made about a woman who chooses to work in the adult film industry, not because she's emotionally damaged, but because she likes the money and community she finds there.
Vote 1 just because there is no zero, slasher fans stay away from this junk, i warned you, or you will waste 90 minus of your life, and you won't miss anything here.
Oh this movie had so much potential and I still recommend it as the soundtrack rocks and Robbin and Tim are both beautiful and so lovely to watch, but....this is an example, to me, of a good movie just made too fast or something, I was bummed because it just has such great potential, there were just way way way too many inconsistencies and unbelievable situations... i.e.
In another film disaster in this series, Murder at the Vicarage, Miss Marple has all the sympathy in the world for an adulterous woman who murdered her husband because she craved a more interesting sex life.
It stinks, not only because the characters are not what Christie intended them to be, but because the ugly morality of movie makers is substituted for the morality of Agatha Christie.
The actors didn't even seem convincing, so either this is because they are just that bad OR the director doesn't know how to help anything.
I only watched this movie because I was bored and I have a more than passing fascination with archaeology.
I bought this film (for $2.00) at a local market, purely because I heard somewhere that it was a quasi-sequel to "MANIAC" (One of the greatest horror films of all-time).
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, DO NOT READ FURTHER, THERE BE SPOILERS HERE:  I'm going to go out on a limb here by going against the grain of the previous reviews, because honestly I don't think 'Ultimate Avengers 2' is particularly good.
If anything, Giant Man's death feels forced in the most laughable manner, partly because he really didn't even take enough abuse during the fight to warrant dying.
It's too bad, because the potential for a better animated film was definitely there, but it just wasn't utilized.
Well, I'm sorry to say, this film cannot be defended on any level, and this comes from someone who will pretty much go to the mat to defend Blake Edwards, because I think he's a great director.
It's also very dated but it's not awful because of it.
Actually I didn't expect anything delightful from the beginning, and forced myself to watch it solely because of Christopher Plummer whom I adore.
Maybe is it because on the set everybody was embarrassed and ashamed of what he/she was doing there?
I didn't check the "spoilers" box because the entire plot is revealed in the first 15 minutes.
i wish axlerod would've been the bad guy because that is an awesome name for a villain.
For example, the research couldn't be done on butterflies because they wouldn't pose a threat to any country--hello, the Dept.of Defense financed the study.
Its a shame because if this had been directed and scripted in more of a unique way, it could have brought back feelings of the old B movies about bugs etc.
Maybe the writers should have skipped the whole thing about demonizing the military, because they didn't have any better solution themselves?
The only reason that I'm giving it a four is because the Locusts actually look really good when grouped up and close-ups are real Locusts.
The dialogue was forced, the direction was slow and probably because the locusts were CGI based they didn't even begin to bring me out in even a Luke warm sweat.
I give this 4/10 and that is only because of Lucy Lawless.I will always be a Lucy Lawless fan and anything she is in deserves some sort of score.
He explains to them that the mission cannot proceed because of a faulty life support system.
He is, however, unwilling to announce the cancellation of the mission because this might jeopardise continued Congressional funding for the manned space-flight programme.
I am only moved to write this review because of the impending release of Next Friday, which must be stopped at all costs.
In several scenes he loses his train of thought and because of the low budget the scenes were not re-shot.
I picked up a copy of this because of its alleged stereoscopic content.
There is no style, it's the same type of acting, the same "just because I'm black" jokes, and the same "I'm sooo good looking" crap.
I'm picking on the Will Smith character because he is the only one that makes the show dumb.
a fat guy who can only get it up with a blow up doll, and the ending where Edwidge says that she doesn't have to worry about getting pregnant because she takes the pill, then her boyfriend says they shouldn't risk it .....  i would highly recommend this film to trashy film fans.
To be honest i didn't make it to the end, i was so bored with this, i suggest people stick to "proper" comedy/horror films such as Scream, American Pie, Road Trip, Scary Movie etc etc, give this film a miss if you can ever find it, it's rare for a reason you know............. because it's total CRAP!
This is a pity, because it was very well acted (these guys shame some of the more recognized Hollywood stars), and the character development wasn't too bad either.
I would not let anyone under 14 see this movie, because of sexual themes and some shock-value spooks.
I thought this was so bad I had to watch it in pieces because it was so cringeworthy.
I taped it and had high hopes because I very much like Marsters' work on Buffy.
This is the best of these exploitation movies from the 30's that I've seen because it's not thrown in your face but instead builds slowly.
I was a kid when I first saw it, but when it was on TV a couple years ago I realized how confusing it was because they're twins and you think both of them are equally hot, but Stew has the best hair, but Phil is better because the ranger girl wants to go out to the forest to eat worms (like the gross white maggot kinds!
I hope he donated the salary to poor people, because otherwise he shouldn't have a reason to be there!
But one can see why this technique failed in the sequel, "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey," because by then (1991) audiences had grown weary of eighties teenagers in heinous situations.
The original is the only thing worth seeing again; not sequels or rip-offs, because their time has passed.
In short, the Catholic Church has been hiding and supporting the fugitive, because they have also been guilty of anti-semitism, and they believe that he just obeyed orders when he killed 7 Jews and later repented.
The half-Jewish now agnostic judge who pursues Caine is a moderately interesting character, but the audience never can truly sympathize with her because she's rude, arrogant and impulsive most of the time - a young, annoying idealist.
The Caine character is interesting because he has touching moments (like when he leaves money and a penitant, caring, thankful note for his estranged wife) and seems genuinely emotional, open and desperate at times.
Although the movie may be trying to say something about justice and corruption, it's hard to engage, because there is no real protagonist [it's not Caine simply because he's a fugitive although the audience roots for Caine at times because the camera follows him].
The Blade series has done good business but it's because it is blockbuster, comic book stuff.
I won't go into the in's and out's of the plot because my head would start to hurt, but it involves a drug that cause the recipient to have strange visions that seem real and which allow for someone to control their mind by manipulating them in their visions, they will also die after a certain period of time.
Yeah, so that was a lame above criticism, but it doesn't matter because this movie hits the pits pretty hard.
It hurts me to say this, because I'm a hardcore Wesley Snipes fan.
I watched the first four episodes, because I wanted to like it, especially since Queer as Folk has yet to find a worthy replacement at the gay drama throne.
During these few episodes of Noah's Arc I fast-forwarded several times because I wasn't intrigued with what was happening.
Lewis made himself immortal among horror/cult cinema fanatics as "The Godfather of Gore"; a nickname he earned because he was the first one to direct horror movies where blood, guts and gore literally burst from the screen.
The gangs' last crime on the beach and particularly the denouement form the undeniable highlights of "Just for the Hell of it" because these sequences are shocking and vile, and the use of make-up effects in these scenes finally state clear that you're watching a H.G Lewis' flick!
Also the movie has a deadly dull subplot involving Wilson and a high class call girl which just consistently slows the movie down, movies like Redemption need first of all fleshed out characters and lots of screen time for the important characters to the plot, however because the movie treats the main story like an afterthought the movie fails on its own ambitions and satisfies no one in the process.
When I hear that a movie flopped at the box office, like "Sylvia Scarlett" did, I want to support it, because I naturally root for the underdog (and besides, so many crappy movies are box office hits).
He creates all the mess at the harbor just because he is carrying diamonds on his heels.
Just because she couldn't swim?
I give this a 3 because it does have its moments and you have to admire the fact that the whole movie is played straight.
The end is totally stupid (IMHO) because the state of some of the characters is unfinished.
The few things I liked are the women attraction: the younger one is very attractive, the actress and dancer are too, though it's partly because of their awkward detached personalities.
I actually watched this scene over again because I enjoyed it so much.
Perhaps the reason a film such as "Va Savoir" is so disappointing is because it is so well done.
I'm not one who goes in much for direct-to-cable to direct-to-video flicks, because there's usually a significant reason why it wasn't released in theaters--and usually a very good one.
The only reason I actually sat through this entire movie is because I happened to be an extra in it and was curious to see myself on the big screen.
He's supposed to be the second bad guy, along with the evil younger Queen that the King married(sure, seventy year old decrepit guy, she married you because she loves you!
Very disappointing movie, its watchable, but I'm giving it a 1 because in the beginning it looked like it could be a classic, but degenerated into mediocrity, so I think thats a tragedy.
Okay my opinion may be much different because I played the role John Proctor in theater-form just a few months ago.
I also had a problem with Ryder because she was convincing but I saw my four teenage friends play her much scarier, and portraying her for the crazy-messed, kooky, demented bitch she was not just someone like Ryder who showed she was mildly disturbed and only motivated to get Proctor in trouble not because she actually thought she was doing the right thing in her own world.
Are we to believe that Allen is not to be put to death for practicing witchcraft right away because she is with child and we know the church's position on abortion?
The two stupid men should have removed that nail in the wall because it would have saved them a ton of time and tape.
I was laughing at the nerd because he was so funny looking.
Director Tretta manages to evoke a certain sadistic & nasty tone throughout the film simply because of the subject matter rather than what actually ended up on screen.
Its gritty, dirty, rough and raw - and because of this you are more easily affected by the events that transpire.
I hired this film out because it sounded interesting.
I highly doubt it is a genuine snuff film because there's no way the censors would let it get released.
I've rated it one star only because there's no option for 0/10...
Those "scare tactics" were only believable because they were so crude.
I just wish she would have skipped this kind of crap because she is worth so much better.
The movie is filled with contrivances, and it's too bad because it good have been an excellent film.
Other creatures such as an alien, zombies, and Frankenstein's monster never get their full due because director Hickox can not slow the movie down enough to provide us with any kind of substance to hold a hat on.
Exactly why one of the characters had to find a doorway out of a waxwork is beyond me because it would at least have ended the movie quicker.
He is invited to work with a special investigation unit because he is a local (and a smart detective).
The name is just a lame attempt to cover up a bad movie, which worked for me, because i rented it.
More importantly it felt like the murders didn't take place at all, because the murder scenes didn't have any intensity or feelings involved.
i still can't believe when business in America count on American stupidity...they win...because it's true...how could anybody misinterpret such a concise ending...how exactly do you feed a kitten to an atm anyway...arrrrgghhhh.
I like American Psycho because of the entire environment that really is.
I admit, the only reason I even watched the video was hopefully because Christian Bale would be in some scenes, but he wasn't.
because it's Denzel?)
Let's also overlook all the scenes where they spied on the girl in the shower and changing - because they should be arrested for that considering that's pretty illegal and inappropriate.
I'm going to start rambling so bear with me- she pulls a gun on him- and he makes a joke that he didn't know that was going to happen - but he really should have, they pass it off as a joke because they can't explain that scene.
Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is how on earth Rachael would be physically able to commit these crimes because Mila Kunis doesn't look an inch taller than five foot , doesn't look an ounce heavier than ninety pounds and yet is able to commit acts of extreme violence with a sharp object .
At one or more point, each of the characters does something unnatural because Wilbur (who wrote the screenplay and directed the film) did not find a way to advance the story naturally.
I saw this only because it was Robert Altman's first film--he wrote, produced and directed it.
10/10 because I finished my popcorn before I even noticed it was running low.
Anyway, I passed this one up time after time at the "used" store, but finally broke down and got it because I was intrigued.
The result is unnerving because the torture seems to be inflicted on real men rather than movie actors.
The surgical scenes were laughable.... and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd......Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant....nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques... just a joke... couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes... no blood, no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over... it is not a film for thinking adults....Also the budget must have been limited... the street scenes were OK but who was the technical adviser....Seems like it was directed by a total idiot.. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and Don't rent it..
In the end, it wouldn't even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness, because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.
Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson, claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being "too much" of a patriot (I kid you not), and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest.
Instead he goes over to his women's home because of time constraints.
He miraculously stops bleeding because he washed his wound.
This is such a dopey film because the stupidity is non-stop!
The only reason that I would not have included it is because although it's very bad, there are SMALL glimpses of actual entertainment scattered about.
There are some good lines and some good bits of businessÂwhen Stan pretends to be Bo-Peep and gets married to Barnaby, Ollie is ready to leave him there because, after all, he is marriedÂbut nothing can save this well-intentioned, badly written, feverishly energetic, garish movie.
I gave this movie 3/10 because it was partially entertaining.
However, I liked B5 for its emotional turmoil and because I came to admire the characters.
I had fast forwarded through a lot of the movie because it was pretty hard to watch.
In fact, after I purchased the 2 DVD disc set and watched it 3 times, I gave it to a friend of mine for his collection because I didn't even like the other movie included in the DVD set {Dead of Night} .
Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and "Claire" (Paula Patton) had been set.
Then when the movie gets to the subject matter that was advertised, we're subjected to a few "gross you out just because" parts.
Their favorite victims are children, then young women, then men, because this is the easiest order to get control over.
We care not when some of the people who are doing the killing get killed because we are not sure if they are the ones in charge.
They leave for Bratislava, in a Slovakia which, according to Alex, is bereft of men because of "the war."
And I am using the world "eventually" because it takes around an hour for this movie to get to the real horror content.
The only reason that I went to see this movie is because I respect Quentin Tarantino's work in other movies, and just because his name was on this one, I caved.
The characters were lame(I couldn't bring myself to feel any sympathy for them), the story line sucked(mostly because the story was "see porn!
I alternated between wanting to throw up and just wanting to cry, not because it was sad, or you felt extremely sorry for these poor people who were being mutilated to the tune of $25,000, but because I couldn't imagine any sane, semi-rational human being enjoying this movie.
While some will point out that the plot is hard to swallow, it doesn't matter because it's wrapped up in sheer entertainment.
The reason this film is highly overlooked, isn't because it was ahead of it's time.
It is because efforts this poor are better off being forgotten.
The reason this movie has twenty alternate titles is because Tobe Hooper and the film's distributors wanted to combat the terrible word-of-mouth that would inevitably arise once the film was shown to unsuspecting audiences.
The gist of the story - a young woman (Judy Davis) accusing an Indian of raping her in the cave - doesn't happen until halfway through this 163- minute film and even that is under question because nothing is ever shown.
A plot of dead zombies and living zombies which are controlled because of music?
It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence.
I truly can't remember why I decided to watch this one; probably because it got regular attention when it first came out.
Now I understand that it was popular among some Horror fans because it's indeed a horrible movie.
Not because it looks like it is going to be a quality film, but because it looks like it will be utter trash.
The ending is quite nice because it's just openly thrown away, the heroes get a Box of Evil and we don't even see them react to it, the credits simply roll.
The movie was different from the book because there were new characters, Santiago's daughter, who wanted him to live with her and she didn't even try to have an accent.
The movie did not help me imagine or understand the story any better because it didn't look like how I imagined it would look.
The movie was also less interesting because it did not say what he was thinking, so you didn't feel as attached to him, and a lot of the stuff he thought was important or interesting.
It was disappointing because I love nearly all the actors - even the supporting cast.
He finds Perky Meg Ryan once again not so perky because she's just dumped her boyfriend, and they have a night of wild passionate sex.
She's the standard actress for this kind of romantic journeys -maybe because she always performs the same way.
First of all, the movie was rated PG but really should have been rated NC-17 because of the wardrobe malfunctions in the scene where Isabelle Lorca is sitting with her mother and stepfather in the dining room table and storms off.
I feel so bad for Mikey Rooney because he was in this terrible (I don't know if you could even call it a movie) movie.
I wonder how popular these films were, although, apparently, they weren't popular enough because Baum's production company was short lived.
I can only hope so, because he hasn't lost his touch and I haven't looked into the reasons why he suddenly disappeared from the big screen.
We went to see it partly because we had just returned from a delightful holiday in Greece and wanted to be reminded of happy experiences.
I just tolerated the movie because it was snowing.
After the Big Fat Greek wedding (that I liked), this was awful... got the feeling that the Greek tourist agency paid a lot to 'force' them to make this movie..... resulting in this uninspired 'movie'..... in fact I would not call this a real movie.... it's more a far too long commercial for Greece...... but it's worse than that because you get a strange impression of the country and I can't imagine that the Greek tourist agency had this intention... what a waste of time an energy.......
(Important: Some movies are bad because the actors are bad, in this case the actors are bad because of the directing and not due to lack of skill.)
I only gave it a 3 because Slaters performance was good enough,but i'm sorry to all Wes Bentley fans,as i get angry when people slag Slater,but this guy really can't act,the last 10 minutes of the film,he gets a pass from me,but up until then,he is like a lump of wood,again,i apologise for being negative about him,but in this movie,he deserves it.
Which is not very exciting either, because it is very single sided.
It gets a 3 because the acting was pretty good.
Usually, this is a WAY under-rated movie, and that is because it is the kind of movie you will watch for the story and not just the sex.
Next the DIA boss wants to kill her DIA agent husband because who knows why and also wants to take out she and her son.
Shoot, I know he didn't because he would've seen then there was, in his words, too much sex.
The original Jason was a cold and inhuman killer - you simply could not understand his motives because he was so evil and inhuman.
But this...the only reason this gets a 2 is because I loved the new Jason so much.
For example: "You are going to have me pump gas because I am the only black guy here!?"
Let's have massive amounts of herb growing around Camp Crystal Lake, because God forbid teenagers might actually want to go plain, old camping and not need a reason like getting high the whole time!
Oh and for some reason he can travel at light speed because he changes from place to place so goddamn fast.
This is probably done for realism, but frankly it doesn't detract too much because you never feel like there's much to see anyway.
In a departure from the norm, Jason takes one of these girls, Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti of "Role Models"), hostage because she reminds him of mom.
that Jason now uses to get around (because the director wanted a mine.
Guess they forgot that because it's the same thing, he finds it.)
And oh yeah, not much happens at the camp because the producer, Michael "Big Explosion" Bay, thinks that summer camps aren't scary.
Hell, the whole rotten movie is a "spoiler")  Upon viewing the opening third of this movie, I swear I thought the film had been written by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (the talentless brothers behind such pieces of dung such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, and ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE) because the film assaulted the audience with embarrassingly crude, off-color, profanity-ridden dialogue.
("Just because I'm black, that mean I can't listen to Green Day?")
You can't have your cake and eat it too: either have a scary Jason that we're rooting against because he's the villain, or portray him as the (anti)hero who's there to wipe out teenage scum.
Everything has the same dark, muddy and flat-looking quality, with no real clarity of picture and irritating shakycam going into overdrive during 90 percent of the horror/action scenes because far too many directors today aren't talented enough to stage an effective horror or action scene without it.
The gore was often even hard to make out because of the camera-work, too, which renders something like this almost completely pointless.
The original has that legendary moment that made people jump from their seats while the people who made this botched that opportunity because of a completely awful editing cut.
He doesn't lock you in his basement and keep you alive for months because you're a pretty girl who looks like his mother.
Perhaps most offensive of all in this film is the performance of Kate Beckinsale, who looks like she is about ten years old, and the director is always making her take her clothes off so he can have another look at her breasts, and when they are covered up, the tight little garment over them keeps them well in view because the director is apparently obsessed with her and her sexuality.
But the idea that one is somehow going to be in the vanguard of popularity because one can say 'fÂ' a lot is a tired and outworn notion which never had the slightest credibility to begin with.
Well, there is no point in going on, because who cares, when a film is so terrible, what the original story was.
"Joseph" is probably Andrew Lloyd Webber's best show, because it's intentionally derivative,and everything else he's written has been unintentionally derivative.
It's too bad that DARK ECHO never really gels, because it is an interesting ultra-low budget production, made in Austria & Hungary by people with good intentions who just didn't seem to understand the horror genre.
That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner.
Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive.
I can understand why planktonrules is so irritated at so many mediocre episodes getting high ratings just because it's got the Twilight Zone name.
Since the plot involves love hotels, we get some nudity, and because the cops and crooks are involved, there's a chase scene, too.
I almost cried after watching this move, not because it was emotionally moving, but because I wasted $5 to rent it for the weekend.
The "Egyptology" described in the terribly written introduction voice-over must be from not a parallel universe, but a skewed one, because it certainly has nothing to do with this one.
The acting could have been good -- I choose to believe this because the bad directing so completely overwhelmed any performance talent that evidence of acting ability is completely undetectable.
I wish Joe Bob Briggs was still reviewing movies, because that's the most entertainment anyone could hope for from this film.
This is important because otherwise, the film would have been far less interesting.
Spoiler; it's telling him that his son along with friends killed him because they thought he was an Arab that hated AmericaÂ based of course on his rude demeanor and tone towards American soldiers, easy mistake.
This movie was made by obvious liberals because a conservative republican would be pleased that an American stuck up for their country and said hey, you want to mess with my land and talk crap about our soldiersÂ well F-you.
It's just because, long time ago, Jack Neo made laughs...
I wish I could have been a fly on the wall during this opening meeting because this little fly would have spoken up and mentioned that this pairing would doom the script, and possibly put a black mark on both of these actor's careers.
I use big words there because there was not one iota of a conclusion.
The direction was horrible because Ritchie could not control his actors.
Whilst Suzanna Ling is somewhat convincing as the unhinged heroine she is not particularly sympathetic or interesting as a protagonist and little time is spent in the script developing the character or going into the details of why she is the way she is beyond her contemporaries thinking she is weird because she lives at the morgue with her mortician father (shades of Six Feet Under).
I must say it was helpful to have her watching the movie with us (in our college dorm), however, because she explained a number of things about Japanese tax code and evasion as well as the Japanese mafia that made the plot (and politics) of the story much easier to follow.
I was excited to see this mini series, because I had seen a couple Gaiman films.
I couldn't get into the plot, because the sets, costumes, and acting was so awful.
u could hardly notice the difference, i watched this movie 4 times because i thought that there may be something to get that only i was not getting, on the final time i watched it with a friend and she was sat there like :S errrrr why are we watching this.. and then it dawned on me ... i really do not know why i would watch this once let alone four times.. this probably will not be useful but all I'm trying to say is.
Just because everyone is gay and the straight people are in the minority in this warped 'comedy 'doesn't make sick bigotry any more acceptable.
Don't worry about the subtitles, because the action on the screen are clear enough to understand.
This is one blundering, bad monster feature that I found hard to hate because it's so lovably, goofy.
After a while, I knew what the lizard was thinking, because my ears were damn sore from this constantly, corny hollowing.
Damn, is he waiting for some sort of written invitation to get thoroughly involved, because he spends his time waiting about for something to happen then actually trying to prevent it.
I think they should give Chase the sheriffs' badge because he makes more headway in the investigation and fixes the overall problem.
Actually, what would the film do without you, because they always seem to make you the talking point when they get the chance.
But hell, it looked like this was dubbed because what they were saying was totally out of sync with their mouth actions.
Is it because it's black and white film and hand held?
Or is it because the actors improvised their lines?
I love improvisation, don't get me wrong, but improvised dialog isn't inherently interesting just because it's improvised.
Well, that's not exactly true because even though the film initially had me rolling my eyes over and over, by the end I was actually quite enjoying the movie, as shallow as it may be.
The attitude towards the women is like that of teen males who hate women because the sexiest women aren't available to them, and because a woman's sexuality is totally abstract to them.
I watched this because it was reference in a similar film, "One Eyed Monster, but have to agree with the poster there, that was a far superior film, and that is not saying much.
And we also know (because its a film) that the two Victorian poets HAVE a relationship because otherwise the movie wouldn't have been made.
The constant intercutting of the modern world kept reminding the viewer that the past is dead and the actions by these dead people ultimately made no difference to anybody living today (because if it had, the modern day scholars would know about it).
If there's one thing i have to say bad in this movie is that Ana Claudia Talancon was wasted in the movie  So to all the people stop discriminating your own product and enjoy this movie because its entertaining!
Not because it is not "based" on a true story, but because by labeling it as such, every single person who watches this movie and does not have access to the real story will assume every moment of it to have actually taken place.
Sometimes it's as if we can forgive the most trying stretches of believability, just because a film was made in an era like the 50's with a shoestring budget.
James (Simone Mattioli) and Leslie  (Antonella Antinori) are here, keep track of them because Leslie is  cute.
Mark (Gian Luigi Chirizzi) and Janet (Karin Well) stand out  only because Mark looks like Michael Keaton and Janet has  psychic feelings that something awful is going to happen, and this  subplot is never elaborated on.
I bought this movie uncut because I love gory movies.
One sequence showing zombie heads being smashed and shot has them all break open just like clay pots, because that's basically what they are.
I came away feeling cheated, primarily because the script created such cardboard characters.
), and that's because there wasn't much there to begin with.
I can hand on heart honestly say that I didn't laugh once during the entire film, not because I found it in bad taste but because the attempted jokes were just not funny.
Stuck on You could just as easily have been titled "Any other movie about small town brothers" because it makes no attempts to serperate itself from any other movie about brothers who have been together for most of their lives.
However, Stuck on You, the newest offering by the Farrelly Brothers, is none of those, for it tries to be offensive without being too offensive, because then some people would be offended.
Bob agrees to go with him (obviously) to Hollywood, because Bob's internet friend May (Wen Yann Shih) lives there, also.
At the end of this film you will be at one of two opinions; "must buy the book because the plot is so original and they just ruined it by a bad film" -or- "I never did really understand the '70's!"
I recommend this movie: "matando cabos" It's a very funny movie, you will forget your problems because you will be laughing since the movie start to the end.
but you should have some fun watching it because as corny and horrible as THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is, there is a feeling you will have, like when you're home sick: that at least you get to miss work or school.
I think they went with this because this was the post-Star Wars Science Fiction craze, but Star Wars had so raised the bar on special effects, that the tired models on wires method just wasn't going to satisfy anymore.
Like I said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.
second, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it secret?
The reason they are difficult to achieve is because not just anyone can do it.
Maybe to a lot of people in the poverty ravaged country of Mexico, it's not funny because of the next to life reality of a severed finger and a senseless beating to a sequester victim, but to us in the U.S who have been desensitized by all the smut we see at the movie theaters, this is a great movie.
It is awful but I recommend it just because it's so much fun to watch a great 'bad' movie sometimes.
Ron Perlman has the lead; a broken man unable to have a life because he stayed alive when many others did not.
All it is is that Cindy and Donna are sisters, half-sisters in fact, who have a father (well one is the real father, we know this because the one who's the non-biological daughter gets a sex scene with the guy - that's right, near-incest, yum to that) that goes around to various whores and gets addicted to one that's her daughters' ages, and a mother who is drunk 24/7 and complains about her husband without doing much about it.
But, as the defiance to a deathbed oath becomes stronger because of his resentful feelings, he flies to Cuba to discover what really happened as well and getting to know his roots.
The flat screenplay has nothing to do with the bad results in the film; narrated in some sort of a road movie as well as a travelogue of those little, picture like towns in Cuba, Miel para OshÃºn is a terrible experience mainly because of it's visual aesthetics, soap-opera like, a very bad acting by everybody that transmits nothing to the viewer, and a long story that usually gives the feeling of going nowhere.
It may not have had the possibility of larger box office draw because there's no Kevin Bacon around this time, but audiences consistently watch a movie for its quality, not for the main star, at least not usually.
The movie does build it's central premise (a series of wild coincidences, characters that are larger than life, the fast paced-all in one night action) on other movies that feature similar elements (Snatch, Pulp Fiction, etc) but because the situations and characters are unique I did not feel ripped off.
The end of the movie is blank, it has no taste, no smell; it's there because the movie just had to end.
Initially, as a viewer you are aligned with Caveh because you are following him as the "narrator"....and he initially connects the viewer in humorous terms....but as his sexual desires and hang ups persist.....you are left feeling sorry and uncaring for Caveh....which is how his existence comes across by movies end.
It's "Come watch me," then "Help me quit," then it's "Don't you go out and do this stuff because I'll get jealous."
I gave it more than one star because his story sounded worth hearing for about a half hour.
That's the reason why the film was released on summer, because it's able to compete against the mega-budgeted productions.
When she is killing her girlfriend, you get the impression, that she is heterosexual, but she has to be a lesbian at the end - because the film wants to tell you, that lesbians are mean, stupid and, in a way, helpless.
actually i think why i don't remember the end is because i fast forwarded to the end, i do that sometimes, so i can say i've seen a film but i don't have to actually sit and watch the whole thing, i usually get the gist though.
I'm glad it was free because I'd have to "demand" my money back.
The story is not pretentiously developed in a way to be unpredictable, it's more like going out in this trip that you simply don't know what's going to happen next because you simply just don't know, just like in 'Go!'.
But he didn't manage she came back to the house to try and rescue the other woman (the evil) because she thought she was being attacked.
Geoffrey Schaaf probably had no clue where he was taking this story, because ultimately, it makes no sense at all.
All what I'm having is just tons of confusion and even more tons of disgust not only because of me being that ignorant, but also because of me being that patient to stand all of this antipathetic movie till it ended !!
I didn't hate it because it's not understandable...I hate it because it doesn't want to be understandable, and I've always thought that when you finish watching a movie then give it a lot of thinking to discover totally nothing about its own meaning or its special message, so this is the definition of a "Bad" movie !
long story short : I'm sorry to whom reads right now because you'll find nothing more than questions, and I'm sorry that you've watched it too as it's not Callas Forever it's Silliness Forever !
The result was released as "Too Many Girls" (1940), financially practical because with almost everything already paid for (insert fixed cost here), the additional expense of actually producing something boiled down to a little electricity and some black and white film stock.
I have given it a 3 out of 10, because it's a bad movie.
Based on it's merits as a film I decided not to give it a one, because it's not badly made.
Zandy's Bride is quite interesting because it deals with a theme that has become relevant again in the 21st century.
I forced myself to sit through every painstaking minute, because it won an Oscar for best screenplay.
I think that's because it evokes a Norman Rockwell period of American history that really didn't exist even during Rockwell's time.
Estranged parent-child relationship, because said parent is too devoted to chasing that big storm.
Parent is obsessed with storms because of a tragedy in their childhood.
Yet it all started because of a really poor made-for-TV movie.
I was sad because they killed Inspector.
I mean, just because Peter Sellers died.
Please fans do not watch this movie because it will ruin your idea of The Pink Panther for ever.
The whole idea of the film is that its easier to have true intimacy (meaning a true connection, not sex) with a total stranger, because we never have to face them again.
At the end plot points are left unresolved all over the place, but that's OK because we're being set up for a sequel.
Frankly, the film works on some bits because we love "The Pink Panther", and seeing those laughs again reminds us of them.
Some of them only had appeared in the earliest of the Pink Panther movies and I felt that they appeared in this movie because they felt they owed it to Peter Sellers.
It's also confusing to see some sequences that were obviously meant original for mainly "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" and "Revenge of the Pink Panther" incorporated into this movie as part of the story but however these different sequences obviously don't really connect with each other also because most of those sequences are basically the same, though less good, ones that got eventually used in those earlier mentioned movies.
It started to annoy me about half way through because there wasn't anything attractive or interesting to look at.
I bought this movie because the actress on the cover (Blanca Lewin) was very good looking and wearing little clothing.
Having passed on "Romance" because he believed no one could replace Peter Sellers, Blake Edwards only went on to prove his point....
I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens.
I don't mean to diminish it, but it was very obvious to me how it was strongly based on Richard Linklater's movies: Before Sunrise, Before Sunset (and Tape, because the whole movie takes place in one room).
The plot was a no brainer which is blown way beyond any common sense with characters who are so stupid they do things like have a "fast of speech" which seemed like a euphemism for "not talking because I'm upset" which, of course, would create relationship problems and does which is why it's factored into this stupid film.
Well, this movie doesn't screw around, that's for sure, and maybe because you know what to expect, and because of this film is well written and executed, you'll never once feel that cringe.
Perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, because of course I would be noticing all the same weird things.
That was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body.
For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re-shoots.
Good because there`s a scene in this that resembles these type of shows .
Great because this happens between every scene in THE UNTOLD .
Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded Major Charles Ingram the contestant who tried to swindle the show out of one million pounds .
Some of them you can laugh at simply due to their ludicrous premise, their textbook stereotyped characters, or often times because the actors are related to the director/producers.
It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film.
For some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and "humanity" could have easily been shown in another way).
Yes and no, because they were all unknowns when this was made.
And I can't be Abraham Lincoln because I believe he is dead.
Unfortunately, the story line, casting and direction leave most of the potential unrealized, simply because the whole story is so ridiculously implausible.
Analyze This, which was quite good, and Married to the Mob, which was pretty weak, are more successful than Mickey Blue Eyes because everything in the movie played for laughs.
Jeanne Tripplehorn is wasted too as his daughter, merely being asked to establish the premise that (a) she loves Hugh Grant, and (b) she can't marry him because her father's a mobster.
I read a review that said her emotionless performance should be nicknamed "Frankenkeller", because she does indeed walk around like a robot!
The movie teaches not to pity or treat someone as a lesser because of a handicap.
The movie is almost impossible to watch too (not just because it sucks).
It then tries to piece together the amensia of the main character through flashbacks, but these scenes never add up to any kind of plot/insight because yet again you don't know if the character is dreaming or if it really happened.
I kept doubting it, and I guessed the ending (mainly because a flashback in the first 20 minutes showed it)and was happy she lived.
Inferno was mostly morality and i could deal with it because it was something different but in hellseeker, we have "Lets make a deal" Kirsty and a cheating spouse and also a tale of greed.
It gets a 9 because the ending comes out as a little bit too abrupt, in my opinion.
I wasn't interested in the story, mainly because I didn't see the point.
It just doesn't work because Leoni, despite her obvious talent and beauty, is not likable enough for us to care - Deborah is among the most exhausting, disreputable characters I have seen in a movie in ages (and that includes Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling in the documentary, "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room").
This is a man who doesn't make films often, his fame being grounded mostly on his TV shows, so when he does, one tends to believe it's because he really has something to say.
I was really impressed with the movie because it he told the story with a completely original and fresh concept based in only photographs.
This is mainly because Sandler is so completely inarticulate, it's very hard to believe that a woman who's barely learned English can understand anything he says.
'Forever Young' really isn't good because it's too unbelievable.
It's a good thing she is a nurse because... actually, for no particular reason.
Moral Orel is still an interesting watch (as long as it comes between superior shows on Adult Swim) because it is a satire.
And they (the people slurred against) are supposed to grin and bear it because it is all in good fun, after all.
I can't believe there are enough people that get off watching a parody of a show the audience probably has never heard off or seen because it's no longer on the air because it's "too" wholesome.
Oh yeah , that probably wouldn't be funny because they don't have any redeeming value to demean.
5/10   Sapphire v 'Sensational' Sherri: Sapphire loses the match by forfeit because she doesn't make it to the ring.
4/10   Hart Foundation v Demolition for the tag team titles in a 2-3 falls match: Demolition incorporated a new member called Crush to share the work load because Ax wasn't well and started a confusion angle (the only people confused where the officials as far as I was concerned) where Harts didn't know which two of the three they were getting.
What I once considered a classic isn't as amazing in retrospect because The Foundation weren't fighting the original members.
4/10  Ultimate Warrior v 'Ravashing' Rick Rude for the World title in a steel cage: You can tell Rude was on the way out here because he referred to the crowd as 'Pennsylvanian Pissants' which caused a genuine stir.
As I said its not bad, its just that you end up watching it to see how the twists go rather than because you're engaged with the characters.
Even though the film might scare some people because it is composed of only pictures and dialog.
I'm not going to go into what this movie was about, because with all of the flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks, you're going to grow tired of watching it, like I did, and not care.
It was like watching an accident, dreadful but you had to keep watching because you couldn't quite believe that anything could be so abysmal.
But not even Billy Bob Thornton can add colour to this drab movie, mostly because he isn't given more than a few words to say.
If you are like most people who probably rented this because of Dwight, don't bother.
Most people would consider this movie unwatchable, but I stayed with it because I hoped it would get better.
My hunch would be that Billy Bob Thorton wrote his own lines because they're not even on the same planet as the rest of the cast in the movie.
Maybe it because I was focusing on the guy playing his sidekick.
I tried and tried to think of something I liked about it, just because I like Dwight so much...but I couldn't come up with a single good thing to say about this movie.
Let this comment serve as a warning to potential viewers, just because a lot of actors who have performed in excellent films are part of this ensemble does not make it worth viewing.
I just think that I wasn't intended as part of the audience, because yes, it's beautifully shot.
His films have received a lot of good reception- only because they show new localities (Iran), in harmless, "safe" topics with not much substance or depth, and in dull, drab drawn out scenes.
Kiarostami was and is one who takes the safe path always... never provokes, never motivates and all "debates" sparking from his films are merely because few can believe that there is nothing more to it than what they see and hear.
I just finished watching this movie like 3 minutes ago.I was amazed by how much of a great horror movie that was.I was really surprised by how much i liked it.I can understand why they call this movie classic,because it is.It's a cult classic.Certainly one of the best horror movies ever made.And one of the best horror movies i've ever seen.Believe it or not,there's not much blood or gore in this movie.Just a lot of disturbing images.
Thinks he loves/wants a particular woman because it turns out she's his last hope of getting a herd of sheep.
but i wanted to talk a little about 'Ghost', played by 'young' Tatiana Maslany, i have written young in lines because when i watched the movie i thought, about 11 up to 14, not older, no way, but she was 19 at the time, unbelievable!!!
and the twist at the end with ghost was just brilliant, because you always believed Tatiana her role, but there are a lot of clues earlier.
TAKE THAT Saw 3-5 (part 1 and 2 had good stories, but from part 3 onwards only Gore because they hadn't really much of a story to tell.
The title of the movie is ironic because it seems the movie itself came "From Hell."
The only genre appropriate for this movie is Horror because of possible shock factor at the type of murders committed.
I find myself shying away from horror movies because I scare easy, however, even I did not find this movie scary.
You could not even really classify it as "gore" because the repulsive part was more the idea of the murders rather than what was shown.
This movie will get a 2 out of 10 and only because the whole setting was terrific and even the special effects with the knife, good!
It's sad too, because it appears the Hollywood machine went full force in recreating 19th century London, CGI, costumes, and props.
While I give this one 4 of 10, this is mostly because I like Scott and his acting--no matter how clichÃ©d and sloppy the movie was.
(I liked the part when she tells the Indian at the newsstand not to talk to her because she is of a higher caste.
Generally when an inconclusive ending is presented it is because the producers are leaving you something to play with or leaving room for a sequel.
But it all went to waste because absolutely no avenue was taken by any of the characters that served to any major benefit or disbenefit (one or the other is important, as long as it keeps things moving).
Watching it is akin to seeing a bunch of toddlers attempt a revival of A Midsummer Night's Dream.. you know it's wrong but you can't pull yourself away because of what might happen next.
in my opinion ghosts and monsters aren't scary because they're obviously not real.
I literally became sick and had to turn it off because of the bad acting.
And they're not very good at it because they keep leaving things like "stunners" behind which makes them have to go back again to fix paradoxes.
The sad thing about this though is that not many people saw this film that are a part of the new generation, except they saw the new version of the film and refuse to see this masterpiece because it's old even though to this reviewer, this film is without a doubt a timeless masterpiece that will never be topped no matter how hard anyone tries.
Too bad, because there are several fine performances in "Millenium," including Joy, Kristofferson and several of the supporting players.
A favourite hobby -horse of mine is that comparisons between novels and filmed novels are pointless because the two media are completely antithetical.A novelist makes certain assumptions about the reader's intelligence and imagination,the filmmaker makes no such assumptions and lays everything out in front of the viewer whose only contribution to the cinema-going experience is to stay awake for the length of the picture.The movie "Millennium" makes even this small effort a chore.
Watch the movies in order, because rather than get better down the line, they get worse.
Sometimes i like to watch B-movies because its fun to see bad actors and bad effect just for fun.but.......
don't hire this movie because it's a waste of time and a waste of money.
The only good thing was that on the backside of the movie it said that it should be 1h30minutes... but it was like 50m only, and that was good, because i would not want to waste another 40m on that crap!
I gave it 1 star because:   1) there wasn't anything lower available to give it here other than 0 stars, and it ain't getting off that easy, and   2) I did enjoy some of the music in the movie (when it wasn't trying to sound 'comical' when the twin vampires were doing whatever the heck it is they're doing while the cameras were rolling... it sure wasn't anything funny, that's for sure.)
Louise Fletcher fans - Watch something else which you will be able to enjoy her performing in, because this just ain't it.
And what about the Whore-who-falls-for-the-otherwise-useless-inspector because - wait for this - he treated like : not once, not twice but three times A Lawdy!
We see some very insipid love story, some more insipid gangster story, we are even supposed to feel sorry for some of these guys... because they were supposedly men of honour... and not one word about why this bunch of people was so notorious, feared, and protected by the powerfuls.
Maybe it's because I never got to Balitmore....did I ?
This NEVER could have happened in the TV series and in many ways makes the show irrelevant--after all, what's funny about moving to Hootersville and then leaving because it DID suck after all?!
Maybe then they could've used the money they'd have saved and spent it on better writers, because the next glaring mistake was the bad writing.
I give this movie two stars instead of one, because the only endearing aspect of this "mistake" was seeing most of the original cast together again.
Do you watch films to get lectured for 2 hours, or because you enjoy films?
It is shocking not because of graphic violence, but because how the violence is handled - we are left unaware of the full extent of the murders, forcing us to use that wonderful thing called imagination.
As Fritz Lang once said "It is best not to show acts of violence on screen because the viewers will imagine the worst".
These are the sorts of lines that can only be delivered in the sleepiest way possible, and it can't be called dialog because usually Brigitte doesn't answer.
I can't list everything I hated about this movie because a) it would take too long and b) I'm sure it killed a few of my brain cells, and my mind is blocking some of my memories out of self-defense.
Just because America pioneered democracy doesn't mean it's the best at embracing it.
Just because America has the most money, doesn't mean it's the most loveable country.
Michael Moore and other American liberals, although critical, don't go this far, but the blindly patriotic assume so because they can't stand any criticism of their home team.
Now other countries are advancing faster than us because the cowboys are still riding the same dead horses.
We see some amazing direction followed by actors acting like real Joe schmoes reading from a script who display their pleasure with this grand country as if we don't have problems, because this propaganda would rather have us ignore the problems because it's much better to just watch this comedy and forget our misery.
Apparently I only thought Dragonball Z was that great because I was never exposed to anything better.
The clown ghost stuff is interesting but because of lousy 3-D you really don't get a good look at it.
There's been a lot of yada yada yada about the "Seinfeld" curse, so-called, because none of the cast of that beloved show have found successful vehicles since it ended.
Some of those those shows are funny because they are so silly.
That works because the jokes are so far away from what is really happening.
The final episode somewhat ridiculously relegated them to a jail cell which few fans could honestly lament, but we stayed to the end because of that deep well of affection and identification we had built up before they went off the deep end (well, the *supporting* Kramer was always pretty much there, but we were only given him in relatively small doses).
I gave it a four out of ten, because it had some funny scenes and I did enjoy some of the characters and performances; however, I did not like the story at all.
Everyone who took part in this movie should be ashamed.Even actors who I actually like have totally collapsed before my eyes.Seeking any deep meaning and symbolism in this movie is just absurd.It completely lacks any originality.Istead there is some kind of redneckish humour in which there can't be any allegory - it is what it is - incredibly flat and superficial.I love sex jokes but they should at least be funny,not just a line of dirty words and gross images of horny old people.I voted with one star just because there is no option to vote with half or less,but this movie doesn't deserve even that much (well,maybe for the music,but that is quite merciful).Seriously,one of the worst movies ever made.
It's a dirty shame because if the story didn't fall apart it would have been a funny and worth-while movie experience despite it's many vulgarities.
I find this very hard to believe because this movie hasn't aged a single day.
I love CRYBABY and HAIRSPRAY because they are kind in their exposure of the unloved winning, whereas ADS is just a waste of stars saying "vagina".
Well, when you go to the cinema, find 2/3 of the seats empty and, before the movie is half, see more than half of the viewers leave the room before the movie has ended...  Talking about the story will not take very long, because there just isn't much of a story to be found in this movie.
If you are already offended by a naked breast in a movie, than you certainly shouldn't watch this one, because it will probably give you a heart attack from the first minutes on.
I can appreciate well known actresses wanting to do a "cult" or "B" movie because of love for a character or franchise (ie: Bridget Fonda's cameo in "Army of Darkness.")
Disrespect, ugliness, a look worthy of the "do it yourself" punk slogan... A few movies that, in their own context, were so valuable, they broke taboos, they spit in the face of that society because the future was coming.
There's absolutely no point, and it would fail as an action/adeventure film because there's so little action (and some pathetic insertions of stock footage).
You kill a human being and then have the nerve to feel you're being wronged by the other members of his tribe because they want and expect retribution Â it's something my 21st Century sensibilities cannot comprehend.
I honestly think it bothered me so much in Jungle Goddess because the movie is so bad there's nothing to take the edge of these scenes.
These dopes crash in the jungle while looking for this girl, because there's a reward for finding her.
He gets even more idiotic than in American Pie and leads to me shaking my head due to his clown behavior because I know there are many people who think that he's funny.
And if you plan on seeing this film you have to watch the credits at the end because the biggest gut laugh is there.
The great poet Rilke suggested that the young should not write romance because their lack of life experience will not allow them to write anything but the cliche.
Some people, who have never seen it before, wonder what's so great about it after watching it for the first time, well, this is probably because TCM is the most copied movie of all time and TCM will look too familiar to newbies.
Mainly because when this low budget movie was originally released by its unscrupulous distributors it was dismissed as another trashy drive-in horror movie, when in fact few realized the brilliance to be found within it.
But the direction by Tobe Hooper is inspired brilliance and even though Hooper often injected bits of black humor here and there which could have made the film less authentic, the humor never overtakes the story (which is probably what many didn't like about the sequel, which, btw, I recommend too) because the rawness of what's occurs on screen is never pulled back.
Hollywood makes these movies because they know that they're trash but the opening sales will cover the cost of the production and still make a small profit.
Well, maybe someone did say that, because that's what they got.
Here's the spoiler, because I have to identify it: once you see the first ten minutes you know how the film will end.
Sometimes you can watch a comedy with a predictable story but still enjoy it because its funny.
Out of 10 I would give this a 3 only because Freddie looks so cute in a goatee!
The only reason I even give it a 2 is because I like Prinze and Forlani...who are both dreadful in this poorly scripted, ineptly directed clunker.
The film opens with a song called "Love Stinks", that should be retitled "This Film Stinks", because it does, from director Robert Iscove (She's All That).
In fact, director Tobe Hooper only shows us what is necessary, maybe because of the low budget he was working with (Hooper's later output would suggest this), but it forced creativity from the filmmaker that is sadly lacking in his other work (Poltergeist may be an exception, but Hooper's direction was steered by Spielberg on that one).
Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those few horror films that will unnerve you to a degree of unrest because it hits home where it hurts.
The task of committing TCM to words is a difficult one, not because the proper words don't exist but merely because they can only describe the surface and never convey the essence and the heart and what can only be felt in one's own skin and maybe that of others.
This gives an aura of "things not being told because they don't fit into Lewis&Klein's view of the world".
I'm glad I didn't watch this little ditty in a cinema, because then I would be forced to walk out (which I hate doing).. What I hate the most about this movie is it's awkward pace - It's a mess, a collage of fast paced scenes mixed with slow motion shots.
If you're going to see The Waterboy because of the physical hits don't bother.
Adam better get his act in gear, because after The Wedding Singer (ugh) I had hoped to see him return to good form.
Fans of Sandler are the same folks that let MTV dictate their lives and consider the Teletubbies "cool" just because it's hip to like what toddlers go for.
Exactly, because that's what it'll take to actually stomach one minute of any of his films.
They instead dismissed it as a pointless exercise in graphic gore(there's actually very little), while praising lousy later films like 'Blair Witch' to the skies because of so-called deeper meanings.
She's not the intelligent, feminist heroine(despite being of the 'free love'generation)that Laurie Strode of 'Halloween' is, she survives because of the killer's(s) incompetence.
I'm not saying Leatherface spared him for last out of mercy(He had just met Franklyn when he kills him), but because they are similar symbolically.
i don't hate this film because i was a young teen when this came out and did find it pretty funny but never thought it was good.
The reason why Faster Pussycat remains Meyer's best-known film is because the females are the main characters.
Canadians take pride in their movies because they are often freer and more daring than films made in the U.S.A.
But let's take a closer look at the characters here: In place of sexually crimped, over-zealously religious parents trying to retard the sensuality of their teenage children we get a careworn, pot-smoking couple - a withdrawn, tepid man and his sad, adulterous wife; in place of a restless, dutiful youth shackled by legalistic restrictions on his behavior we get a kid who has no trouble lying about his intentions because he believes the lie will help him manipulate a much older man into having sex with him; and instead of an uninspired teacher limited by narrow, parochial thinking we get a guy who thinks it's perfectly acceptable to cruise for casual sex at a rest stop.
This film is, in fact, not a comedy at all, but rather one of those light entertainment films which is classified as a comedy simply because it's not a drama.
is fun), because it's fun to continue with the story from part 1.
Another commentator is right on the button when he says that we the audience do not care who wins because both antagonists are childish.
See that's the part where the crook gives Batman a taste of the hard life that he endured because of Batman.
Yada yada yada, a bunch of pointless & poorly delivered speeches happen, the criminal does everyone a favor and blows his brains out, and Batman uncharacteristically kills himself because the director thinks this is a brilliant plot twist.
bruce blames himself for his parents death so he wouldn't kill himself because a punk took his own life, or kill himself because he was raped/got aids.
Many people refuse to watch this movie in the first place because of what they've heard and because of the title.
All because of Leatherface, many people's nightmares will be dominated by the hum of a chainsaw.
Unfortunately, these ideas are lost and muddled, because the film keeps switching teams; one minute it's about vigilantes being wrong, then the next minute they say the hero is needed; then the villain gets all of the sympathy, making you want to hate Batman, and then when it ends, they want you to sympathize with Batman.
And it's a shame too, because there's a lot of great ideas in this movie and, as the title suggests, this film could've been really interesting.
No real Batman fan should see this because it's depressing and disheartening for our favorite hero.
I hesitate to use the word disturbing to describe this short because that word suggests an emotional impact that a skilled filmmaker could achieve, in the way a horror movie or an art film can be both disturbing and rewarding.
Personally I like a darker Gotham than most and I have imagined what an R-rated Batman movie might be like, however 'The Death of Batman' is unrewarding even in simply seeing it as a for-adults superhero story because all of its extremeness and shock value is all it has to offer.
I don't mean that as in a trekkie telling you not to watch 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' because it fails to meet certain expectations or do not watch 'Batman & Robin' because it's a waste of time, I mean that if you watch this short could ruin Batman for you.
Although intended to showcase American airpower in the 50's, it could be redone as cold war retro flick because the footage is still cool and beautiful.
I think Hooper must have had some divine inspiration, because each of Leatherface's scenes is exquisitely planned and executed, from the first guy who gets dragged down, to Pam, to the encounter with Franklin and Sally in the woods (how chilling and scary was that, and yet how clever, to chase someone in the woods equipped with...a chainsaw) to the end.
It's not really their fault because they actually work well as a team but the director, John Landis felt that it was more interesting to dwell on the rather tired plot about the possibility of nuclear holocaust which is played out too long at the end of this otherwise amusing comedy.
This only caught my eye because I recognized the Sprouse boys and I saw it had Tom Arnald in it and thought it would be funny.
We rented it because it looked cute.
Ghajini Just because Amir Khan Â the superstar of Bollywood is attempting to make this Tamil re-make in Hindi, I was interested to see this original (which itself is a rip-off of Hollywood movie Memento).
Well I was impressed with Ghajini only because I was happy that directors have started thinking about new concepts ,but I was wrong .This one too turned out to be a copy ,nothing original .
I gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because I clicked on the wrong number, I meant to give it a 1.
My roommate rented this under the title "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits.
Not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.
A memorable passage from Ayn Rand's book THE FOUNTAINHEAD has a character reading something which is essentially gibberish and thinking it "...must be profound because he didn't understand it."
I only understood what was going on because I read the book.
The dad and his daughter work because they are archetypes and protagonists.
And really, after watching this movie, maybe it's a good thing because if they did the 'goofy lighthearted predictable' thing on books number 2 and 3, I would have been really disappointed.
He comes out and the audience would boo or catcalls him, Maury doesn't let the guy fully explain his story because of the audience which consists of nothing but lazy, good-for-nothing imbeciles that should be at work, not on talk shows feeling sorry for people that air their dirty laundry on national TV.
Maury Povich (or however you spell his name) is a hypocrite because his show sends opposing messages to women.
Some shows are so bizarre, so ridiculous, or so "bad," they can promote interest because of the fascination provided.
Hopefully, kids are in school when this trash is on but what about people unable to leave the house because of illness?
I like Maury Povich, but although I watch this show, only because of him and his advice, I don't like it.
This show has to be scripted because these people say the exact things no matter what.
An ex-nun nymphomaniac, so she says, who has not had sex because "I'm choosy", and a porn star, some gangsters, etc., adds up to a labored, dead, badly acted pseudo movie.
I watched it because of all the good comments, so I'm warning those with ears to hear.
Just curious because the catch phrase on Dr Elson`s show is " look after each other and keep talking "
it just goes to show you that you've gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it's bad (and not "bad good," either): the reason i'm giving this movie a "4" rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams (the rest of 'er is pretty good, too); but this movie has all the hallmark TV movie characteristics - which means you'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen.
I say may, because the final scenes are a bit of an unnecessary letdown considering the buildup.
It's really a shame because the directing is actually pretty good, the score feels just right, most of the actors hold their own, and the sets actually look remarkably authentic considering what an extremely low budget this movie clearly had.
This is one of the great war films, not because it shows some epic event such as "Pearl Harbor" or aspires to maudlin sentimentality and false realism like "Saving Private Ryan," but because it shows the ordinary plight of common people who happen here to be soldiers.
Badly understrength, the Allies manage to take the hill, but because of ongoing peace talks their superiors are racked by doubt about how much strength to commit.
I dislike films that are obvious about the "we are all just brothers under the skin, so won't you just like me even though we're different because I am deferring to you" politically correct party line.
In a particularly cruel evening's prank, Grizzle's garden is destroyed, Charlie is reduced to self-mutilation because of the stealing of his pup, and the lowly barn in which he lives is destroyed by fire.
Disillusioned about their superiors and frightened to the hilt, the men must battle for the hill knowing they could well be killed just because the top brass want to save face.
A powerful and memorable movie for sure and certainly an important one because the Korean War is largely forgotten these days, so Pork Chop Hill now stands proud for those that died during the conflict, for this is a wonderful testament to the brave fighting under stupid circumstances.
The rating is higher than it ought to be simply because it is fascinating to watch a great movie remade on the cheap for no particular reason other than Columbia already owned it, and comparing it to the original.
Some people say that the Americans won because the North Koreans did sign the peace treaty shortly afterwards.
Others say that the North Koreans won because they got better terms than they should have.
I was so intrigued with the story line I wanted to see the ending but again because of the scrip and acting I could only watch it in small doses.
They might as well have gone beyond the scattered skin peeks to a fuller soft-core intention -- all pillow-plush and pleasures in the sultan's palace, because that's already the quality/ambiance/performance level of much of this thin 'n cheesy production.
Of course this could be because it's a TV film.
If your a Sci-Fi fan you can watch this movie because is Sci-Fi but I warn you, you could develop some funny feelings (I don't know if funny ha-ha or funny queer) in the pit of your stomach.
It's very funny because it has a dumb story,bad acting,bad visual effects,bad direction,and enough plot holes to make a small cemetery.
It's very funny because it has a dumb story,bad acting,bad visual effects,bad direction,and enough plot holes to make a small cemetery.
The writing is terrible mainly because the subplot of the soldiers trying to capture the bad guy, but where the film really fails is when it takes an entire magazine to make the raptors stumble.
But if that makes sense to you, please explain it to me because I have no clue how radiation brings dinosaurs back from millions of years of extinction.
Whoever told the actors where to shoot, obviously didn't speak before hand with the FX guys, because the actors shoot all over the place, and never hit the raptors.
The raptors were funny to watch simply because when ever they would get hit with a bullet it would make a really unrealistic blood splat and then just disappear without a bullet hole or any mark at all.
One of them takes about 50 rounds to the butt, which is really hilarious because you'd think he'd turn around and see what's going on back there, but he doesn't.
However, the cast is much more interesting, mainly because we don't have the outstanding character actors now that we had then.
***Spoilers..maybe*** While the "adventure" focus the most part on the "growing" and "surprinsing"(because nobody can actually explain how many powers Will has or how did he get them)of Will Treston, it also points the relationship of him, with his family(BIG family, by the way), and maybe love-wise.
All this...i could easily forget it...but what destroyed me completely...was the "Disco Battle"(Final Fight Between the Old Ones and the Raider)or the Final Fight Between Will and the Raider( The effects of the Light and Dark Energies looked so crappy, a White and Dark Blankets, would have worked better) ************************************ So, Ill give it a 3, because it was not the worst movie i have seen yet...but because of the many plot holes and ...why to put Maggie and Stephen on the promotional poster if they barely acted on the film?
The characters and situations are badly developed and I took a ten minutes nap along the story, but I did not rewind the DVD because I noted that the part I had missed was also boring.
I give credit to the producer, the money spent on the actors was probably worth it I did think that there was a bit of integrity because of the actors (I was wrong).
As Executive Producer Gregory Peck is said to have had the original 20 minutes of the film cut from the theatrical final version because he wasn't in it and felt too much time would be spent before the star of the film makes his on first screen appearance.
If Emily Perkins's performance doesn't blow us away as it did in `Ginger Snaps,' that's only because it's not as much of a surprise this time around, and Tatiana Maslany's Ghost makes a goofy but plausible addition to the films' world.
If so, he failed miserably because the massive changes made this look more like a bad Harry Potter knock-off than a separate film.
The Dark is represented by a villain called The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), named so because he rides around on horseback.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** i gave it one star because this is supposed to be a true story.
no charges were profered, nothing.. only after over 4 years of being locked in prison, sometimes in solitary confinement because they thought he was so dangerous, was he offered the plea bargain.
One interesting touch has all the women outliving the men, but that's probably only because they're slightly better actors and willing to go topless once in awhile to relieve several boring stretches where nothing of plot relevance is happening.
I give this film a little credit because it DOES pick up a bit by the end, but otherwise it's typical slasher nonsense, done with little creativity and flair.
That movie (because it is the same movie) is also a blatant work of nonsense.
Back when I was a kid in kindergarten, we always used to sing a song about a crocodile named Sophie and, according to the lyrics, her jaws were never closed because she always gossiped about the rest of the animal kingdom.
Quite undeservedly if you ask me, because it really isn't such a terrible movie and even benefices from a handful of good aspects, like a solid cast and engaging CGI-monster effects.
In this case the theory is that the "Gator" acquired this "taste" because of all the bloodshed from the civil war that had gone on for years in that country.
if you are reading this please donate the money you will spend on the ticket for this movie because it'll be put into better use, cause trust me it will not entertain you at all!!!
we snuck into this movie because it was the only thing playing that wasn't night at the museum.
then they goto Africa because there is a crocodile thats been killing people for like 60 years.
then we left cuz we couldn't take it anymore; the only reason why we stayed that long was because we thought the chick was going to get naked (i found out she didn't).
It is hard to say that it is irrelevant, because if it was well developed it could serve as a decent metaphor.
I think the snow had a really bad accent, but I cannot be sure, because eventually I couldn't even stand looking at the screen to see who was saying their incredibly banal and annoying lines.
And the idea that a player is being hounded by the team's owner because he's too much of a rebel reeks of that silly and ubiquitous anti-establishment theme seen in too many movies of the 1970s.
I rented this movie because I adore Ji-tae Yu - I think he's a wonderful actor.
I'm not going to say this movie makes the least sense of every movie I've ever seen, because I've seen an awful lot of movies, but it's got to at least be one of the most senseless.
Premise comes directly from that antiseptic '50s aesthetic that women want marriage in order to start a family (just like their mothers), but men want marriage in order to get into the bedroom (because no self-respecting 'tomato' would go all the way without vows).
He's called a monster, a heel--which seems a tad severe for a guy who never seems to get any action because his phone is always ringing and his doorbell is always buzzing.
The plan works, because the idiotic secretary decides to conveniently buy out all the mangos, thus preventing them from ever proving the tape to be the fraud that it is.
She does this because she doesn't want Bobby to get sick, like the tape says that he will.
And even though her plan doesn't even make sense, because in all seriousness, there shouldn't be only one fruit vendor in a given city.
It was a waste of celluloid and the filmmakers should have burned the negative and collected the insurance--because it doesn't even belong on the American market.
GT brings nothing special of it's own to the table because honestly, there is no story left, just some people who want money.
The only reason I remember it is because of the unexplained pretentiousness of inserting an ill-fitting note of profundity in the person of Sam Silver, and especially, the presence of Elena Sahagun, a very beautiful and underappreciated actress.
So about 30 - 35 mins into the film I thought, screw this, because the Dark Knight was on at this time, I had a much better 30 mins in the Dark Knight than this.
Once she gets a boyfriend, Georgia sees herself as "perfect" - because he tells her she is so!
The film was very hard to like from the start, not being able to relate with the actors' poor portrayal of the school-girl demographic (not because I'm not a school-girl, but because they were such disastrous actresses), the hypocrisy of the storyline itself, and a general dislike for most of the lead characters, meant that I didn't care what happened to them at all.
I mainly agree with slyttle, who essentially slated it, because i have been a big fan of the series for a long time too.
But this didn't happen, mainly because the boys didn't, not once, turn around, a fact that I find pretty amazing.
The second-last sequence in the movie is a bit of a mystery to me because at the start of the film, Georgia was unpopular in her school, but suddenly, her night-club is packed with what looks like the entire population of her state, everyone cheering and throwing confetti like she's just handed out free flip-phones.
A shame, because the production values are there, the star (Henriksen) is wasted with this kind of script and the editing tries to contrast every moment of suspense with random actions (like heating up a stove, cleaning a fish, ...) This is B-movie material, a rental for the Henriksen fans, others should wisely avoid.
An ultra-generous 3/10 because of Bodnias acting.
It's strange because no episode of Doctor Who has dated as badly as this.
I'll give Traces of Death a 3, because of it's pure exploitation!
This makes the film just that much more disturbing if you ask me because when you're looking at live and in motion footage and can see exactly what led up to that person's death, one has a tendency to want to play that terrible scene over and over in their head for days after; and for me it isn't always done intentionally, it's just that it get's in your head and doesn't want to leave until you are able to focus your thoughts on something more pleasant instead until it goes away...which is easier said than done I'm afraid!
That is the type of damaging effect such films as this one can truly have on you, and if you find yourself doing the same thing as I just described after watching even one of these films I implore you: please avoid "Traces of Death" like you would the plague because ultimately all it will ever do is give you horrible nightmares and leave you thoroughly nauseated for days after viewing!
Julia goes something like: "There are no fences here, the horses stay because of respect..." Well, in my opinion, the horses stay because they are in need of food, which they get from the horsemen, the law of nature or something.
However, all is not so simple, as another werewolf is on the rampage and is stalking Brigitte because it wants to...ahem, mate with her.
I only wanted to watch this film because I'd read that Kim Cattrall got her tits out...and then I had to wait over an hour for that.
Perhaps I shouldn't be too hard on the actors, because some of them have shown talent in other films, but how desperate must they have been to appear in this dud?
I don't mean to make out that this movie is rubbish just because of this, it's rubbish for many reasons.
The action was like watching paint dry, I just couldn't get into it because it was just so corn.
I've already seriously contemplated turning the movie off because it's so dumb, but i continue on despite all odds to be true to the concept of a Johnny Stockwell Film Festival.
I walked into the theater thinking this should be good because its the Hera Pheri cast, but two hours into it i stopped hoping for something funny and original to come out.
If you haven't watched 'There's Something About Marry' then you might enjoy this lame movie .... Lame because every joke is lifted directly off 'Something About Marry'.
One of the reasons why I tuned into this show was because I like Bruce Greenwood's work, but, after watching as much of it as I could stomach, I can only hope that Bruce was paid well.
If the movie or TV industry cannot make a religious movie without showing the messengers of God having teenage puberty sex outside of marriage, then they should not make any religious movie, because they do not know how to make a religious movie.
Too bad the BBC didn't pick it up as a series because I think it showed promise.
Watch it if your not really wanting to get engaged because you won't.
The (young) daughter subplot was good because both characters were somewhat likable while the scientists father daughter subplot reeked--I hated the scientist daughter.
I happened to tune into this one just as it was beginning, mainly because the log line seemed interesting.
Following is a repeat of above text because I've already said it all, but IMDb rules require 10 lines of text before a review can be submitted: Don't waste your time on this boring movie.
After the initial "shock" that the world only has the time left for the plate to move another 20 cm or so I said to myself, "Okay were is the villain because the movie can't rely only on an evil-moving tectonic plate."
You haven't lived until you've seen a young woman graphically rip her eyeballs out because she thinks there are ants behind themÂAWESOME!!
I am giving this flick a "2" because it is not the worst Sci Fi Channel movie I have ever seen.
Thrown in for sexual tension, and a woman's touch, is the scientist's daughter, reknowned in her own right, but with a chip on her shoulder because she thinks her father cared more for science than for her.
It may fool you because despite its low budget, it starts out looking like a real movie: Its production values and musical score are actually quite respectable.
In fact, we learn nothing about Madison's character because the scenarists provide him with no backstory.
I was disappointed by the scene in which Melissa removes Edgar's mask mainly because I wanted to see the total extent of his deformities.
More dull then anything else it never generates enough interest to create any real scares because you really don't care.
The film opens in the year thirteen-hundred-forty something with a bunch of monks turning to Satanism because they're angry with God for allowing the Black Plague to kill millions of people.
This was obviously a brilliant career move because the story suddenly jumps forward in time 600 years and all the monks contained their same age and virility.
But the next winter sacrifice is coming up and one of the cult members suggests using his granddaughter because she's still a virgin.
The first few minutes really had me thinking the movie was going to be worth watching, but I couldn't believe I actually finished the movie because it really just had very little to offer as far as keeping me interested.
i hardly know the names of the characters because they were barely mentioned.
And why was this movie rated R, because only one person did in a not so bloody way and not so much cursing in this movie.
Al I'm saying is don't make more Puppet Master movies because after part 4 if was boring, stupid, and pointless.
I would never tell anyone to stay away from a movie because we all have different emotional responses to what we watch, but be warned this will leave you confused and wondering 'what did I just watch?'
One good thing about it: it made me register at IMDb because I was so upset and wanted to write a review so that nobody else makes the mistake and spend a cent seeing this movie...
One more thing: Quebec's critics rarely say bad things of Quebec's own movies because of the small market and that they want to protect themselves but even Le Dernier Tunnel got bad reviews so believe me when I say it's worst than bad !
This movie made my head hurt; not because it's nonsensical and hard to watch, but because someone actually paid money to make it.
She also gets to display her dramatic side in an enactment of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" that brings tears to one's eyes, not because it is moving, but because it is painful to watch.
It's not his fault though, because the movie just doesn't care how he might have felt about it.
Eventually there is a big showdown, and if you've ever seen one Western before you'll be able to predict how it ends up, except that by then we have established a sympathy bond with Van Cleef, who never allows himself to really be as scummy as his gang and insists on being protective + helpful to Garrett's kidnapped, jailbaitish sister, and doesn't jump her pretty bones because he has a little bambino back at home who loves his poppa.
Maybe something does happen in the final 4 minutes or so that redeems the rest of the movie, but I rather doubt it and am willing to risk the loss, because like the movie itself, I just don't care.
I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, scanned the digital channels... the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks.
I recorded it because it was rated highly in the TV listings and starred Matthau, who I always like, but during the opening credits' bucolic scenes of Matthau playing with a little boy to the movie's unutterably treacly score (the sort of thing you heard in TV movies of the 70s) I thought, oh god, what am I in for?
I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival because it starred the great actor Phillipe Noiret.
Like in the film, I just can't get over the feeling that Jacko only included this because he wants to see himself 100 feet high.
That's just what I think , I hope the fans of this completely irrelevant and inferior visual wanking will not be offended because this is nothing personal .
Too bad the movie doesn't consist only of these two scenes , because it would be much better that way .
He proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals, citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean.
They are magic  because they glow.
Not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the Dark Ages after all)Âit is, quite simply, very poor stuff indeed.
They want to be accepted by their peers but they can't because of bourgeois prejudices.
The movie itself gets a 0 out of 10, but because of the gore and good f/x I'm giving it an overall 2/10.
His plan worked and BLADE RUNNER hit in 82 while MUTANT HUNT's legacy was muted because it was seen a ripoff.
The direction is the big failure in this movie, because the script and the acting, while they weren't good, they could have been fixed by a competent director.
A bunch of trouble teens invest themselves in putting together a rock club they once thought was owned by the bum (because of squatter's rights) who granted them permission to use the club.
And sometimes you'll have to shoot at them in different directions, because they can attack you from the air, water and jungle at the same time.
The game become very boring after a few hours, because it's all the same; you come to the island, start shooting at the enemy, enter a base or laboratory, shoot new bunch of enemies, push the button or something like that and in the end shoot some more enemies.
Here in Europe, "Dark Ride" is simply just another low-keyed and cheesy horror movie that anonymously moved to the lowest and most neglected shelves of video stores, but in the States it's apparently a little more popular because it was part of the 'Eight Films To Die For'-cycle that played at the "After Dark" horror festival.
I have to admit the opening sequence is awesomely atmospheric, creepy and even a slight bit controversial, because two children Â twin girls Â are slaughtered and barbarically dissected on screen by a mad-raving lunatic who hid himself in a theme park ride.
I thought about clicking the spoiler button, because that pretty much sums up the movie.
The only reason I give this movie more than one star is because the killer is pretty awesome.
Really the only stand out is Andrea Bogart, and only because of a hilarious non-sequiter moment where she goes berserk in a van briefly.
There's a scene mid-way through where all the characters are in the dark ride talking in panic to one another and you absolutely lose your sense of place because of the way it's shot and edited...it reminds me of the parody short films shown at the beginning of the brilliant "The Big Picture" and I actually had to laugh after a certain point, it went on so long.
no not really, but its far from gripping simply because its so similar to stuff we've seen before.
But they end up in Asbury Park because one finds a pamphlet in a restroom that trumpets the opening of the Dark Ride, a boardwalk attraction that shut down many years ago after twin sisters got killed.
!I wouldn't recommend it even if it's the last movie you have.The plot is simple and I was able to make up what is going to happen next, and you know what I was right.I'm not going to write anything about the story itself because there is nothing to write about!
If you don't believe me, watch it and try to keep track of how many times shots go out of focus because the cameraman (or the director, who can say) has no idea what he's doing.
I was able to say lines before the characters because it was so obvious where the story was going (i.e.
The reason why for me was because it seemed like little more than a cheap Canadian kids sit-com slightly vamped up with some gore and a few breast shots.
and the film looked dull and grainy, the bit where the girl is run over will make you laugh forever, the shocks are ridiculous to the point of needing to by yourself a new television because your current one has just caught a virus.
please don't go buy it, and ignore the positive comments about this film because its basically the cast writing reviews about there own shitty film because there out of work.
I thought at first I just had a dud.I wasn't able to get a refund only an exchange for the same stupid movie, and the next factory sealed one also skipped in the same exact spot so obviously the master copy is bad and has been transfered to all of the discs.I won't buy or rent anything again by this no-name new filmmaker and hope other's don't make the same mistake unless you like bad quality, grainy B-rated films made by a guy and his friends with a cheap hand held video camera.It is nothing more then someone's student film.All the money was spent on deceiving us with interesting looking cover art and a nice animated main menu.This is the only reason I even gave the movie a 2 out of 10.That is all this movie has going for it.It's a shame because I wanted to like this film but could never sit through it again.Now i've lost 14 bucks that could have been spent on something else.I feel ripped off!
In small places the acting is almost passable, but they only stand out because the majority of the acting is beyond a joke.
It's too bad, because I think it's great fun to skewer the snooty art world...but this was just too far over the top.
I came into this film expecting a lot, and what I got out of it, was nothing more than despair, not because of the dark subject matter, but the waste of talent and celluloid.
Watch it, because this is a landmark.
The reason I auditioned for the film is because I wanted to be a sand pirate but they ended up casting me for a prisoner due to my poor horse riding skills.
I gave this movie three stars just because the actors make a concerted effort but even they can't save it.
But this is a really deep conspiracy because Grandpa isn't who he seems.
Unlike its brilliant cinematic counterpart "Excalibur", Merlin plays like an awful made-for-TV movie because it happens to be just that- an awful made-for-TV movie.
It was pure torture to sit through it all...and the only reason I stayed until the end is because I was waiting for something good to happen.
I got this movie because of the box art.
I bought this DVD because I expected it would provide some serious and interesting insights into Indian cult adventures, followed by some keen deprogramming techniques back home in the pond of Christianity.
The movie is a total bore because Crawford's choice was obvious from the very beginning; run to the nearest convent and become a nun.
Now I'll admit that Daisy Kenyon does have some noirish elements, chiefly in the dark photographic texture imposed on the picture by Leon Shamroy (who presumably disliked working with Joan Crawford because he often seems to go out of his way to capture her close-ups from unflattering angles).
Both the audience (and his wife) are supposed to conveniently forget that he planned her cold-blooded execution and only missed out on doing it because she abruptly left him first.
I bought this film because of the multitude of glowing reviews found on this forum.
Richard Dreyfuss (who you'll probably confuse with Bob Balaban because of their similar looks), who is a decent actor in his own right, is disappointing as Roy Neary, whose character is so crazy and unlikeable, the experience of watching the film becomes numb.
Roy's evolution is too fast Â in a matter of what seem to be few days he has turned into a complete loon, and because of Spielberg's lack of character arc, the sudden change is startling and Â worst of all Â cold.
We lose all sense of empathy for Roy, primarily because we do not experience his pain Â we see him suffering, sure, and moping around like a "cry baby," as his son names him.
Then, audiences savored the F/X because they were the best since Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (even the trailer advertisements claimed this was so, in order to entice viewers).
Dorothy also runs away because her parental figures don't "understand" her; the same with Joe.
But where Dorothy is upset because Miss Gulch has taken Toto away, Joe swipes the Honus Wagner Card more out of basic selfishness.
I rented this movie last week because I love 80's teen movies (License To Drive, Can't Buy Me Love, Don't Tell Her It's Me, etc.)
I won't bother explaining the reasons why (because there are so many reasons).
I just couldn`t turn away because it was so bad!!
Actually, this is the kind of film that an obscure 80s comedy/drama fan might only appreciate (it is probably destined for cult status anyways, even if the following for such is extremely small) because you have to expect (and forgive) a lot of campy cheesiness.
...in September 1986 when I was 13 and caught it on opening weekend - the only weekend it appeared at a theater - because it sucked so bad no one saw it besides me and some others that barely helped it crack that weekend's top 10 grossing film.
But this doesn't mean CURTAINS doesn't have its share of problems because it's Canadian.
This stalking scene is long and seemingly pointless because we never really got to know this woman and her screen time seems truly excessive, compared to the more interesting actors that were just killed.
But with all said and done, the poster is probably the only thing I really like about CURTAINS, a slasher/giallo that's well intended but sorta falls short because of less than gruesome killings, extremely uneven script, a weak killer (with an albeit cool mask) and a chaotic production history.
15-20 minutes into the film i was so distracted by all the people in the house because they were family i made it to the part where he is talking to a guy in a lab with shark things all around him.
All i can say is the film's first half hour is boring, but it has a lot of action, so it is okay, the paragraph above is just to keep you entertained because there isn't a lot to say about this junk, just treasure how bad the film is.
The completely untalented Casper Van Dien stars as a scientist (yeahÂhe sure looks like one) who travels to an African fishing town because the increasing amount of shark attacks there and one of the victims was his old high school buddy Marc.
The director in my opinion should have focused more on the shark attacks because in the movie there isn't enough to satisfy the audience, even though the sharks shown in the movie are actually real and cool to watch, the movie lacks any thrill or scary moments when the main cast actually comes face to face with the sharks.
So that's why I'm giving it two stars, because maybe it got better after that.
I laugh, because I own the DVD and I don't intend to sell this one anytime soon.
Probably because it's Arizona, back in the great eighties!
I recommend this for college type, sitting around on laundry day type comedy , I rated it a 2, because of the classic old scenery.
Then, "Cactus Jack" and Morgan Fairchild, who met for the first time a scant thirty second ago, kiss, because we all know in movies like this, nearly everyone must be coupled off with SOMEONE by the end of the film.
The cast is a laugh because they are mixing good performance with old TV stars that should have retired or just stayed with TV.
As far as the plot goes, it's pretty interesting and is all wrapped up nicely, but because Ward is so terrible and so grating, I don't recommend this film to anyone but those determined to see every film from the series.
The simpleton, Jack Carter, is the one who manages to put it together because everyone else, despite their brilliance, is seemingly unable to solve problems outside their field of science, except a couple of the science characters who happen to be experts in everything and are able to spoon-feed the audience some tech-babble and advance the plot.
It's only given such praise, in my opinion, is because it's one of the few science fiction shows on TV at the moment.
Because it has a monkey, and they always do funny things, not only that Matt LeBlanc is a very funny actor (in "Friends" of course) because here it doesn't work as well as in the sitcom.
I only go off on that tangent to say that Ed is doing a similar thing, but not getting the same kind of recognition for it because it's a few steps ahead of even this time and offers us no crutch of the "mirror stage".
That is, with the no-brow ironic movement starting to wane and with the introduction of the "new sincerity" movement where there is NO shred of irony, this is a very hard movie to place because the intent isn't spelled out for us.
These are three dangerous prongs to dance on, because nobody has time to think about these things except for young adults that play XBOX Live too much.
I had to comment, because this piece of Chimp dung finally replaced "Mannequin 2" as my personal worst movie of all time, as well as replacing "Blame it on the Bellboy" as last movie I physically could not watch all the way through.
I frankly wanted Ed to go nuts and kill everyone, which may be because the last 8 days, I've watched the Halloween films.
.... On second thoughts don`t bother because this is ape sh*t .
Parents love monkeys , children love monkeys , Michael Jackson loves monkeys so lets make a family film about a monkey "  I know films with monkeys can be box office gold like PLANET OF THE APES ( The original one not the dumb remake ) but that`s because it had a great story , or the Clint Eastwood movies with Clyde but that`s because they were funny with great gags ( Many of which involved the hell`s angels ) but there`s nothing here that made me laugh probably because I hate slapstick .
Parents: do your homework before watching some of these "family" films because some of them are the normal crude comedies of today's Hollywood.
Just because Steve McQueen was cool, and is dead, doesn't make everything he did "the Best" Peckinpah made a few good film, but the more i watch them the more I realize that Straw Dogs and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia are his only solid work.
In this video-movie we know Johnny is latently psychic because he repeatedly anticipates an old carnival huckster's game of chance.
And because he always knows where his mother left her glasses.
And because he gets a bad vibe from his mother's new sweetheart.
And because of a prologue where Johnny as a little boy correctly predicts that a hockey teammate is about to fall through the ice.
The movie generates a lot of tension because we never know when the touch of a hand will trigger a new vision.
About the only reason I went to see it was because it had been promoted heavily as a karate movie, and martial arts films were quite big at the time.
In fact, the also deadly serious Billy Jack (1971) made zillions at the box office--not because it was a good film (though it wasn't quite as bad as The Trial of Billy Jack) but because it was a perfect film for the times.
I heartily agree with the choice--but must admit it gets a 2 because it's so darn funny--and it doesn't even intend to be!
This is offensive, not because of the politics, but because of the dishonesty; it's easy to paint everyone opposed to you as a brutal, vicious Fascist, and thus (in theory, anyway) renders any possible argument against the film moot.
I hope they didn't pay him, because I would definitely be asking HIM to give ME money.
All in all, this movie was worth the one star I gave it purely because of the funeral scene.
People getting murdered because of different type of camera ?
This was one game show where maybe 1% of the contestants actually won a single dime... even the winning two contestants because they both give ridiculously fake smiles and both vote Foe.
This show had a short run because so precious few of its contestants ever took home any winnings whatsoever.
Tsuruta Norio's "Kakashi" caught my attention because of the obscure mental association I made with the "Kakashi-Dori" festival held annually in the Kaminoyama-shi city in Yamagata-ken prefecture.
And being a low-budget horror flick, this turkey has a lot of shadowy and nocturnal footage which I had a hard time following because my attention was constantly being diverted to the ever-changing patches of pixels fading in and out.
I began to think part way through the film that the reason that they showed the famous Japanese actor only on video in the movie was because he was unaware he was being filmed.
The dialogue seemed like improvisation, which I hope it was, because nobody should have been paid for it.
But you'll be warned: the effort of going through this clearly stupid and ugly movie will not be rewarded at the end, it will be punished because watching it is VAIN and painful (for any serious film aficionado, that is).
This movie is not really good, because: 1.
Fool female main character which people usually don't like because too weak.
It never really got going and even though the impressive cast do well with a patchy script, you never really believe it because it's clearly bunkum.
The escape is so unlikely but that is conveniently ignored because the plot requires the vigilante to get away.
Trying to ban everyone together, Campbell faces a tough task as these groups hate one another but must put aside their differences because of the greater threat.
His tyranny will only last so long because his brother, Spider(Danny Martinez), has been bitten and is slowly succumbing to the zombie plague sweeping across the city.
You know that with him in charge, the situation will only get worse because if the group doesn't work as a cohesive unit, tempers will flare and violence is certain to occur.
Rarely do you see visible flesh-ripping or cannibalism because the zombies form in massive packs hovering over their victims as we listen to the screams.
It's kind of a shame really, because while watching it, I couldn't help but feel that with a better script and director, this could have been an enjoyable little zombie flick, and that the Urban Horror genre could finally have had a good recent zombie effort.
It's too bad, because a few of the performers brought more to their characters than the script gave them to work with.
John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good job  Now he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)  We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in it  The main problem is actually the storytelling, direction  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined  Ajay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredients  The comedy by Sushant Singh is poor  The film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it further  Direction by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okay  Amongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
Everybody remembers the film simply because it was a fantastic film.
The only reason I saw 'Threat' was because I found out Slug (of the hip hop duo Atmosphere) is in it.
Just because people throw the music you like into a movie doesn't mean it's a good movie.
The first movie is better because...it's the first one.
I rented this so-called film just today from Blockbuster because there's a quote on it reads that it's a cult-classic.
I couldn't finish this film because I got so bored and repulsed watching it, so I don't know how it ends, and frankly I couldn't give a bleeding crap.
My guess is that the only way this film got made was because Lawrence Tierney was the uncle of the writer/director/lead actor of this thing.
De Niro does not rely on his grotesque-looking makeup to give the impression of a troubled creature, but instead embraces and surpasses it with his performance and there were some scenes where I actually felt a little moved because he was so great in the movie.
(7) Victor did NOT just decide not to make the female creature because the creature chose his mother's body!
Please don't be fooled by the title "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" because it's not!
I still have no interest in really reviewing this film, but let me clear up a few erroneous statements from previous reviews:   1) Please don't trash James Whale's 1931 film unless you've actually SEEN it Â all of it, because it's a far superior film to this, bolts and all.
Karloff's make-up was green because when filmed under proper lighting (on B&W film) green make-up looks deadly pale, almost pure white, not because the monster in that film was supposed to be green.
This story will always present challenges for a filmmaker because it's not really horrific as a story by our standards, or by the standards of the 1930s for that matter, hence the bolts.
The concept of putting together body parts is a contemporary consideration because we are now able to achieve this.
Kenneth Brannagh was frankly embarrassing - please God someone stop letting him direct, produce and act in his films because no one can tell him how awful they are.
He was a medical student because of his mothers death, not a random science enthusiast.
I still try not to think about that, because normally I really admire his work.
My husband fell asleep while watching it because he found it so boring.
I'm glad Michael Moore went in a different direction with his career, because it would have been a disaster if he did more like this.
According to Moore's "Adventures in a TV Nation" book, many of the featured actors agreed to make Canadian Bacon because they were shown the TV Nation pilot.
3) When the actor formally know as Rufio (or Bat/Bart if you want to get technical) is pretty brutally killed, he not only makes a cheesy death speak like in Hook, but Ken says something to the effect of "because of you, the village is saved."
--An unintentional comedy because of a stupid story and lame characters.--
I never watched the Anime or read the comics because I am just not into that stuff, but, from what I have read about it, the Anime sounds like it wipes the floor with this poor production.
Which is sad, because the group had many good ideas as well as talent, but went unused.
To sum it up, this movie is clichÃ©, dull and pretentious because it thinks it is everything that it really isn't.
I watched this movie just because of Robert Englund (best known as Freddy Kruger from "Nightmare on ElmStreet"), but I was disappointed!
And if looking at your face made you laugh, then don't go for this movie, because it wont even make you laugh.
"Heartstopper" is never really scary or disturbing because the plot is overly grotesque and incoherent.
It's another of those movies you dislike for not being what you truly expected, and it's because of these movies that people think that the horror genre is trash.
I gave it a 3/10, because it was at least a little bit entertaining and it had a few funny moments.
the girl does not care for the agent because lesbianism isen't her style and therefore sets her goals in taking the agents place as high priestess in the cult.
The second part of the first act has a family killed at gunshot by a gang led by a man named Kevin (Jeremy Northam), who murders these people because they withhold a computer disk containing information that could put every member in prison.
I rated this film a "2" because Sharon Stone wants soooo bad to give a "great", "oscar-winning" type performance.
I just saw this for the second time* and I wasn't going to watch because it scared me the first time.
This was a major issue with this film, because instead of focusing on the underlying themes, I was too caught up in the basic structure of this school.
The twee goings-on advance the preposterous premise that Guy Bennett (based on Guy Burgess) went Commie because he was gay, and was thrown out of school before he got to wear his foppish upper-classmen vest.
This is roughly analogous to saying Guy Bennett became a roadside bandit, a pirate, or an evil scientist because he had a bad experience at Cambridge.
Hopelessly clichÃ©d sentimentality and schmaltz are quite annoying and the film really falls apart in the last third, mostly because of the double-birth scene which is incredibly lame and unfunny, clumsily "written" and directed; the gags in the birth scenes are so bad it's embarrassing to watch.
Is it funny that Julianne Moore packs up and leaves Hugh Grant, slamming the door behind her while he's trying to talk to her, because he's been distant and uninvolved?
all the hate you see in the movie not because of the Islamic clerks control..or the Islamic barbarian nature -as they want you to think-it's simply a reaction for 54 years struggle to get the Palestinian rights back.
I'm not sure how close this is to the book by L.Ron Hubbard, I'm assuming its not very close at all, because quite a lot of the stuff in the film, would SURELY not escape the notice of the original writer, but might slip by the hurried screenplay writer.
Its called Battlefield: Earth, but it might as well have been called Battlefield: USA, because we don't ever get to feel the scope of the destruction of the planet that the title suggests it should.
The only good thing is this film didn't harm Travolta, because it would have been a shame to see him go down again after his resurgence after Pulp Fiction, I think Hollywood saw it as his one indulgence.
The film cost $80 million to make, and you have to question where the money went, because it certainly wasn't lots of mesmerising locations.
I'd be interested to know if the book is as bad as this, if its not, the scriptwriter needs taking out back and shooting, and then make sure they've got plenty of ammo, because they then need to hunt down every person that thought the script was good and worth filming.
I've placed this as a spoiler comment, because the fact that it sucks is the whole film.
This is difficult, because there really isn't that much to say about this movie.
However, I won't go in to details because these are best discovered as you watch.
Even if you show them your "leverage" and they threaten you with a beam weapon, they won't shoot because you have "leverage".
"Vaporize" means to kill or behead, and it's not funny because there is no humor in the future.
I will prove once and for all that all other "Science-Fiction" is nonsense, and incorporate everything I learned from L. Ron Hubbard into my movies which everyone will watch because I am famous.
Everyone will take me seriously because I am famous.
I don't particularly want to because I can still remember it vividly 16 years later.
* special effects are the worst ever, because they pretend to be serious.
If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc.
anywho, Ingrid doesn't believe its over because she thinks Frankie is still on the loose.
Even though i may not be a fan of the movie "Hide and Seek", it actually SHOWED us what happened as opposed to this movie that felt it necessary to give us a 10 minute dialogue because they were too stupid to figure out a way to show it.
because haunts promises ghosts or demons or something.
Surely the ending that every viewer finds so profoundly unsettling only works because the rest of this beautifully crafted film leads us to expect a quite different ending.
I couldn't care less what happened to Ingrid because her performance was as dead as the person she portrays.
I only gave it a 2 rather than a 1 because I watched it all the way through.
only good thing about this movie was Bradley because i connected with him and i feel like him most of the time, though maybe not quite as nice lol.
And when that moment happens, it's scary because of how realistically depicted it is.
It, as well as the rest of the film, is depressing, dark, and somber, and while I wouldn't call it a "twist" (because it really isn't), it's still extremely effective.
This movie does not prove a thing about the wonder of love- just because the girl knew her boyfriend would die but married him anyway- is probably the 100th movie to do this (see 'Love Story', 'Dying Young', or 'My Life').
I have no idea how it ends because after an hour, we gave up and walked out.
I say X because Greg goes through several women in the movie.
A very different movie than any other...the closest thing you can compare it to is Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction" but only because of it's multi-linear story.
I gave Haven a 3 because the soundtrack was good and the acting wasn't horrible.
That's because most of the truly frightening monsters in real life wear clothes just like the rest of us, have normal jobs just like the rest of us and are often living right next door, usually appearing to be ordinary family men and women on the surface.
Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killing cannibal, might have not gotten caught when he did if it weren't for that horrific stench of decaying corpses that permeated from his apartment; because on the surface he looked and acted just like a quiet, ordinary guy.
It works so extraordinarily well because it feels like a documentary, a slice of life of the three main characters, Rex, Saskia and Raymond.
She pops out of her car to figure out what's going on, which is a bad idea because she witnesses a murder!
Also he is teaching there because his friend's daughter (Rebecca Staab) was attacked by the said mobsters.
I think the real problem with this entry is that not only does it stink to high heaven but because there is a lack of action we are forced to watch an anti drug message delivered with all the subtleness of a brick through a window.
He's frightening, not for the typical reasons, but because he plays a weirdly heart-felt character that seems as normal as anyone.
It doesn't even mention that he was an unlicensed electrician or how desperate he was, he just showed up at Generosa's because he heard she might be hiring.
After i couldn't get a ticket for Clerks2 or Silent hill because of the age problem( i am still not 15, not long to go though) so instead i bought a ticket for this film since all the other movies looked quite stupid.
I really wanted to like this movie but half way through the movie i stopped trying to find good points in the movie mainly because there weren't many so overall it's a disappointing movie and i wouldn't recommend anybody to watch it.
Here you have an unlikeable Asian character who has a "chip on her shoulder" because the "white man" won't let her in the film industry.
How would he feel if people thought every Jew in the industry is working because of nepotism.
Or maybe people simply aren't sending him any good scripts because they have realized he cannot act.
Regardless, I cannot in good conscience give a full review of this film, since it was so horrid that i turned it off 40 minutes in to watch Meerkat Manor...because it has better acting and a better story.
I only watched it because the reviewer before me said there was comedy in here, but I failed to spot anything, and I mean anything funny - at all.
But most of all, I miss this show because of the possibilities that would have been opened up had Fox not pulled the plug and showed a bit more moxie.
Yes, 3 hours, because I had to keep going back from the beginning to see if maybe I had missed something.
I am really unable to give a summary because this movie jumps around from scene to scene.
But because the whole thing is so dull and listless, any attempt at social commentary is wasted--if it was even attempted in the first place.
After taking a single injection of the serum himself, he then decides to woo Linda on a date, lays a big line on her about not wanting her "professional services" and simply wanting her company, and then he reveals that it was all because he wants her to allow him to inject her with the serum.
I watched this film because I am, at times, a film masochist.
Some poor films and most soaps are watchable because of an attractive cast; this one lacks even that, other than Preston Hanson and Patch Mackenzie.
She recreated Marilyn Monroe's poses for the magazine and I wanted to see the movie because of it.
He grasps at straws in desperation as very little can be done because few clues or leads exist.
Billy the Kid was an insignificant, unremarkable, pimply-faced, orthodontia-challenged 21-year-old thug that is remembered today because the New Mexico Department of Tourism spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to make sure that we do.
And that is the right word, because a movie like The Vanishing is not just watched-it is experienced.
Frankly, I'm a fan of both sub-genres and still hated this, because it's still a ripoff, and as such, rates a 4.4/10 from...  the Fiend :.
Last years academy awards was a classic year because ...  A ) Steve Martin was a brilliant host and   B) There were some shock winners   This year`s awards were very boring because ...  A ) Billy Crystal wasn`t as good as Steve Martin and   B ) There were no shock winners   Before everyone writes an angry private message to me I will point out that in no way was Crystal bad it`s just that I didn`t find him all that good apart from his New Zealand one liners and his plea to Bill Murray not to walk out .
All the Lord of the Rings New Zealand jokes were rather lame and I don't think Return of the King deserved to win all of those; it just did a clean sweep because it's a well-made, huge-budgeted and fantastically-promoted blockbuster.
The camera guy was terrible because he doesn't know what a polarizer filter is for,and the lighting was bad at the bar scene that I had to increase the brightness on my TV.
I tried my best to enjoy the movie because I love a good werewolf story.
I love horror movies and when this came out I was determined to watch it because I live only 40 minutes down the I system from Bray Road.
(1) I figured out about halfway through the movie who they were going to identify as the werewolf, even though it made absolutely no sense because the person (who shall remain nameless in this review for fear of spoiling the "suspense" for others) did seem otherwise occupied during several of the attacks.
Unfortunately, I saw this and have remembered it these nearly 30 years - but only because it was so God awful.
The effects sequence in Cedar's office where the floors twist is a show-stopping highlight because it is just so eye-openingly farcical.
I think all who participated in this should have had electro-shock therapy, because they were certifiably insane.
So, not that I don't think the guy has talent, but it's kind of hard to take him seriously as a Native American medicine man, because when I look at him, all I can see is the Klingon General Kang, whom he played in the STAR TREK: TOS episode "Day Of The Dove."
Yeah, I still have a soft spot in my heart for flicks like this, because without them, I wouldn't be the salivating, drooling horror/sci-fi/fantasy geek I am today.
The greasy little monster that crawls out of Susan Strasberg's back is a powerful shrimp (shrunken and disfigured because of the multiple X-Rays done when trying to figure out what was going on with this goiter gone bad).
I give this a ranking of 2 out of ten because of the fact that it offers a lot of unintentional laughs.
They come together because they don't have a life on their own.
Iris, Margaret, Paula and Jane, form a bond because they find safety in numbers.
Iris is the one that stays the longer and she is the one that discovers the mystery of the missing things in the office, but alas, it's too late, because at that time she leaves the temp job.
(I did because some nutcases recommended me this movie)   Watch a tom and jerry episode,funny videos or even old photo albums.Try to miss this movie by all means.Otherwise you will repent on doing a life-time mistake.
Towards my point of view this film sure gonna loose some money because Simbhu spent more that he should.
The title will fool you(at least the U.S. released video title-Cry of a Prostitute) because this movie has very little to do about a prostitute except that she is a minor character that pretends to be the wife of one of the many `Don's' in this movie.
Now, some find that entertaining, because its not as lily white and pristine as, let's say, "The Bachelor" or "The Bachlorette" but did they have to go ALL the way to the other side of the spectrum and drag out the alley cats??!?
This is true because after watching this, no woman with any self respect would degrade herself this way.
Maybe the 'love' of paying doctor bills because just looking at these women through the TV makes me want to get preventative disease shots.
I feel like I want to puke because he's so not funny, his jokes and repeating words have gotten old, and he just goes on and on about crap that nobody cares about.
Not because of the story, music, humour... No.
It would be impossible to write a spoiler because by the end you couldn't care less what happens.
this movie reminds me of a chinese fantasy movie because of Shadow  Shadow depicts the same character in that fantasy movie as he is armless and carries an identical mask to cover his face and his fighting style is based on footwork and his ponytail.
In fact, I would not even classify such scenes as "action sequences" because the concept of "action" demands that someone actually DO something.
It's a shame because some of biggest laughs I ever had in my life came from listening to the Howard Stern radio show which Artie helped tremendously when he was added to the show, but the comedy involved in Howard's show wasn't stale one-liners that fell flat.
This sells because of Howard Stern.
It has been commercialized like crazy because Artie Lange is a part of the Howard's show on Sirius Satellite Radio.
not because he is arrogant, pompous or such.
lol 2 out of 10...got the 2 because of Mike Myres's small part.
I only grabbed this one because Christina Lindberg (of THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE and SEX AND FURY fame) is in it, and I've got a serious hard-on for that chick.
It is truly astonishing how a film as formulaic and trite as VIEW FROM THE TOP managed to get on board such a cast of Hollywood big-hitters and near big-hitters (Gwyneth Paltrow,Mike Myers,Kelly Preston,Christina Applegate,Candice Bergen,Mike Ruffalo),because in essence it is little better than a slightly (but only slightly) above average TV movie in it's plotting,production values,direction and performances.
And Christina Applegate's acting style fit in on Married with Children, but that's because she was SUPPOSED to act poorly.
Maybe because Gwyneth looks good.
The first "Urban Legends" movies was fair (worth 5), because it was just like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" movie and at that time, that kind of movies was popular.
Acting was fair, because some actors trying to be more real in this movie.
I don't understand whats happened, because it was really boring.
The director doesn't know a good story, because this film does NOT have one.
I had never heard of this film because I'm 100% positive it did not get onto screens in the UK and now i see why!
Sorry for me being so negative but i seriously suggest that no one put themselves through the 2 hrs of this movie because i would rather stare at my ceiling than watch that film.
I love Urban Legends quite simply because it is from the Scream era when all teen slash horrors were worth watching, even the rubbish ones.
I't wasn't scary but it had some memorable scenes like a ring finger in a beer bottle and a guy even gets electrocuted to death because he wizzes on a high voltage sign.
Don't think it's anything like the first Urban Legend because it's not.
For example, a subplot early in the film where the jocks suspect a character of seeking revenge because of a prank just went nowhere and was forgotten after a few minutes.
Two stars because hottie Patrick Labyroteaux actually adds a bit of humor.
There is no way in hell Xander, Willow and Giles would completely turn against Buffy and basicalyl depose her just because they think her in a certain situation plan isn't sound.
I can see why the Scoobies were not thrilled by the plan but there is a world of difference between "this plan is no good" and "Buffy, you are no good because your previous plan was the same and it failed".
I don't know whether this was done because of budget constraints, or pure laziness, but i was really upset with this effort.
I stress online because when was the internet ever like what it is in this movie?
The time line of the movie makes little sense, but thats OK because the script is so bad, the characters are so poorly done and the execution of the film is so bad that you'll be screaming for someone to hand you the remote before one more minute of this clichÃ© ridden, badly written waste of disc space goes by.
Well, expense couldn't have been an issue because you can tell by the grainy effects that it was filmed on digital cameras.
This movie made me angry not because it was really bad, almost all zombie movies are bad, but because it just ripped and ripped and ripped off Romero's movies without as much as a wink.
Too bad he was killed, because the writers (even though none are credited... surprise surprise) cannot think up a good story.
That's okay, though, see, because everything else about this movie is just as godawful.
Whoever made this ( i don't want to call it a movie because i don't think its even worthy of that) video recording of these so called actors did so because I believe they want to tell people that they are actors and have been in a movie.
This video is not even worthy of a rating because its not even a movie.
By the way if anyone who was in this movie can read this review, I hope you have luck finding a job, i know the reason why you probably made this video is because the economy is bad and you must be one on those people that got laid off from the peanut factory.
i wish axlerod would've been the bad guy because that is an awesome name for a villain.
And that's another thing, the script sucks because all it did was rip off Romero.
And because there were so many randoms in this movie it made it hard to even follow who some of the main characters were (i.e.
This movie got my attention because its producer claimed it'd compete for Oscar foreign language film along with the Banquet and Curse of the Golden Flower, another two big budget Chinese films.
This anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and OVA.
Micah was probably my favorite character because he was the bad guy and you finally want him to win because you get so sick of the "protagonists".
Of course this film is corny because it is all about corn Thought that there were only one or two good scenes for example micah (bollman) is in Church and has a wooden doll and knife there is someone sitting across from him then micah starts putting the knife up the doll's nose and the guy across from him nose starts to bleed then micah keeps on doing it until the guy dies and the other good part is when micah dies.
Maybe I was putting too much thought into this segment because yet again this is a scene ruined by cheesy references to other films.
I read a comment earlier about this movie being great because it was realistic and did not make up some crazy fantastical ending.
I'll try to be nice and say that the actors are all good, because they are, but there's no story here!
That's it - no need to see the movie because not much else happens.
I just dont have to much to say about this because it left me bored.
You mention that the scene where the old man runs screaming through the trees is supposed to be funny, well i didn't know that when watching because that guys acting skills made me believe that was his best attempt at being terrified.
My whole reason for writing this response was because i read the previous one and I completely disagreed with it and I wanted to warn people it would probably be a mistake seeing the movie.
We rented it just because we saw that Leif Garrett was one of the stars -- and he's just as believable as a horny high schooler as the fact that you will never guess who the killer is!
For example, the research couldn't be done on butterflies because they wouldn't pose a threat to any country--hello, the Dept.of Defense financed the study.
The murders only occur halfway through the film because the opening is too busy playing out the fat guy pranks!
Too bad, because "Dream Demon" definitely has style!
D'abo and A1 do the nasty (in an old hotel it appears) and they have a laugh about it, probably because they were rubbish and then luckily room service arrives and it's Meek.
I had to watch the ending a couple of times because I kept nodding off.
In fact, the only reason I saw this movie was because it was on a DVD with Moon of the Wolf.
Lucy took this role because she thought it would be fun, and "good Sunday night fare".
She did not take it because as one person has said 'she needs the money'.
I watched this movie because I like several of the actors, including Madsen and Shannyn Sossamon.
That's because the sound is too hard to hear clearly, and the picture is very murky.
The cute female lead, an illegal Mexican immigrant, robs a gas station, but we are supposed to sympathize with her because this is "for a good cause".
By the time I watched half of it, I thought it was an avant-garde movie because it also seemed so naive, but the directors were clearly striving for a typical, joyful Christmas film.
So the movie is about this psychic who we know for all of 5 minutes as she's quickly murdered by somebody because she knows that person committed murder.
because the real killer is his mom!
The reasoning behind that is that several decades ago she killed her husband because....he...wanted to take her to the doctor to get mental help.
And then she gets her head cut off because she was wearing gaudy jewelry.
For instance, the black guy doesn't want to work with Treat Williams because he heard that Treat was a 'fecal eater' (a fact that doesn't exactly advance the plot) in prison.
The job gets botched because...if it didn't, there would be no movie.
No one accepts these tickets because...well, if they did, the filmmakers wouldn't be able to show us the various ways these people get tortured and killed by assassain Steve (have they made a movie without me yet?)
There are some interesting character actors who do good in their roles mainly because they don't take themselves or their characters too seriously.
Its a shame because if this had been directed and scripted in more of a unique way, it could have brought back feelings of the old B movies about bugs etc.
At the end, she drives what must be hundreds of miles to private property just because she thinks he might miss a female dog on the farm...that makes no sense.
The final moment when Harmonica's flashback is completed in Once Upon A Time In The West is such a gob-smacker in its original form that smart directors know not to try and ape because it was more than just a means to an end.
I hope no female viewer will memorize that move, because it will not work at all but even put her in greater danger.
I've only given this two stars because the romantic lead couple were actually quite good.
It's a shame because in a time of torture porn they could have made a classic one.
I found it hysterical at first because it seemed almost natural the way it was spoken, but then it becomes totally repetitive and soon falls apart when the killer finally shows up.
I give this film one star, because it is simply the worst film I haver ever seen.
The only reason that this show is still being aired is because half of Norways population is youngsters and oldies, who does not understand English or manage to read the subtitles fast enough, and there's no other shows to watch in Norwegian(Okey, you have the sucky sitcoms).
I couldn't rent it because they didn't have it, probably because it was so terrible!
Maybe the writers should have skipped the whole thing about demonizing the military, because they didn't have any better solution themselves?
But I just watched it and I'm hoping for that hour and a half back because this was a pretty sad movie.
The first film is so cool because the first half is a gangster film, and then it just changes into a vampire film.
The plot ends right there, because it turns just into a "killing vampire festival" with awful special effects and no great interest, at least for me!
Lucy Lawless was outstanding as Dr. Maddie Rierdon, a woman who is both intelligent and resourceful and who, because of who she is, has to put the welfare of those endangered by the locusts before her relationship with her husband.
I just finished re-watching the entire series on DVD a few days ago, and it gave me a definite impression of nausea this time: to be more specific, I think that seasons 1 & 2 had potential, interesting ideas, but the problem is that from season 3, the series went completely off-focus, and should have been renamed "Waiting for the new Messiah", because the plot evolved endlessly around two things: Jordan Collier and his f*****g promicine, and how "great" the world would be with the possibilities it could provide.
I still give the show three stars, because of the soundtracks.
It's a shame, because this could have been a great SF.
Such a belief is akin to touting grass growing as breakthrough cinema just because it's being broadcasted in HD.
Though I gave it a 2/10, because this is probably the most accurate movie ever made that was based on the story.
It's obvious they did not use a military consultant, or if they did, the producers were taken for a long ride, because there was next to nothing accurate about the portrayal of things military.
Okay first I will give you a little run down I first rented this movie because I thought I heard good things about this movie.
I turned it of when the SS officer in full uniform runs through a British platoon to get to a truck and gets away with it just after he says to his side kick we will use the artillery as cover, because artillery good for that.
It's such a shame because with today's special effects they could make a great WW2 film as special after Band of Brothers think of all the different places the battles took place.
I can't really comment on the quality of the acting, because I think it is impossible for an actor to turn in a good performance when he/she is given nothing to work with.
With the exception of Billy Zane and Michael Madsen there are no big names here and in many ways that is a good thing because the two stars are the weakest characters.
The only reason that I'm giving it a four is because the Locusts actually look really good when grouped up and close-ups are real Locusts.
I can't say anymore about this film because my head is starting to hurt and I'm afraid my brain will explode.
Bryon and Cathy break up because Bryon calls M&M a F**king retard.
In the case of the Matt Helm series it was obviously a still birth   THE AMBUSHERS is an awful movie not only because of its Bond wannabe format but because it`s woefully made .
Part of this is because Dean Martin appears to be sleeping through the pictures.
Harry obviously thought so, though I am inclined to say no...just because there are more than 50 worse films out there--probably several hundred, actually.
Salmi did vile and disgusting things to pilot Janice Rule upon her capture because, well he's Albert Salmi.
Oh by the way, they need Rule because the satellite can't be flown by a man.
Dino walked through this one as did the rest of the cast which looks bored, but also eager because the Matt Helm films did make money back in the day.
I've had to pad this out because of the rules but my summary would be: Quite boring with no resolution (yep - I'm one of those who likes a real ending!
The dialogue was forced, the direction was slow and probably because the locusts were CGI based they didn't even begin to bring me out in even a Luke warm sweat.
I give this 4/10 and that is only because of Lucy Lawless.I will always be a Lucy Lawless fan and anything she is in deserves some sort of score.
i hardly know the names of the characters because they were barely mentioned.
And why was this movie rated R, because only one person did in a not so bloody way and not so much cursing in this movie.
Al I'm saying is don't make more Puppet Master movies because after part 4 if was boring, stupid, and pointless.
If another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause.
I must admit, I only turned on this movie because of how hot Jane McGregor and Piper Perabo are, and that's the only reason I watched it all the way through.
I say it's implausible for no reason, because it wasn't very entertaining.
I gave this movie 7 out of ten stars, only because of the performance of Lawless.
In fact, I felt worse because I had just wasted nearly two hours of my life.
But that's because it was so boring, I could only take it in 20 minute snippets.
The reason I continued watching it is because as bad as the movie was, Sean Penn was excellent.
I got this movie because I saw the trailer.
I try to classify movies as they manage to get what they want, example: John Woo's a better tomorrow is far better than The Matrix, just because, even though a better tomorrow is just about nonstoping action, unfolds in its essence something deeper, and it amuses at 100%, meanwhile The Matrix, tries to get you into a new level of action cinema, tries to do a more reflective exercise in the audience, and that's something impossible to get just by splatting on, between gun shots, the basics of the Platon theories (the myth of the cavern).
You know they are critical to the war effort because the spies say they are worth ten armored divisions.
concluded: 1) Many articles cited in support of the film contain assertions unsupported by any data, 2) In those articles that do contain research data, the data "fail to support the film's contentions, and strongly suggest contrary conclusions," 3) Two key figures in the film have made statements that raise serious questions about their ability to be objective: GWU Law Prof. Joan Meier is reported to have described herself in writing as among those "who start with an advocate's perspective," as opposed to a "neutral" perspective, and Lundy Bancroft is reported to have boasted that he was fired by the Massachusetts family courts as a domestic violence educator because of his extreme views.
On The third of November 2004, Muslim extremists assassinated director Theo Van Gogh because of his inglorious portrayals of their culture and beliefs.
This is a complete failure and I don't really feel obliged to give it more praise simply because the maker is death.
The ending is not surprising because the people in charge forgot to introduce other characters who may be the suspects so that leavesÂÂÂÂ.well, I'll let you figure it out.
The whole plot is a kid becomes a mass murderer because his dad didn't spend enough time with him.
And convince others who are sad to murder also, because people were mean to them.
He tells his brother he must do this because he is gay and that he doesn't deserve to live in this world.
One of the "horsemen" as a gay character with a big brother so redneck and devoid of familial feeling that it almost went beyond belief, and who the gay character ended up disemboweling himself in front of because of his brother's rejection.
Verdict: This is not the movie that's worth watching because it's too bad, it hurts and insult your intelligence, and by don't watching it, you will save yourself for having Zhang's performance in your mind.
Not really sure who this is supposed to appeal to: either parents of Columbine-type nutjobs who can be reassured that their poor parenting skills are understandable because they're explained IN THE BIBLE or misunderstood youth who feel neglected by Mommy and Daddy, so it's okay if they act out a Marilyn Manson video.
Several young people share an apartment, joined together by Rae Dawn Chong's character, MJ (that in itself should be a tipoff because I cannot remember a Chong movie post-Commando).
I think I laughed once during this movie, when someone made a remark about the "Lambada", and even then, I was only laughing because I kind of knew what the lambada was.
So, Capitan no fun and his gang of merry thugs wage war (somewhere in there) and vow to get them kicked out of the camp, because they're really stealing their thunder.
They attempted to put a story in there and follow it, although they didn't and the characters had to state the obvious intermittently in the film because they obviously weren't devoting much camera time to it.
i wonder how the producers conned these actors into working in this movie either that, or they accepted because they were too lazy to read the script there is nothing redeemable about this movie, take my word for it.
Ian McCellan gives a stellar performance, but otherwise this film is rendered almost unwatchable because of the performances of Aaron Eckhardt and Britney Murphy, and most of all, because of the insufferable/clichÃ©d writing, which makes every effort to pull at our heartstrings.
Trite, because it follows a classical outline: meeting, love affair, misunderstanding, separation and reconciliation.
The message is loud and clear: working class people are happier than the guys with all the money, because their emotional lives are purer and not spoiled by capitalist values.
When she's supposed to be acting turned on because Gomez speaks french, she looks as if she's about to puke.
I would've loved to have heard Curry sing, for he has a great singing voice, because Raul Julia sang a Mamooshka in the first movie.
I was in junior high school when Liza won Best Actress for her tour de force as Sally Bowles Â I was furious because I felt that Diana Ross got robbed.
She tries so hard to imitate the fey-like quality that Anjelica Huston brought to the character that I almost pity her because she overdoes it.
Now I know they had to get rid of the kids from the first two, because as you can see Wednesday who was played by Christina Ricci in the first two is now an adult, making movies like Sleeping Hollow.
Me and my friend, against the other friend's will, demanded this off about halfway through because it was so bad and wrong.
It's quite unfortunate that his wife is an idiot who doesn't get the kids out of town because she thinks it's 'crazy' (in spite of the fact that people constantly melt in her lovely hometown)...  "We All Scream For Ice Cream" may have some qualities (very few, to be honest).
But most importantly is a new character named "Ghost" (presumably because she's almost like an albino) who is fascinated with the occult and death and befriends Bridget after finding out she might be a werewolf.
I can finally say that I'm cured, I can recognize junk from miles away  All thanks to "The Last Samurai", which I will never forget  Fidel PolvorÃ³n   PS1: this is based on a true story... in fact, it's 100% a true story   PS2: I gave it 4/10, just because Ken Watanabe, Art and Costumes
Is it because they were stripped of their titles of nobility?
Or because they were no longer permitted to carry swords?
Or because they lost their government stipends?
Perhaps because Saigo Takamori wasn't allowed to invade Korea?
We don't know, because the movie mentions none of these things, choosing instead to depict the restriction against ponytails while reiterating that "Japan is losing its way."
The only surprise is that Algren manages to get into a romance with a Japanese lady, which is only surprising because you would not expect the writers to insert such a standard thing into a story that does not suit it at all.
Japan was smart to modernize and adopt western practices of war, because if they hadn't they would have probably been conquered and colonized by the more technologically advanced western countries of the time.
Better if Warners had assigned Busby Berkeley to choreograph and/or direct, because the dance numbers are a very weak imitation of Berkeley's style without the interesting camera angles.
Nothing feels real because of Francesca Joseph's implausible screenplay and her own direction, which doesn't make much sense.
Which is a problem because this is not meant to be a comedy.
It's a frustrating movie to watch because it started with such promise and then just does not work at all.
Later Pam loses her job because of her drug use.
Sometimes it looked like he was giving a decent performance when he was yelling, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was really yelling because he was sorry he got stuck making such a horrible and worthless movie.
Granted, there is an inconsistency because the whole mess started with Chucky writing bad words on Andy's paper about the teacher, but she was just so unlikeable to begin with.
I think just for the sake that I saw the first one and something must have been special because I am curious how the series goes.
The scene gives you cold shivers, because the emotional impact is quite scary.
Chucky did not deserve to have a horror series because in my opinion he's one of the worst horror icons since the evil killer Leprechaun.
I recommend who ever reads this go and see child's play 1 but you have to buy it because it is banned and its rare to get hold of in hired shops especial in england.
I notice that because he didn't explain nothing at all about it he changed everything the main characters from the 1st one should have been in the second one.
Plus after seeing the last 4 you will find they are boring I recommend to just see the 1st child's play because the 1st was superb
Some sequences are genuinely hard to sit through because of Lafia's staging.
I'm a huge horror fan and really wanted to like this (because of Robert Englund) but I couldn't.
Otherwise throughout the whole movie we don't know who's the hero or who's the villian because everyone is so stupid that no one even cares.
People will rent this movie because it is directed by freddy krueger himself.....
With reason, because rebellious teenager Spike and his nerdy cousin Hoax frequently call the titular phone number to get their daily "horrorscope".
He doesn't mind, though, because now he can finally fight back against his domineering mother, the school bullies and all the girls that rejected and laughed at him.
Quite seriously, I wish I could because I loved the first Pumpkinhead so much.
I'm actually at a loss right now because I don't know if this or Boogeyman is worse.
After Pumpkinhead is resurrected you might as well turn off your DVD player (or if you're old school, VHS player) and turn the movie into a novelty flying disc because then at least you can say that it's a GOOD movie (trust me, it glides real nice and cuts air like a hot knife through butter).
If you remember how the first Pumpkinhead ended your gonna be on angry mofo because there's a very special something taken out that made the Pumpkinhead villain so unique.
Rather use it as a clay pigeon, use it as a frisbee golf disc, or use it for self mutilation because you're gonna be wondering why you let this movie finish.
Perhaps I am just missing something or perhaps it's because I've seen other films about the Nazi period in Germany that just seemed better.
Or, perhaps it's because I preferred the parts of the film where they were NOT singing--for as a musical, it's songs aren't all that memorable.
I assume that part of this was because with three nominees for Best Supporting Actor from THE GODFATHER, the three actors split their votes--allowing the unusual performance by Grey to grab the trophy.
She plays Marcie, part of the town bad-a** crew, and she knows a great deal about witchcraft; because one of these dim wits really NEEDS to be smart enough in the field of witchery to resurrect a dead person; the movie calls for it.
People just don't behave like this & yes I accept the 'it's only a film' argument but this was meant to be a serious credible horror film set in reality with 'real' people, don't make me laugh because Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings is anything but.
Even the good looking monster comes across as often being ridicules, mainly because he too often gets featured too prominently.
It's formulaic, uninteresting and just dragging too much in parts because it doesn't seem to be able to make choices.
In fact, all it takes for her to see the light in mitchum's soul is to see him shell civilian refugees into kibble then justify it because 'half' of them were communist infiltrators anyway.
Let's just kick ass and shut up the pansy eggheads with a kiss, because we're the real men and war is necessary everywhere all the time.
He has a bit of a queasy stomach after slaughtering a bunch of civilian refugees because a few Communist infiltrators were hiding among them, but even his initially outraged girlfriend comes to see that "even a doctor amputating a leg has to cut off some good flesh with the bad," and pretty soon, this mini-My Lai is forgotten (without anyone apparently considering whether a wiser choice than massacre might have existed).
And though not included in highschool history texts, there was considerable sympathy for the North from the peasantry of the South because of the landlord-dominated government of the South, many of which had collaborated with hated Japanese occupiers during WWII.
I was disappointed when I saw this movie in 1954, probably because I was expecting more "ancient Egypt stuff."
This is not a horror because it is not scary, not a pyschological thriller because it has no real psychology or thrills, it is bad just bad that is it.
Most psychs become one because there's nothing easier in college.
It's worth a look, the musical numbers are great but the plot somehow meanders, and is only of real interest because of the looming Nazi undertones.
Honestly do not even think about renting because of Dennis Hopper's reputation.
Sure he is the reason she had an abortion and there is an attempt at saying "she's the one because of it" but that could have been time better spent on the character of Mowatt himself.
because as horrible as Hannibal Lechter is, you come to care about him a bit.
Pointless, confusing ending (she was the one who was supposed to be able to kill him because she had an abortion??
It actually hurts to write the following review because it pretty much admits I'm a superficial person who was suckered into watching a movie that was stashed in the box and write-up of a much more interesting looking film.
The entire film is like a punchline and it's all because of the leading lady, who has no rightful place in popular culture except the subject of catty jokes in shows like "Queer as Folk," "Queer Duck," and "Will & Grace."
First in part 2, because of the ozon-thing and in part 3 they mention that his wife had to be scraped of off the road in Scotland somewhere.
However, this movie deserves a special place in the realm of modern disasters in the film industry, because as a sequel it is absolutely abysmal, out of place, and an utter disgrace to the first one (and to the whole series, which never recovered after the atom-bomb that this movie dropped on the plot).
(e.g., that ten-times overlong train scene ... we'd already figured out that Ironside's character was a nutcase, thank you ever so)  I don't give 1s except to the very worst films of all, but this movie deserves it, if only because the producers and directors ought to have known better.
This movie should thank God for "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", because that's the only thing that's keeping it off the bottom of the list.
I'm still not sure why they apparently have gotten rid of jet engines, but apparently they have, because there they are, flying across the Atlantic in a small turboprop.
It's because of that, that one cannot speak of this role without mentioning the sparkling Liza.
He even walked out of the premiere within 15 minutes because he was so disgusted with what the movie company did.
It may have some laughable details in the depiction of the swords, such as swords being able to hack through steel girders, but I can forgive these silly little details in the original movie, because it is such great fun to watch.
Even Christopher Lambert threatened to quit during the making of the movie, because it was so bad.
The Renegade Edition of Highlander 2 is quite different from The Quickening, because the original director went back, and completely re-edited the film, restoring it as closely as possible to the way he had originally intended for it to be, as opposed to The Quickening, which had been heavily meddled with by various people within the studio that produced the film.
Without wasting pages of words, "Cabaret" failed because of the sloppy editing, the poorly developed historical slant, and due to the massive disappointment from the actors.
In theory, this would be a great idea Â but it failed because of again, the lack of focus with our characters.
"Cabaret" failed because there was nothing for the audience to hold onto.
It is impossible to follow the events in this film, not just due to the abysmal plot, but also because if you look at the screen for too long, you find your retina burning inside your skull.
I can actually enjoy movies purely because they stink.
So although McCloud was originally born in Scotland and Ramierez in er, Egypt, now they were aliens from a planet called Zeist; handy, because this new ancestry meant that all that was needed to reengergise the concept was that another visitor showed up on Earth and the games can begin again.
We can only imagine that the owners of the original film were desperate for more because nothing but desperation could possibly explain how this made it to the screen.
I know there are some die hard fans of this show out there, but don't think just because someone doesn't like the show doesn't mean they don't get it.
And that is where the show fails because at the end of the day its even more vapid and than the conventions it is trying to satirize.
Don't try to coax me with "It is what it is" and any other self-serving explanation because you want to find brilliance in something you like (which blinds the ability to objectively comment on how good something really is).
Just because something is controversial doesn't make it brilliant.
Just because something isn't mainstream doesn't mean it's good.
Just because something like this is weird doesn't make it good.
Just because someone doesn't like this doesn't mean they watch Friends or Two and a Half Men.
Just because something polarises people doesn't make it art.
The series is filled with just a bunch of random things happening that are supposed to be funny just because they're random.
one of the inner story's is on four girls looking for a place that they can get into, because of their young age, after failing in that, they are find themselves in the "bad part of town", well that just could be a real cool story, but that bad part of town, isn't really as you might expect, it's just a typical warehouse area.
So if you find yourself watching this for whatever reason, just keep telling yourself to stick around, because the ending really pays off.
I write this review because I love the comedies of all sorts and I was completely disappointed with this film.
I mention this because the film seems much more interested in ideas than it is in any real action.
It's undefinable as a genre because it works as a musical, as drama, as a comedy, as a war movie, as a social satire, as a historical epic, as a masterpiece of cinematic choreography, AND THE LIST GOES ON.
This gives the movie a certain realistic feeling but unfortunately, this does not endorse the story, simply because there is no story, no real plot, no evolution in it.
This film was not able to touch me (the attempt of being emotionally touching was way too obvious), it was not intellectually challenging (the message is simple and mundane), it was never funny and there was no real tension because it was very slow and the film leaves the public absolutely uninformed about the odds for some plot change.
I only kept watching because I assumed it would get better---it didn't.
If you're a shallow, worthless Hollywood cult worshiper, you may find this lousy piece of cinematic trash worthy viewing because you hear the name of someone who knows somebody who knows someone who once may have heard of you mentioned.
Obviously whoever made this movie has some friends in high places because I have no idea who would think making this movie was a good idea.
We get it, but we're only laughing because of who's telling the joke--not who wrote it, and certainly not because of the joke itself.
2/10, and that's only because I smiled when Bill Murray drank straight from the pot.
If you actually liked this movie, I would love to talk to you, because you are just kidding yourself.
You think it's cool to like movies that you don't understand, when really you don't understand them because they are crap and there's nothing there to understand.
Here is a summary of Coffee and Cigarettes:  The movie opens and it is shot in that terrible teen angst black and white that kids who can't take pictures like to photoshop their digital photos into because they think it will salvage an otherwise crappy color photo.
Then, Jack should quote Tesla about the world being a conductor of audiophonic harmony or some shit because he's a musician.
'Cabaret' is an exciting place for music...  'Cabaret' is the first musical to exploit the notion that life is fascinating because it is ambiguous...   'Cabaret' uses music in an exciting new way... His characters do not disintegrate into song to express their emotions... Rather, a sleazy night club becomes a place where satirical comment on the lives and problems of these characters is made in striking, entertaining, and often in ferocious dances and songs...  'Cabaret' is only one of three major elements that remains separate in the film and then gradually and inexorably become melted into one...
Episode 3, wisely re-named the Horror Show, was an exception because it starred the great actor Brion James (may he rest in peace) He made this film enjoyable and also the story had more horror in it.
A lot of those guys will tell you to watch this film because of the good and original story !!
Well by now I have really gotten over it.It doesn't matter anymore because the film works so well without the other songs,I feel it has everything essential from the stage version,which I have never even seen btw,yet anyway.
Whoever decided to go through with the production of this must have been severely kicked in the head by an angry mule or something because, otherwise, there was absolutely no reason for this nonsense...
The reason I did not give this film 1 out of 10 is because it did have some moments of comedy, both physically and verbally.
And of course, director of this genre must understand that retro films are stylized genre in the end, because naive admiration of the past may easily turn into a conservative, nationalistic political manifesto(Really the campaign for this film's domestic sales,including DVD release, gradually have got such nuance, saying "We are happy to have been born in Japan"!).
When i heard of this movie, it was very promising,like Bangkok dangerous or sort of.But hell no.The movie begins confusing and you actually don't get the right idea of the characters.The the plot goes even more confusing at the concert and keeps it's way of lame events all the way to the end.The boss-fight at the end is total OMG the collateral dmg guy was supposed to use some kind of sharp weapon not a kung fu pan.For those who don't know there are a lot of way cooler weapons in kung fu.By the way i've always thought that the evil mean guy in any movie shouldn't do kung fu, because it's kinda a defensive matrial art and it's philosophy is quite calming and purifying and he is a f**king psycho.The ending is lame as expected.I was expecting some kind of Big Hit ending where "main" hero was supposed to grab the girl after dealing with the mean dude, but no the makers of this had better idea:she keeps on singing some sappy pop-trash and he is somewhere.Rofl really...
City life is unbearable, so kill yourself if you live in a city, because you are pathetic and realize!
I put a question mark after spoiler alert because the fact that they off themselves in the end wasn't particularly shocking.
Why,simply because absurdity lacks the ability to solicit emotions from others in a vacuum of characters.
Bleak, emotionally dead people (seriously some of the lamest, unsympathetic characters I have ever seen) commit suicide because the boring, repetitive motions of their daily lives that the director chooses to show us are boring and repetitive.
I fully understand someone can argue the idea it was so plodding and boring is because it's a film detailing how monotonous a life in the 21st century can get.
Don't even bother to turn on subtitles because most of the dialog is just "heh baby" or "heh sweetheart".
"Cabaret" is an exception because it has an interesting background and storyline, and the music-hall performances are cleverly used here to illustrate and emphasize the plot.
Guest: because you are not funny, and never have been, yet you insist on telling people you are hilarious and that "The Mask 2" was not this generation's "Ishtar".
Guest: because everything you've ever done is painful to watch, and just basically sucks on ice.
Admittedly i watched this because i was expecting from the reviews a funny movie/documentary,so is probably my own fault for expecting something its (presumably) not trying to be.
(this is NOT by the way a criticism of the movie,its just a comment in the hope that someone else does not assume like i did that its intentionally supposed to be funny-least i hope its not,because it is'nt lol)
does a bad job, are they justified in telling you not to complain because they're still better than you?
So when this was aired, all my friends told me to watch it, because it was really good.
I can imagine the pain of these people, but please don't put Christianity and the Bible on it because it has nothing to do with the Bible.
Or is it because the game is so good?
movies because since they do not have the budget for big explosions and special effects, they spend time making movies that make you think, movies with soul, movies worth watching and remembering.
I hate this movie as much as I hate midnight express because it does not serve a useful purpose except for making it harder for different cultures to know each other and get along.
I'm almost positive the person who wrote the review "Queer Duck Rules" had some hand in the production of this film, because this was just junk.
I checked it out because I saw that it was written by a former Simpsons writer, and had Conan as a guest voice...how could that not be funny?
We are supposed to believe that Queer Duck really accepts being gay because his wife dies.
I can say this unequivocally because I liked this movie when I was a teenager.
The only reason I'm grading this 4/10 is because I'm taking the average of my two ratings.
And that's only because the cgi effects are so corny that they made me smile for a second or two.
THis movie is the worst comedy I have seen except for dirty love now that was worse but this movie goes right along with it and jenna jameson is not good at comedy she should stick to being in porn because it does not take much acting skills.
The whole reason I picked up this movie in the first place is that I just adore low budget made horror movies because in my opinion they normally turn out to be better than the big budget horror films (examples: "Campfire Tales" and "Dead End").
It looked like I was watching a documentary at times because it was so horrible.
The violence almost completely takes place off-screen and it is apparently(because the whole film seems shot on someone's camcorder)because of a zero budget.
4 is better because the first story was awesome, at least better than some episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark?, unlike the rest of the stories.
I won't tell you about it, because I honestly didn't pay any attention.
I fell asleep for the beginning of the third story and didn't even bother rewinding it, because by that time I'd learned that seeing the whole thing still wouldn't make it make any more sense.
Buster Poindexter (I can't even think of the guy's name, because that's all he ever plays is that "character") plays a ranger in the woods (who wears a boy scout leader uniform) who helps pass the time in a creepy fashion along with 2 guys and a girl who both have very poor maintenance of their cars.
Now her girlfriend starts talking about revenge on their boyfriends, because the boyfriends taped them having intercourse without their permission.
Then we veer into a very strange subplot with Sherlock Holmes being unable to sleep because he's having a recurring nightmare (which he sketches).
We're led to believe it's because he has fallen in love with her.
But the story is the most feeble ever... No real suspense, only mindless clichÃ©s about a totally hapless main character (no, this is not irony on the film's part, guys, this is just the 'good-old-Kaurismaki-feeling' we yearn for and it only seems to work because his other films were enjoyable on their own).
Most of the events are difficult to believe because there's no possible way this guy can't figure out the situation.
Then we have the psychological approach, because our hero is usually alone.
He killed his own neighbor, though he thought the stalker had killed him because he had seen the two of them together.
I find it interesting that Chaplin himself considered this to be his most clever and witty film, because I thought it was desultory and downright boring.
I had justifiable misconceptions walking in because I have seen too many movies like it.
Starts off great introducing Vin Diesel and the setting and setting up the action and basic plot (lots of money spent on sets, too) so it looks like it is going to be a great epic action movie but gets boring about halfway through because the action becomes pointless because you don't know why people are chasing them and killing each other and then the movie simply ends without explaining.
Sadly it was completely bungled and at the end of it you have a heartless action flick that makes no sense whatsoever because the back-story it was meant to be bolted on is not narrated at all.
From the looks of those the movie was not meant to be about the action scenes because they are actually far and in between.
He also fits well with the sci-fi genre because he plays mysterious characters so well.
The movie could have ended there... say maybe use the premise she was just coming into her powers and when Vin dies it's because she doesn't need his protection any more.
Its all disappointing because the movie looked liked it had potential.
She's excellent in her role as a nun in a seemingly peaceful cult spouting lines such as, "just because we are peaceful, doesn't mean we are weak."
Considering all the good material it certainly feels like a misproduction, someone said the director and actor Vin Diesel were having different opinions and I do hope the latter won because if Kassovitz did it the way he wanted I'd be really disappointed.
Over all, this isn't a terrible movie, but I would say definitely to wait for the rental, because while the effects are very good and the whole setting is disturbing, it's the story that leaves you dumbfounded and just bummed that the story ended the way it did.
There is a brief scene in the movie where Sister Rebekah explains hers and Aurora's history to Toorop, but it doesn't explain anything and doesn't really matter anyway, because the story is so clearly just a backdrop to the futuristic landscapes and the cookie cutter fight scenes, many of which are hilarious in their badness.
This is a completely ridiculous and crazy comedy that's reminiscent of Roger Corman's LITTLE SHOPPE OF HORRORS, and the main reason it gets one star is because Buck Kartalian is actually perfect for such a wacky part.
This movie started off really horrible and I almost gave up on it because of the stupidity but then there were tons of sex scenes and the whole movie redeemed itself in some way.
The dialogue is wretched, the story makes no sense & Please Don't Eat My Mother is slow because of those sex scenes which break the main story up to much & for too long.
The sex scenes aren't going to keep the raincoat brigade happy because they are for the most part pretty soft & dull, the horror elements just aren't there as there's no tension, atmosphere, shocks & there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing.
I was disappointed that every time the movie introduced an interesting plot thread which would have made the movie about more than just "liberated students vs. stifling university dean" it was dropped by the next commercial because serious thought would have interfered with the party atmosphere the movie tried to foster.
The original exploitation classic-though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people.
I rented this film simply because from time to time I enjoy watching a bad movie--you know, ones that are so inept and stupid that they're good for a laugh.
That's because one or two of the non-professional actors didn't totally suck and the story was goofy enough to keep my attention.
Avoid this if you're looking for an entertaining film because you won't find it here.
FYI I only give this 1 Star because the system wont let me give any less.
At first I have to say I was attracted by this series because it seemed like offering something new and more complicated than your average "Jack Bauer-hour".
It annoys me that they have felt the need to film this poor imitation, apparently purely because the original is in a foreign language.
Do not bother seeing this if you have seen, or intend to see, the original, because you will only be disappointed.
I give it 2/10 because you may be looking for background imagery for a techno-party and this would suit well.
2 seasons of Riget was made and a third was planned, but it was canceled because some of the actors died.
I couldn't stop watching this train wreck, because I always kept hoping that they would recapture some of the wonder that was originally established before the end of the first season.
I feel the need to post a comment on this title because I've seen a few comments from people who are surprised at the positive user response for such an awful show.
While I can recommend the first two seasons of Andromeda to most SciFi fans because they appealed to many people on many different levels, I cannot recommend Season 3 or beyond to anyone who appreciates intelligent or well done writing.
sorryÂ I can't say anything about spoilers here because they are badÂ but I guess the commercial managers have outdone themselves, because my best guess is that an actor / director would never allow thisÂ  
This is an errand for their lives because Askin already has Robertson and Price under a death sentence for some harem indiscretions.
Good for you because the sex-scenes could make up for lack of story / plot-line.
The author doesn't tell us because he simply hasn't thought it through.
When my husband and I went to see this movie, we chose it purely because a) it wasn't one of the ridiculous movies already out, and b) it got a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
The poorest decision comes when the two find a friggin' BOMB SHELTER FILLED WITH FOOD AND WARM BEDS, but after a couple days they need to abandon it because they heard somebody walking around up top.
But one can't point fingers at such glaring plot holes, because This Is Such A Serious, Award-Winning Oscar Contender!
You can tell this movie is an Oscar contender because the kid cries real tears and there are at least a couple scenes where the audience gets treated to a rear view of Viggo's naked ass and nutsack.
There's a scene somewhere in the middle where The Mom (Charlize Theron) decides to end it by walking out into the freezing winter in her sleep shirt to die in the woods, because she can't take it anymore.
I rate it a 3 because if you spent any money watching it, you might very well feel ripped off.
Some people might rate it higher because it's an indie, but I'm an average movie watcher, not a film-school teacher.
Poor old RKO was reduced to being a craftsmanship studio making (now funny) trash by this stage and barely made any films in this period that have lasted because of quality.
The bad-ass of the series, whose name I didn't learn because he's *so* MYSTERIOUS, seemed like he was crammed with every trait a dark loner could ever want: He has a dark cloak, long matted hair, unusual tattoos, broken glasses that obscure one eye AND amnesia!
I never attached to the characters because nothing about them sticks out to me.
I think that I went into this film expecting something completely different from what the film actually represented because I was expecting something completely raunchy and funny.
Still it's Fritz the Cat and all is not lost, but all through the film i get the feeling that the director just took all the ingredients of the first fritz movie and mashed them together to a lifeless pile, sticking them in here and there, maybe because that's what he thought the fans wanted (and that would make more money).
If you get bored before the end, you're not missing anything, because there is no resolution, no big finale, nothing.
If it has suffered, it is because those who have spoken most often about it have not seen it nor perhaps considered its many merits as an attractive "entertainment".
While I am not a member of this counterculture and don't relate to it personally very well, I did try to keep an open mind while watching both movies, and neither one really shocked me that much - maybe because they're getting older and I've witnessed more shock value in recent movies.
If you guys liked this garbage you have never seen any other DBZ film because this Movie was a huge let down.
I give it 3 out of 10 because of this: 1.
His behavior is increasingly aggressive and near the end of the movie he ends up butchering someone with an axe.This storyline meets one that is very reminiscent of movies such as " Evil Dead" because his girlfriend hooks up with the bunch of brainless , shallow bores and goes with them to party in an abandoned tower ( but where are the stairs inside of that tower? )
It adds to my impression that this departure from previous entries made by the same crew is disappointing, because AU movies included good , very convincing acting.
Or maybe he is, because this type of mainstream banalities needs no good ideas, just recycling of the old, old, old senseless rubbish.
The special effects are good because they are done by Jeramie Cruise , and he proved himself as the master of that art in AU series.
, but it's not frightening or creepy because the plot quickly becomes very predictable.
Did they like him because he's a murderer?
I know why the actresses were chosen... mainly because they spend most of the movie talking about sex and walking around naked... frankly here too it's not worth losing your time watching...  As for the good critics ....
Is it so difficult, Richard Dean Anderson had to stick the "Dean" in because of the existence of Richard Anderson, known by many as Oscar Goldman on Six Million Dollar Man.
Do not buy or rent this expecting black comedy similar to the brilliant "Bad Santa", because you will be sadly disappointed.
The loved by children part is a nice touch because no matter how mean or abusive he is to the adults, he is a fantastic clown (what agility on this guy).
How there is not a feature length gag reel is beyond me, because these guys could not have kept straight faces opposite her.
Also, Prince Hamlet's film "The Mouse Trap," which is crucial to the original drama because it seals Claudio's guilty conscience, cannot serve its function in this film because it has been modified from a drama reenacting King Hamlet's murder into a bad montage of random student-filmmaker camera shots which one can scarcely connect to anything in the plot.
This is a lush, beautifully paced film that fails miserably, because the director forgot that you must make a movie do more than look good.
Make that `most' of those who make the attempt; because in the case of Bill Murray, someone should have put a stop to it right out of the chute.
He comes to live in Canada because his mother has died and is living with a supposed friend of his father who has a family on his own.The movie has a couple twists and turns that make it feel like a 2 hour soap opera instead of a movie.The movie starts off alright but at the end becomes quite ridiculous.
I had always wanted to see the film because a picture of Ireland and Malone that appeared in a biography of Corman that has been on my self for years.
I only watched this movie because a friend asked me to.
Lately I've been kind of avoiding anime because I expect way too much out of story lines, dialogues, character development and just... everything that makes you think and question.
if most people voted "I agree, your life sucks" then it probably would have been because of her aunt who just never told her the right stuff (again, just for the sake of driving the storyline someplace...)   Good for a younger age group and eye-candy or if you want to just sit back and not think too much -- don't watch it if you expect something remotely profound, witty, smart or innovative out of the storyline.
This movie is a stand out because it's about as early a Chaplin film as you'll find.
Given all of that, this is worth watching once if you're a Chaplin fan just because it is such an early example of his work.
Overwhelmingly unattractive, obnoxious, and virtually illiterate (because why go to class when there are handbags to be bought and hangovers to be overcome), the majority of these kids have absolutely NOTHING going for them but their riches.
I'd like to say that it is but that just simply wouldn't be the truth because God knows there are a lot of other t.v./reality shows out there that are ten times worse than "Growing Up Gotti" by far!
I don't think so because she is in a sense a gangster herself.
Which is a little unfortunate because...
The plot is weak, isn't explained very well and is thus confusing, but never mind because here comes another set piece that has absolutely nothing to do with advancing the plot.
It's a jumbled mess that only did well because of the Very LARGE and VERY EXPENSIVE marketing.
I went through a big DH Lawrence phase in my late teens and early 20's, and Ursula and Gudrun from Women In Love and The Rainbow were characters I loved and related to, despite and because of their flaws.
That's because it sets up the sequel featuring Reggie and Jack , like I said contrived .
For those who haven't seen the film, for God's sake, don't rent it, because you'll want your money back.
This movie was not funny because of its poor treatment of the subject matter.
Better movies like Strangers on a Train succeed at depicting killing your spouse because comic moments are balanced with an authentic appreciation of the horror.
It was so bad , I'm posting this now, because the memory has never left me some 12?
None of the comic sequences really work, because they never build into anything.
I'm regularly flabbergasted by opinions on films such as Sixteen Tongues--which I thought was horrible--because they are often somewhat favorable.
It seems like director Scooter McCrae included it just because it's usually taboo.
I've only given an extra point because the premise has a smidgen of potential and the film is somewhat coherent.
This one was pretty bad, I bought it simply because of the names of Ruth Buzzy and Martin Landau, I could just see a cheesy horror movie being made of these two and becoming more funny like a cheap William Shattner movie or something but what this movie turned out to be was one big bomb.
There's no point of writing a sensible review of this "movie" because it's sooooooo bad.
The bottom line: if you ever see this flick sitting in the horror shelf of your local video store, rated-R or UNRATED, do me a favor, pick it up and hide it behind a bunch of other videos, because this movie is a disgrace to all horror movies in existence.
had been isolated by the rest of the world because of its neutrality in the Second World War.
Perhaps it is because friends of the filmmaker wrote in.
I can't even call it a valiant effort hampered by some weaknesses, because that would be too generous.
If you said Mexican wasn't involved in the Spanish American War because they were no longer a part of Spain you win the cookie.
One of the stupidest bits was the idea that the Asian population would grow in California because new Chinese immigrants couldn't believe they would be enslaved upon arrival.
As if enough Asians haven't moved to Canada over the years because they didn't like the conditions that America did offer.
Why automatically assume that we would have a repressed, conservative, homophobic, antisemitic Bible Belt dominating a Confederate world just because some fanatics who insist on perpetuating the conflict culturally are like this?
The comedy here is of the subtle, "funny because it is true" variety.
In the course of the movie we are also told that the Jewish population of America was decimated because of Confederate Aryan attitudes.
Final verdict: 2/10, only because the idea was good.
here are the main two points i disagree with this film on: - the confederate states of America were called a confederacy because their chief concern was with states' rights over the federal government.
It is worth pointing out that there is not really any blood or violence in HOWLING V. If you are silly enough to enjoy this cheap crap then may I recommend that you buy a tin of paint, throw it up a wall and sit and watch it dry, because you are obviously very easily entertained.
It's hard to stay interested as the film goes along because the characters we begin to sympathize with are each killed off in turn...which is fine as an element of surprise the first time it happens, but when it continually happens throughout the movie, the end result is that it distances the viewer and you're not left with much to care about.
I would love to believe that either Ravi chopra directed this film in his sleep, or that he had some inspiration from Ekta Kapoor because i REFUSE to believe that he would actually make a 3hr film for justifying a 3 minute monologue!
I say this because the dialogs are so clichÃ©, it's disturbing.
BAGHBAN was scripted 40 years back and it was modified and it had some good emotional moments bt yet it was too oldfashioned   Here too the story sounds 2000 years old  Rani Mukherjee's role, her dress sense, her acting, her smiling is all too bad Don't know why she is boring to watch Seriously i loved her in YUVA, HUM TUM but nowdays she is just doing the same roles, same acting style, even her dress scenes are outrageous  I don't understand people praising her like hell here, she has no role just to cry after Salman dies and then get married because Amitabh says so  About the rest as i said the story is like PREM ROG(1982) and the handling is not at all convincing  The all hoopla done about the clash of titans between Amitabh and Om is just 5 minutes talk  Direction by Ravi Chopra is outdated Music is outdated  Amitabh once again demonstrates his acting skills and overshadows everyone but he is getting monotonous with such roles Salman does well in the first half, nothing new but he is more lively and less animated then in most of his films John looks sick(he was suffering from jaundice those days) but fails in his acting here Hema Malini is just there in the movie, her role lacks substance In fact the director doesn't at all care for women's wishes in the film supposedly based on women role improvement in society Rajpal comes does some usual gags and is forgotten Parmeet Sethi has no role Om Puri is too loud
Surprisingly, given McGovern's own politics, there's almost no hint of republicanism here, although within a few decades Britain was engulfed by a civil war that disputed absolutely the relevance of monarchy: perhaps this is ignored because it was a Protestant rebellion.
The fact that this film is advertised as a family flick repulses me to the extent of running away to gasp for air, and wash my self because it is so dirty.
Heidi Lenhart is tolerable in her role as the knuckle-headed fish out of water, but only wins in the end because the writers (I assume there were writers) penciled in a happy ending.
I read the director said he made this movie because he wanted to restore Jim Dougherty's place in history.
I ended up watching this on Saturday mornings because I was waiting for the Super Mario Bros Super Show to come on.
It's too bad because I like Joseph-Levitt as an actor but all the characters were completely one-dimensional.
Let's see....we have the girl that is goth looking (because we all know girls that wear black lipstick are wildly depressed).
We have the person that makes everyone angry because he is so mad about his own life, he must make things terrible for all the people there.
We have the friend that there is no hope for, because he does not try to get better (I feel mostly because he does not know how to live outside of a hospital).
because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is.
The second, star-wise, is interesting because it features Christian Slater (about to be hot), Steve Buscemi (had a long way to go before becoming hot) and Julianne Moore (had a long LONG way to go before becoming hot).
Me and my friends rented this movie about a year ago, because we thought it was going to be a scary movie... We were wrong..
I'm not sure if it killed people or not, because I was still laughing about the killer-cat, so I wasn't really paying attention to the third story at all.. One thing that I do remember is that the monster looked very strange and fake..
It would be understandable that you could have been sleeping 15 minutes into the movie because it is awful, but doesn't help your argument.
because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is.
Ebert's review is interesting because he "didn't get it" either, and seemed to say that the movie had accomplished something by puzzling him.
Kimmi-Sob the winning streak is over and my favorie survivor is sent home because of a fight with Alicia.
Amber-She was so tired and was voted out because she just followed Keith Tina and Colby.
I feel sorry for those who had never read the book or seen the 1964 movie before because as you know (without including spoilers) you can't experience this story twice the same way.
The movie meanders and has no aim because the filmmakers have no idea what sort of story they want to tell.
Bridgitte befriends this girl because she can help get her monkshood and I'm sure she feels a little bad that all the other patients make fun of her.
Possibly she is superwoman in disguise because she seems to run an enormous Edinburgh house more or less single-handed (the other household staff, all four of them, don't appear do anything very useful about the place).
She should have either stayed with the bad Irish accent or her natural dialogue because it drove me crazy as she went back and forth between the two.
It draws into a different side of human nature because a lot of women tend to be drawn to the dangerous type.
The movie would probably be fairly hard to follow if you didn't because the movie assumes that you know the Jekyll and Hyde background.
OK so how to rate something as bad a s Neighbours, well I rated it one, only because you can't rate it any lower, I really wanted to rate it -1 for every year it's been on air, 20+ years of nothing but crapÂ I can't wait for this show to be axed just knowing it exists disturbs me on so many levels, I find it odd that some people say this show used to be good, it was never good!
However, because it is Australian... Due to it being set in Australia rather than America or Britain (where incidentally for a long time it was a smashing hit, old chap) it IS more down to earth, and it is more realistic, but the margin is thinning year by year.
I first started watching Neighbours when I met my girlfriend about 2 years ago because she watched it.
The character Zeke for example is the most head-wrecking person to ever exist,ever notice in every scene,all he does is complain,most lightly because he has never got laid, and he blames everyone else because of it.
After running around corridors for an hour and a half, being put in solitary confinement (although allowed out to have sex, because sweet mercy that's what being Jean Claude Van Damme is about) Burke suddenly finds out inmates are being killed and their organs removed, not in some event relating last hour's worth of clues he'd been gathering but because the guards left a surgical saw conveniently next to their big suspicious medical cabinet.
One should remember that they were largely 12 or 13 year-olds, selected at that age because they could be easily manipulated and indoctrinated, or they did what they did because they feared for their own lives.
Clearly the lesson remains: 'give us what we want' because the alternative is just too horrifying.
In fact, this is one of those movies that's hard to turn away from because the awfulness is so compelling -- this is a movie with serious Oscar pretensions that comes up short in so many ways.
after the first 15 minutes the story seemed to turn in circles- which actually was a good thing for a friend of mine, who got out of the theater to buy some drinks and returned 15 minutes later: I didn't have to tell him what was going on while he was gone, because actually nothing happened at all.
None of it works, mainly because the whole plot is terribly tired and has that "been there, done that" feel to most of it.
The relationship between the two main characters exists only because in these kinds of movies there is always a relationship between the two main characters.
And then there's this female reporter (Kay Lentz), see, who's gonna do a report of the man and then there's this ken-do fighting cable guy (Richard Hatc), who because of an accident gets hooked up in this and they all are like sent into a parallel universe.
POTLU isn't nothing more, than a low budget action/sci-fi/fantasy flick, which, if you are into this kind of films, will make a grin on your face just because it is, what it is.
The script by Milius & Kevin Reynolds takes itself deadly seriously & is very pro the right to bear arms all the way, it says that the right of each American to own a gun is good because America is the land of the free & in the event of an attack by the Russians or any other evil superpower individual Americans will be able to defend themselves.
One was because I can't remember being able to use the phrase "apesh*t" and mean it in the most literal sense.
But because this movie inspired me to bake both banana cookies and banana bread, I will give it three stars.
The three main characters are well rounded, interesting, and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant (though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home).
The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly, dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays (one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson), team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again (even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out), and in general, the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, because as we all know, since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time, a city would be pretty small potatoes!
I hope they had a good time because the 'movie' they made is more boring than a fistful of slides narrated by your monotone aunt.
Sometimes an independent film succeeds because it is different and the producers have an original vision that is unique and refreshingly new.
The Motorcycle Diaries succeeded because Che is a compelling character, not a fresh-out- of-high-school kid with a vindictive sense of humor.
Amazingly enough the movie in 1989 even got a sequel, though I doubt that this was because of the big box-office successes of this movie.
I only gave it a "4" though, maybe because the middle of the movie dragged, and I was expecting better special effects than the movie could deliver.
Heard here is smug and charmless, yet we are supposed to be impressed by him because he's played by the great John Heard.
The dialog is hard to believe and its annoying sometimes because half the time it makes the movie go by very slowly when I wish I saw some action happening.
Its funny because its silly and some of the actors are doing pretty good job.
This movie was shown late at night because it is supposed to be scary but I found it hilarious!
Never had I painfully sat through such a bomb hoping that the film would just get better because others enjoyed it.
I'd say half of the movie is Hollywood fiction, and the other half could be a remote possibility- only because I believe that the Earth's magnetic poles have shifted, in the distant past.
But first, I need to hurt the puerile-minded fans of this schlock: Any ratiocinating fools who entreat those of us with a modicum of intelligence to "sit back, relax and enjoy this entertainment" do not realize that we who rail against bogus "science" in movies of this ilk, do so NOT because of bogus science per se, but because of the INCONSISTENT bogus science.
I haven't bothered to see who wrote the screenplay for this flick because I'm afraid I'll never see anything he's attached to.
That's especially because the special effects and werewolf designs were vastly better this time around and the attacks were more callous and bloodier.
Should we completely remove our brain first by smashing our head on a rock until it falls out, because if so, I'll do it.
1 out of 10, only because there are no negative numbers on the scale.
Thirdly, The premise of the film is based around the effects that occur because the core of the Earth stops rotating.
Fourthly, the scene with the golden gate bridge heating up because of a hole in the magnetic field?
And for example, the Swedish attack wasn't lead by Karl XII (because he was wounded and couldn't lead Sweden in battle), it was lead by Carl Gustaf RehnskiÃ¶ld.
I gave it a 2 because the story itself was ok.
I probably would not have rented this movie many because of the string of stinker movies recently released with John Travolta.
It was just a weak plot, I'd hate to say it was bad acting because there were so many good actors associated with the movie.
(I list Mochrie because I love Who's Line Is It Anyway?
A very popular TV weatherman(John Travolta)is fighting foreclosure on his home, because he is going broke with a business venture.
However, my optimism was challenged, because by the time the last 30 minutes of the film came to fruition, it looked as though the cast were just keen to see the end of it and so was I.
Well, don't waste your timeÂthis was perhaps the most boring film I have seen in yearsÂIt was boring, then briefly brutal then boring againÂit tries to be artistic but it's really just autisticÂit's not a daring brave piece of filmmaking because it truly makes no senseÂI tried very hard to find either the reason for the woman's actions or the hidden meaning in themÂNOTHING!
Perhaps because of the translation (or a poorly written story), I just didn't see what her underlying reason was for her self-mutilation.
this is not a good movie.i don't recall seeing worse acting for a long time.basically,a new student becomes bullied to the point where he is pushed over the edge.he exacts revenge by killing those who wronged him, making their deaths look accidental.sounds okay so far,right.but,this killer decides to kill other students who had nothing to do with bullying him.now there are no real "legitimate" reasons given to murder everybody.now,we get to the acting.each time a fellow student has a fatal accident,the other students show very little emotion and continue as if nothing has happened.i have to chalk this up to the limited acting ability of all the actors.in most so called horror movies, acting is not expected to be Oscar calibre,but this is worse than almost any movie in the horror genre.and things are worse because this movie has no scary sequences,so it would be nice if the actors could pick up some of the slack.the characters are like robots in their reactions,so it's really hard to like any of them.there are at least two scenes of nudity which are pointless.there is never any suspense generated,so there is never any feeling of anyone being in jeopardy.one last thing.this movie tries to take itself way too seriously,as if it is an Oscar contender.if it had been played for laughs,it may have been a better,or at least watchable movie.
But do take a look at MACH because it's a good watch.
One of the most touching (because grounded) elements of the original is that Bogart had to give up the vivacious young Joan Leslie for the older, husky, used, and rather plain Ida Lupino.
Low-budget queasiness (worked on at an early point by Martin Scorsese) takes a surprising amount of time to mount its grisly story--and by this time, one is watching and waiting for one of the nasty killings to occur simply because nothing else is happening.
It's a real pity he didn't direct it because if he had we probably would have ended up with a far superior movie.
It involves the hero Jack Quinn hunting arch-terrorist Stavros and because Quinn fails in his mission which leaves several people dead he`s given the choice of instant death or being exiled to an island similar to the one in THE PRISONER .
He chooses exile but decides to break out to gain revenge on Stavros who`s planning to kill Quinn`s wife and new born child   If the last paragraph makes much sense then I`ve probably explained it all wrong because the plot is totally underdeveloped with a massive amount of scenes that lead nowhere .
Maybe it's a case of "so bad it's good," maybe I'm just partial to Van Damme, or maybe it's because I still have that promotional "Double Team" baseball cap from working in a theater.
I actually recommended it to my best friend at the time because i told him that it was the worst movie ever made.
"Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2.
A big number of gotchas that may be forgiven only because it's just an action.
If you can imagine this, you can imagine why the audience applauded when Albert Finney's character finally died because it meant that the movie was apt to be over soon as well.
I enjoyed The Breakfast Club because I was able to relate to all of the characters.
A friend supports helicopters (yes, several of them, because they are wrecked one after the other).
If you want to waste some time do anything other than watch this film otherwise like me, you will be left angry and vengeful..   Why would you waste your time making a movie this bad.. Its like a bad rip off of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but lucky for them its so bad that Tarantino wont be suing them because he will be laughing so hard.. and why stop at robbing 500 million dollars?
Now, that's not to say the movie doesn't make us laugh, because there are several sequences in the film that are down right hysterical, proving that a movie can be successfully made about an imaginary six foot rabbit, but most of the funny scenes accrue during the first twenty minutes, for the one joke this film has gets stale after a while.
I guess we're supposed to become involved with Elwood's defense, because people thin he his a nutcase.
I saw this for cheap at a used DVD store & picked it up, because I love the original "Harvey" and Harry Anderson certainly looks like he'd make a great Elwood P. Dowd.
We watch a lady who had it easy giving it all up so that she can live in poverty, because allegedly poverty is better than being unhappily rich.
Mr. Morris feels at home here as an eccentric estate agent, but only because his character has very limited screen time and also plays no part in the unpleasantness that almost the entire remainder comprises.
This statement was never defined because of the garbage that was presented.
It's like watching a train wreck - no matter how bad it gets, you keep watching because you know it's going to get worse!
I thought that for sure this movie would be an instant comedy classic because the prince of comedy, Martin Short, was going to be the evil villain.
I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because I was not entertained or amused by this holiday comedy.
I went to see this movie like I did the second one because I am a very nostalgic person and I wanted to relieve happier parts of my childhood by watching this film in which it's predecessor or The first one was a great delight in my young years.
I know this because they say something like at least you did not buy him a car or something to that effect.
Only watch this if you have small kids, not if your trying to rekindle memories of youth because there are none of those moments here.
In SC3, if a 6 year-old fails to understand something it's because he's had some kind of unfortunate mental handicap.
This is actually ART made to look like thrash, because it brings the audience closer to the characters.
My girlfriend talked me into seeing this movie because she loves Christmas movies.
I'm not often bored, especially at the movies, but maybe that's because I'm careful about what I pay ten bucks to see.
Perhaps it's my own fault that I was disappointed, because I'd had such high hopes for this film, but all in all, I was left feeling that this installment, which ought to have been another glittering Snowflake.
Or better yet, since I had to buy 3 tickets, I'd have rented it on DVD and been able to pause it to use the bathroom, because the treacles sweetness made my tummy queasy.
Sad, too, because it had great potential.
We were attracted to this movie because of the cast.
The movie consists largely of Dorf and others tooling around Budapest, with several time outs so that Dorf can reassure Hoskins, who never leaves his study presumably because of his great girth, that he is not wearing a wire.
To me, this movie is priceless because it has a high school prom scene, which, when done is the 80s, was just too cool.
I didn't like the stepmom, because she was just too crazy.
That the appeal to audiences around the time of this film's release was probably the fashion, the music, even the actors themselves (Ami Dolenz for younger audiences and probably, Tony Danza, before he because more of a pop culture joke), things which are probably very cheesy by today's standards.
I saw it primarily because of John Stockwell.
Of course, now when I see 1980's pictures and see those fashions and hear that music, I'm always amused because I think, "I actually lived through that."
Dark is depressed because Beverly D'Angelo wants him to get out of the shower.
Dark is depressed because his ex-girlfriend only wants to have sex with him (no-strings-attatched), although, she has a new girlfriend named Lucifer.
Dark is depressed because he has has a crush on some kid named Montgomery.
Dark is depressed because his friends think playing hide & seek on Ecstacy is a good idea.
Dark is depressed because he's always IT.
Dark is depressed because he thinks he's dying and/or the world is going to end.
And I would imagine Dark is depressed because he thinks no one understands him.
The ending is not surprising because the people in charge forgot to introduce other characters who may be the suspects so that leavesÂÂÂÂ.well, I'll let you figure it out.
I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is.
Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid.
Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style.
The whole plot is a kid becomes a mass murderer because his dad didn't spend enough time with him.
And convince others who are sad to murder also, because people were mean to them.
He tells his brother he must do this because he is gay and that he doesn't deserve to live in this world.
One of the "horsemen" as a gay character with a big brother so redneck and devoid of familial feeling that it almost went beyond belief, and who the gay character ended up disemboweling himself in front of because of his brother's rejection.
Verdict: This is not the movie that's worth watching because it's too bad, it hurts and insult your intelligence, and by don't watching it, you will save yourself for having Zhang's performance in your mind.
Not really sure who this is supposed to appeal to: either parents of Columbine-type nutjobs who can be reassured that their poor parenting skills are understandable because they're explained IN THE BIBLE or misunderstood youth who feel neglected by Mommy and Daddy, so it's okay if they act out a Marilyn Manson video.
Ice must have been working on his own skills because I am sure this film is not something he brings up when discussing his past projects.
This only reason I watched it was because my roommate and I were playing Mystery Science Theater 3000 to it.
It is a confusing show because all of the adults are claiming "true love", and that Brian is all of their "soulmates", but I find it hard to grasp how a woman can settle for only a part of that man's love, and part of his attention.
Foolishly, Denise appears to have tried to buy her way into their lives because she's so desperate for love and for a family, but it also appears that she likes the role of favorite woman, lounging around while the others are cooking and cleaning.
Apparently it wasn't a secret because one of the husband's friends knew about it and said that others in town did, too.
At an anniversary dinner (for all three wives) he made the newest wife try a bite of something because one of the others did.
He is legally married to Pam but because the state of Texas believes firmly in monogamy, he has had to resort to private ceremonies to 'marry' his second wife, Kathy.
More specifically are those people who, when in reference to some of the recent animated features, say things like "Oh it's such a great film, because, not only do the kids love it, it's funny for adults as well!
This irks me because adults and kids alike have always been able to appreciate a well-made animated feature.
So while I do hate this growing trend -one that has seen studios offering "condolences" to parents who drag concession-hungry children to see their movies by using two-tiered, age-discriminating humor (I guess so parents can nod knowingly to each other over the heads of their kids, while receiving these studio "winks", as if to say " They didn't get that one, but we sure did -it's because we're OLDER.
There are several laughs to be had, mostly because of Lucy Davis' excellent comic acting; there are not enough for it to be classed as a comedy.
It's a shame I didn't heed my own inner alarm system, because I would have saved myself an episode of eye strain from the godawful editing and boredom from the godawful script.
It's a shame that such a top rate cast was let down by the insane camera-work and direction.Quick cutting has it's place,Natural born killers and the Bourne trilogy are enhanced by it because it furthers the story, but you are still able to actually focus on the characters.This rubbish is so quickly cut you are't given the chance to appreciate the acting or follow the plot.The director should definitely never work again.
It's a pity really because based on the opening scene(s) I would have viewed the entire movie.
But flies on a wall have one perspective, because they are sitting still on a wall.
In order to fully explain the disappointment in movie, I must state that I have just about, read every book written by and about Zora Neale Hurston and it was because of the movie.
This book is wonderful because of the strength of its main character, Janie.
In the novel, Janie's finding Tea Cake is heartening because it is a symptom of her growth into a woman who can lead herself and has the strength to find and believe in that sort of love.
Next, the scene where Janie kills her lover was lost because the camera was not on the scene.
I think if you are trying to enjoy this story, read the book because Hollywood does a poor job with this one, although i don't feel that book is a real knockout either.
I have to agree with the first comment, because this movie was nothing special.
In the book she left the old man because he beat her.
On screen the fight comes on the porch has no bite because Winfrey removed the dozens game and most of the violence from the movie.
I really started hating this movie because Janie on screen seemed downright cruel.
He can afford to do it because the case is weak and Elizondo has diplomatic immunity, I guess.
I know this to be true because both my mother and my psychiatrist have assured me it is.
I wanted to see it because Michael Cera is really funny in SUPERBAD and he is funny in this "movie" as well, BUT his role although being on the cover of the DVD is limited to one sketch that runs for about 3-4 minutes.
I recommend checking out a couple of YOU TUBE-comedians instead because that's all this movie is really, a bunch of YOU TUBISH clips wrapped around a not interesting love-story.
I could probably best describe this as a deranged orgasm in the form of a movie, if that makes sense, because I'm telling you now this movie doesn't.
The only reason I have given it a 2 is because of the one or two nudity scenes.
I watched this movie because I'm pretty big Michael Cera fan and really nothing he's been in so far has been terrible... however, this movie looks like it was begging not to be watched.
It might seemed a little biased because he was the reason I watching the movie, but really his sketch was the only one that was casted perfectly.
The only tolerable bit was Cera, and it's only because he sells it, not the writing.
This is a hard film to review because basically it was nothing more than a documentary reviewing the performances and story of Shepard's new play.
This was sad to see because we as people should be getting out of our seats and spending more time in museums, theaters, and galleries, but for those that do not wish to do so we have this film to enjoy.
I say this because I am not really sure what the purpose of making this film was.
Were we to see that Shepard was a bastard in real life because of the influence of his father?
There was the one scene where Shepard tells Nolte to forget that his mother just died because he has a job to fulfill, a job that basically highlights the death of his own father.
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
The title is very appropriate because this film indeed leads to nowhere and it's Gregg Araki's view on the subject of teen-alienation.
It's depressing, all right, because it's always depressing to spend two hours in the company of someone or something with no energy, no life and not very many thoughts; and I'm not referring to Harry Caul here (although I could be), but to the film itself.
Coppoloa is as obsessive about getting down every little uninteresting detail about people and events he doesn't understand the significance of, as his protagonist is; if the process of watching the minutae of bugging is SOMETIMES involving (as in the opening scene, where we see how the title conversation was recorded in the first place; or the sequence in which Caul patiently and methodically sifts through what sound like random crackles in order to pull out complete, comprehensible sentences; or even the trade show, where matters of moment look as though they might be under discussion), this is because it's sometimes going somewhere.
When the key sentence "He'd kill us if he got the chance" leaps out of the soundtrack at us, it's an arresting moment, but only because we suspect that the sentence means something.
As Liebeniner points out, his film was "rejected as evidence because it had 'nothing to do with the crimes (euthanasia program) on the indictment...
This film cannot be compared with Liebeneiner's work because it goes much further openly endorsing the actions of the mother who killed her child, and suggesting that she was merely carrying out the clearly communicated wishes of her daughter, while condemning all those who questioned the right of a mother to kill her child.
It is important to remember that the inquest after Katie Lynn Baker's death ruled that she died as a result of homicide but that the BC crown simply decided not to prosecute because "there is no likelihood of conviction" (BC Ministry of the Attorney General, 2 December 1999).
Of course, the CBC could say they are not really endorsing this or they could say that the opinions of Dennis Foon, who wrote this, Buffalo Gal Productions, and Sienna Pictures are not necessarily their opinions just because they ran the film, but that would not be consistent with their program description on their website.
I watched because I had an inkling that Kate Todd might actually be able to act, but even if she was an Oscar winner, she couldn't have made this good.
If my sister, and her friends made it, I would be surprised, but only because I'd wonder how the f they got a bear to not eat them.
Of course not, because by then the damn bear would have moved on and the movie would have ended with their eventual rescue.
I gave this movie one star because they rely on the old, stand-by suspense scene where the vehicle refuses to crank until the last second.
I think this film made me very stupid all of the sudden, because I completely failed to link those toxic waste barrels to the bear.
Was it because he felt like Tarzan?
I watched this because I had a free movie pass.
I gave it two because I gave it a little credit and at least all the bad actors died!
I started watching this horrible movie because it was so bad it made me laugh.
I hope not, because this movie has a very SILLY plot, lame acting, and it was made for about $100.
(I won't bother with the summary of the book/ movie because you've probably already read it.)
Trust me, the book is amazing, but the adaptation is not, probably because Stephen King adaptations are almost impossible due to the mainly psychological aspects of the books.
Other parts, like the Smoke-Hole Ritual, those parts with the infamous house on Neibolt Street, and the part in the novel with Bill, Richie, and Georgie's album, were completely cut out of the film, without any recognition whatsoever.One of those parts could've been put in place of the cafeteria scene in the film, because in the novel, Richie didn't even see the werewolf in the school basement.
This really made me mad because, after Stan, Richie was my favorite character.
In closing, if you read the book, I suggest you not see the movie, because it will disappoint you a lot, as it did me.
If you haven't read the book, then go read it because there are many gaps that the movie created, that the novel will fill.
Richard Pryor Just goes nuts because he gets taken advantage of by moving men and his boss.
And it's OK that they cut out the kids being lost after first believing they killed It (definitely because of the made for TV movie... hell, even a theatrical movie...
It was horrible, yes, but horrible not because it was scary, but because it was a huge joke at the author's intentions, i'm sure.
Like I said, if you think it's good just because other people like it, then you're out of your mind.
Pointless messages galore the genre should be horror because I was pretty scared watching this crap!
Strictly speaking for myself, because I'm strange, I would have thought a much better ending would involve the latter-day heroine, Bonnie, and her boyfriend going into the upstairs bedroom and finding Frank and John in bed with their mother's dead body, or Frank dressed as his mother with John next to him and Frank talking like their mother.
The title is also apt, because 'simple' perfectly describes the A to B plotting which could comfortably fit on the back of a matchbox.
Its a joke of a movie and i laughed all the way through, not because it was funny, because it just sucked so much.
sorry, haven't seen it but I doubt I will just because of the content and the prior reviews.
Do not be misled by the token appearance of Rodney Dangerfield, because he is almost totally wasted, and Randy Quaid's character is so repetitively abrasive, he quickly becomes boring.
rating system, because it is so depressing to watch.
Only problem is, their rooster buddy has now discovered a new talent for harmonising Elvis Presley-type rock tunes, and his new manager won't let him go because the old miser has been rolling it in cold hard cash ever since.
How ironic, that in the early 80's, Don Bluth left the Disney stable to set up his own production company, because he felt Walt and co weren't making very good films any more.
Then it starts to rain, and before long, all the animals are terrorized by both floods and the evil Grand Duke of Owls, who, it turns out, actually set up the whole thing simply because he dislikes the sun.
Edmund is the most annoying character in the film because the scene where he gets turned from a real human into an animated cat was weird and stupid.
This causes an evil owl to move to the farm because he wants to live in permanent darkness.
The Chanticleer/King songs were fine, because they were part of the whole singing rooster story.
I do not remember if the speech is in the film,but if it was it was wasted because the powers that be at Disney in 1956 decided to change the ending.
I once had a father ask me if it was OK if his son,who did not want to read the book, watched the movie , I told him sure, if he wanted to fail the class.... the teacher would have known immediately that he had not read the book,because he would have no clue about "that a man can stand up".
Set in Revolutionary era Boston, Forbes' novel is the story of a bright, talented, and cocky fourteen year old silversmith apprentice, Johnny Tremain, who because of an accident which cripples his hand finds himself without a profession.
New characters come into the story and often disappear without explanation because they do not attract a following.
I was going to rate this film a 2 but I opted for a 1 because a 2 would really be stretching the bounds of truth, reality and justice (just like this film does from start to finish).
I keep harping on the problems created by stupidity in plot details because they damage willing suspension of disbelief by the audience and make the movie hard to enjoy.
We enjoy "Society of Extraordinary Gentlemen" and "Van Helsing" despite the campy Victorian "science" because the actors and screenwriters do a good job and the story recruits the audience as a willing conspirator.
You have to wonder if SciFi Network shows garbage like this because of a special dumb movie discount or something.
Doesn't that just sound stupid, because that's what they did.
"Preston Tylk" proves a sad fact that just because a film is independent doesn't mean it has something interesting or new to say.
And I could go on, but I don't want to, because just bringing up this cartoon seems to be very painful.
(And can't even help him openly because his ego must be preserved!)
Which was part of the problem because she didn't want to be comfortable or complacent.
Priscilla Lane begins the film as a secretary but because of her persistence and great ideas, she quickly moves up in the company and is a very well paid executive--something practically unheard of in 1938.
In fact, throughout the film BOTH characters are really hard to predict or understand because there is no consistency with either of them.
Also because neither of the leads seemed consistent or believable, the film is more of a curiosity than a good film.
Why exactly a sex vampire needs fangs would be something I don't want to think about too long, but this transformation also makes her brother lurch along like Quasimodo, perhaps because he has an erection; again, not something to ponder very much.
Putting this film on a DVD with "Monstar-a-Go-Go" was really a stroke of genius for this film's reputation, because MAGG is so awful that it makes this poorly-assembled collection of audio and images look GOOD.
There is a point where one sees things that one can't watch because its so hysterically funny one will die from laughter from continued viewing.
This is a movie that is rated R, it even says so in the credits, because of nudity and sex.
I think its because the film makers were desperate to have a reason for people to see this movie.
I know this is what she's doing because of the voice over.
'The Burbs' was intelligent because it kind of put you in a safe and familiar environment then turned it on it's head.
Shame as well because this is the kind of role that big Randy usually kicks ass in ie.
The side stories about Pryor's daughter staying behind in Jersey because of her new boyfriend also just falls apart.
I am an American History teacher and this is the sort of film that causes people like me to grumble and complain because the film bears almost no similarity to the actual story of the founding of the Jamestown colony.
But, it is because of this and how widely the movie was loved and accepted that I actually use it in my class discussions--teaching kids that much of our history is distorted or even completely fictional.
There was a little-known sequel named Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss that had NONE of the original characters or charm--and because of this it was soon forgotten.
I don't think you can really take this review as the end all be all, because admittedly i did not watch all of it, but hopefully someone will get some use out of it.
Regardless of our feelings toward Bush, we need to fight Al-Queda there, because that is where they chose, or else we will be fighting them here, in LA, NYC, Atlanta, and Omaha.
Tommy notes that he sells "stupid tickets to these stupid movies," but he never goes to see them, because they "seem so unimportant."
For a long time I only owned Lethal Weapons 1,2 and 4 and only bought this because it was dirt cheap and people always moaned at me for missing it out, even though they understand that it is a rubbish film.
It's because of movies like this that Last Action Hero got made.
Maybe, if drunk, it would be a bit fun because it's so bad, but I really doubt it.
I suspect they only made this movie because it was so cheap then to shoot movies in Romania.
(And you wouldn't have a single Croat there in a mixed force because country troops work together, and oh by the way Croatia is not a UN member country).
Action junkies might be tempted because of the enormous body count.
Barbara Stanwyck, whom I usually like to watch, was nothing but a whining hypochondriac and not somebody you root for because of her constant demanding of everything.
They end up in the mansion of a rich lady (Irene Pappas giving a performance less lively than some of the furniture and obviously wishing she were elsewhere) because they run out of gasoline, and when she finds them in her garage syphoning off some fuel she realises she has a use for them.
The scenes of violence that are present in the film have almost zero effect because there's not really a context for any of it.
I can't say I liked it very much because, honestly, it's a super-pretentious film that goes on for far too long without actually handling about anything.
The ending is also weak, not because the idea (a shoot-out in the fog) is bad, but because it's impossible to believe, while watching it, that you're seeing anything other than one man alone in a studio pretending to be in a fight.
It struggled to be heartfelt because they did not speak the same language, but only succeeded in boring me half to death.
We never see that, because this cheesy production must have run out of cash for paying Mitchum so they couldn't afford a fake cat or renting one from a zoo.
I am sure I saw this movie as a kid, mainly because I am such huge a fan of Walter Brennan, Fred Astaire, Chill Wills and Edward Buchanan.
However, Astaire deludes himself further into thinking that the roughnecks who come into town eventually leave it because of his notoriety (rather than through the helpful 'armed and invisible' presence of his friends) and even befriends a much younger saloon gal who turns out to be the girl of the robber behind the crime Astaire was supposed to have committed in the first place!
The quintet of Hollywood veterans provide the only pleasure to be had from this meager production because whenever they are offscreen things get pretty dull indeed.
The acting alone is terrible, the storyline has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, These two friends set out on a journey and start hitch-hiking being picked up by some SPACE-CAKE who ends up trying to kill them, they manage to escape and end up in a quite sleepy town meeting a beautiful lounge girl in a bar, she turns out to some sort of demon-like thing that wants to live a normal life, the whole town seem to have demonic sense to them, there's some other guy who I think is mean't to be the Devil, he wears a 3/4 length leather jacket and big massive leather biker boots, he's looks like a bad guy in Blade or something, then there's these two brothers who are sent down to earth to kill and then recruit people for 'legion of the dead', they constantly get into awkward situations, one of the brothers manages to get injured by falling objects, moving cars, and finally getting blown up, that was slightly funny, the guy who plays the devil comes down to earth to find his bride(demon like girl)and then there's a big fight in the film between good and evil, apart from that DON'T get this film out, because it is so bad, everything in it is so far fetched that I think the guy who made it must have been taking some sort of drugs, acid or speed maybe, but anyway the bottom line is BAD FILM, BAD ACTING, BAD PLOT, funny in certain bits because your actually laughing at how bad the film is...
But I rated them both with 3 stars because:  1.
Yesterday I bought this used VHS in a rental without any previous reference first because I am a great fan of horror movies.
But really, if you haven't been to Asia, I can't really see this being worthwhile renting because it moves at a snail's pace and seems intended for those who love to read meaning into everything.
But, I wouldn't think of it as a "remake" because I was stuck trying to compare the two movies together, and it made this movie look really bad.
He claimed he took the key, put it on Emily's key chain and jammed the door lock because he thought the thug was David getting in with Emily's key and he tried to protect Emily's reputation.
I don't object to the animations, because they're thematically unified by always being connected to travel and cellphones and they create a sense of link with the 20-somethings, the generation after the director's that he's focusing on here; the fact that they're glib and kitsch just fits with everything else quite intentionally.
Why was Steven so easily dismissed as a suspect -- just because he was "on the phone" during the attack?
You're supposed to believe him in that role because he wears glasses and chain smokes.
He appears in movies, and because he is pretty, people watch.
Don Johnson must have had an ironclad no - cancellation clause in his contract because the show was mired in the bottom of the Nielsens.
That's because these films are cheap shorts made by an eager and unknown director--hardly works of art.
Don't ever let someone tell you some of these movies are low budget, because they aren't.
Some don't like Jia's work because of its slow pacing.
Nothing is sustained or delivered, because they are poorly staged and too goofy to have any sort of effect.
The character's for instance, the selfish businessman who wants to keep everything quiet because of his investment, the Mayor who fears for the towns economy, the unflappable hero with personal problems who nobody takes seriously at first, the blonde female who falls for the hero & just tags along for no apparent reason other than to be put in mortal danger so the hero can save & 'get the girl' at the end, the disposable character's who are there to keep the body count going but add nothing else whatsoever to the story, the scientist expert who happens to be a personal mate of the hero & knows everything about the creature/monster (depending upon film) & the central threat itself, in this case snakes, that pop up occasionally to kill someone.
Ordinary man meets strange girl with secrets and his values tend to change in dangerous ways, because of the passion.
Maybe it's because one is too used to American actor manners, but I'm not sure that's really the problem here.
On the other hand, I think the film fails primarily because Rendell's story doesn't work well in a French setting.
In the novel, he stole it because he thought that Courtois was a vulgar man, but here Magimel's motivations to steal the bust remain blurred.
However, things aren't looking good because there's an absence of unnerving climate and the scenario seems to have been sedately written, especially near the end.
So, an absence of interest for this story of manipulation is surely due to its actors and also because like for "la CÃ©rÃ©monie", Chabrol made dull Rendell's novel.
Phillipe drives a new car in the film apparently because the auto agency delivered it to the set by mistake, so his boss Nadeau lets him drive it for six months until his own driver's license is reinstated, but he admonishes Phillipe to "bring it back in one piece."
I am doubly disappointed because I rented this movie based on the reputations of the executive producer (Redford) and the writer of the novel on which it was based (Hillerman).
There is NO Esperanto in this movie  I watched this movie specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages used.
Overly cryptic to the point of obfuscation, not because the plot warrants it but because there is almost no plot.
There is also nothing edgy or controversial with such nudity; people are not shocked or attracted to films just because they are not afraid to photograph under the belt, literally.
A shame, because "Before Night Falls" should have been a real event.
Could have been, but wasn't because Meg Ryan is a one woman wrecking crew from beginning to end.
I gave this disaster a 1 because 0 was not a option...
I guess it does this because it has nothing else to do.
I don't wish anyone the experience we had with a play he co-wrote with a brother and that was seen at the Mineta Lane Theater in New York about three years ago, in which the audience kept leaving the performance because it was insufferable.
It's easier to see why Bruce has stuck to the situation because he doesn't have much to offer anyone else in her right mind.
Standard film shots are scattered throughout, of locations and events in history, a parade from WW 1, a real street scene in Chicago, and this further aggravates the authenticity of the whole subject, making the film look "cut up" because most of it was filmed on cheap Warner Bros sets in Pasadena.
I don't need a mediocre film to instigate that "chain gangs are evil", I should know that from my own knowledge, and further more, this film contradicts itself because capitalism itself is slavery and there is so much insane dialog about the "virtues of work" in the beginning.
An average film reduced by film historians and buffs to a "classic" merely because they can not understand why films had to make a profit for the capitalistic and authoritarian film companies which produced them.
A cheap movie - and not only because it is low budget.
Disaster warnings start small and build slowly so that the "man" is not aware of the problem until almost too late and then must turn to the "rebels" they have been trying to suppress because they don't want a panic or interrupt the annual picnic or whatever.
What was disturbing was the shot of lower manhattan smoking....I am just SURE they used some 9-11 footage...and I HOPE they didn't...because that would be wrong!
I had to sign up just to make a comment regarding this movie because I definitely wasted my money and my time on it and here I am doing what I can to save others the time and grief.
I say this is not too terrible - for a disaster movie - because there's no sappy melodrama involving kids, pregnant women, sanctimonious paramedics, or inner city gang members.
I mean, it must have been a conscious decision because that is the end product.
The only advise I can give anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet is: try READING THE BOOK because this movie is awful!  
Maybe it is because I slept a bit while watching this.
I will not tell you what happens exactly because you can guess by then.
I watch a lot of European and asian movies, because i think overall they take more time to develop the story and do not simply hang on to Syd Fields' 3-act formula.
i love the french cinema, i am not bashing this film because i havent seen alot of foreign films but they have copied the american film industry and made a worthless clone of previous french films.
Spanish officials are especially upset with Blood because Cartagena is a Spanish port and Spain is one of the Crown's allies.
The editing killed the whole thing for me because it was too choppy and made it difficult to follow becase of all the weird splicing everywere.
Johanne is interesting because she actually does something other than whine about teen-angst, which the mostly late-20s characters should have outgrown.
Lillian is a small part, but she's interesting because the misogynist chorus seems to have a special dislike for her, which could be an interesting story.
Then she ended up seeing again, because of an unannounced festival schedule change.
The American born South Asians are the one's who are constantly bending over backwards trying to please the "FOBS" because of their constant criticism of us being too "American".
We are constantly struggling to find a balance in our lives and we are the one's being treated like outcasts because the "FOBS" are the ones who are so critical and stuck up with their own set of standards that they expect from us.
if you're going to have a huge party for your Indian friends, you better make sure that you give individual invitations out because that kind of event will be crashed every time by FOBS.
It's almost like ABCDs take pleasure in pointing out the differences because they are ashamed that many Anglos think of US that way.
And that's not to say that a person who grows up in a small village in Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh is going to smelly, socially-awkward and not worth knowing, just because their values are traditional or they dress differently.
Oh -- and if you're only interested in this movie because you're a Vincent Kartheiser fan, don't bother.
I wasn't sure if this was a comedy about two opposites thrown together (because there were very few humorous moments, this film certainly was not the side-splitter that reviews boast it to be) or if it was a drama about a man discovering who his father really was.
Unfortunately, because of the poor script and unskilled actors, this film was not moving or compelling at all, no emotion was evoked, except disdain for everyone involved in the making of this film.
Naturally Michael Bay does all that in slow-motion, because that's what action movies are all about you know, slow motion.
I found myself surfing other channels, but came back because other interesting shows were either in Spanish or German with Spanish sub-titles.
As an aide to history it is without value, because the events and conflicts it portrays were almost certainly nothing like the film-makers would have us believe.
It spoiled it for me...  Was it because it was in Dolby 5.1 -- and we didn't watch it in Dolby 5.1 ???
I recommend Carol Clover's book, 'Men, Women and Chainsaws' or Adam Rockoff's book 'Going to Pieces' and the documentary of the same name for more on these rules.The documentary is particularly excellent, filled with clips from movies like this (movies that think they're slasher pics because they are sequels to slashers) and 'real' slasher classics.
At last he goes crazy and kills a bunch of people while moving his eyebrows a lot, because apparently that's what crazy people do.
I give this film a one out of ten stars, simply because this movie has earned just one.
In one scene he flashes back to when he was a newborn baby, because, of course, vivid memories are easy to keep for a baby.
is a shame, because this film really has some gem lines and really bad readings.
But on the other hand, I can't be too harsh because the murder sequences are great!
It's entertaining to watch just because it is that bad.
It's honestly funny only because it would never happen in real life.
BUT, because I enjoy movies like these to no end, I highly encourage those with a morbid and masochistic view on flicks to seek this out and indulge.
I strongly don't recommend this movie unless your a fan of the 70's porno genre.It is quite tame by today's standard,but the plot is just as incoherent as the modern porn plot.Barbara Broadcast is a author who takes tricks on the side because its so much fun!She is not that bad looking of a lady,kind of like a Julieann Moore type.Only thing is she is not nearly as attractive.Attractiveness is not found at all in this movie,plastic surgery wasn't as relevant as it is now.A guy could probably see better looking girls at his local watering hole.There is a dude who has a cool porno mustache that was amusing.If going to the XXX movie theater's remind you of the gold old days than see this movie.Than seek help.
- Too bad, because this one has a lot of potential.
Plot: Anna Carter is informed by her doctor that she has three months to live because she suffers from frontal-lobe Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer).
Every character is dull, and the reprise of Rosewood and Serge's characters only generate mild interest because we have seen them before.
It's amazing that rival Warner Bros. could make a movie series where the sequels where ten times more entertaining than the two sequels of BHC but maybe it was because they were all made by the same team of Donner and Silver.
Made on what looks like the worst/cheapest camera available in the shop, with actors the director seemingly chose because they live next door/didn't demand payment, "Champion Killer" fails to deliver on any meaningful level.
We have all seen played out far too many times the sad tale of the former great this- or-that attempting a comeback and flopping because the juice is gone.
The whole story is so much larger than life that seeing the sorta mediocre result is disappointing because this story needed grandeur, big budget, big cast, big everything, to elevate the over-the-top story to its sublime glory.
It's a shame because like I said, I love these kind of stories and it annoys the heck out of me that Wilder was more concern in trying to voice a (tired) opinion than actually trying to create a great film first.
The actors in "Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying" don't really know what to do with their stereotypical characters because there isn't much for them to do.
I hope this was a huge loss for the film makers because it was a waste of 2 hours in my life I can never have back!
it stunk out the whole cabin), mostly because there were large portions of the movie where nothing much exciting happened.
The supporting performances are generally rather lacklustre, possibly because none of the characters beyond the two principal players carry much depth or interest.
I decided to watch this film because I love Cary Grant and eventually I want to see every film he made.
Anyone would love it because it's so interesting, and teenage girls out there: Adam Brody!
I just really want to convince people to get this movie, because it's so interesting ans the storyline is so unique.
Too Sweet ends up in prison again because he violently pummels a boxer to death during a boxing match after his drink was spiked with some sort of drug that made him crazy and more violent.
The game-play is common sense like, not challenging but can be at times aggravating because it can get hard and repetitive.
Well, I was gonna rate this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while righting this, I'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better.
When The Spirits Within was released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like Final Fantasy.
And this critter must look truly petrifying because even the animals in the stock footage run away.
Eponine wasn't anywhere to be seen, Thenardier, Gavroche and the priest were only token inclusions and the death of Gavroche doesn't move us at all because we hardly know who he is.
I was willing to be patient with a Les Mis movie adaptation, because the novel is sooooo lengthy and detailed.
Here is what all bothered me: - I saw people praise this movie because it didn't change Valjean as drastically, i.e.
I'd heard about this movie because a friend of mine let me know that Adam Brody was in it.
I was immediately drawn to it more because of hearing that Illeana Douglass was in it.
She made the situation between Marius and Cosette complex because of her own feelings for Marius.
She's the essence of innocence; she does not question her father because of his goodness.
When Rani's character meets with Vivek's again, she decides to end their relationship because his parents were rude to hers.
This causes her sister's marriage deal to be canceled and not to mention the fact that her parents disown her because of this.
He did this to Denise Drysdale because she was simply to funny, so anyhow he then decided to put blonde bimbos as his co-hosts on the show instead (they were really REALLY dim)  I will give the show credit for unveiling alot of talent on its RED faces segemnt (this was a segment EXACTLY the same as The Gong Show from America)but beyond that it was pathetic.
Red Faces, even when its contestants were as boring as the rest of the show became, managed to entertain because of regular judge Red Symons.
There is only one show that lasted as long as Hey Hey and stayed good from first episode to last, and it did so because it regularly changed staff, allowing new ideas to make their way in.
Shame, because the opening scenes are very promising, with Eriq Ebouaney portraying a very sympathetic hero, and Fatou N'Diaye also impressive as his deceptively strong partner.
Just because a film has a humanistic social agenda it doesn't give it the right to be this lacklustre.
Then you also should avoid this one, because it's so utterly bad that it's not even funny.
I was very disappointed by its quality because I am a big fan of Hindi movies and had been eagerly awaiting Saathiya's release.
A number of the scenes in Alaipayuthey brought a smile to your lips because of the interaction between the lovers.
I gave it a three because there was some effort put into it, just not enough to make an average movie.
It is not often that I watch a Bollywood movie in whole, simply because they are usually so embarrassing to watch even alone!
It is hard to get the 9 songs of this film out of your head once you watched the movie, not just because A. R. Rahman is a genius, but because the collaboration between him and the rest of the crew and cast has been just perfect.
As an added bonus, the film is much shorter than the usual Bollywood formulaic crap, and, because it has the ability to capture the viewer's attention and hold it to the end, the time just flies while you are having fun.
And this movie does not fail because of that.
It fails because of its predictability and absence of plot.
My girlfriend fell asleep in the middle of the movie because it was so boring.
I gave it 9 and not 10 because I did not like the hospital part.
The start of the flight is bumpy because he steers the ship right into the maintenence bay, then he zooms right past the Endor moon and right into a comet field.
On Broadway, perhaps its most disturbing element was its ending -- yet that was jettisoned for the film version because of the "moral" dictates of the times.
I am so tired of people applauding films just because they are old.
Hepburn has trouble making the big finish because she "chokes" when her boyfriend is around.
In the meantime she is completely psycho but it's sad because she cannot read.
On the surface she seems to be the perfect worker and an excellent cook, but underneath festers years of resentment at being mocked because she can't read.
compared to the TV series,this thing is crap.i couldn't get through it,i was so bored.it's just not exciting.there's no real suspense or excitement,at least up to the point i watched.that's really surprising,given the quality of the series.it takes place after season six,and before season seven,so i guess it's a season seven prequel.if you can get through it,i would recommend it,as it does fill in some gaps between the sixth and seventh season.i only know this,because in some scenes they allude to events that must have happened in the movie.for me,though it was just too difficult to get through.my vote for 24:Redemption is a 4/10
There are some rather humorous sequences rather than frightening because of some badly staged scenes.
Some people have told me that this is a great film because it is family entertainment - no violence or sex.
But the main thing I came away from this movie with, because we live in a relative universe, one can't know a good film until they see a number of bad flicks.
The film opened with an average opening in India, UK, and the USA, because it was released alongside the much-delayed star studded Kaante.
He's wacky, he wears strange outfits, and he's got a voice that they didn't dub because they couldn't find anyone to replace him.
If you've ever watched the Japanese ones, you know how quiet the stands are because everyone is intrigued; in this, it's just people standing up and cheering for no reason.
I'd heard many negative things about "Twilight of the Ice Nymphs", how it had nearly destroyed his career as a filmmaker, but I decided to give it a go anyways, if only because it was available on a DVD with both "The Heart of the World" and "Archangel".
This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era - the dialog is still stilted and clumsy, but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio.
I wish it had stayed that way, because once things start happening that is when the movie gets really annoying.
Like in all other British colonies, Africans were driven onto 'reservations' which went by various names, and mainly starved because a lack of land.
Oh and by the way, the reason why most of the White people in these series speak with South African accents, is because...
Most arable land in Kenya and Africa today is going untilled, because it is locked up in huge estates like in Thika, that belong to individual White people who do not have the capability to farm it all.
Largely because it is visually beautiful and very well photographed.
The sequence where the train was blown up was filmed on The Bluebell Railway in Sussex mostly because the filmmaker was given the track without disturbance from visitors.
Whatever you think of this misguided and silly film, please don't tell Mary Louis Parker, Billy Crudup's girlfriend, he stunk big time in this disaster because she might not like you, and hit you, the same way she hit some fan who was bad-mouthing Billy in his last stage appearance in New York.
Try to get involved in an Australian theme, one that you're more familiar with, and give us something more dignified than Charlotte Gray, who, by the way, doesn't even have to change her name at all because no one could have cared less if she was Gray, Brown, Green, Black, Blue, Black, or just plain Jane Doe!
The script essentially relies on sexual tension to function properly, and it doesn't, because the gentlemen cast opposite Kate are such bland pretty boys -- soap opera sidemen -- that you only feel uncomfortable for them when things start heating up in the bedroom.
The good-natured cab-driver's first scene seemed completely unbelievable because of the bad acting.
Saathiya, a movie that i wanted to see because of its beautiful songs.
My friend gave me the vcd of mistress of spice because i was bored.
I went to this film because it was advertised as being in the "Bend It Like Beckham" vein, which was not only a misleading come-on, but in the end also a film as ineffective as the real Beckham in the recent World Cup.
I don't think Dylan McDermott was the right guy because it was never convincing that she was THAT interested in him to break any rules.
As another reviewer here pointed out, we're in voice overs up to our eyeballs because of this film.
Ill keep it short because there isn't really much to say.
Therefore directors are remaking their own films in Hindi but are failing, as well, because there is too much South Indian touch (Nayak Â Mudhalvan; Rehna Tere Dil Main Â Minnale; Dil Hi Dil Mein Â Kadhal Dhinam; Doli Sajake Rakhna Â Aniathiypravu etc.).
I gave this a "4" because it was mildly entertaining.
Don't expect any great acting either, because there's NO acting.
But it's not long before Pinhead and two of his followers Â Bound and Chatterer (who are completely butchered because of lack of funding.
and the fact that everybody was familiar with the Hellraiser mythology (the main character Chelsea even mentions that cenobites could never attack her because she would never open the box... beside the fact that it's all just fiction).
You might think that's a good thing, but it's not, because the predictions I made were way better than the actual unfolding.
In fact, even if there was a good story, these flashy techniques would pull you right out of the film because all you can think about are the "clever" editing techniques.
Literally the instant Chelsea put her hand through that crack in the floorboards, I immediately relaxed, almost to the point of breathing a sigh of relief because I didn't have to worry anymore because I completely stopped caring.
And it's not just because she doesn't realize she's in a horror movie (despite the fact that the entire cast of this movie are hardcore Hellraiser fans, so the fourth wall has already been breached), it's because the moment her hand crosses the threshold of that crack in the boards she instantly ceases to be a victim.
When someone in a horror movie does something that stupid, it is generally because the filmmakers need to have the character killed off but can't think of a really clever way to have it happen, so they just have the character do something monumentally stupid, but the problem is that this places the blame for their death on themselves, and in a horror movie, it's not only not scary when someone is attacked after doing something as idiotic as putting her hand through the crack in the floorboards because she thinks she sees her dead friend down there, it's satisfying, and not in the good way either.
It starts out with the funeral of a college age kid having been killed because of his over-involvement in something called Hellworld, which itself is never very clearly explained.
The only reason I'm keeping the disc is because the incredibly hot female lead runs around in pleather pants for the duration of the film.
party run by Lance Henriksen who starts killing the kids off one by one because he blames them for the death of his son who poured gasoline on his body because Rick Botard wanted him to be in a Hellraiser sequel.
Ruling the world must leave one with more slack time than say, running your average restaurant, because he's on ready call to be a witness at the trial of the title.
This movie was just crazy, because I think that they could have made this movie a little better.
I started to watch this movie but gave up because it was so poorly made.
The answer is because Christians are delusional and others are realists.
This cartoon gave me a headache because I tried hard to understand what people were talking about.
And that's because this film is fundamentally a wish-fulfilment fantasy for - pardon me - fat, ugly, spoilt girls who don't look like Sandra Bullock at her messiest.
For you see, the Kraken's territory in "Deadly Waters" encompasses Desolation Passage because that's where the valuable opal rests in a shipwreck, and the monster attacks everyone who sails in this passage, whether their intentions are bad (like multiple treasure hunters) or harmless (like Ray's parents).
The reason why "Dealer" has been so successful in Hungary and elsewhere is probably because the issue of drugs is overpoliticised and it has been de facto taboo.
"Dealer" certainly has a different approach, because it makes you mostly laugh at, and/or - to a lesser extent - feel sorry for drug users, whereas the other movies were intended mostly to make you hate drugs (and/or - to a lesser extent - also feel sorry for drug users).
So this movie suits for both pro-drug and anti-drug people, because of not making any clear statements about the issue.
I watched this film because it was highly recommended.
Unfortunately watched this the other night on cable because there was little on, and I was trying to see if I could remember what I had seen some of the cast in before.
I will try to be brief about this film because I can't imagine anyone will ever really watch it.
The only reason I even rented soemthing like this is because the woman I am dating thought it looked good and she recommended it.
I hope the real story hasn't been tarnished because of an inadequate portrayal of it in a TV movie.
I wish this movie had been better because the story line is a very compelling one.
This movie was frustrating because of the slow moving story.
I watched it to the end because I really wanted to learn what happened.
It's not the genre it's the style with which it is done - audiences will watch Indy climb onto a submarine and still be on it hours later because the care about Indy and are engaged by the film.
I say these things because she sings three or four songs in here in the first 30-40 minutes and it is painful to hear.
You almost laugh out loud because it looks so fake.
*proud*  If you're going to watch this at all, just fast forward through all the bits with people in them and just admire the scenery (interiors don't count because they're not real).
My brother convinced me to sit and watch moving target and in the end i was pleased i did.It wasn't the god awful acting or the laughable dialogue that brought a smile to my face it was the fact that this movie was basically a remake of an earlier film of wilsons.By changing a few names,filming in a new location (uk) and mixing around a few scenarios they tried to pass this one off as a fresh idea.If you have seen bloodfist4-die trying there is no need to waste 90 minutes on this movie because if you've seen die trying your watching the same story...same ending... same man...just on a different continent,the only reason i kept watching was the constant laughter prevented me from being able to reach for the remote
Maybe it's because I just recently got into Indian soap operas.
Or maybe it's because I am comparing to the other domestic and foreign shows/movies that I've seen over the years.
I have tried several times to watch this movie because I am assured it's wonderful.
The X-wings you see in this attraction violate the laws of the Star Wars universe, because they launch to hyperspace in attack position  *END SPOILER*   The flaws aside though, this is a fun ride for the whole family that actually brings some characters from the movie in, though you wont see any Jedi battles, as this is a flight simulator which takes you on a rough space trip, to an explosive ending.
Now I wanted to see this because I was curious since I liked the original so much, it is such a classic that is very under rated.
Still, this movie gets only a 1/10, only getting the one because of how funny it is to watch.
I am glad to have learned the following 1) tequila can cure anything, 2) that body shots can perform miracles, 3)Joey Lawrence is still alive, and 4) that dreams really can come true in America because apparently anyone will give anybody a bunch a money to make anything no matter how crappy it is.
I did however enjoy this movie because my friends and I just mocked it so horribally.
For the most part THE BOX is not a bad film but its not a very good film either, plainly put I had mixed reactions about this film, it had a good concept, the acting was above par, it maintains a slow pace throughout but when it ended I felt really disappointed because I waited for something big to happen and it never did, there was no major car chase scenes but there were a few quick shootouts nothing more, there is just nothing to get overly excited about in this film.
But too many people think they should be actors, mainly because they see it as a lifestyle and a way to be the center of attention, not a job - laziness & privilege are what appeal to them.
But the main reason I thought Insurrection was fun was because I kept my expectations low (repeat after me, this is not Star Wars) and I was open to sci-fi that has some thought behind it.
The villains claim they don't want to co-inhabit the planet because "it would take ten years" to feel the effects, yet the Enterprise crew are significantly affected within hours!
This is mainly because the Baku, basking in regenerative radiation all day long, have remained relatively pretty while the Sona are now very ugly as the film takes pains to point out.
OK, so I went to see this movie because of Monica Bellucci, however, I am a Spike Lee fan.
For those who don't know what Cop Rock is it was a show that the creator of NYPD Blue created because i believe NBC or ABC i forget gave him a show for whatever he wanted because he took care of that station with NYPD Blue.
this is the only show ( at least i watched until now ) that not only helps to know how our favorite stars are... but also helps to develop the craft for professionals ( being and wanted to be ) and know the difficulty of the craft for non-professionals, you may ask why general public should know how difficult the craft is and that is because they are the people who comments ( usually bad ) on them.
Jack is a corporate employee with serious potential who finds himself unemployed because of his refusal to ignore the massive corporate corruption with which he suddenly finds himself surrounded.
First, it could be because he's been having too much sex, or second, it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it.
These interviews are wonderful because they are not the average "hollywood" interview.
Because you do feel these emotions through the movie... mainly because the script is so awful.
I'm sorry- while I don't doubt the rejuvenating qualities of swapping spit with Ms. Longoria, I think its effect was slightly exaggerated, because I don't really think that it could eliminate the horror of killing your best friend.
The film also was relevant to me because I am currently working on a report to the Premier of Ontario on the Roots of Youth Violence with Mr. Alvin Curling and the Chief Justice Roy McMurty (please see www.rootsofyouthviolence.on.ca).
I thought having the community discussion after the film was really important too because the film leaves you with a lot of hard questions and you want to talk about it.
Certainly this isn't the first film to do this, but that makes it even more problematic because by now filmmakers should know what to do and what not to do, particularly when you are working with the slasher genre.
By the time the action starts, I really didn't care because (a)I hated the characters and (b)I was half asleep.
It's a shame because this film could have been a decent slasher film if the director had remembered that is what he was making...not a WB teen drama.
I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone because it really bored me a lot and the ending was really cheesy.
If truth in advertising laws were applied to motion pictures, London By Night would have been titled Backlot By Day, because this is one of the least convincing London-set features made by any American studio.
The fight scene has to be one of the worst ever seen eg "Are Robin and Marion going to make that balcony whilst swinging on the bell rope or are they going to smash into the wall because the rope is too long ?
this movie is really weird because every time they fight there is comedy and the music does not go along well with the fight scenes and action!
Alfonso Bedoya is a joy to watch, as always, not because of his acting, which is abominable, but because it's so much fun trying to figure out what it is he's doing with his mouth to make him sound that way.
I can only assume the movie is so far rating at 7.3/10 after 30 votes is because every single member of the cast voted 10 for it.
(This film is confusing, because the audience doesn't know what the story is.)
No, because it makes no sense.
This also doesn't work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end.
Predictably, he has to work two jobs on the brink of exhaustion, because of Whitey's horrible oppression.
To everyone's surprise, Senay falls in love with Okwe but the affair doesn't work out because of Whitey's persecution.
A star was born because of that.
Another star had to wait a bit to be born because no one was as bright on the Three On a Match Set.
This movie was really bad, I think that the title fooled me because I thought that there would be at least more vampire call girls and more of a vampire acting but what I got was a bunch of boring sex scenes including a girl straddling a washing machine while some goof with glasses watches through a peep hole, a lady at a club watching the most horrible band in the world play with a guy playing a guitar with only one note and then she takes him back stage, or vice versa and straddles the guy.
It's because this version of the great detective is him in name only--almost nothing about him sees like the Holmes of the Conan Doyle stories.
The "contemporary" adaptation of a 17th century novel is always a good idea, because without the costumes, some details of the old times appear differently and helps us to see what really changed during theese centuries.
and this makes maybe a lot because the music has a certain importance here.
It is because of these features that audiences in countries all over the world believe that this little Canadian film, set in a downtown Toronto community, speaks directly to them and to their concerns and interests.
It always gives me hope to know that there are still Canadian executives who, like Diane Boehm, are prepared to take a chance on Canadian talent that is relatively unknown in our so-called "mainstream", simply because it is Canadian.
The only aspect that even halfway works is the film noir spoof, and that's primarily because Forsythe is so skilled as an actor that it would be difficult for material centered on him to completely fall apart.
Obviously, because it's a true story, everyone's nervous to criticise the storyline, to suggest that just perhaps, it really wasn't that tragic.
Well, hardly, although I admit the Irish actor Gerard McSorley's performance as John Gilligan, the man who supposedly ordered Veronica's murder, gives it a momentary kick, not because his character rings truer than anyone else's but because McSorley makes Gilligan such a monster he actually makes him entertaining which, of course, is the one thing this film should never be.
This movie gets a 3/10 only because of Esa Vuorinen's photo (superb) and Nadine Kirschon's debut as the young sister.
you should watch this film if your a war fan because its not a rubbish film but you will agree with me that its no way as good as other war classics  i really have no idea why this film won 2 academy awards either.
Sorry if I offended any of the actors with this, because this was clearly not their fault.
The only reason i would give this a two is because its so bad its laughable, and the monkey ninja is hilarious in the fact he doesn't actually do anything other than hop about like a monkey.
I was excited about this all last year because it was a collection of B-movies star to make you proud.
Problems in this film arise because there are loads of fights and most are from Don, while Mayid and the other leads have a lot less to do.
Lorenzo has a brief bit but he is essentially a cameo part, which is a shame because he is the best actor of the lot, by far.
I'd have preferred him in the lead because he fights better than Don.
The film is still reasonably fun though because it is so cheesy and they have some clichÃ©d and hokey drama in it that is so badly done you can't help but laugh.
There's a good reason why nobody makes movies like "The Lawnmower Man" and "Arcade" anymore, and that's because computers have become an integral part of our everyday life and nobody finds it scary anymore.
(What I know of city issues in Toronto come from my niece and nephew that live up there)   watching the move was refreshing because it really is a remarkable work of art, but at the same time I was frustrated because, I said to myself damn why is it they never try to show you Canada from this perspective  I would definitely recommend this movie here are some links about flick: ledaserenesnewz1.blogspot.com, awintertale.ca  Best thing about it was the Director and two of the actors were in the audience.
Apart from being crazy, he also lacks skin, and for some reason, every shot that contains him is blurry, either because they spent all their special effects money on pictures of the sun, or because the director was a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, and thought it was a good idea to recreate those fancy shaky-cam effects in a visually beautiful scifi-movie.
A computer that overheats because it doesn't shut down or go to power-save mode when cooling fails.
None of that matters though, because at the end it turns into "There's a madman on the ship!!!!"
It's a shame he didn't want to inject some humour and more action into the story also, because its quite heavy going.
The reason freezing instantly is rubbish is because the writers haven't realized that there is no heat loss by conduction (as in air) but only by radiation.
It loses direction - maybe because Danny Boyle is too busy looking over the computer graphics guys' shoulders and saying "Ooh, that looks cool.
It's such a shame that Sunshine ends up so incomprehensible and random because it is packed full of good ideas.
But it can be argued that these elements are not important, because the producers were trying for an art movie.
Smart people creating jeopardy by making dumb choices or nonsensically arbitrary decisions is less likely to evoke sympathy than smart people who find themselves in peril because of natural disasters or mechanical catastrophes.
because there's nothing else worth seeing!
So...I give this movie a 1, because IMDb doesn't have a 0.
I had a bad time watching it because of how poorly it all was done.
No doubt Brain Yuzna was the correct choice for this material given his taste for sex and violence, and this could have been a flashy showcase for his new Spanish production company as it looks fantastic (care of A Nightmare on Elm Street cinematographer, Jaques Haitkin) and has has some good FX, but the film goes down in flames fast because of Quinn's convoluted script that throws in everything but the kitchen sink but refuses to define its characters or tell a coherent story.
The reason why I say this is because I can relate to these things that happened in the movie from my own experience growing up in a troubled neighborhood.
The reason why I thought the movie was great was because it showed the struggle that we face on a daily basis, growing up and living in a troubled neighborhood.
It's not even good for MST-style humor, because the cast and crew seem to be taking themselves far too seriously.
to some up, this show is so totally unbelievable and torturous to watch, and not because of the vampires and voo-doo zombies.
I watched this movie several times because it didn't flow well at all but it had some great information in it.
It has something to do with Dracula taking over as the head of all the monsters or something, but I'm not sure because its not very good, and I lost interest in anything that was going on.
I can't really suggest anyone actually watch this movie because its a bit of a bore.
I give it 4 out of 10 because of the music and the curiosity value, but there always is the album and then again there are some movies best left unseen.
THE CRAVING, when it was released in the states was horribly butchered because of its violent content.
If you've ever wondered why there hasn't been a re-release of this for the digital age, STOP, because people often find themselves getting exactly what they asked for and regretting it.
Not only because it happens in winter (hence snow) and not only because the world of this small black Toronto community gets shaken (as snow globes do) by the accidental shooting death of a young child ... but also because of the closeness and intimacy of everything.
He keeps quoting poetry and claiming that Shakespeare and Whitman must have both been vampires because he really understands their poetry.
It's kind of pathetic because he can never find anyone else that cares about his poetry fascination.
Don't know why I have watched this film more than once because I always get so mad~~~which is pretty silly.
I must speak to her about it," and chastises her daughter about her abhorrent behavior, but if you don't listen carefully you'll think she's discussing the weather or the latest fashions because I never heard anyone get such a calm and polite scolding.
At first glance, you start watching this movie and wonder if you accidentally turned to the Idiot Channel, because you can't possibly imagine someone actually getting PAID so much to act so poorly.
You probably think you've seen this premise a million times before but it's not really a plot that's been filmed all that many times , probably because it's so weak and obvious which leads me to be confused as to how it survived its pitch .
Ultimately the film is a let down because nothing really happens.
What might have been an excellent detective thriller turns to unwatchable slush halfway through because of an utterly ludicrous romance plot.
By the way, though it was probably NOT intended, in the scene towards the very end of the film my family and I laughed because by the way the dialog was written there sure seemed to be a gay subtext.
I bought this movie at Wal-Mart for a dollar because it had Vincent Price on the cover.
Aside from this, I feel sad for Frank O'Brien because it seems as if he, and his slowness, are just being used and exploited for the amusement of the crew and the viewers.
Well, the reason why that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum is because it blatantly isn't true.
Too bad they did not release a soundtrack CD because the music is the only redeeming thing about this movie.
Most high school class project films are better than this-if only because they have a shorter running length.
My sister recommended this movie to me because she thought it was awesome but I thought otherwise.
It might actually be that people who clap themselves are educationally subnormal rather than believers in one country socialist democide   The second point about being a philosopher is being able to state the painfully obvious , as in " the more coke you drink the more thirsty you feel therefore the more coke you will drink the thirstier you will become " To be fair to Zizek he does point out out that there is decaffeinated coke but no one spends a great deal of time and money drinking decaf , we drink coke because caffeine is an addictive drink and thirst has nothing to do with it .
In fact Mr Zizek comes across as one of those people who if he were discussing films shouts down everyone else's opinions because " The lighting makes San Francisco look like Los Angeles so that's not the Golden Gate bridge in the background " You can't disagree with his arguments because you're not sure what he's talking about   And as a footnote Mr Zizek apparently makes a considerable living on touring seminars .
It might be a good idea to watch ZIZEK before you pay money to attend one of his classes because I'm sure you'll here the same things said down the pub
This show is a piece of trash,I hate it when people try to tell you what to do and how you live your life.It is cloths people,wear what you want.If you like it and it fells good than power to you.Yes,there is some place where you have dress codes.There should be no rules in they why you present your self,express yourself they way you like.The one thing I hate is that women Stacy,she seams to be very uptight and make very rude comments.So,what if the cloths do not fit her shape.if the girl like it than power to her.Clinton is OK but some times he kind of sounds to posh and act like he is the cream Dee la cream.The other thing is that some of the cloths are far too darn expensive.No one is going to buy a skirt that cost a person $500 dollars.no one can afford it.A person beauty is in the inside , not because she wears the latest designer cloths.At the end of the day beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Sorry but Stacy and Clinton get faces out of TV.We need to except people for who they are and what they like.
If any directors want to have a good movie despite his bad editing, Kubrick's movie was a bit long, not well edited in many scenes, he still won the day because his premise for the story was strong and plot elements were there to prove his premise, which buildup to a strong message or a theme of the overall masterpiece, which we can sum up in few words, such as in Dr. Strangelove, that an accidental holocaust can happen.
OK So I saw this movie because Angie Everhart was in it.
I just want to cry because I spent $4 renting it...
I originally watched this movie because I loved watching Skeet Ulrich in the TV series "Miracles" (another great & provocative series cancelled by the U.S. networks, way before it's time), and wanted to see some more of his work.
It didn't help that I didn't really care for anyone in the film and found myself feeling pity for our anti-hero because he was "in love" with someone who seems rather dull.
The crowd is enraptured by a man preaching hate speech, satirical or not, and you know that the predominantly white, male crowd is the kind of people who are given all the chances in the world, but fail because they're idiots, and instead choose to blame every minority they can think of: women, the handicapped, women, the Japanese, women, the sick, women, midgets, and of course, women.
In one scene, when Donny is pointing out to Marie someone who might have been one of the criminals chasing them in an earlier scene, she says she can't see them because she's not wearing her glasses?
She can't need glasses too much, because she wasn't wearing them for the whole movie.
I bought it at HMV in the summer and bought it because I owned the series on DVD and TEoE.
I was excited and I nearly shat myself because it said "107 Minutes", and I thought it was a movie, and it had an 18A rating (I'm from Canada, mind you).
Either way I find this negativity sad, because I really did like the series.
So this is basically my first Spoiler-free review, because really there's nothing at all to spoil.
I didn't totally trash it because I thought some of the acting was decent and seeing a real SWAT team was pretty cool for a no budget movie.
Another reason I didn't give it a low score of 1 because of a short that is on the DVD which in turn was pretty good.
Anyway, this Pusher 2, of which I hear the only reason they made this, is that they thought they could big money on a sequel and they needed it because their production company's Fear X was a big flop in America.
It is also inaccurate to call this show "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever", because after it was released at least a dozen more "awesomely bad songs" appeared on the radio.
You would actually have to compliment the writers for making such a disgusting film, because to my knowledge no being who had any semblence of dignity could be capable of making such a horrible movie.
It's fortunate that this was not Marlon Brando's first role because it might have short-circuited an otherwise brilliant career.This movie was not a dream, but a nightmare.
With the exception of "Hairspray" which was tolerable only because of Ricki Lake, John Waters's movies go straight over my head.
This is when you think it can't have been a True Story because it starts to get into the realms of fiction with plots and subplots based on the storyline of a woman lusting after her lawyer who tells her he's happily married.We find out later he DID once have an affair which nearly destroyed him.
It's a better research problem than murder because we can all understand why someone might kill someone for personal reasons.
Just because some industry bigwig thought she was photogenic and popular with teenagers, she was cast in this picture.
I'm sorry I can't tell you about the rest of the film, I switched it off after that...   NOT because I was offended or repulsed, but because the big 'surprise' had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with what had gone before it.
All the cursing of him turned really on my nerves because it didn't seem to be necessary.
The Oscar for the best screenplay is not earned because there are things I already have counted up.
And even when you don't know what will happen, which you now know because I said it, it is also not worth the time.
Perhaps the main reason I was so disappointed was because at moments the screenshots, dialogue and directing seemed superb.
It is being suggested that even though the film contains hardly (if any) entertainment value, it should be accepted because of its artistic quality.
Overall action movies are always very similar and predictable, and this movie is too predictable, perhaps that is the only big weakness of this movie, because who can deny there is something special with Die Hard.
This is harder for me as well, because I typically love these types of movies.
Already you're assuming that Americans will actually watch your movie just because it's in English, and on top of that, you're assuming that the bourgeois depiction of the 'victims' would be more fitting in American theaters.
It did not even justify a nihilistic view, because the way in which the movie was made, especially the semi-surrealism of the actual events and the 'rewind' feature, at least reveals intent in creating a point.
Why does the Coroner fire Ray because he ordered a RUSH blood test?
The Sheriff of Nottingham was the main villain (I don't think he could ever play a good guy with his expressions but just as well because he's always perfect as a downright evil mastermind).
All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze.
I thought it was cool that the father from "Family Matters" (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures.
That said, if this movie wasn't so poorly acted and mis-cast, this might have been more watchable, because the plot is interesting enough, exploring male roles and male sexuality.
I don't know why the writers think that just because someone is Mexican or Chinese or whatever that they will end up being corrupt in the name of culture and tradition and honor and blah blah blah.
I only gave this movie a 4, but that's mainly because it was kind of slow.
If you're looking for a movie to watch when you're really feeling like simple humor and not too much thinking to do, this is it, else don't do it because you won't survive for an hour and a half.
If I ran NBC, I'd broadcast the show in weekend mornings for little kids to watch, because that's just what this show is for.
Therefore it is not science fiction, because it is not based on science and only disgraces the noble sci-fi name.
But with John in the building, he's gonna have a hard time because John is on his case will make sure to give him a roller coaster of a crime bust.
Nikki also became popular with the men, probably because of that lovely crotch shot in the first episode, so they continued on her dull struggle to keep from becoming her alter ego, take care of her son and to not go to jail, when they finally put her in there, she murders some couple guards or something, and then... they release her!
It wasn't original in any way (Basically X-men brought more realistically because of low Special Effects budget), but it managed to peak my interest.
This kind of urge isn't like drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, etc because this is an urge that WE WERE BORN HAVING.
According to the interviews in the movie, the reason why pornography apparently "destroys families" is because whenever they get close to their spouse / loved one, they feel ashamed of their porn addiction (two people interviewed claimed that this was their problem).
I'm glad they didn't have Bow Wow dunking too much, because it does look fake.
I must see some of Jess Francos older movies because he must have made something better before otherwise he could not be working anymore.
High School Hellcats is one of those films from the fifties you took a date to in a drive-in because you had other things on your mind and didn't want to miss anything good.
The movie is dreadful, because by the end of the movie you'll wish you never seen it cause it is too slow and boring.
This is almost scary, because we can ask ourselves: "How could we beat this...
It all got a blind-eye instant greenlight because Fred Fuchs signed up his name knowing he'd make a quick buck because Peyton had a deal with Tom Hank's PLAYTONE and the big name recognition that brings (Hanks needed a Tim Burton rip-off for some project).
The only reason I gave it 2 stars, and not 1, is because the animation is beautiful.
Only Aldous had a few funny lines and I liked the Seymour character mainly because he was mute.
So it's not as if I won't like something just because it's religious.
It's a shame the casting is so poor because the film had potential.
She changed her name to Calista because it sounded "hot" like a porn star name?
The only conceivable way to enjoy this movie is with a lot of alcohol, because really it's so ridiculous and bad it's just downright funny.
I found it pretty boring because what to like about.
Not much because it's been done before.
I bought this movie for Australian $15 a few years ago, most like it's $10 now because it wasn't that good or popular.
I Just wish this movie could have a better storyline because "saving the forest" has been done before and it's common to viewers.
But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before.
It's more like a repressed memory now, and I only commented here because I was trying to find out what the Spanish Orangutan in the first movie was saying.
I find the more unlikely cop shows, like Castle and The Mentalist, more enjoyable simply because they are different.
Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's marvellous performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader.
And it sucks because of the premise, because of the exploitation of the lower instincts left in the human body and mostly because of the all knowing detective genius Vincent D'Onofrio.
I rarely see really bad movies... because no matter how bad a movie is, I always try to overlook the flaws and focus on the merits instead, then it becomes a not so bad movie.
But I'm not giving it the lowest because there were still some elements that could've been worse.
Jesse (Jonathon Trent) has always been interested in the hotel & drawn to the mystery surrounding the still unsolved murders, he has convinced some of his high school mates to accompany him, during the middle of the night of course because going there during the day when it was light would just be silly.
It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies.
I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience .
The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases.
The plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero.
I watched this on TV a couple of months of ago and then recently after the trial was over, I watched it again because a friend of mine had a tape of it.
They are seen as people who turn on Scott very quickly, because of his selling of Laci's car and his affair with Amber Frey.
OK, is that guy upset because they just killed....uh...his father?his brother?
The only reason why it is made is because the DVD looks good in a cult-collection like mine.
Dracula is to well known in Romania to be able to locate a virgin, so together with his servant Anton (Arno Juerging) he sets out to Italy to find one, because of the Italians strict religious upbringing they believe the chances of finding a virgin will be high.
"Die Hard" succeeds is because it presents every challenge McClane has to face realistically and clearly.
I rented this movie, because I am always drawn to movies of the 40's/50's era.
Lahr does not appear on screen in this film, perhaps because his somewhat comical facial features would remind audiences of his father Bert Lahr.
I'd say see the film for Haas' performance, because the rest of this mediocre effort isn't worth your time.
It had no humor, bad makeup and I thought I was watching a forest because of all the wooden objects that were trying to act!
Hitchcock always had a motive for his villains, Stephin King even wrote reasons why his insane creatures and villains did what they did, Roland Copping chooses to be a jerk because... of a roll of the dice.
I only give it a three because Collins surprised me with his acting chops (Haven't seen Buster yet) and can play a jerk very well.
One could claim that 1988's "Die Hard" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an "x" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.
Of course she is correct and has a valid point, but the movie unevenly makes her out to be the villain of the story because of that viewpoint.
I reiterate when I say that Burt Reynolds should probably get a new agent, because he has been in and can be in better movies.
God I'm done with plot summary because frankly thats about as deep as it goes, afterwards people fight panties are shown and nonsense is spoken.
because they talk about the story plot which doesn't make any sense and is just stuck up its own poop shoot to realize it.
This wallow is an "erotic thriller" and we can be certain of that because it is called so upon the home video box.
The younger of the brothers, Will (Andrew Stevens, who also produces here as well as contributing heavily to the screenplay), a rather artless character, does in fact espy Nikki in flagrante delicto, but this apparently fortuitous event for Brian is nullified because Will has succumbed to the physical charms of the wayward wife and has decided to withhold the evidential tape from the musician and his attorney, played by able supporting player Paul Carr, causing a viewer to recognize that the lovestruck security guard can not be considered as an example of rectitude.
The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.
The songs in the movie are really bad, which is weird because the musical score is quite pretty.
INNOCENCE: an organist hops into the sack with his old girlfriend because he misses his deceased wife.
Maynard pursued Teach because of a $1000 bounty (in 1718) offered by the Governor of Virginia to anyone who would capture and/or kill Blackbeard.
I hated this movie from start to finish, because I quickly learned that Blackbeard was a Captain Jack Sparrow wannabe.
A basic understanding would mean knowing the name of the ship he's associated with the most (Queen Anne's Revenge, which was a French ship he captured and renamed), he's associated with the then English colony of North Carolina among other places, that the governor of the colony of Virginia sent Maynard after him because the governor of NC was to friendly with him.
I don't usually write comments because most movies have at least one point, or moral, or meaning of something of common interest!
because if that's the case then I retract my statement.
And what the hell is up with you guys and the "hot chicks" A movie has never been better because of "hot chicks" Rent a porno flick, at least they have better plots!
Just because you don't figure out the killer, doesn't make it a plot-twist when you find out who it is.
If there even was a plot-twist it must have been a pretty dull one, because I missed it completely.
Contemporary viewers will find the forced insertion of Trevor into most of the scenes rather puzzling, at least in part because she has little going for herself as an actress or a screen presence.
I gave this movie a 3, instead of a 1, but only because they got this movie made and released with practically no budget, which I respect.
I also admit that this Ron Marchini film is far, far better than an earlier film I saw that that he "starred" in ("Death Machines") because he actually has dialog to deliver in this one (in "DM" he was a silent zombie killing machine) and he gets to kick people in the face on a regular basis (where in DM, the actual fights were few and dully staged).
"Karate Cop" is also better in two ways than the stream of similar post-apocalyptic themed Italian rip-offs of "Max Max" and "Escape From New York" because it appears to have been made by Americans.
That said, my circle of friends enjoyed this movie because we have a soft spot for god-awful movies.
The many Shinya Tsukamoto's films (such as "Snake of June","Tokyo fist","Tetsuo" and others) appears psychological exploration of "love triangle" situation.Unusial in "Gemini" absence urban constituent.Therefore "Gemini" is not hypertrophied as "Tokyo fist",not surreal as "Tetsuo" and not so atmosphere as "Snake of June".Total is not so intensive as others Tsukamoto's works.But it is a good movie because qualified lighted , acted and cinematographied.Pleasant momentary turn (by using equipment in manner sci-fi movie) from "historical film" to "modern" (plague child scene).Synthetical music soundtrack is the part of "urban" instruments of director Tsukamoto.
They may have taken the "100 monkeys at typewriters" metaphor literally, because that is the only remotely feasible explanation I can come up with for this nonsense.
Good, I'll keep mentioning it because it really is that bad.
Through dialog and flashbacks we learn that the mystery man is his long-lost brother, abandoned by his family because of a snake-shaped deformity on his leg.
You can clearly see that this movie is made by amateurs, first of all the lighting is really bad, at one point you can't even see the person being film because the sun whites out the camera.
Maybe this is a concept movie because by the time it was over I was waiting for a serial slayer to come and put me out of my misery.
It's a shame because Melanie Lynsky is a great actress and she deserves better film projects.
Judith O'Dea of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD fame must have really needed some money to supplement her retirement pension when she made this because this is the most embarrassing production any actress of her ilk could have appeared in.
I actually feel a little bad reviewing this because I feel I'm only advertising it somewhat...like a lot of people curiosity got the better of me after reading the reviews...I have to say though it's a work of genius from the director to film a LOW low budget film and then come on here and deny he knew what the final cut of the film looked like...that had me on the floor...what great directing that is...
The three girls in it are outgunning each other to see who can play it worse...I give it to the girl with the glasses simply because of the glasses..they just add that bit of unbelievability that clinches it for me...the plot is thinner than Kojack's wig...the script was written by someone clearly drunk...and the score...well...defies belief.
It also has very high saturation, not to hide the action as other reviews might suggest, but because the lighting guy mows lawns on the weekend.
The main reason for this is that we, as the audience, don't care about the characters, mainly because we can tell that they are not really afraid about their circumstances.
It's just randomly thrown in there because the director though he had to put it in there somewhere.
Sought it out because of a friend of a friend, but wasn't impressed.
However, apparently nobody drives through this neighborhood (including cops, who should probably be patroling the area), because nobody notices a guy on the roof in broad daylight.
I honestly reckon I could sit here for around 3 hours typing up problems with this movie movie but I won't bother because it wasn't worth it.
The "Making of" featurette (excuse me, I had to chuckle there for a second) is more entertaining than the feature itself, generally because it allows the viewer to see that the movie was a joke to the cast and crew, but the joke was on us.
This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era - the dialog is still stilted and clumsy, but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio.
I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it!
Ironically because of what Shore does, Judge Abe Vigoda does declare a mistrial.
I don't know if its fully on its own terms or simply that its not another Japanese or Asian horror film with a long hair female ghost lurking about, honestly I don't care because the film is just so damn good it wouldn't really matter anyway.
Watson did not look like he had retired because of health after a long hitch in India.
Perhaps that's part of the problem then, because in every film version I've seen (save, perhaps, for the Jeremy Brett Granada one, where the hound looked as though it merely wanted a Milk-Bone and a nice tummy rub), scriptwriters can't resist the temptation to add dubious "improvements" to Sir Arthur's masterwork.
I don't know why it was called "The Hound of the Baskervilles" as it bore little resemblance to the well-known story of that name, nor why the main characters were named Holmes and Watson because they could just as easily have been called Jones and Bloggs and be done with it - they had nothing in common with the well-developed written characters of Holmes and Watson at all.
It's easy to tell where this latest version of Conan Doyle's perennial classic goes wrong because so little goes right.
The film was originally slated to be less than feature-length, but because of the director's resourcefulness, it was lengthened to a running-time of 83-minutes.
I also thought the point about the "quacks" was interesting because it's harder today to figure out if a doctor is a quack since we have such a high rate of suing for malpractice.
In other words, the message really is, "Don't have sex because scary things can happen.
The husband is left blind and the baby is clinging to life--all because of the dreaded syphilis!
I wanted to love Vacation, I truly did.Seeing as how everyone thought it was a magnificent movie, I wanted to think it was a magnificent movie as well, but instead it turned out that I thought Vacation is pure crap.Nothing was funny.I laughed at maybe one thing.Also, it couldn't keep my interest, and it was "REALLY" boring.I was pausing the movie continuously, because I wanted to get up and do something, for I was about to fall asleep.The acting was good, and the script is somewhat original, but there was a lot of unnecessary material as well, and overall I found this to be a pretty terrible movie.Don't waste your time on it.
If it weren't for the excessive profanity, this could've easily covered the PG-13 market because the gore is missing.
And, Benny must have 9 lives, because there are at least three different instances where, for all intensive purposes, he should've been killed.
I'm hesitating to call LEATHERFACE TCM 3 the worst TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies because I watched TCM 4 after this one.
The story of Leatherface and his family told in the original movie was pretty horrifying but perhaps not realized to its fullest ability because of budget and technological limitations, so it would seem that remaking it with a better budget and technology would work, but, besides the factor of the film not looking "right" with a better film-stock and higher budget, the higher budget meant there was more financial influence, which more simply means it was cut to ribbons by the censors (what's the point of supposedly-brutal killing scenes if there's barely any gore in the film at all?!
It's not as over the top as any of the other movies, and because of that grows boring very fast.
I can't write much because basically nothing happens.
Believe me, reading the plot summaries to this film, especially the back of the DVD, make the film so much funnier because the film is nothing like what the film creators want you to think.
I ended up giving this a rating of three only because of its comical value - if you don't make this an interactive film, by which I mean talk about it and make fun of it as it plays, you will be bored.
It occurs to me, that this film implies a racist latency, because only white men are saved from the Flood.
Linda Blair has undergone quite an amazing transformation since the first "Exorcist", but this inconsequential, goofy, utterly predictable comedy is easily forgotten a few hours after it's over, because it has no plot and no weight whatsoever.
The only reason why I watched it was because of Christina Lindberg.
It was funny, not because of the dialouge, but the dinosaur.
You can't even laugh about how bad it is, because the repetitive 'gags', the randomly stuck together scenes and the dialogues are just plain dull.
...because it saved me the price of an entrance ticket.
I'm not entirely entitled posting here because I turned it of after about half an hour.
I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film, however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.
The endless rap jokes go on and on because the idiotic writers cant be bothered to think of anything else.
It hasn't been taken down yet, because no one cares about it.
The first two Scary Movies were funny because they didn't let the flat parts slow them down.
Scary Movie 2 contained a number of bad jokes, but it was okay because the filmmakers had a general idea of where they wanted to take the "story", and at least made a concentrated effort to tone down the absurdist humor in places where it wasn't needed.
I'm honestly not sure whether this review is in fact spoiling anything, because the trailer does a pretty good job of that on its own.
I give this one four stars, solely because of Tom Sizemore who, for me, was the only interesting thing in this whole film.
Don't suspect anybody because I can assure you the director and writers have gone out of their way to really throw you off.
At one time Abe Lincoln uses a time machine to hunt down Bart and try to kill him, maybe because Bart resembles John Wilkes Boothe.
I stress the word basic and not simple because simple things can be very beautiful and interesting, however, this movie has no depth, explores the drug world in a futile way and as a detective story it did not convince me.
I didn't give it a lower vote because with all its flaws it still entertained me for a while (it was a Sunday night).
In fact, as I watched the film, I kept found myself falling asleep because there wasn't much to interest me and the lack of incidental music made the film seem very static and subdued.
I suppose I fancied Linda Blair in it, but other than that the only reason I liked it was because it was simple fun, not to be taken seriously.
This whole short is built on and relies on the prospect of Temple's being cute enough to entertain most viewers and get a laugh because there's sure very little else here to really laugh about.
Shirley tags along, the curious little sister who wants to go hang out with the big kids, and ends up running into a strangely well-dressed but crazy man in the desert, who struggles to get her to ask him silly questions but fails because she already knows the answer.
My theory is that they just needed a reason to have a man diving into a mirage that is really just hot sand to add to the sight gag of the kids plowing a wooden shack to the ground because they thought it was a mirage, just like the cavernous mansion that disappeared before their eyes earlier.
I think her cuteness worked against her in some ways, because she's been in many films which have little else to offer.
The soundtrack has been over-dubbed subsequent to filming, presumably because the local actresses accents were too heavy to be understood.
The only redeemable quality of the movie is O'Hearn himself, but not because of his acting ability or skill with martial arts and clearly not for his theatrical fighting abilities.
Roller Boogie was brilliant for me, because it was cheesy , but most of all one of the very rare films that focused on roller skating - a tough subject to inject into a movie!
If you can tolerate the near hour and a half of convoluted yammering of the characters (because that's all there is), then you'll probably be able to get through it.
I'm glad I saw it before "Slackers" because otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.
This movie is mainly a comedy, or at least I thought so, because I was not frightened one bit.
this is like a bad sequel around the lines of leprechaun in space, but i forgave that movie simply because the first one was good but this on the other hand you cant forgive it trys way to hard at times and throws a little blood and boobs ur way every now and then to keep u watching, a part made me smile close to the end because it was simply a scene stolen from dead silence.
This gets a 3 because it isn't totally unwatchable--it's definitely better than "Xanadu" and the opening sequence with the kids skating through the streets IS fun.
Stay away from this film unless you love the worst films out there or this is going to be the first film you will ever watch because from here the only way is up and for the Triloquist I don't think it could get any lower.
The reason that budget horror flicks remain as popular as they are is because they are usually over the top.
From here on the movie takes very lame twists and turns, it wasn't even fun to predict who would die or what would happen next because it was so predictable.
It was somewhat of a hit at the time because roller disco was a big thing in the late 1970s, but this film came at the end of the decade and was a critical failure.
This film had me looking forward to it, not because I'm a Red Sox or Yankees lover/hater, but because I really like baseball.
They just sit there emotionless...probably because it happened a month earlier and the "fans" couldn't recreate the raw feelings they had that October night.
There were hilarious moments when the camera was trying to get the natural vantage point of an off road race, but because of the wind all you could see were tires and dust because tree branches covered the screen.
But no one manages to channel the glib repartee into anything resembling a character, in part because their contributions are mere slivers of celluloid crammed between pictures of cars driving around.
The filming quality even is mediocre because it looks like it was shot in the 1980s.
Perhaps Flight 93 was a magic plane, because there were no cell phone calls reported coming from the other three planes that were hijacked that day.
Say what you will about the terrorists (I'm sure you do), but they brought a certain unity to families that day Â let's face it, any factor that compels that many people to say "I love you" to one another, must be doing something along the lines of Christmas Â that's the only other time you'll hear so many insincere sentiments, expressed because "it's the right thing to say" in deference to the circumstances.
I really have nothing more to say but I'm going to type this because IMDb has this weird 10 line minimum so here goes.
Yes, I rated this a 7 out of a 10....I only gave it a 7 because I haven't seen it since I was 7 years old......don't know if it's the 10 I used to think it was hee hee I loved Roller Boogie hee hee...I must have watched that movie a million times when I was a kid.
Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI, said: 'The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden's Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.
He has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9/11 because the FBI has no hard evidence connected Bin Laden to 9/11'" ÂEd Haas, Muckraker Report, "FBI says, 'No hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11'," June 6, 2006 http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/terbinladen.htm  "We've never made the case, or argued the case that somehow Osama bin Laden was directly involved in 9/11.
Now either Argenbright Security was bent, United was in on the deal, or there was no bomb-belt, because otherwise the relatives would be going berserk with lawsuits.
Even the ending (my wife would not turn the channel because Brad pitt was on the screen) was painfully bad.
I'm going to guess that 'Cutting Class' became a cult classic only because it stars a very young pretty boy that we all know as Brad Pitt.
"Cutting Class," the directorial debut of "Excalibur" screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg, receives a failing grade because it doesn't know what it wants to be: a slasher flick, a comedy, a teen drama, or a hybrid of all three.
Maybe because it's Brad Pitt!
this movie should have been called 'we're stupid because we let a psycho killer who killed his father back into school where people will get killed'.
This movie is a nightmare that you don't wake up from, but its one of those weird psychedelic nightmares that you just have to sit through because its so surreal...Check out the costumes...God awful, especially the overweight bike cop who wears SHORT shorts.
"Cutting Class" does not deserve the cult classic status because it isn't.
Not too long people are disappearing and bodies are piling up at Wurley High and Brian is first to be accused by Dwight because of his disturbing past.
Directed by potboiler specialist Mark L. Lester, this ultimate cheese of a roller disco musical avoids a permanent home in the video junk heap simply because of the sheer idiocy of the storyline and the wealth of unintentional humor permeating the film.
Of course, it helps her professional standing that she is playing opposite real-life roller skating champion Jim Bray, a non-actor who was cast as Bobby only because the producers could not find a leading man who could actually skate.
I felt this was a very average quasi-silent movie that is in our hands today because the production design was a little more novel than most.
I say quasi-silent because the sound appears in concentrated, intermittent segments.
Having just watched the first 4 episodes on Sci-Fi, just to see what the big deal was all about ( and because the writer strike ), I can not fathom why there was such a strong call for this show to be "saved".
In my opinion there's a very good reason for the show being canceled, they took a bulletproof and a very appealing back story and messed it up, nothing was good but i kept watching because i loved the fact i was watching a post nuclear based TV-show.
I hope that it finds it's center and gets better because I think the premise of nuclear survival is much more interesting now than just a few years ago.
I suppose you should be thankful if you can't relate to what's going on in this film because it probably means you've never had to tip-toe into some middle manager's office on a Friday afternoon to get a signature on your time card.
I'm fascinated by this show partly because I am a big fan of post-apocalyptic fiction (Alas Babylon, The Day After, Testament, The Last Ship, Threads, On the Beach, etc).
A barn full of horses is a time-consuming high-maintenance endeavor, not some place you visit in the fourth episode because you need to get Jake Green worked up.
The bias of this film is demonstrated by its maker's position that the American press was itself biased because it focused on the tragedy caused by the deaths of Americans who died in the incursion.
i wanted more bad acting for the Willmeister, because he does it like nobody else can.
How would I grade this movie?As a horror film,it fails completely.It never provided me with one scene of anything resembling horror,or fright.If it had been a satire, I might have given it a 3,but if it is satirical,then it is only accidentally so.As a comedy,it would get a 2,but I think the things I found funniest,were things the film maker wanted me to take seriously.So I have to stick with a one,but only because there isn't a lower number to give it.rp
As they talk about the rain, his father stumbles home as his face starts to melt and he starts mumbling about some book and to give it to this man that is the high priest of some Satanic cult because it righfully belongs to him.
I can't really give The Devil's Rain more than three stars because it is mostly dull and confusing.
Boy - this one scared me - because - it shows what can happen in a blink of an eye.
I myself had never heard of such nonsense -- maybe because as far as I know, there is no such thing and the only earthbound element that the Devil is associated with is the "fire and brimstone" of dark, Miltonesque poems and the well-known "Garden of Earthly Delights" of Hieronymous Bosch, featured in the opening titles.
Well, it surely was but in some odd way it was also watchable because it had a certain stupid charm.
Whether they melted because they are Goons-of-Hell deprived of their holy watermelon, or just because they live in Arizona and are unused to precipitation is not explained.
I know it's only a fantasy film but, still, if you know the slightest thing about baseball this movie can be annoying at times because ballplayers would NOT act like this.
I always wonder why they didn't use the front of the school (could have covered up the school name) because the view from across the street would have been nice.
Ultimately, the movie loses you because it never explains why Eddie disappeared, what made him a genius, or what was eating him before he ever became a singer.
This was a ridiculous version of male hustlers and other assorted homeless teens because it is done in such a clean-cut manner.
A gay young man, he likes Johnny, but is consistently obsessed with the idea that maybe Johnny isn't going to carry on the deep friendship Eric imagines simply because Johnny is straight.
And if you can't follow the plot, don't worry, because the Worst Narrator of All Time will be happy to spell it out for you.
Bottom line, don't watch this movie unless you're trying to ruin your night/date/relationship with your in laws etc , because after seeing it you'll feel like you wasted your life, and the people watching it with you will wonder if you're on crack.
I gave it a "2," only because the opening sequence was pretty well done.
watching this movie was like staring at someone who looks horrible because you cannot believe that a person could be in public looking that horrible.
The fact that Ranger Jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because Tiny , despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!
I'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming.
Which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens.
This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.
These things are missing because it's Tom Cruise Vs the rest of the world.
I can't even be entertained anymore, because I am acutely aware of how shallow, empty, and ultimately pretentious it all is.
It's a shame because I like Tom Cruse.
And, I do not dislike this movie solely because of the rampant anti-Americanism.
The brother and sister (well sort of) begin a romantic interlude because deep films have love scenes -- right?
- because I really wanted to like this after everything I've heard, my love of French cinema, and the fact that John Turturro is one of the best actors out there.
People who are into porn don't like them because they don't "show anything" and people are *aren't* into porn are going to be bored out of their minds.
They run free because the alcoholic assistant to the doctor left a door open by which a few of the creatures made their escape, and with their prolific reproductive prowess, have turned into a couple hundred ravenous killer shrews.
Yes, it'll star someone like Jennifer Lopez (I mention her name because her pretty face is in one of the Celeb Photos on this Web page) and the person who remakes it will probably marry her too!
The Mexican dude wakes up Rosco because one Â only one Â carpet dog got in through the window and went down into the cellar.
He knows this because the window and cellar door were open.
I won't recount the plot - such as it is - of this campy classic, because several others have already done so.
If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it.
The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end.
The basic plot has a white ninja battling a dark ninja group because the bad ninjas want to take the land where they think their secret wealth was hidden after it was stolen many years earlier (this doesn't take into account the fact the bad ninjas kill the good ninja's wife because she can't tell them where he is).
Unfortunately,after twenty minutes the laughter begins to wane because the movie is just so bad it over whelms any unintentional humor.
The anticipation builds every second after that because of what the director has shown us what happens to those who have been given the potion, and we fear for Dr. Allen.
To really get into a movie like Serpent and the rainbow, I think the subject matter just has to be interesting to people to enjoy this, but even then, I think many will have problems because it is simply to hard to follow and many parts don't make any sense.
Well, Technically because according to rumors had it that It was suppose to be an education cartoon about Homosexuals.
Spongebob always Acts happy because He's gay Well, I don't know why but I think He and Patrick are boyfriends.
If you're going to judge this show, judge it by older seasons 1 through 3,not the current episodes, because that greatness can't be compared to what Spongebob is now.
I did like the part, though, when that dyke's body splits in half just because she smashes into a tree branch, that part was both stupid and hilarious at the same time!
And, yes, like some other reviewers, I too could not wait for several of the characters to meet their demise because they were SO annoying.
I give it a three because, well it's a horror movie after all, invite some friends over and watch it with pop corns in a boring Saturday afternoon.
This was one of those horror movies where you hope all the characters get killed quickly, because they're so annoying.
!that guy who played James in it wasn't even from the UK he's Australian!and the clothes that they were all parading in like arseholes pretending to be British really annoyed me.I love going on shopping sprees and believe me WE DO NOT WEAR THAT LOAD OF CRAP!So to all Americans out there do not be fooled by this stupid film because us Brits do not speak posh like that (only the queen does) we are not snobby n strict (us Brits are totally wild!)
Maybe youÂ´ll still watch it, despite my and other peopleÂ´s words, thatÂ´s what I did because I was curious to see if the Olsen twins had finally grown up...but it isnÂ´t worth it, trust me.
Nevertheless, it was extremely hard to watch till the end because it made me furious how it depicted men and women.
The movie's/Lawrence's hate towards lesbians is clearly shown in the short dialog between Paul and Jill where he wonders why she would be a lesbian as she's "not bad-looking, features are good, nice legs" (we are to understand: you become a lesbian because no man wants you, i.e.
So I'm as shallow as they come, therefore I'm not criticizing this film because I'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - it's because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat.
The brainless lefty, Kris Kristofferson, when asked why he took such an uncharacteristic role (leader of a revolt against Soviet overlords of a conquered America) answered that he did it because he thought another actor might have been able to do serious damage in such a role.
Maybe because this series was vapid, vacuous, boring and incoherent!
Most people have forgotten the hysteria that took place because the movie was shown on TV.
From a cinematographic viewpoint, it failed because it needed drastic editing.
I've never been inclined to view those tapes, because the non-sequitors were annoying the first time through.
It isn't obscure because it was controversial, it's obscure because it's dreadful.
I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone because it has nothing going for it.
I had such high hopes because I had read about it for many months and I was so glad to walk into the video store and finally see it on display.
Hard to believe that director Winner actually made a handful of decent films in the early seventies, because this film is offensively stupid and violent with giant lapses in logic and character motivation.
After laughing at his impotence, he beats her, because, well, you know, all men are scum.
I think that he should get some help with writing from a Hollywood veteran because his idea was good.
Personally I gave it a 1-STAR only because there wasn't anything less to give it.
That is a pity because he writes those wonderfully absurd and over-the-top stories that are just begging to be turned into popcorn blockbusters, but who can blame the man.
I bought Raise The Titanic on DVD for one of my mates for Christmas 2003, mainly because we've read all of Cusslers books and thought them very very good.
They are raising the Titanic because it may have hidden in its waterly bowels the secret element to make a defense shield feasible.
We don't get the defense shield in the movie because that would make us villainous!
Well let me go say this because i love history and I know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and Julia Stiles became my #1 favorite actress after seeing her in "The '60s" and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history!!!
Now the families are all p***ed off because they have portrayed them so badly.
I was excited to re-watch it on Reel 13 because I felt that now, as a more educated and hopefully more sophisticated viewer, I could fully appreciate it for the important work of art that it was supposed to be, butÂno Â it's still pretty boring.
Firstly, they meet when Susan comes up to him randomly and abruptly on some Boston street and asks him to walk her to the corner because someone's following her.
Houseman won the Oscar because he was a legendary theater producer and director (he worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, etc.)
Not really, so it misses the mark because 98 percent of the human population watches a cartoon to get some laughs.
Trash like this is worse than "The Apprentice" because it has six year old kids, tuning in and thinking its "cool".
The producers were never on set, because they just couldn't watch.
I wanted to try this film because of Franco Nero and Menahem Golan.
It's the kind of movie you'll watch time and again because it's JUST SO BAD!
I advise that no one should ever view this movie again, because it is an insult to cinema and all we hold dear about movies.
But all her plans are ruined because of a little boy who is always sneaking around the hospital.
The scenes would jump really ahead and you had to just assume things had happened because the story didn't tell you.
Overall I thought that it was a terrible movie, although I did laugh at several different points because of it being so absurd.
The movie was a mess mostly because of the subplot they tried to have going on, which involved a romantic interest between the virologist and the president.
Then the brilliant general decides to blow up the hospital because then the virus would be gone.
But what really would happen is the airborne virus would then be able to travel farther because the bomb disperses particles over the area.

I keep watching it because I just couldn't believe if was that bad.
This movie is not even good enough to have a chance to be played on the sci fi channel, which is bad because they play some really bad movies on there.
Bruce, just promise me that you'll never be acting president ever again because you reminded me a lot of Bill Clinton.
It was hard paying attention to storyline because the pace of the movie was so staggered and hard to follow.
There were some moments when it just got too long because it was supposed to be "intense" but instead it was just aggravating.
But the president turns down the offer because " The United States doesn`t negoiate with terrorists " Now let`s think about this , the president has been told his organs will slowly dissolve due to the virus and when offered something to stop this happening he turns it down on principle !
Oh and don`t think that because the Irishman and Ms ugly bimbo want one hundred million big ones the president will suddenly decide they`re blackmailers and not terrorists and give them what they thereby saving his principals .
I saw it because a lot of people said that it was a good, perfect movie but they are so wrong.I mean just the description and all that fantasy seems so stupid.
Well, the only comic thing I find about all that is that luck (because the way you look is destiny) can put a bad actor on top of the pyramid.
Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch.
i only voted it a "1" because there was no **f u c k i n g zero** option.
I can honestly say the only plus to this movie was that there was hardly no dialog, because the acting wasn't even worthy of being called acting.
Based on a true story of a man who ate another man because he met on the internet (was it consensual?
I am shocked by what I just saw, and not because of the contents, but by the way they were brought to the screen.
Just walk away because you will, most surely, regret the experience for the rest of your life.
same for the ubiquitous violence -- no point, no reason, no humor, just because animation can do it.
I would only care about "Humping Dog" and the "Wrong Hole" just because they are not about poo (well, about `same old in-out') but it's not worth getting for just 2 titles.
That's because most of the animations weren't at all funny and they almost always relied on scatological humor or nudity.
HHH winning really sucked because WrestleMania is supposed to be a "Make the fans go home happy" show.
Why make your kids stop playing a sport they love simply because the coach was holding extra practices?
Jeff Goldblum's line from Jurassic Park springs to mind, "Just because you could, doesn't mean you should".
Do not believe a single positive review about it (as they obviously are coming from the less-than-no-talent hacks that were involved with this turkey), because anyone with DNA will be not only bored to tears by this thing, but downright insulted.
(4* because of the level of fascination provided.
You don't learn about who someone is by listening to what they say because their ideals about what they should be will get in the way with what they really are.
I rated this 2 out of 10, though, because of a pretty cool soundtrack, and because "Dorothy" was kinda cute.
Bertolucci has become an icon, maybe more because of the scandals adhering to his films than of the intrinsic worth of his cinematographic output (in contrast to for instance Ettore Scola).
I actually couldn't finish watching it because I felt I was wasting too much of my life sitting there bored out of my wits.
Additionally, because of the prudishness of Hollywood, Porter's originals get censored too.
I saw the first half of the film then gave up because this looked to me DOUBTFUL.
The only part, which looked to me real was the the talk between Arturo and the American officer at the USA Embassy in London when Arturo wanted to leave Cuba because the officer raised the right questions.
I'm not one of those who freak out because space ships make noise in the vacuum of space.
They inform NASA they can't because they've lost their main engines.
I won't say that "Deep Rescue" is as bad as the 2005 rehash of "Pride and Prejudice," because P&P was actually trying to be literary.
Most of children don't understand that those are empty-brain girls because they are KIDS.
But if the kid likes it that means that she/he sees nothing bad in the movie because well you are parents and u should know it that kids don't see bad in anything.
Listen to a cast saying clichÃ©s, cast that can't show any talent skills because of the lines and because of the awful characters that are dreadful.
The reason I watched this is because my younger sister wanted to watch it.
We couldn't finish the movie because we were so annoyed with the corny plot, awful skinny role models and the dull argument that doesn't teach you anything about adolescence because this movie is too happy, sunny and colorful!
i personally told her not to see the film because it would make her feel unpretty and stupid.
The point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie.
It's very difficult to write a long review for this film because there isn't much in it to talk about.
I can't say that it is the worst movie ever because no film can be worse than Pulp Fiction and Jackass part 1 & 2.
Overall I didn't like the film but I absolutely did not hate it as well because it did not bore me to death and I have seen much worse films.
Oh, also the girl who is awarded the scholarship at the end of the movie... because she "needs it"... can afford to go shopping all the time and has a big house as well?
I actually only enjoyed it BECAUSE it was so bad, and because some of the scenes in the movie were just so awkward and hilarious.
On top of that, some parents decided to tag along because of the perception that is was good for the entire family...
They couldn't have been more WRONG, because it seemed like a dumbed-down version of 'The O-C', written in a day care center.
If the intention of writing this film was simply because the last time a movie has been this cringe-worthy was Britney Spears' Crossroads, then the idea was a nail hit directly on the head.
Not from laughter, not sadness... it was SO bad, I had no emotions that could be connected to this film, and I just started crying because nothing else quite fit.
Had I not been forced to see this film because of my occupation (and the fact I have two young daughters), I would have avoided this particular production like Richard Simmons avoids women.
The acting was poor, but maybe that was just because the script was cheesy.
Most of these dogs are left for dead because they REFUSE to fight at all!
I gave this movie a two because of the scenery, which is Alcapulco, Mexico and stunning.
In a rather distasteful staged script, the bride, Melissa, went off the rails the day of her last bridal gown fitting because she found her fiancÃ©, Brian, in bed with her wedding planner.
I say this because as I cannot remember this major movie's release at all.
It might as well have stayed that way, because this is a horrible movie.
I am shamed at the women who played those roles, because they've set back minorities 30 years at least.
The reason that's a surprise is because it's not funny.
This movie has an interesting premise, but it ultimately fails because of poor character development and the unappealing actors who portray them.
Those soap-opera devices weren't necessary in the original novel, because the story itself far surpassed them.
Now there's a scene were the "lead" dog falls out the back of a moving van because the "robustly funny" characters left the rear doors open.
If anyone even remotely found this funny please tell me why because I will be in disbelief.
This is the first and probably last film I will ever submit anything to on this site because it is that bad.
The humor does not work because it simply is NOT funny...it is unoriginal, not very clever, and very elementary.
It also takes quite a while for the killing to start, because the makers of this vaguely likable crapfest thought it necessary to introduce us first to the utterly dull and unfunny humanoids.
The main problem with CM is the same as with most horror comedy: not funny at all, and because there's "comedy" in it, no scares whatsoever.
I was angry, because I couldn't find a single thing in this adaptation that would explain why I had had to pay for this.
You only keep watching because you think that surely there has to be more?
When some interesting events do happen, they are only told by the narrator (in subtitles because this movie is in French if you didn't already know).
I am glad I read up on the film here, though, because when I watched it I thought Oosh's brother was "Doosh."
I say seemingly because there may have been plot clues that I missed.
For instance the mother, what mother would not come to see her first grandchild because she was scared to fly.
Its shown through the perspective of "Shue" the whole movie, a lot of unanswered questions and confusion left at the end is because she never had them answered.... and honestly all of the questions are answered if you pay close enough attention there is just no "WHY" but you can figure the "HOW" out.
This movie is good because it gives you that eerie feeling of real life where as if it was laced with a bunch of special effects and corny situations made strictly for fear and not the story line, it would have been much worse in my opinion.
Perhaps because that was the whole point of the movie?
I only voted four because of my original impression of the film(before Isaw the end) Avoid at all costs!!!!!
The only reason European-Americans like it is for fear of being branded a "racist" because they don't enjoy a mini-series that is not good in the first place.
If I make a mini-series about my ancestors coming to America in the boiler room of a passenger ship no one would even care, some would probably even call me racist because there were no blacks on the ship .
I cringed when I saw Simpson running across the African grasslands, not because of his subsequent notoriety, but because of the very unsubtle association between African ancestry and modern day athletic prowess.
If you want to watch this as fiction go ahead, but please do not watch this as a history lesson, because it's simply not.
I rented this movie because I had a coupon for a free rental.
I am glad that I did not have to pay because it is not worth paying for.
A re-write wouldn't have hurt, perhaps bring in more comedy because this is not really working out.
We already know it's a Deer Woman because of the title.
It was almost like watching a "scene study" exercise in acting class, where you feel incredibly sorry for the girl in the scene because she just isn't believable and is truly hard to watch.
I dislike prejudice in any form so it offends me to hear statements like, "Women are better at politics because they can admit when they've made a mistake."
They cant have sex because the guy keeps getting attacked by a ghost.
This is the primary plot of the film and the film suffers because it never once seems plausible.
but I always have a good time watching it, because it is just so fun to notice everything that is wrong in this film.
I would have given it a score of 2 if it was a parody because it actually made me laugh at some points.
Mainly because he has dumb dialog and he has "Lance" to act against.
You'll CRY when you watch it because you can actually feel your brain cells dying and shriveling up.
)**********  Watch out people because as we speak, the K-17 virus may actually exist...  this is the knowledge they start you off with so you'll feel like the plot could be possible... riiiight.
So they get Michael Dorn, don't forget the name because they say it like 5000 times during the movie, to create a vaccine to cure HIV, but it also turns the subject into a vampire??
I picked this film up because I thought the cover looked ok and the write-up on the back sounded okish.
Who knows, because there are no clues and nobody else on the streets apart from the actors and frankly, who cares?
I don't know who backed this thing (note that I didn't even call it an "effort" because that would imply some sort of love for the project and not just your own image on a screen), but my suspicion is that the writers/producers/directors/stars either had more money than talent or are salesmen (in person certainly, because I didn't buy anything that was happening on the screen) on the scale of the infamous Ponzy.
The cinematography wasn't all that bad (except the part where I could actually see the rig they used to lift people off the ground) and it showed what the future of Independent Film will look like (sharp, clear, and almost as good as the studios) but the people behind the camera must've blown their camera budget on that awful looking Kevlar vest thing because instead of buying a red lens filter to simulate night time they just turned the contrast on the camera WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY down.
It also had a look like it was filmed exclusively using security cameras, which gave them an extra bit of annoyance as one moment you can't really see what's going on because you're too far, and then the next not seeing it because the camera is shaking like mad.
I assume he does, but I wish he didn't because then there wouldn't be even the possibility of this movie getting a sequel.
And sadly, it definitely does not have a so-bad-it's-good quality like so many Troma films because the filmmakers take this seriously, which gives it a completely unwatchable film.
This movie is so carelessly acted that all you can think as you watch is, "I hope they got a good paycheck", because there's certainly no commitment to the material shown by any of the performers.
It's a movie that presumes that its characters are likable because they know how to use chopsticks and don't want God mentioned at the funeral.
I was surprised to see that it is from 1997 because until I turned onto BBC2 today, I had never even heard of it.
My vision of Jake Gyllenhall has been completely skewed because of this movie.
And the scene in the courtroom when he 'confesses' because Diana would want him to be honest.
This film doesn't rival the top offenders in this category, thank God -- the worst being "American Buffalo" (which made me run screaming from the theater after about fifteen minutes) and "Wonder Boys," both of which achieved a false, theatrical quality strictly because of this annoying tendency.
I rented this because Max turned it into a high school play in Rushmore.
Not least because it is apparently a true story.
Unfortunately, Murray ends up spending much of the marriage feeling sorry for himself because he is having trouble making a go of his new business idea as well as falling under the influence of the evil vamp (Thelma Todd).
Their owners have to move from their house because it's condemned and they can't take the dogs, so they leave them in the yard for a neighbor to pick up.
I am a big Jodie Foster fan and went to see Stealing Home mainly because she was in it.
It was also rather dull, at times though, maybe it's because I'm not a major baseball fan either so I wasn't that into that part of it.
When I watched Cold Fish, I had heard rumors that when it was first screened people walked out, not because it was bad, but because it was very disturbing.
Because the story is absolutely meaningless, which becomes more and more obvious as it developsÂ also the "real life" killing footage is absolutely tasteless, especially because it is advertised so strongly on the front of the DVD coverÂ No wonder the critics walked out during the screening in Cannes Â (I don't think it was because of this films "controversial" qualities) Â rather the embarrassment that a film like this could reach Cannes!!!
Are these people completely without any sense of direction and just wanting to make as much money as possibly Â if so please change professionÂ because it doesn't look like you have anything to give with regards to filmsÂ
I know because I'm one of the few people to have seen it, one of the few that will ever see it and because I know a lot of people who worked on it and had to hear their horror stories about how bad the shoot was.
First of all, it's not a disturbing film because of the material: You hardly see any of the "execution" footage and the characters are so laughable and unconvincing you don't find the premise convincing either.
It's a shame they're not making any more episodes of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 because it's prime fodder for them.
Adrian Paul plays a vampire who, it seems, has been living under a rock because he seems unaware of all the contemporary slangs used by his human partner (who is also a cop).
And there's the whole 'we fear them because they're a different 'ethnicity'' thing.
I have no real idea of exactly how the whole thing ended because I'm not really sure what happened during the first part of the film.
It's not a surprise because many western countries avoid Scandinavian kids movies, because they are too different.
British authors used to do something in this style (sometimes even in darker mood like Loach), American kids are too infantile (but still beat adults...), Italians are too mature (because of social context), Czechs forgot that they have children (and were among the best in 70's), so only French authors can stand next to Scandinavians.
There are no cartoon Culkin tricks: he is afraid, he hides as every normal kid would do, and sometimes when he seems to do something brave, it is more because of hopeless resignation.
What about those of us who watch these movies because they aren't filled with the same garbage you can find in every other modern movie?
I hope this was intended as a parody because if it wasn't it succeeded pretty well, unintentionally, anyway.
The plot was OK, but I had to register an account here because people are saying that Sopkiw's character was the hero.
In a deleted scene we find out that it was because a chubby guy sat on the bonnet and blew the tyres.
Another woman yelps because she sat next to a snake.
The guy has a go at her because she could give their position away - as the smoke from HIS fire billows everywhere!
Then some other guy kills the wounded guy because otherwise he'd die a slow and painful death.
But maybe it`s just not my sense of humor because two of my friend thought it was hysterical amusing, but as I said I thought it was boring.
BTW, it was shown at the 1998 B-Fest--and was a resounding bomb, probably because everyone had to go vomit in the toilet afterwards.
A craptacular knock-off off Bill & Ted (a master-piece in comedy, in comparison), which honestly is mostly funny because it was made quite some time ago and was sort of creative.
One reason why I know I hated it so much was because I hate comedy films, In the cinema if you watch a comedy film all you can her is the laughter around you and it really destroys the film.
1 out of 10 (and thats because it was filmed in ibitha only).
He must have shot this movie, because absolutely no attention was paid to detail in any way.
While I loved the first one due to its excellent writing despite its low budget, the other Bancroft films have been mediocre at best--mostly because the writing was, at best, second rate.
I'm only entering 1 out of 10 because zero isn't an option.
Looks like they had to have rewritten the script because this movie quite frankly seems to be a little dark to be a follow up to that movie.
Although this is said to be a sequel to "Masters of the Universe", I really don't understand why, because I have problems in finding any connections between the two movies.
I really enjoy such stupid films because it's so crappy that you can't stop laughing during 90 minutes !
Where as I can give other action flicks a higher rating because they actually do a few things right, Cyborg manages to do practically everything wrong.
I didn't hate her because she was ugly, but because she was annoying as hell.
The whole ordeal opens with Jemma getting Pete, Mark, and Fred to come down to the Amazon, because she has a good hunch that some Professor Korenz, who was believed dead, is still alive.
That said, if you come into this movie with any expectations at all, you're going to be horribly disappointed, because there is so little substance to this film.
These random events makes there very little action at all, because every ten minutes there's something new to focus on.
It makes them the stereotypical, happy, and extremely annoying do-gooders just because they have to be (and they're all best friends, how nice).
Chuck us another shrimp, because this one's well and truly over done.
Only reason I watched is because my Guide said 'killer salmon' and I couldn't pass that up!
If you're just watching it because it's a rainy day and it's something you taped out of general curiosity, you'll probably enjoy it even less than me.
And, the most grievous problem is that as noted in the 'trivia' section, the producer added more sex scenes because he wanted to make it 'more sexy'.
And she didn't reach for a coat hangar earlier because why?
I rented it because the actors in it are normally first rate, well they were terrible and the directing was ridiculous.
The boys family was killed by the mafia and the FBI agent was semi-responsible because he was protecting the boys family before the father testified against the mafia.
I would have given this movie a higher rating if it actually induced sleep, because at the time I couldn't.
This makes the fact that this movie had a half ass script even worse, because it's offensive to the people who actually lived through it.
Honestly, I just couldn't believe it: when this movie was written, someone must have been following the how-to-make-a-corny-movie recipe, because absolutely all of the ingredients are to be found in this film.
Stereotype contrast is everything here), who looks down at the lot because they are poor and not American.
Well, I forgive all this, because the dance is handled cinematically, and that's good enough for me.
my personal favorite episode is the (canadian boreal forest) one because its in my home country and i sometimes go out it the woods and do my own little survivor thing.
They just don't have the honesty to admit it, because that would ruin their ratings.
My vote on a scale from 1 to 10 is 1 (awful), that's only because I can't give this piece of crap of a show a big zero.
I would love to go on one of these haunted missions because I could debunk everything right then and there.
There is reason why there is absolutely zero credible evidence of anything spooky going on, it's because there isn't.
It is not realistic to eschew certain safety considerations and prolong one's suffering merely because I think it might make for a more unpredictable show.
If you watched this film on You Tube, there would be long stretches when you think your computer has locked up because nothing is happening until you realized that the crawl bar is actually moving.
Story-wise, it would have been better off set anywhere between the Fifties, because technically it's akin to the much better FAR FROM HEAVEN in melodrama, or even when this type of movies came into vogue during the period going from the late Seventies into the early Nineties.
Rather than being 'shocking,' as some have called it, I found it pretty predictable, primarily because the characters are clichÃ©s that have been familiar figures in movies over the past 10 or 15 years.
This is some counsel: Boris says Zoe's husband must be gay because if he wasn't he would want to have sex with her every day (this is after 10 years of marriage).
a haus frau who has little to do but talk with her gay confidant, another brother that paints sometime (we never know when) the gay confidant who does nothing but pine for one of the brothers and a mother, who has lunch, because she seems to be perpetually out to lunch.
"Necronomicon" is an analogy of three short stories:1)"The Drowned"(Christophe Gans)2)"Cold"(Shusuke Kaneko)and 3)"Whispers"(Brian Yuzna).In my opinion,the first one is the best one maybe because it's highly atmospheric and a little bit creepy.It has also very appealing cast(Bruce Payne,Richard Lynch or wonderful Belinda Bauer).The second one is very weak:boring and full of uninteresting characters.I didn't enjoy it.The third one is too bizarre and also very ridiculous.It has some nice gore effects and nothing more.I suggest you to watch only the first story-"The Drowned".Don't bother with rest.My evaluation:4/10 perhaps 5/10.
I really wanted to give it a perfect score because this film made me laugh harder and louder than any "intended comedy" ever has, but the film-loving being inside of me is screaming for the single star.
To begin with I did not give this title a three because i don't like foreign films i love them.
Do not be fooled by the cover art or summary which screams violence because there is none.
His wife Michelle Novack is more dumb than him as she leaves her son alone and goes up and down all the time just because of curiosity.
because i just couldn't believe that all those bad things could happen to Rocky so fast.
I will never watch this movie again because the plot made me so angry.
After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.
it was ,however, extremely disappointing because after all those years of grueling training montages and hard work, Rocko loses all of his money because of Paulie's ridiculous gambling habits.
it was great tho because when he gets back from Russia later that ,probably year, his son is 5 years older.
Overall Silent Scream at best is merely watchable as there is nothing really wrong with it I suppose, but at worst it sucks because it's far too slow, uneventful & nothing of interest really happens for most of it's running time.
I call it a micro-movie because the cast is populated by a few actors.
This show is great to watch because Les Stroud really does survive.
Probably because the plot is terribly thin: an unlucky gambler discovers he can't lose as long as he's holding a dancer's hand - a frosty workaholic dancer who's never had time for love.
The celebrity cameos are kinda fun (in a "oh, there's so-and-so, I'm surprised" way, not because they're actually *doing* anything amusing), but pointless (unless the point is to show us that these celebs endorse Vegas - ooh maybe we'll spot 'em there!
Many of the fans claim this is superior television, because "it isn't scifi, it's drama".
The truth is, most television Science Fiction is easily accessible, because it has to appeal to the masses, but all good science fiction is dramatic, thought provoking, challenging stuff that goes beyond our pre-conceptions.
I enjoy because I think that most of us who started watching televised science fiction (When there were really only three channels, when the creatures were usually enlarged garden denizens, large bug-like sculptures, or just some guy wearing something that looked like one of your auntie's failed quilting projects, and when any sci-fi tended to be broadcast long after our parents had been safely tucked into bed and Johnny Carson had signed off.)
As it stands, the only one of these people I would even allow in my house would be #6, and then only because I am intrigued by that glowy thing she does with her spine during intercourse.
Adama led so well precisely because he showed emotion, valued his family, worried sometimes intensely but let others live their lives, cared and managed situations with flexibility but brooked no nonsense, and was fundamentally an older human being saddened by pain but capable of happiness, flawed (without being a mess) but striving to be the best he could.
There are bad people in this world, but the sort of disintegration into whoring, in-fighting, and drugs touted as "real" by such shows as this ridiculous new rip off are unreal because they show only the worst case most extreme scenario.
After watching the whole series, I must say this was a total disappointment, and the ultimate proof about how things are done in Hollywood: good contacts, speaking loud, and making the audience believe they are smarter than they really are because the series it's "intelligent".
I'll refrain from giving it a one because I suppose the filmmakers must have done what they could with a budget ranging in the hundreds.
Mario Montenegro (as the Mad Scientist) was interesting because he answers the question "what would a Filippino version of Dirk Bogarde look like?".
Silverado is a movie I watch frequently only because, like seeing a shocking accident, I feel compelled to review this horrible memory and ease my disbelief.
For a start, she is described as a tall, prim, straight lady, because, as Miss Marple herself tells us in one of her books, "I was taught to sit up properly".
Light bulb goes off: Dad needs a new crime reporter, because it is so dangerous.
I couldn't figure it out, because it had photos from the 1940s -- ankle straps and all -- and I was a child in the sixties.
And it's such a pity, because I anticipates so much.
The film could be said to be 'horror' because of the ghostly plot, but aside from a sÃ©ance sequence, there aren't many shocks and scares and I'd say it's more of a supernatural drama.
Perhaps it's because it's the director's first feature film, but mainly because of budget constraints, "Civil Brand" left a lot of gaps in credibility, and visual creativity.
Perhaps because there was not enough cash to get this thing done, some scenes were not filmed.
In one way, I hate to downgrade this film because it does have a message it is trying to get out, and there are so few films about African American women.
I sat through it once because I lived in that era, but it is not worth a second showing.
seriously nobody is doing to the Mexican film industry any good by calling this film a classic, because by telling that, it means that this is the better that Mexican directors can do.
I tell this because this movie is truly horrible, the acting, the ambiance, even the music it's like a nightmare to the ears.
Just because a show is meant for children is not an excuse for it to be poor quality.
The only reason so many "Bibleman" episodes were made because some parents feel they need to get children's shows that are designed to teach Christian values and Bible verses.
Bibleman noted that he should have seen through it because the robot has two blue eyes while the real person has "one blue eye and one green eye, as an unfortunate result of his hereditary lineage."
I personally feel that the only reason any one bothered to make this book into a film was because of the shock value.
Just because it has scripture and morals doesn't mean that your children should be subjected to this.
Got this for my son for Christmas(2006)this year, because I thought it would be more mature for his age(9).
Most of the people touting this show's merits see a superhero fighting in the name of Our Lord (and I'm a Christian myself, so I'm not bagging on this because I'm against Bibleman's religion) and not how stupid and hypocritical the series is.
Bibleman is supposed to be just a human at heart and so vulnerable to the same temptations as the rest of us, but unlike the rest of us he never has to resolve any problems that arise because of being angry or proud or dishonest.
The villains are supposed to embody the concepts of fear, wrath, pride, or thinking for yourself, but that approach costs the show all of its impact because a person was behind the Bible Team's sins, and they never have to answer for what they do because they were just being manipulated.
In the end, Bibleman is little more than the Captain Planet of Christianity: he presents a worthwhile message, and many people who see it buy into it, but delivers it in an extremely unbalanced manner far fewer acknowledge because it's a superhero teaching what are ostensibly positive beliefs to kids.
It look like this movie really took time to make and develop, which is sad, because the outcome is horrible.
It look like this movie really took time to make and develop, which is sad, because the outcome is horrible.
Obviously David Cronenberg isn't comfortable with his flair either because he exhibits none of it in this cinematic train wreck.
There are times when you watch a movie and the flow of the story comes to an abrupt halt because some character does something that just doesn't make sense.
Sometimes the film overcomes this bit of illogic, though more often it just derails the film's credibility completely because it inadvertently reminds you that you are, indeed, watching a movie.
We don't see the consequences of the senseless violence, because that would negate the ain't-it-cool impact of each burst of mayhem.
In summary, from the moment Viggo's family crowded around the little girl because she had a nightmare and all were there to console her (in Cronenberg's hackneyed attempt to show Tom Stall's initially perfect existence) to the end when Tom/Joey/Michael Myers comes home to find his family tensely sitting at the dinner table and little girl Sarah pulls out a plate to show daddy Tom/Joey/Jason X is still part of the family, the movie was a complete package of one terribly directed clichÃ© after another.
I cannot even talk about his performance because he was hardly in the movie.
now, i also realise that some may say Cronenberg often favours the more direct approach and tries to test his audience with occasional bouts of realism straight out of a comic book, but i'm sorry, just because he has built up a reputation of doing things this way (which on many occasions i've hugely enjoyed), does not mean he get away with sheer sloppiness of this magnitude.
not at one moment in the movie did i feel any emotional contact with any of the characters' violent actions (and their reasons for committing them) save for - SPOILER - the son knocking the crap out of his tormentor at school, and that was simply because throughout i found the bully character so utterly pathetic and laughable that for all i cared he might as well have been put in hospital.
sure i was shocked in a few places, but that was simply because within a matter of seconds - SPOILER - one of the 'bad guys' had the front of his face hanging off.
I would rate this a 9 for laughs and entertainment value and I give it some credit because the plot is actually competent (even if much of the dialogue is not), but going by the craftsmanship, it's a generous...
There is a real attempt here at telling a story because there is NOT much action.
I like the way they presented the story because it is the fist time that I watched a movie that is taken from an actual UN meeting.
It minus well had been written in crayon, because it doesn't get more childish than this.
I say 'started' because the script on a whole is just a total mess.
After a while there's just blabbering going on and you don't even care who's who and who's working for this one or that one and he has conflict with him because of someone else's agenda blah blah blah.
I only went to see this because I was taking a friend of mine out for her birthday and this is what she wanted to see.
At the end of the 32 minutes that it ran, the audience let out an audible gasp because so many of us were holding out breaths.
I rated it two out of ten because the actor Ryan Carnes has a lot of charisma, though he isn't well-directed here.
Let's these two guys end together, correct me if I am wrong, but I got the impression that if Caleb didn't move any faster to Marc, was not only because he confessed to be straight, it was because he felt he was betraying his roommate and flatmate Kyle.
It's a little better than those because of two competent performances by Ryan Carnes and Emily Stiles.
Rather, I only add my 2 cents to the comments that we need to be supportive and gentle to reviews of gay indie films because they are so "hard to get made."
I only go on so long because I am AMAZED at all the good reviews this film has received.
No matter, because soon Aristocrat joins the ladies for yet another threesome, brilliantly mirroring the previous threesome scene.
No matter though because soon the S&M freaks produce blood-drenched whips and proceed to lash Masturbating Woman's naked body, streaking it red with ketchup stains.
As a horror film it fails miserably, basically because there is none.
Odile lets her guard down, because of this attraction and free-spirited delight towards Mari Nieto's seductress.
Don't rent this crap just because it's rare and "notorious".
Watching this film because of John Lennon's endorsement and a short synopsis I had read, I found myself very upset about what I saw and disappointed with the story as a whole (particularly the second half = the acting and plot went downhill very quickly).
I get the impression that the film makers didn't even try to do anything different with these characters because they were as bored with them as we are.
If I were from this age group, I would be particularly offended by this movie because of the way it portrays teenagers.
You don't actually learn anything, so you can't pick up on normal social clues that everyone else does - Charlie, for example, gets beaten up in school because he doesn't pick up that a tough guy and his sycophant in the high school bathroom are people to avoid.
I gave it a three because it had some good moments - but the cruft around the good is just so awful.
So many people go on and on about giving them some credit because it is AFTER ALL...A low budget movie - BULLS**T -- OK I am as lenient as can be for that fact, but thats no excuse for the bad acting and poor direction and most of all the story... Why do these people even attempt to make a movie for, because they have a camera and no job which leaves them with lots of time and they try to throw some crappy effects in and make a movie.
I rented this horrible B movie last night before checking out people's comments first.I will never make that mistake again.I couldn't even get a credit for another DVD after asking for a one at the video store because it's just their stupid policy not too because it's a renter beware thing or something.I thought the opening scene was a bit funny but knew from there it was no horror and could not get into it because it dragged on and was boring as hell.It was filmed in the same cheap same format as a daytime soap opera.I trusted the stupid cover art when it said nothing but good things about this movie.Even Fangoria gave it praise.I'm not sure I wanna read Fangoria anymore after being mislead.I don't understand how it could win anything.The idiot who made this film has no taste and it never should have even found distribution.
Like i said all you see the whole movie is the actors faces but majority of the time you only see half their face because the other half is just black or dark.
There was supposed to be a Q&A session with the director and one of the actors after the screening, but everyone who'd watched fled the theater as quickly as possible ... because nobody cared what those involved with such a TERRIBLE film would have to say about it.
Like the title says, Blockbuster video gave us a refund on the movie PLUS a free rental because they said 5 other people also complained about it.
I guess it's not company policy to take movies off the shelves because sure enough, the next time we went in it was still there.
I give it a "1" only because the rating system doesn't go any lower... Avoid 13 Seconds like the plague!
I suggest you rent this movie because it could motivate you.
Maybe because of the movie depends on a memoir not on a complete scenario.
I am not talking about just story here, because you can have a bad story but still keep people guessing for more.
I was amazed to see that it had won some awards in the horror circuit because, to me, it showed the poorest of the poor.
Do not just pride yourself on the ending because you are going to have upset people like myself that could tell that you spent more on that then you did the rest of the film.
One of the main reasons I have not gotten my own production off the ground is because of movies like this.
To sum up: remember kids, just because you CAN make a movie does not mean you SHOULD.
I am this strongly critiquing this movie not because I have a grudge against its creators (although I'm not happy about losing 90 minutes and $4).
I decided to give this movie a 2 star rating out of 10 because at least it is very funny.
Is it because she becomes lovey-dovey with Ozone?
The only reason I can imagine a film like Showgirls (which is "Gone With the Wind" compared to Sol Goode) got financed was because they promised the backers that Elizabeth Hurley would be naked and gyrating throughout half the film.
Perhaps because i'm of the same age.
Then you also should avoid this one, because it's so utterly bad that it's not even funny.
I'm glad it's on video because they hardly put it on the telly.
Don't get me wrong, I like the Blue collar guys but whoever booked the show has no ideal of the term "Fan Base" You could tell by the expressions on Foxworthy's face that he was uncomfortable and not just because it was a roast.
Not to say that Jeff Foxworthy doesn't deserve the recognition of a roast because he does.
Bad things happen because they have to.
There are several scenes from Denmark (scene 35) is from a small drive-by coffee-stand on their way from Copenhagen to Elsinore, a sign saying "Stop o g tag en k o p" (Stop and have a cup)- the joke is on Dylan, because k o p is not a cop.
Regardless of it's popularity now, no one will be watching this in ten years because no one will be able to trudge through it.
I decided to add my voice because this film is highly rated and I have never found myself at such odds with the majority of the IMDb audience.
I went because I wanted to know why this film was so highly rated across all the demographic areas although I had my doubts based on the preview.
For those kinds of films, it makes no difference what is their literary legacy because they presuppose no antecedent, unlike a sequel or a film based upon a tv series.
There is hope that this will be more than a decent film with an adequate budget and good actors because it is associated with the BBC.
At best, this role is two dimensional and clearly lacks depth because none was called for in the portrayal of a dying woman.
"The Claim" is a movie that is very much like a full cup of water in its beginning, but by the end of the movie one realizes that there is a hole at the bottom of the cup because everything has dribbled away.
This movie should have been titled "Trudging through Snow," because that's all I remember from it.
Thank goodness I saw it on video because I was able to fast-forward through many of the "trudging through snow" scenes.
I watched the whole thing because of the link with Hardy's "Mayor of Casterbridge."
Pity because moving Hardy west is an appealing idea but the performers, mood and conceits of the movie are anything but western.
Probably the only reason why I seen this film was because of its co-star Katie Holmes (of the popular Dawson's Creek show).
Thank God this movie only lasted 84 minutes, because it was pure torture, the first half was just your average bad teen movie (what I expected) but in the second half it turned into a real nightmare, It make Police Academy films look good.
I saw this movie because it seemed like a good plot, I'm a horror fan, and I always take time to watch the movies of Dawson's Creek stars.
Especially the long shots of water, which are pleasant, if a little sleep-inducing because they may be TOO pleasant.
Tarkovsky seemed to have some kind of an almost-fetish for "aqua", because he filmed it in all its visual and audio glory in nearly ever movie he made.
There's a reason most people don't know about this movie and that's because it's for film students and those who consider themselves in the hierarchy of the film community.
That's a pity, because it could have been a good old-fashioned action flick in the manner of its predecessors, but with an added cachet of great color and wide Scottish vistas.
The disappointing part is that the movie had potential because of the acting of the mother and father and the overall story was a good one.
It's odd, because this picture isn't an especially good vehicle for Olivia de Havilland; her character is completely wasted during the final showdown (despite being the only one to notice what is going on, she is used simply as a liability to the men), she has relatively little screen-time compared to the male trio, and with the exception of the newspaper-office scenes, the character has little to do save look pretty.
I gave it a three and that only because I was in an exceptionally generous frame of mind.  
You have to see this when you get drunk though, because it will be a whole night full of laughs.
However, American politicians can rest easy because the central figure here is murdering people pretty much at random; which saps any weight out of the theme.
I just rented this movie because of the video cover.
It's the kind of echt-schiksa name that somebody might dream up because it sounded right, like "Ellie Arroway" in Carl Sagan's novel, "Contact."
Anthologies tend to suck anyways because they are always lacking in proper plot and character development.
One night while in my local video rental outlet I settled for "Dead Boyz Can't Fly" because reviews touted it as the "Clockwork Orange for the 90's," one of my favorites, I thought it might be another "Warriors."
I wish it was banned like Clockwork (Note: Clockword Orange was banned on video in Australia for quite some time because Kubrick received death threats if he released it on video) Anyway back to the dreadful film.
Saying that, I urge you to see it, not because it's so bad it's funny, I wish it was like that, but it's so bad that it's woeful.
I will give it a second chance when I find it because as far as I know, it isn't available on DVD.
So if you come across Rocket power avoid it because you will hate it.
First-off, the only reason I'm writing this is because the 4.3 rating is almost impossible.
The only reason I gave it an 8/10 is because we have movies like Fight Club and Animatrix.
If you are expecting a hardcore war movie, look elsewhere because this feels more like a lousy romance novel.
With the same amount of money, someone else could have made a better movie because they were emotionally detached from the content and could have seen the obvious shortcomings.
He admitted that his film isn't perfect, but it isn't perfect because he didn't have a budget.
Just because I didn't like itÂfor purely aesthetic reasonsÂdoesn't mean that you should ignore it.
Not because it is at all bad, but because there are way too many Friday The 13th fans out there who really are stubborn and ignorant when it comes to movies using the "formula", not to mention psycho horror movie fans who spend every minute of their day on message boards crap-talking movies.
It was unfortunate that Murphy was exploited just because his war record was deemed to be a box office draw, but he just couldn't act.
Which is a shame because what little there is of Sheridan is really rather great.
I only tuned into the show because I learned Stack was to be on the show and continued to watch because of him, but I was not supervised to see it canceled.
The story is about an estranged family going to visit their daughter/sister in New York and each is dreading the encounter because of all the past trauma.
We don't really know too much about the past because it's only dealt with on a surface level and too many attempts at funny moments preoccupy the running time of this film.
I rented it based on the cover and blurb on the back and thought "Hey this could be good," because I like a lot of straight to video horror.
I hate to say that, because i strive to find positive attributes in every film i see, but this film simply is badly made.
The film begins with a woman realizing she needs to spend time alone because she's been having "difficult times" (so we can later explain why she thinks she must be crazy when she sees things), then the big house inherited from her dead aunt (low angle shots here, with blue lights behind dead trees, a la Amityville horror) and a bunch of bad acting locals who act unkind to this lady almost as if just because the script calls for it.
It is impossible to care for Russell because she's embarrassingly bad.
I guess I should have known better because with the opening sequence this one began to stink to high heaven.
I mention the Omega Code because it is my personal benchmark of bad movies promoted by Christian ministries (i.e.
I'd love to see a real director and screen writer tackle this story because it's a great one (read "Pistol: The life of Pete Marovich").
I had to stop and rewind a couple times because I couldn't hear what he was saying.
Although I gave this movie a 1 because the director put in the horror Genre I couldn't help but laugh at the awful acting the saddest most hilarious part about this movie is that the best actors were the crazy Hillbillies that beat the hell out of Harding speaking harding the other characters had some sort of hatred for this man because if you pay attention the three phrases you hear most in the movie are "Harding your an a**hole" "Hey Harding F*ck you" "Harding acts like a 5 year old" The movie also has randomly disappearing characters,Name Changes,obvious picture cropping,misleading plot,awful sounds,windows that break but actually are just copy and pasted triangles flying through the air well anyway if you watch this you will be sure to laugh its a riot trust me!
I didn't follow it because I was too busy scratching the mole on the side of my neck.
There are no ridiculous scenes, because they are too bad to actually laugh at them.
I usually give films with some blood and nudity at least a 3 because I think those aspects might redeem a film somewhat or give it some exploitation/guilty pleasure cred but this garbage doesn't really deserve any extra credit.
WICKED LAKE gives horror flicks...camcorder flicks...and underground movies...the clichÃ© negative reputation it deserves because so many hacks hawk up luggies like this smegma.
I'm not very sure what this film is about because there is not much of a continuous story.
The cinematography in the film is terrible and it looks like the director forgot to clean the camera lens because there are an alarmingly vast amount of noticeable water marks in certain scenes and the picture is washed and incredibly grainy.
For those of you Nicholas Lea fans out there who are trying to get ahold of this movie because it's listed on his credits and you can't find any information about it anywhere...look no further.
Nothing of value occurs with out characters, because they give us nothing to care about.
I have used the word "nothing" quite a bit, but it is because all other words escape me.
My toes wouldn't even tap at the music because it seemed clichÃ© and overused.
I even liked "Scream" and "Scary Movie" I liked these films because they have, if not a lot, at least something good about them.
I appreciate 99.9% of the films I've seen because they tell a story which I haven't heard before, and most directors only make films with a good storyline.
There was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think "Oooo wasn't that clever" because it wasn't.
I think it was "wild things" that had like a pretty poor double twist and I still liked the film because the rest was OK and it wasn't trying too hard to be a big twist.
Whoever thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because I think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!!
All this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had, well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1.
Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used, as if to show why the kids are like this.
If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE!
He "falls in love" with Danielle (might i remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle giller says quote "you broke up with THE FIRST PERSON you ever loved because i said to- so how can he have been in love in the prequel???).
Luckily for Amy Adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress.
Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft-core porn.
I'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and I always feel bad saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a two-hour waste of my life.
And in the first one, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser.
are spectacular and beautiful to look at...the couple's relationship gets to be a drag to watch...one, no nuttier than they other...if he cared about her he would've come up with a shrink or something...i felt, after awhile, the thing was too contrived...i heard one reviewer say Betty Blue is great and Million Dollar Baby was lousy and i wished i hadn't read that dude because he told the ending...at least this is a spoiler...i think Betty Blue is OK but Million Dollar Baby light years more enjoyable and moves along telling lots more in the time alloted...this is a pretty film, a slow film, well acted and put together...the story is contrived too much...a different, but same, Cuckoos Nest...it's a comedy at times cutting itself up i think...some of the characters , at times , 'over acted'...i enjoyed it though.
And that the changing of reality is not to be taken lightly-- there are unintended consequences, because everything is connected.
Are we really supposed to accept that a successful and self-assertive lawyer will drive out to a remote location and jump into bed with a psychiatric patient about whom she knows very little and that she will remain there with him for days in the face of his increasingly obsessive behavior - simply because he says he feels he knew her from a previous life?
As it is they produced a senseless watered down version that made no sense because they ignore the fact that it all is a dream world created by George Orr.
Although the story was set in Portland, Oregon, they filmed a lot of it in Dallas because of that city's more futuristic architecture.
It looks like a long episode of the "new" Outer Limits or a similar show, one of those low-budget syndicated series that they film in Canada because it's cheaper there, where there is money only for a few sets, a couple of computer graphics, and a lot of talk in closeup (to hide the spareness of the sets).
What is not mentioned is that his "bible" contains only the moral teachings of Jesus, with the complete expurgation of miracles and everything else Jefferson considered spurious, because Jefferson was in fact a deist, more or less the eighteenth century equivalent of the modern atheist.
It's also a bit dubious because he seems awfully fey about it all.
I kept on thinking the only reason this wasn't called My Date With Liza was because Liza Minnelli got a restraining order.
When his mother tells the unemployed 27 year old that she reads The Star tabloid because everything in the rag is true, I realized that Herlinger probably never had a chance.
By today's standards it is rather surprising that the Southerners are seen as the heroes and the Union cause identified with Surrett and the villains, but this was the era of "Gone with the Wind" when Hollywood tended to treat the Confederates as romantic rebels, if only because a film which treated them in any other way would have done no business anywhere south of Baltimore.
My friends and I decided to watch this movie today because,like an idiot, I fell for the glorious comments about this movie being great and different.
Then they reenact the meeting because they didn't bring a camera into the event.
Every attempt is made to enliven the concept but because it simply doesn't lend itself to a feature length film these attempts are doomed to failure, even if they weren't so hopelessly amateurish and inappropriate.
I would say, nice try, they did it because they have guts, less afraid to fail.
In addition to all the stars, you can really tell Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops because they secured the directorial services of a Hollywood Heavyweight, Michael Curtiz AND they filmed the movie in Technicolor--a relatively rare thing for 1939.
That's because this cute actor seemed to die in almost every film I've seen him in.
Do you not want to submit this because it is negative.
It's almost as if Long Dream gets a free pass on everything just because it's low budget or because it's made by the same people who made the impressive Uzumaki.
I rate it at 10, because all of the people in it were at their prime and beautiful....even the men.
Director Michael Curtiz put scriptor Robert Buckner's story in an easy- to-follow movie - these early films are a joy to watch, simply because they have just this quality.
He had a promising career as a piano player because he was good at it and it was his family heritage.
The only reason he went back to see his family is because his father was dieing and he felt that he was obligated to do so.
She wants the relationship to get more serious by having kids and he wants nothing to do with that because he doesn't want to be tied down.
The only reason that they are still together is because she is to stupid and naÃ¯ve to break up with him.
To be honest this is the perfect girl for Bobby because he can do what ever he wants and she will let him.
You can also tell Bobby is a loner because every time something big happens he goes off by himself and gets drunk.
This is a great symbol to show that Bobby is a loner because the only person he likes in his life is Elton and he is taken away from him by the truck.
We find out at the end of the movie that Bobby is a loner because he is afraid that things will get bad if he stays in one spot for too long.
i didn't like this movie at all.i think it's supposed to be a parody of March of the Penguins.but for me,it just wasn't funny.plus,i felt the humour consisted of mostly vulgar,crude language.there's a lot of the F-bomb(among other words) dropped here.this definitely isn't for kids.but i also just found it boring.i actually couldn't watch it all,because i found it too slow.as for the crude language,that doesn't always bother me,but i just found it gratuitous and too frequent.i don't think you always need to have swears to make things funny.it's not for every taste,that's for sure.if you don't mind a lot of very crude language,you might want to check this one out.for me,Farce of the Penguins is a 1/10
I can only assume that all the names involved in this disaster owe Saget something, or he has some dirt on them, because they can't possibly be serious about this one.
I assumed the reason few people liked this was because it had a sort of "stupid" sense of humor as seen in movies like Kung Pow that few people appreciated.
The reason I didn't give this a score of 1 was because I'll admit that I did laugh a few times, and I appreciate that the movie recognized itself as a bad movie, like when penguins from the March of the Penguins scoff at how dumb the humor is, when the writers are depicted as a monkey banging on a typewriter, and when Samuel L. Jackson apologizes for not having the budget to make the penguins' mouths move.
Marry -- not simply cohabit, because she's not that kind of girl.
She really did look funny, laying there nude and muddy, because I knew she was next and the thought of her being anesthetized in that mud pack was hilarious!
This may rank as one of the low points in the history of British TV;12 "celebrities" are flown off to some exotic tropical Island to see if there is any mutual attraction with each other,hopefully leading to sexual attraction.The word "celebrity" once had rather more respectful meaning for most of the 20th Century;mainly with those who had achieved fame because they deserved it,through endless hard work and great ability at their chosen field.In the 21st Century,particularly in the UK,it is now mostly associated with tawdry,dislikable,intractably pointless excuses for human beings most interested in seeing their names in equally reprehensible tabloid newspapers or c_______ magazines.
With so much competition,it is so difficult,but Paul Danan,desperate enough to star in both series,is the nominal winner;so amazingly smug and irritating that even a prostitute he's just paid Â£1,000,000 would think twice about associating with him,but he's closely followed by Abi Titmuss (notorious for her lascivious public image,but curiously reticent here,maybe because of pound signs in her eyes),Alicia Douvall(grubby groupie),Calum Best(tenth-rate playboy and a poor imitation of his late father George,but minus the peerless footballing talent),and Sophie Anderton.Yes,the ex-cokey model blubbed,scowled,sneered and caterwauled all her way out of our hearts,though she may have been the reason why TV bosses concluded that even this awful spectacle went below the lowest common denominator.By the second series,even the "C" word was dropped as the producers were reduced to persuading the stepsons and stepdaughters of actors and footballers to non-entertain us all.As for who won,well who cares?
Only because nothing happens or things happen very slowly a movie isn't exciting or creates suspense automatically.
The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it made me laugh once.
This is one of the better old-time westerns because:  1 - It is a very fast-moving story.
Also, the movie ends with the unfunny protagonist getting up in the love interest through dancing upside down (because of artificial gravity).
3) The boy's militant father (in one of innumerable flashbacks) makes his son shoot his own dog after it gets hit by a car and breaks a leg, because he won't take it to the vet.
I feel sorry for the story tellers not because of what they claim has happened, but because this film hurts what they have to say.
Unless this movie was made for 8 year old girls, which I doubt because of the almost constant presence of a half-naked woman (get a real woman you anime perverts, or at just go ahead and show them naked if you're gonna do something like this), I would never want to put someone else through the pain of watching this... thing.
just plain out bad because the movie is too slow and it has entirely too much talking just like, "Hannibal" and it's just a under estimated, bad sexual BASIC INSTINCT to me.
It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power.
I gave it 2 out of 10 for it's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make-up was good.
And why didn't Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because Majors wanted her to?
This is why, when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the "Three's Company" pic delivered.
The reason I chose to rate this movie so low is because I couldn't understand a word of it.
I assume it was a funny show because I saw people in the audience laughing their heads off.
But I kept watching this twisting writhing thing I would a sick snake, simply because it did not make much sense.
But these spy things are always a bit like that, tough to make because they are kind of cheap magician tricks, what do you show and what do you hide and if you hide too much its boring or confusing and you show too much and there is not a mystery.
There are others that non-readers will also notice because they make so little sense to the story of the film and this is where the problem lies; in trying to make a faithful adaptation of the small details the screenwriter has forgotten to put any plot in.
Christopher Guest's movies work--when they do--because he uses comic actors & writers.
There was almost no excitement or tension to the poker tournament, perhaps because it is impossible to build tension in the results of a game when that game is severely edited.
Only Gabe Kaplan, a bona fide professional gambler in real life, delivers consistent laughs mostly because his performance is rooted in reality.
I'd be hard-pressed to even classify this as a 'real' movie...It's more of a display of Penn's attempt at 'riding on the edge' of any conventional-type comedy film, meaning it's an (obviously)'improvisational comedy that centers around a cardgame ('The Grand')...Fairly enough, it's taglined as 'an improvisational comedy...using a handful of actors playing characters competing in an actual poker tournament', which is quite accurate...So, you have been warned...I think the problem here (aside from the old 'ust because someone gives you the money to do soething, doesn't mean you should), no the problem is that it's a little 'too improvisational' and feels like it might 'all-be' an improvisation...LIKE NO SCRIPTED LINES WHATSOEVER...It's like a musical where the orchestra didn't have any sheet usic, but a guy going "like this: dong-cha-dong-chucka-dong-dong-dong"...At least that's the way I felt watching this...In fact, the thought 'kept' coming into my mind...I said "self"..."I don't think they had a written script"...
It probably pitches like it could be funny (and even successful), but it falls apart as a film, completely...If you understand this, then you also understand it sounds more like an off-Broadway play...As a matter of fact (and the ore I think about it), this 'movie' would probably do very well in a live theatrical format...Heck, it could take on a life of its own and become syndicated, making the US cities tour, complete with building sized promos appearing in each city months before it premiers to build the anticipation...I'm certain performing arts centers all over the country will sell out all the shows quickly as anticipation grows and of course the wealthy season ticket holders would let everyone know they'll be busy on Friday evening, because they will be at the 'premier' of that play...'The Grand'...As a matter of fact, the more 'I' think about it, given the opportunity; 'I'd' pitch it!
(as a play), because it 'would' be successful (as a play)...
Just because it is a little better than the average dutch movies, doesn't mean that it is a GOOD movie.
Actually copyright 1989, which is important: not just because this is exactly the kind of film that sits around for four years before it gets released, but because it means that this South African production was completed before, not after, Mandela got out of prison.
I say that because the order in which people see episodes generally determines how good,scary,dark and maybe life-changing each one was.Also because all those episodes were filmed around Vancouver in the same forests,fields,villages etc they looked so alike visually that it might as well all have been one continuous series to me.
The audience was supposed to cry with joy with the characters, but you probably didn't or won't, because this movie fails on so many levels.
To be honest with you, I rented this because of the cover: a giant headed, freakishly odd looking alien holding hands with two African kids--that's funny.
I don't want to summarize the plot for you, because I'm still not sure what that was.
I watched this film with my little brother and we had to stop 30 minutes in because he was literally getting sick to his stomach.
Honestly, when I finally finished this movie I felt like dying(it took me a while because I watched about the first half hour and needed to stop on account of the utter idiocy of this movie).
I can't even relay the plot because I lost track 1/3 of the way through.
It all ends happily, of course, because this is a kids' movie.
The producers must've expected a big demand for Nukie merchandise, because every time the word appears it has the little `TM' after it.
Did you ever have a friend who was your friend just because you felt sorry for them?
I like Nukie because I feel sorry for it.
You may not use my spells against me because I'm the half blood Prince.
In all the chaos of tossing the characters about, leaving out essential scenes, people, quotes and other details,they inputed two major scenes that is not in the book, but it would be a bit unfair to say that they are bad, because they're not.
Don't get me wrong, because Mark Williams is a good actor, but I want to state a fact here; Arthur Weasley is practically BALD!
I wish this was a "to be continued" episode, because as much as I hate those, this is an interesting story and they could have gone a lot deeper into it.
but maybe that's because the script is so awful u'd have to have super acting skills to make it remotely likable.
The characters were playing like some idiots at 50% of the time, because of the incredibly stupid script, which focused on the Ron's and Hermione's love story and their personal problems.
The second battle is more interesting, because it's just MISSING.
There's a reason why each of J.K. Rowling's 7 books have brought much fan base all over the world, it's because of the magic of the Harry Potter books.
After viewing however, I can only see it as a waste of time, because the only character it introduced was Greyback, but you never heard of him again through the entire movie until the very end--in which he did nothing.
In the movie, he makes out as if it could be any old thing, a shoe, a can, a piece of paper... (better get searching then Harry, I found the ring, because "Magic leaves traces", but when I die, you're screwed!!!)
And i know I wasn't the only one because i heard laughs and hoots all around the theater.
The only slim ray of hope (because hope springs eternal) left for the next movies is that they include what they missed out in HBP at the start of the first seventh one.
I read somewhere that the director did not want to do the fight because of the fight in book 7.
They really need to re-shoot this movie and try again because it was bad.
For the real fan, it leaves you cold and empty, with no tears for Dumbledore because you are so confused, and wondering why Yates and Co. cared about Lavender being funny more than the back story of Tom Riddle.
Scary Movie was fun even if you can't appreciate the sense of humor or the story line: it's a great movie to watch because it keeps the audience entertained by the parody it brings.
Guys like this must love "The Eagle Has Landed," because the Nazis in it are -- with a few exceptions -- paragons of courage and virtue.
As in another popular sympathy-for-the-Nazis movie, "Das Boot," these branches make convenient villains, serving as a contrast to the clean-cut good-guy Germans who just happen to be fighting for the Fuhrer because...well, they're patriots, that's all; they have absolutely nothing against Jews, and they despise those slimy fanatical Gestapo bastards -- honest!)
Almost every character is unbelievable, even more so because they're fleshed out by major star shtick working with a script and direction that hugged any clichÃ© within reach but with out the swagger, fun or poignancy of, say, "The Great Escape" or "Von Ryan's Express."
I remember when I was in class once and a guy got arrested in class because he tried to run instead of just escorted out to the hall.
Along the way, we learn that it's better to be a navel-gazing spewer of trite truths and drop casual and ineffective references to "Star Wars" and "A Few Good Men" because, gosh, those are movies no one thought to spoof.
Threading its way throughout the entire story is Tracy's brother may or may not be the killer because he escaped from prison.
Briefly, because there's really no other way to discuss it, this short film attempts to tell something about the heroism shown by a troop of Bengal Lancers under British command during WWI, and by Bengal, I mean they are Bengali, from India.
Every scene is dark and most of the time you can't even tell who is talking because it's so shadowed you can't see their mouth.
Question: why is it that movies that wish to involve attractive women always resort to killing them because of their "morals."
Every movie you see with "hot chicks" that are murdered always ends up being because they were thought to be loose women that didn't deserve to live.
Is it because we really think this in society?
The music was generic and horrible, the Clowns' outfits weren't the least bit sexy, the characters didn't have anything unique about them, the movie moved really slowly and I found it hard to believe any word that came out of any character's mouth because either I couldn't see which character was even saying it, or because no one talks like that.
Love's a Bitch, Nine Queens , Cidade DE Deus if you wanna give south America/Latin America movies a try but this one wasn't supposed to be even filmed My vote was 1 because there's no 0 Salutes
This was without a doubt a very cheap production and the political correctness of adding a woman to the visitors on the Nautilus was pretty dumb, because you have a crew that hasn't seen a woman in a long time and everyone is well mannered and behaved, well you fill in the blanks.
The production values aside, this movies shines because of a simple plot, appropriate music and an outstanding lead cast.
I generally like science fiction and was interested in it because it was a Mars based movie.
Some low-budget horror movies are cool because you can tell that the people who made it really has an interest in the genre, and that they love what they do, but the people who made this probably decided to make a horror movie because it's cheap, went out and rented a bunch of old old classics, and started filming without much of a plan.
I'm not sure if this is suppose to be related to the audiences the films are produced for, because if so, they are undermining these moviegoers.
It's appearance on television should have been delayed until (the US) Thanksgiving because few families will be able to manage such a giant turkey,
Also, the movie gets pretty boring because of the lack of action and excessive useless dialogs.
Landers stars as a twenty-something and supposedly sexy young woman who witnesses her mother getting killed by cheesy and unconvincing killer Sharkey, because he's looking for "papers" that apparently are very important to him as well as to the people who hired him to kill the woman and to get rid of any other possible witnesses.
Even decisions he makes at the end as Fletcher wishes to abandon their work, kind of lacks logic(..he'd be willing to jeopardize his career releasing patients that had been tested on like guinea pigs he himself contributed to), although maybe the filmmakers were hoping to humanize him a bit because in working out a formula he was hoping to cure brain ailments.
This is because it is a very stuffy costume picture--just the sort of film that emphasizes costumes and stilted language (oh joy) over action and characters.
He soon goes off to fight in the Napoleonic Wars for 10 years and when he returns, he sees a radiant woman who he thinks can't be Hepburn because she seems so young.
Is a propaganda piece for thinking locally and acting locally and horror movie designed to make one paranoid because it turns out that the people who are supposed to be protecting us, are incompetent in all the ways that we usually figure that they would be.
So what we have is Scott afraid to make a movie about the fact that war goes wrong just because war always goes wrong, and instead making a movie about how war goes wrong because our Special Ops are populated with people who either can't breathe when the going is tough, or having seizures when the going is tough.
Once, you have that set-up, that's when the politics really is deplorable--because of the fall back on such idiocies as 'heroism' and just looking our for your friends.
We already know who'll live and die because it's a flashback, so there's no suspense either.
A few years back her own son killed himself because he was gay, & this one of the reasons they run Genesis House, We are concerned with 2 of the guys.
I totally disliked this film, because it just went ahead and threw the James Bond of lore out the window.
I'd rather not offend Mr Craig, but I must admit that he is the worst casted James Bond ever in the history of the series it's not his fault though because the filmmakers were the ones who chose him.
Its excruciatingly dull to watch the "game" both at the poker table and between bond and 'the girl' because we all know where its going and its not fun.
There have been some bad Bond movies in the past, but they were bad only because they didn't live up to the standards set by better Bond movies before them.
If you're hoping for any kind of Bond movie at all, watch one that was made before this one - because despite the title and the lead characters name.
All in all I had to watch it to the end, because there was nothing else on the TV to switch to.
No, because that... is... NOT...
To which, the emasculated James Bond replies (watch out, humor coming your way): "That's because you know what I can do with my little finger."
I guess I just felt let down because the T-Rex as a villain has been done before in the 16 years since "Jurassic Park" was released.
It may also be because the chase scenes with Will Ferrell seemed flat and uninspired, both as a science fiction and comedy plot point.
maybe it is because he is coming from an alcohol addiction background and is more accepting, while she is trying to make amends for driving away her son without really understanding that love exists in all forms, straight or gay, and that acceptance of others is the only truly Christian way of living.
I blame Disney a bit for this film because cutting corners and cost is not an excuse for making poor films.
This view of the rural West feels very genuine (and I know because I've lived there before).
The answer: because it's not very goodÂan independent, low-budget, shot-on video effort that attempts in vain to replicate the brutality and grittiness of 70s and 80s Euro-crime flicks, but which fails thanks to a lazy script which relies so heavily on expletives that I can only assume writer/director Darren Ward was going for the World Record for most swearing in a movie (and would wager that he succeeded), and a cast who are, with the exception of David Warbeck, simply dreadful.
With a running time of around 102 minutes, there are far too many opportunities for our budding thesps to practise their art, and between the bursts of violence, viewers are treated to countless dull-as-ditchwater scenes in which various bad guys face-off with each other whilst swearing a lot and gesticulating wildly (either because the 'actors' are completely at a loss at what to do with their limbs whilst their mouths are moving, or are under the misguided notion that pointing a lot equates to a powerful performance).
I give Sudden Fury a rating of 2.5 out of 10 for being so irksome for so much of the time, but generously add an extra half point for its gratuitously violent content, the so-crap-it's-funny sex scene between troubled hit-man anti-hero Walker and a coke-addled hooker, several hilarious jungle warfare flashbacks that look as though they were filmed in the local woods (because they were), and a full-body burn stunt that is actually pretty impressive.
Fortunately I only saw snippets of this film because it became just too stupid to watch.
Basically, a satellite emplacement goes awry because the satellite collides with an alien spaceship running on autopilot and bound for an automated landing on earth.
Also the CGI for Ryuk was very good, which means a lot because CGI always pisses me off (it always looks too fake for me).
You'd be much better off seeing the anime (which is excellent) or maybe watching "L" when it comes out next year, because the same actor is in it.
And because Shuya isn't.
Maybe I should have read the manga after all, because after reading other reviews I think a lot of blame for this poor film goes to the director and screen writer of the film.
There is scene in Retrograde where all characters in a spaceship fell on the floor because of the spaceship's twisting...
That's why if its funny, I can not laugh, because that kind of jokes appeared too much in movies.
It's a shame because I like the director, Hideo Nakata, I thought the Ring movies were great, even the US remakes were alright and the direction here is not the problem.
Even Death Note veteran Kenji Kawai's score, while certainly not bad, is a far cry from his work on the previous films, though largely because he's mostly forcibly limited to low key background music and the long periods of sluggish silence Nakata so adores.
It's an awful shame, because with the ingredients left by its marvellous predecessors, it could have been truly great.
I was forced to go watch it with some friends that hate me now because they heard me sware.
Nicktoons is dieing off now and thats a good thing because nicktoons disirves to die for banning Ren & Stimpy.
I'm not saying this movie is bad because they banned Ren & Stimpy.
That said, watching the downward spiral of Railsback's character into the drug world is highly entertaining, if only because it brings him into contact with a sweating, primped, slick-haired, and fascinatingly evil Ian McShane.
This would explain his totally flat performance (just because the protagonist is alienated doesn't mean you don't have to act)!
I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, but it is more like a sterile view of something that could be scary just because of the subject matter, but doesn't come off that way.
I had a pretty hard time watching the whole thing just because it was so boring.
Like a lot of style-over-substance J-Horror films, the plot eventually comes to rely upon inexplicable twists and mysterious appearances that may excite some people's interest but in reality are the signs of bad writing and a half-baked story that can be modified with ease because nothing significant is taking place anyway.
I only rented this because i loved the first movie.
I rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original Vampires.
There's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because its a sequel to some-one else's movie), but it is totally buried under an underwritten, badly executed and laughably un-thought-out script.
I only got this movie because I am a fan of Greg, but I must admit the kids casting was terrible except from Munyaradzi Kanaventi (mouthful!)
I am not slamming it because of the camcorder back yard feel it gives off.
The scene where the promise is made is very disappointing because of the weak arguments, circumstances, and acting, for such a serious promise.
That would have been a satisfying ending, because the way things play now, here's what the audience is thinking, "He deserves to catch the killer.
While there were some very good episodes during the last season of Star Trek, there were probably just as many disappointments--probably because they knew the series was on its last legs and no one in charge really seemed to care.
It seems that the planet is actually so overwhelmingly overpopulated because they have no natural disease that they wanted to kidnap Kirk and take germs from him and introduce them to the woman--making her sort of like a "Typhoid Mary" who will help reduce the population through illness instead of instituting reasonable birth control.
I've seen a lot of these women in prison films, but I don't know why I keep watching them because I've hated every one that I've seen.
It is a pity because I think these actors were capable of turning polyester into silk.
The legendary director Jess Franco apparently seemed to think so, because almost half of the titles that fall under this category are his.
Just because so many prisoners die, the government sends a new female principal to the island.
I don't like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it.
If you're a fan of Gerry's don't worry, he's as adorable and precious as he always is, but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot, good luck because you'll need it, either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake!
4/10...and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea of how to spell his name!
Forget about any scary ghosts, any violence or anything you might be looking for in a horror film because this is one extremely tame film.
just makes stuff up as he goes and he just gets away with it because, well, I don't know why.
This sci-fi/horror/conspiracy thriller sadly constitutes as one of Margheriti's dullest and least satisfying features, mainly because it's crucially bereft of the gleefully trashy verve which distinguishes his more enjoyable efforts.
I don't know and cannot imagine why Chow Yun-fat made this movie (he does not appear until more than 50 minutes into it) because he was successful already...he should have done commercials and sold floor wash or denture cleaners, done anything except this movie.
Bruce Willis plays Tom Mix and James Garner plays Wyatt Earp; in truth they just play themselves (their standard characters) and because they are both very likable and have decent chemistry together the film has a strong foundation.
Eventually the boy escapes because he's trying to get medical help for his buddy, Shorty.
O'Brien's a bootlegger and when his warehouse is raided, Junior takes the fall because he won't rat out his pal.
I know it will cause a lot of sorrow in this world with the people because they will find out it will not bring happiness.
Especially Marsha Cross, she is so ugly, and her head looks like a golden egg, or something all shiny and tight because she is so stupid and concerned about a single line that she is willing to look inhuman to fix it, and her acting is total crap!
And because the story lines are convoluted and intertwined, I can't just watch it once in a while and enjoy it either.
But he didn't enjoy much of a screen career after that and, on the basis of this, I can only assume it's because he's really not a very good actor.
The I Inside is a complex movie and while some may dislike it for it's complicating story lines others may just because of it.
The woman in this film is put through an ordeal because she had the audacity to leave her husband, Hamill's mother was a psychopath (Hamill's sister had an affair with him), another female victim talks back to her boyfriend and the first female victim is shrewish, hence these women are either killed or put through an ordeal.
Company is necessary, not because of the thrill, or something like that, just because if you're alone, nobody will believe you!
Silly as it is with things on the cover that aren't in the film, the dubbing is utterly painful - totally out of synch - and when the story is as fragmented as is the case in the version I saw, one has to wonder if the dubbing missed out things, or if the Danish version has been cut, because the storyline is pretty much impossible to understand.
The absolute low-point comes at the funeral scene, where the kid throws a tantrum because everyone's crying at his mother's death (?!
"The Ring Two," titled such because Nakata evidently doesn't know that you can use a single character to depict a number, starts off exactly like the last one, with two bad actors plugging in the infamous videotape where at least one will eventually die.
I would recommend a re-watching of the original, or perhaps checking out the various Japanese versions and sequels, because it can't get ANY worse than this.
I normally don't post a comment, because normally it all has been said pretty much.
***POSSIBLE SPOILER***  I'll have to go back & review that part, because that wasn't necessarily what was implied in this film.
That's because there's not a whole lot that goes on.
The movie didn't have much of a plot (even for those of us with more creative imaginations), and, because of that, it was difficult to follow.
It wasn't because she was thrown in a well - she was afraid of water as soon as she was born.
I mention all of this as a precursor to the review because The Ring was a modern day miracle.
I don't know where to lay the blame, because Ehren Krueger, whom I respect very much, returned to pen the sequel and you have the director of the Japanese film that started it all, helming this one.
And the professor is apparently none too bright, because he seems to suspect nothing.
Apparently it is, and if you want to save him you could forgive him because the screenplay was adapted from his own play, and as I have said before, a play can be good but it doesn't have to make a good movie.
You've got to compare then because the first one sucks and the latter one is great; because the cast of the first one is way superior to the latter one'sÂ   I like Ryan Phillippe is a starring role: I liked "Cruel Intentions" and very much liked "Antitrust".
Not because of the quality, not the length.
The joke works because the "homage" stresses the banality of the composition.
However, he appears bored in this reunion (probably because he was currently dong Broadway).
Luke had a goatee because he needed it for a production he was doing on Broadway (he flew back and forth to do the reunion).
It seems as though it was shot in high-def and DV and maybe some VHS-C because there is zero consistency in the picture quality even within a given scene.
?--that are also going to croak because I spent and extra two minutes in the shower this morning.
Some bears die in the film and it is very, very sad--thankfully my youngest daughter and I were out taking a leak during the bear death sequence because it might have over-traumatized my little 4-year-old.
Second: (Usual since 10 years as well): It's only because of you male punks (Car-drivers, electricity-users and so on) that these cuddly (female) creatures won't be able to live (hunt???)
in the years forthcoming, because of your blame only, their world is going to disappear.
The film looks like someone with a few dollars (not that many, actually) thought that other martial arts films are bad because they are violent, have actors with actual martial arts skills and don't star talentless kids and teens.
There's 3 annoying kids who who communicate entirely in sarcasm talking about a white-dragon character/crime fighter but it's difficult to know if he's real or not because we've just cut to a montage of fresh-air karate training again (really the same 3 kids just wearing masks).
this sparked my attention because later in the movie they saw white dragon on a Japanese comic, they were wondering who he was, even though they were informed of him in the first FIVE MINUTES of the movie.
All in all, this deserved a 0, but I had to give it a 1 because there is no lower score.
I hope whoever made this film was really, really, high and just decided to make a joke film, because if it was a serious movie, wow I feel bad for him.
Shrek 1 & 2, as with all Dreamworks animation, are bent on bombarding the audience with modern pop culture references ad nauseum -- partially because the creators believe such recycling is humorous, but also I suspect because they understand, smartly, that modern audiences desperately sop up pop references as a means of affirming their own image of themselves.
I am second guessing myself over my "1" rating because I usually reserve 1 for extremely bad movies but I couldn't give this higher than a 1.5.
The actors and actresses were all very unattractive which sucked because there was a lot of sexual situations.
It made no sense because it was just a 2 story house.
Make sure to come back here and review it because it's pretty likely that as soon as I post this, we'll get a few positive ghost reviews by people that worked on it.
Linda packs up her staff for Indiana to do a cover story for their June issue, covering a wedding in small-town Midwest, U.S.A. Once there, they have to completely transform the house and the people in it, because they do not meet the cosmopolitan standards of these New Yorkers.
There's actually not a lot more to say about the film, except that it's too bad that "June Bride" wasn't better, because it was rare for a couple of reasons: It was one of the few Bette Davis comedies and it was one of the few Bette Davis films I had not yet seen.
Emily then decides she must live among the Chasidim to learn about their community, to prevent further murders, because the murder looked like an inside job, a possibility considered unthinkable by the Jews.
Both the Chasidim and her bosses readily accept this implausible idea because it's the only way to advance the plot.
In fact, he would be more likely not to speak to her at all because she is a woman not related to him!
Less compelling are those moments involving Ariel and Emily of the NYPD, since their interest in each other strains credulity, not only because their backgrounds make it unlikely, but due to the lack of any chemistry between Eric Thal and Melanie Griffith.
No doubt she was cast because at the time she was still Hollywood's flavor-of-the-month, but we are asked to suspend disbelief and accept her not only as a New York police officer, but as one who would be selected to go undercover and infiltrate the Jewish community and live with them as one of their own.
Perhaps the director couldn't catch the atmosphere in the book, because the movie was a huge disappointment.
I mean I can't believe that the Swedish language/accent hasn't change since 1150-2007Â The lines was empty and when the accents was so poor, this equaled in very low performance, and I sometimes felt that I was watching Swedish Big BrotherÂ I think this is because Swedish actors has not yet understood that acting is with whole body, eye moves, body-language, etc, not just standing there like a jukebox and saying your lines one after other.
(Not possible spoilers, MAJOR spoilers, you can rest assured...) I'm writing this review because reading the other comments, I think this movie is being misunderstood by many people.
Many people give it a low rating because of the ending which they see as a kind of cheap way to "solve the riddle".
However, his plan fails because some other car is there with a couple making love.
Anyway, when he had a "bad intention", Simon chose the wrong road, because it eventually led to him getting involved in a car crash, and Anna blackmailing him.
Actually, the fact that no one answers the phone in both cases might be exactly the reason why the fateful car crash appears in both scenarios (although in one of the scenarios, Simon survives and in the other, he doesn't): Claire decides to return because she is getting worried about Simon and/or Peter.
I'm giving it a 10 nonetheless, not because I think it is worth a 10 (I would give it a 7 or 8 or so), but because I find the general ratings given here ridiculously low (There's more to rating movies than only giving a 1 or a 10, people...).
Also, the scenographic, props and wardrobe division deserves a gold medal because thats beautiful work!
It looks great and big (at least parts of it), but something is wrong with the acting or the direction (or maybe the script) because you never really get drawn into the story and you don't really care about the characters.
When you do get to the aliens, you're pretty disappointed because they are the dumbest looking aliens you'll ever see.
"fight club" works because the protagonist and his alter ego always occupy the same physical space.
having the point of view switch when the cops see the video was not only jolting but bad movie making, because there was no reason beyond confusing the audience with facts that can't possibly fit the film thus far.
Although I doubt it makes a difference because my complaint has to do broadly with the plot of this film, my review is based off the US theatrical release.
It's very hard to say exactly what happened in the movie because after that revelation, it is obvious that 99% of the movie must be dismissed as nonsensical.
A film that leaves itself open to interpretation is not a bad thing in itself, but in this case the audience has nothing to interpret because they are given nothing to work with and there is little incentive to bother.
The only unique thing about this film was the casting, not to say that most of the actors werent miscast, because they were but Redford put unknown actors in the lead, and "name" actors in smaller supporting roles, I thought that was an interesting touch.
Pass on this film, people, it will make you want to beat your head off a couple of rocks and then stick your head in a microwave while you sit on a grill, because this movie is utter crap!
Neither of these is enough to carrying this overblown movie though, especially the NYC angle, which is spoiled because it appears they shot this movie during the monsoon season.
A recommendation to any aspiring directors: make sure the annoying characters get eaten, and if you really insist on naming 80% of your French characters Jean-something, at least have them laugh at themselves for it IN the movie - don't just hope people will notice and think its funny, because they won't.
As badly made those films were, they were still incredibly fun because of all the camp.
Alas, 'Movie Crazy' is a particular disappointment, probably because it's been hyped as Lloyd's best sound film.
Maybe it's because the character is moving at the speed of sound, rather than having the slightly fantastic under-cranked zip of silence; maybe it's because this Harold is a stuttering, stumbling, unsure boob rather than the confident, intelligent boy of yesteryear; maybe it's just because Lloyd was running out of ideas; but this is far from his best sound film, let alone being his best film of all.
It may well be that the reason the film has received such exalted praise in the past is because people have hitherto only seen the shorter edit.
I only remembered this movie because I was considering what movies would be on the "all time worst" list.
Suffice it to say, I find this movie very depressing, mainly because of Heather O'Rourke and her untimely death after making POLTERGEIST III.
Its running time is rather short in length, but because of that it kept my full interest.
Any decent horror movie worth its salt has suspense, or tries to utilise it because that is what terror is all about, the long silences waiting for something to happen, the build up to it... Poltergeist 2 simply does not even try in this area,For example when carol Anne sees Kane at the mall, menacing and staring at her, in order to build up the tension, Director Brian Gibson didn't need to show us that Kane was a ghost, any director with any idea of suspense would have let us make up our own minds, as soon as we see Kane walking through people and things we know straight away what he is and any suspense vanishes.
I saw this movie because the guy that played Harry was my drama teacher.
Big-name actor Stephen Rea as Doctor Newman is nothing to write home about, but that may partly be because his role is relatively less significant to the total story.
I would really like to know if this mckenzie-c guy had anything to do with the production, because none of the positive attributes he states in his review are in this boring clichÃ©d nonsenical disasterpiece.
It's got some pretty women in it, but you can hardly tell because it's lit so badly and the cameras jerk around so much.
Other shots were clearly intended to be slow-motion, but these lost much of their effect and believability, because motion blur wasn't added.
Problem is, I really wanted to like this because of the environmental/physical similarities, but the dialog was inane and I suspect the original target audience was actually older than the 7 - 10 year old demographic to which it belongs (due to some fairly graphic violence, e.g., blood spatter).
It should not get props just because it was an independent, low-budget film.
Karl Marx thought that George's theory was "the more unpardonable in him because he ought to have put the question to himself in just the opposite way: How did it happen that in the United States, where .
2) India and China are not emerging economies because of communist protectionism (as mentions Cliff Cobb); on the contrary, they boomed only after they opened their markets.
Those are things I knew, but because of that, I was skeptical about all the other information in the documentary.
I rented this loser because it mentioned Campbell Scott, who I admire very much as an actor, and New Orleans.
The story, if you can call it that, revolves around a promising pro golfer who got bounced off the tour because he wanted to search for the "meaning of life" and decided to drink along the way.
But be advised I gave this a 3 out of 10 only because the photography is very good and the cast obviously needed the money and tries very hard.
While browsing around a Video Store one day, my girlfriend picked this up out of the  bargain bin for about five bucks because she said that it looked like  it would be interesting and how could you go wrong for five dollars etc.
The good news is, there are greener pastures ahead for Scott (as well as all of his costars here), because after this, there is definitely no way to go but up.
Actually this little bit is really funny because the filmmakers decided to have bagpipes playing on the soundtrack as well!
Only Sylvia manages to escape into the mountains, the bandits kidnap Professor Lacombe because he is a 'wise man' & Melody because she's a pretty young girl, hey it would be a good enough reason for me!
By the way, you know how to recognize a film scripted by Paul Naschy because he always foresees a sequence of him having sex with beautiful woman that would usually never fall for him.
", but for the love of Christ possessed, I can't remember why... 1/10 and, uhm, I guess, ehrr, maybe 5/10..., meaning 9/10 for being the worst piece of rubbish out of the lot, and 1/10 because I couldn't laugh with it.
Sweeney is less successful, mostly because his role is a stilted, repugnant mess.
I bet the reason Kingsley (the police) looks angry at times is because heÂ´s starting to realize the movie will suck.
What I should have done was to put my eyes out, stick my fingers in my ears, and have run shrieking out into the night, because THAT would have at least made sense.
Maybe because I was so bored and tired to get up from my comfortable sofa and change DVD.
I guess she also needed the money wanted to finish and go home because like everybody else, her acting was extremely cheesy.
Don't say to me that is a good sequel, because its not, its a fucklng shlt!!
Very bad outcome, especially because a lot of people were to watch this to see the conflict between the bugs and the humans when bugs were only present for around 5 to 10 minutes of the film.
Notice I haven't even mention starship troopers 2 a lot throughout this review, its because it isn't anything in comparison to the original starship troopers (even to this one), and should be AVOIDED.
And apparently just because they can write, it all of the sudden means that they can direct too?
I still remember that evening when I first borrowed "DIL CHAHATA HAI" CD secretly on the way back from mathematics coaching & very excited to watch it because my sister watched it two days ago & highly praised.
My wife and I watched it to conclusion only because we thought there would be a punch line that rewarded us for enduring the film.
Obviously he took part in it as a favor for a friend or because he desperately needs the money.
It's as though someone said, let's have an earthquake strike Manhattan because having people trapped in a subway system would be cool.
1 The family man who we know loves his wife and kids, because he either talked about how much he loves them or we see a happy family picture on a desk.
I am happy that I saw it in one sitting because I believe this had to be a 2 night movie when it first aired.
I am also glad to see that some of the film companies are starting to expand into other more controversial subjects about the morays and tabu's because I find not only is the films entertaining but I have learned a lot more about the culture and it's people.
And I must not forget the song writers and singers whomever they are because to me they share as much credit as the cast.
That's because this movie doesn't know WHAT it is trying to be!
"The Bostonians" still remains a politically offensive minor effort easily overlooked because it also commits the crime of being dull.
Once the attacks start to increase in regularity the town starts to "panic" or to be more accurate become slightly agitated because a cabal of secret government agent don't want the virus to spread so they quarantine the entire village.
It's because films are aimed at lower/middle class traditionalist uneducated people who cling onto whats familiar.
Well after watching this movie and loving it, my intial thought was : was this film great because it was different and a break from the cheesy nonsense that bollywood has thrown my way before.
Or was this film great because it was actually a great film.
Quite why the government come to the decision to obliterate the town off the face of the planet because of the presence of a lone toxic madman is really never fully explained.
I hesitate to criticize foreign films too harshly because what we see is a dubbed version that has undergone who knows what changes in coming to an American audience.
We find that he's mutated into a horrible monster that avoids the light...not so much because he's photosensitive as that the makeup isn't really all that convincing when seen in full light.
We know these people are going to be attacked by the monster because, with the exception of the family in the last attack- the father is involved with the research project- they have no connection with the story other than being potential monster chow.
It's not in me to call people "bad" actors (something other reviewers in this page have made a point of because of a comment made by the leading man that leaves this avenue wide open.
You have Bitty Schram (older episodes) and Traylor Howard (newer episodes) as his assistants, who put up with the worst out of him just because of his intelligence (as far as IQ goes; not emotional intelligence).
The one adventure that they have in this move is aborted because they forgot to fill up.
This films gets you away from Bollywood because it is not focussing on some stupid love story.
This film is not quite Hollywood because it has some principles of independent films going on within itself.
Although, a little old to play their parts, I let out a suspension of disbelief because the film is just so much fun!
This one is probably a good film if you're on a psychedelic drug because it is all hype and little else.
In the original version, Betty is an incredibly smart girl, and gets really nervous around people, obviously because her father kept her from socializing..ever.
Or because Bobby was dead?
I was always curious about Darby because I grew up in the late 70's and early 80's and I saw and read about him in many magazines I read at the time.
Maybe it was because he was more the anti-hero.
Carpenter must have gone senile, because his movies have traditionally been some of the best around.
Mr Cube, taking a step away from the acting of Three Kings, seems to have scripted a lot of his own dialogue in righteous gangsta speak, but his portrayal of a hardened criminal doesn't really work because, put simply, he looks like a big teddy bear.
And don't try to say it wasn't his fault or anything, because he shares screenplay credit.
The flashback didn't work because it was a big letdown as to how Natasha Henstridge ended up being the only survivor on the train coming back from the miner community.
It's quite tragic because all it becomes is a lame monster movie on Mars.
He's supposed to be mad because invaders (the humans) have set foot on his planet.
Maybe it's because he can't say any other words than "waah" and "raah".
This movie so badly wants to be a good SCI-FI, but it can't be that, because it so badly wants to be a good WESTERN, but it can't be that, because it so badly wants to be a good MONSTER MOVIE, but it can't because the script and props suck.
That is because I payed good money to view this movie.
In fact those old magnetic mines would be ineffective today because of specialized hull construction.
First of all, the motivation for the Geum-Ja's bloodthirsty revenge--she's angry because a kidnapping she was involved with ended in murder?
I don't know whether to consider this a spoiler or not, because it does not spoil any part of the plot really for you if you haven't seen it, and it takes place right smack dab in the middle of the movie, but just in case, I'm notifying you.
Korea is the country that eats them, and apparently allows authentic deaths of animals in its movies, so I am really trying hard to believe that, because the dog being actually killed by the bullets is technically not shown, they didn't kill the dog because they didn't actually have to kill the dog.
It's not because of any of the technical qualities.
No, Sympaty for Lady Vengeance is pathetic because the story and the characters are both flat and uninteresting.
stamps because they are brainwashed into "If it's Asian, it has to be better than American!"
I could care less about the characters because all they do is stare at the camera Napoleon Dynamite-style.
In this case, because of the performers I fast forwarded to see the performances.
Too bad, because the basic story is fascinating.
This was possibly the first Hindi movie where the young generation of India was so realistically depicted and because of that I can relate to this very much as a young man.
Despite, or maybe because of all this, I actually found the movie very charming and quite intriguing.
This all gets remembered because it was unusual for the time, and therefore "clever".
It's actually during this process that his pictures start to improve, and I'm even glad that he never totally lost his showy style, because he was occasionally even great in genres such as the musical or the swashbuckler, which require a bit of flamboyance behind the camera.
The tyrannical ruler of this movie(played by Orson Welles) is emotionless and just not very impressive as a person but supposedly because he had the money he could rule over everyone.
Every time he appeared on screen I would roll my eyes and groan because he looked like a Keith Partridge wannabe trying to appear tough by smoking cigarettes.
Maybe some people think it funny because it is so bad... but even that is not possible with this 'movie' in my opinion.
The director is partly to blame, because he's always having Scott do these clownish double takes to the camera that really do not suit him.
Joan Bennett is mis-cast because she feels too contemporary.
No wonder it has been canceled, because it had no potential of getting any better soon and was really really boring and unoriginal.
I'm not sure why fans like this show and keep asking for it to come back, if it were for me i wouldn't watch a second season of this show, and I'm glad there isn't another season, because it really sucked !
I rented this movie because it sounded sexy and hot.
He suffers horribly because they suffer because of their love for him.
Those questions were discussed very seriously in the late 60's (and still are) because "2001" was a believable world where our powers of disbelief remained suspended for 2 1/2 hours.
At best, "Grand Slam" will barely pass as a rental when the other choices are few, which is too bad because it showed many traces of potential, but never capitalized on any of them.
This was very very boring and lame, this should need some more happiness, kindness and entertainment to make it a great movie for all ages because it's about like 2 very clever kids who really know a way to save Christmas and escape a evil dark attic in an old crooked house and like every 10 or 20 minutes, the young kids keep returning to the attic.
4/10 ps: even in this case, the dvd is better than vhs because it'll never get screwed like tapes will.
Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.
The original "Xtro" (1983) still remains a cult favorite these days, because of the gory effects and weird nightmare sequences.
That can also be said about the creature, you can hardly see it and that may be for the best because it is bad and awful.
But only because it is the worst, worst movie ever made.
Comparing it to even the worst heroic-fantasy has to offer doesn't do it justice, because while those films are merely poor, this film's badness is extreme.
Yet this film is a marvel because you'll be spellbound, either horrified and unable to move or laughing yourself into a coma.
Subtitles are hardly necessary, because as a visual feast of ludicrousness, the film delivers.
Through Hollywood, the Indians actors would be more widely known because it is a place to rocket people's name over one night.
I hope some male "Khan" would do so somewhere in Oscar or Cannes again because they do deserve it.
The idea had some real possibilities and I disagree that it is disgusting to speculate what would occur in such a situation because it could lead to some meaningful conversation.
But I suppose that will not matter because the Democrats and all the wet liberals and leftists are so closed minded that any thing that puts down Bush must be just brilliant.
However this will remain to others, who have seen more than this movie and have a different understanding of this world in which we live in, an intellectual 'wheelchair' to the Liberal base that doesn't indeed look for the good in America but continues to find a 'Villain' in the U.S.   My question is, before 9/11, when there were still three thousand people in one piece, and Bin Laden was offered to President Clinton, on two different occasions, when William passed on taking him, because he said, "We have no business, with Bin Laden."
Ugh...this was painful to commit to watching the whole show...because I knew it was going to be 97 minutes that I will never get back.
The only satisfaction I got out of this is no one would think this was real because of how bad the acting was.
I give it the worst rating not because it wasn't well done, on the contrary it is executed with perfect timing and very possible outcomes... the only problem is if you make a movie make sure that it is a MOVIE, not a mockery of people's intelligence.
Second, this is NOT a political movie, it's a murder mystery you don't care about because it didn't happen.
I feel bad because I asked my local library to purchase a copy based on IMDb's comments.
Homer Simpson once said "It's funny 'cause it's true" and The Daily Show proves this every night; War, Inc. however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny.
The first movie by an unknown young guy Farhan Akhtar (may be known earlier because of his famous parents Javed Akhtar - lyricist in this movie - and Honey Irani) and what a fantastic job he did both in direction and script writing.
Interesting, but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart.
Her ex-husband (Peter Lawford) tells Marsh that she ended the marriage because she was in love with a woman.
There is a nice scene as Marsh uses the phone in the house (his car tire and radio cord were slashed) to call for a fire truck and ambulance, only to have to sit outside and watch the house burn down and Lawford die, because the assailant, who took off in Lawford's car, blocked with the car the "one-way tunnel" between the town and the house, delaying the reinforcements.
Krycek and CSM were interesting because they had MOTIVES.
After THE BLUE ANGEL and MOROCCO, DISHONORED was a bit of a come down for me, in my opinion it is the one film that Dietrich made with Joseph Von-Sternberg that has the least meaning, Publicity hyped it up because it was released at the same time as MGMs MATA HARI with Greta Garbo, unfortunately for Dietrich she was no match for Garbo and MATA HARI wins hands down.
She's sexy and alluring as all get out, she has to be because if she wasn't the audiences would have been rolling up the aisles.
i was totally appalled by this movie and only finished watching it because i was a kickboxer movie fan.
Tong Po wasn't finished yet, because he ran away in part 4.
"He learned too late that man was a feeling creature and because of it the greatest in the universe..." ...next time on Biography!
And because of it the greatest in the universe.
Which is a better film because they had less to work with, had to push themselves, and came up with more, where it seems with "Dracula & Son" they had more money, more access to locations & talents, and less disciplined results.
But despite the sometimes overly violent scenes, I think it great that the show is marketed towards little tots like my nephews because only children that age can be naive enough not to read into the wise-cracking and very subjective manner of the show.
Anyone who still believes this movie shames the original ... or that the series itself isn't worth seeing needs to have his or her brain removed ... because it's obviously not being used correctly.
It was because of them that the first movie really worked.
In Krrish on the other hand, you get a feeling that Krrish only fell in love with Priya because she's the first woman his age that he's seen all his life until that point!
( Kevin takes a picture of Hary and Marv,and runs to his cousin's house where he has set the traps because his cousins have gone on vacation to Paris and is on the balcony and is followed by Harry and Marv)  "Pass the camera boy,and we'll leave.
(Kevin turns to get a brick but Harry and Marv start to laugh because they think it's the camera)  (Kevin throws down the brick and it hits Marv)  (Then he throws it again and it hit's Marv again)
Anyway the director must have been the son of the inventor of the fog machine because every scene outside is foggy, not an exaggeration either.
It was very hilarious at times because of how awful it was.
Well...as long as its the the MST3K version, because this movie is pure crap.
The ending provides no resolution whatsoever, which actually doesn't matter because it's impossible to care about any of the overly stereotyped characters anyway.
And if the music sucks, it can only be because the, ah, movie(s?)
So do not, I repeat, do not watch "The Pod People" without Joel and the Bots of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," because after watching the MST3K version, I couldn't imagine what this movie would be like without the funny commentary!
Well, not all of them, which is unfortunate because then the movie would be over in thirty minutes!
You know a movie is bad,I mean really,really bad when your 11 yr old tells you that they want it on DVD - because its the funniest film they have ever seen.
I think the director stole his kids piggybank and used it to fund the entire movie because thats the only explanation for the ridiculously stupid battles and explosions.
This is because there is SO many things that lacked consistency and how many coincidences can you get, plenty!
Just how big are they supposed to be because the rubber ones used to stick on someone when they are being attack is about twice the size of the CGI designs!
Quite unnecessarily, all the more so because it is an everyday plagiarism.
It may sound bitter but we all agreed that the reason was because the industry in this country is crippled by nepotism with people getting their movies financed simply because they know the right people , not because they have any obvious talent   MAD COWS is a case in point .
Anna Friel spends the movie with an entirely unconvincing Aussie accent while Joanna Lumley is abysmal since she recreates her role as Patsy Stone from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS   The supporting cast I will reserve judgement on because I've a feeling that the director Sara Sugarman is more to blame than the actors themselves .
...no really they did - not just because this film was so awful, but you simply never know!
The filmmakers are trying to generate so much sympathy for Roth that none is generated at all because of the film; only when the audience member sits down and thinks, "Well, wasn't she a victim of show business (and life in general)."
Obviously Mr Grubin had to fill up his 6 hour doc with idle images because he couldn't use stock film footage they way used on his other docs.
It might be "the best Irish/Celtic horror film" because it might be the only "Irish/Celtic horror film."
I can't even remember any of the plots because none of them had the possibility of holding my attention.
Despite, or perhaps because of its flaws, I liked it.
Just because children seem to like the lead protagonist does not automatically mean the audience will.
This is a motion picture that can degrade in the studio vaults to its hearts content because it will never be missed.
He has a daughter with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, but they split up because Tom prefers to spend his time drinking, painting, and having casual sex with women he meets at a club owned by Adam Ant.
I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it.
7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazy  I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it.
Still, it didn't matter because the film made mega-bucks and Fox laughed all the way to the bank.
The main male character is a poor excuse for a human being whose only reason for taking a slave is because his dog died.
Some movies are bad, but entertaining because they are bad.
The only reason I gave it one star is because there isn't a zero-star voting option.
The show was meant to be a low budget sci-fi TV series show because it wanted to be not because it had to be.
The only good point about this show is Kryten......only because its the original.
It feels like everyone has returned because they knew they had a sure-fire hit on their hands rather than any pressing concern to continue this story arc.
Its impossible to feel for his plight because he's so unlikable.
Bottom line: technically amazing, visually good, but I can only recommend to stay clear of it because the plot is so depressingly disappointing.
I'm giving this a 2 because Rydall is good (and really handsome) and there are good performances by Tweed and Richard Roundtree (!!)
Rydell is a stunt performer turned would be leading hunk and now a writer ("The Power Rangers") which is helpful because he got to do all of his own stuntwork, though I am not sure if Allen Garfield was that spry.
The perfidious witch switches from Nick because, as she puts it, she wants to know "where we go from here" after a five-year-long love affair.
Probably because they had no idea it would turn out so poorly.
Primarily, I suppose, because Jigsaw is a Hollywood lecture on the need to fight extremism.
So overall it is a very bad movie, but if you persist to have your own opinion about it, don't read further because from here on i will give some SPOILERS.
They looking for guys and police blocks the road, then we see them turning right because they go that way for they little day off just before the police setup, you really think the police wouldn't stop them to do a little control?
because it won't work for a good while when it is in the water, second of all where in the name of god did they get the guns?
But the best and most stupid is the friend that suddenly turns against his so said love and kids, and believe me it isn't a stranger because at the end he explains much more about the kids you can imagine.
Shahid Kapur is Shahid Kapur which is nothing special because the only reason he is allowed to exist in Bollywood is because millions of teenage girls fawn over him.
Deol, Shroff, Puri, Pandy, and Tagore are all wasted in roles that are needed because...well, their roles were in the original and there are character spaces that needed to be filled.
The actors look uninterested and the viewer quickly realizes that the actors are doing this either because their careers have faded away or because they needed a paycheck to sustain their high flying Bollywood lifestyles (which according to interviews consists of sitting at home and listening to their parents).
Ayesha Takia was looking beautiful & her acting was cute but the rest of the cast were not impressive and Viveik Oberoi is better off in negative roles because his acting in Shootout in Lokhandwala was terrific.
Finian has stolen a crock of gold from the leprechauns, and means to bury it in Rainbow Valley because of its proximity to Fort Knox.
He is pursued by Monkees-type pop star (invented by publicists) Tommy Steele (age 32) as a leprechaun who is turning mortal because that's what happens when your 3-wish-granting gold is stolen.
We're supposed sympathize because their minty cancer leaves won't burn and rejoice at the end when they inexplicably burst into smoky flame.
I gave FR 2 points because Astaire was in it and I love him to bits.
Yes, there is a lot of moralizing here, and if you don't know by now that giving your best weapons to your worst enemies because you are afraid of them is not an intelligent thing to do, then this movie will hammer that obvious point home and do it with a psychopathic vengeance that is firmly rooted in the belief that every dead horse requires a really good beating!
Let's just give the enemy what they want and go on our way, because then they'll be satisfied and leave us alone.
I am actually angry because of this movie.
I give 3 points because Kingsley's performance was - as usual - excellent.
)does not become incredibly interesting just because she is going to die soon.
The characters are eggshell thin, and mostly we have to believe what we are told about them by their screen-mates, because their own behavior makes little sense.
Is it because he's cultured?
He never really gets himself into trouble because of his own stupidity like Clouseau always did.
It was fine entertainment but mostly because of the funny leftover scenes with Sellers in 'em.
The last two panther-flicks sucked pretty hard because they had absolutely nothing to got to do with Sellers anymore.
Still, surprisingly "Curse of the Pink Panther" isn't all that bad because I can still watch it without throwing up and I'm sure that's something everyone can't manage to do.
There's couple of good scenes here and there and I can still enjoy it because of the old team: David Niven, Robert Wagner, Herbert Lom, Joanna Lumley, Capucine, Burt Kwoak...they're all here to fill the enormous hole Sellers left behind.
They must have really saved on the computer animations because they look as if they come straight out of a cheap third rate computer game.
And to think that I watched the movie because it was described as a "thriller!"
Some of the fights are pretty entertaining, what with the various characters interesting powers, but I saw it two days ago and I can barely even remember what happened, because the plot was so dull.
This time the fight is not about a pizza, but because Buzz humiliates Kevin in public when it's his solo singing of the song "My Christmas Tree", making many laugh.
Cedric is a likable chap, but the Concierge not so much because he dislikes Kevin from the very first moment, although this guy is hilarious at times.
That sequence with Kevin at the top of the World Trade Center is spectacular and nostalgic, but also painful and depressing to look now because it brings back memories of the tragic date 11th September 2001. Who could possibly imagine back in 1992 that, some years later, such horrible thing would happen?
But then none of this really comes as a surprise because things have been hairy from the beginning, starting with the half dozen members of the team, a bunch of wise guys goofing on their new leader, a stern Lieutenant Commander wearing the wrong cap (he's one grade below the scrambled-egg level).
They go ashore on this deserted island and everything begins to happen, one thing after another, really FAST, as if to prevent the audience from being bored because a scene lasts longer and is more revealing than a Head On commercial ("apply directly to the forehead!").
I will state (and prepare for the negative backlash) that I have not seen, but would very much like to, the accompanying mangas and series, because there is something about X that lurks in the background amidst all the faults that is desperately trying to get out, and desperately trying to impress itself upon you as the viewer, but just doesn't quite make it.
Now during this sequence they have unnecessary banter, I know this can be common place in manga but if you wish to produce a slick opening, trying to set these characters up as long time enemies who we should feel a connection for (because many reviewers have claimed theirs to be an epic rivalry) only to have them killed two seconds later is madness.
Good children's movies form a proper subset of good movies - simply because adults have access to all childhood emotions and desires, but not vice versa.
Children may - I say, MAY - ignore the fact that Jar Jar Binks is a deeply irritating non-character because he is all colour and movement and he speaks funny.
So the defence that `The Phantom Menace' is allowed to be a poor movie because it really wasn't trying to be something great in the first place, just won't wash.
I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.
Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe).
I'm not one for sequels but this was one of the handful that I can enjoy time and again, not only because the original cast is in it, but because of Macaulay Culkin's comedic ability (even as a kid) and Joe Pesci's and Daniel Stern's reactions to getting their butts kicked, booby trap style.
This is because the movie is entirely lacking a dramatic structure.
Who knows why, but Lucas must have decided that people who go to movies only go to movies because they wish to escape a world full of text images, and thus most of the different alien races in Episode 1 speak english, limiting the use of subtitles.
Actors/Casting - I have to give all of the actors credit for this because I know they tried their best, even Jake Lloyd.
In the same way, Liam Neeson is a great actor, but you didn't see that onscreen because he had no direction or screenplay."
In the end, I found myself rooting for Palpatine/Sidious, simply because he was geometrically more intelligent than any of the other characters and would probably do a pretty good job of ruling the universe.
They are not even that impressive, not for a lack of technical wizardry, but because the action they portray is either confusing or non-existent, and there is none of the tension in any of the battle scenes which is even close to that found in its technologically ancient granddaddy, "A New Hope".
Now getting back to the random killings, one of these guys rapes the mother, or was it sister, daughter, I don't think even the director knew, but yeah this girl gets raped and then he gets murdered and the sister who sleeps with the same guy after he raped her mother then gets upset because of his demise.
Hello are you still there, for those who are I hope you're following it because I'm pretty lost.
The cod-Freudian psychology is worthless, and whoever made this film, must have taken substantial amounts of LSD, because it's clearly a film that will be enjoyed more by viewers under-the-influence of alternative substances, than anyone who sits through this stone-cold-sober as I did.
No amount of talent can save this movie, only because the movie has no clue about what it's trying to be, where it's gone or where it's going.
If it had any semblance of success in the US, it was likely because people were still hyped by the previous film, and did not realize that American Adobo was produced by Philippine filmmakers.
However, there are parts that Americans will find funny simply because they are Philippine farce, and as such make absolutely no sense.
Of these characters, the only one even remotely interesting is the womanizer because he at least seems like he has a backbone.
... because all I offer is honesty here, folks.
The HIGHLANDER comparisons come because the bulk of the film is set in New York City and involves large, open-spaced townhouses that are so expensive to rent that the only people who can afford to make use of them are set designers for movies.
However, people seems to like the film because it respects the text of the play almost verbatim.
Oh, yeah, my favorite part is Macaulay (Kevin McAllister) was walking around in New York when he was lost then later, he went to the toy store to buy something then these 2 bad guys found him then Macaulay (Kevin) was screaming same thing then run away from these 2 bad guys in the city of NY but it was so funny because I loved Macaulay's screaming that make me laugh so hard!
Pretension also comes to my mind because we, the viewer, are asked to accept significant illogical plot points presumably because it seems artful to do so.
If the reason she does is because he can provide for her all the designer clothes she could buy, she must surely be a very superficial person.
Many cinema fans do not like watching silent films because of the overacting they are said to feature.
Next thing you know he's being arrested, because it turns out all the murders in the book actually happened, ha ha ha.
I would have to say that I would never watch this movie again, or recommend it to anyone, because that would just be mean.
Watched this movie because it featured Tom Berenger only to find out he only had a supporting role.
But, actually, there's a surprise at the end of this shot -- because there is nobody in the bed!
Perhaps it's just because it was an early work that it falls so far short of his standard.
Not even that, because at least he was so bad that he was good.
Also, Seth McFarlane as mechanical-suit-man was incredibly distracting because his voice, with the German accent, sounded exactly like Klauss... the fish from American Dad.
Not so in this case, because there were just so many problems.
-------------------END SPOILERS--------------------   None of this came off as believable to me; I was constantly pulled out of the movie because it only made sense in the context of del toro trying to move the plot along when the events constituting it just wouldn't fit.
why i have rated it 1/10 , is because it is disappointing to watch a good director like Guillermo del Toro completely miss the target.
For instance Abe falls the princess in .01 seconds and we are expected to just let it slide because the have a psychic connection.
I waited that long in to get to that point, because I just wanted it to be good so much.
I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set.
The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher.
I didn't care much for this movie because the music wasn't that exceptional and I found that odd.
because the perpetrator turns out to be someone we've completely forgotten about.
The script gives too much stage time to these very egregious and tedious characters and seems to feature the Lugosi character only because they *had* to fit him in somewhere.
I really wanted to like this film because the central idea (a woman with a guilty past fears for her life in an institution) and some of the imagery (especially the green mask motif) were intriguing enough.
I actually liked this because so many people in the movie had good motives for killing this harpy and it also felt very satisfying to see her literally scared to death.
I guess it was a learning experience because she put away the drawl and brought it out again for greater effectiveness in Jezebel.
Now, XTRO 3 is slightly better than the second one only because it actually has a bit of a plot.
He explains the inaccuracy of pistols of that time and how Hornblower sets the conditions of the duel because of it.
They make a series of a good book precisely because it's such a good story, and then feel compelled to change the story into a typical formula plot.
I have not seen it since because I hated it then.
If not, why not Â I hate the convention and I hate how it makes people that do it feel clever because it 'breaks the fourth wall' and that's so 'out there' when it comes to mainstream cinema.
Now, the term anti-hero is one that springs to mind here but I'm not going to apply it to Katrina because she (as does the film overall) doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the term.
I only pray this film be seen by as few as these young people as possible because in the end, the film is a glorification of a young girl who has attained celebrity status through things like pregnancy and getting caught up in a murder plot and what-not.
The plots all involved him trying to trick people into giving him money or trying to trick women into sleeping with him or usually both of those things, all he did was con people and it always backfired because he was very bad at it and thought he was a lot smarter than everyone else when he wasn't.
The ideas were only half baked and none of the jokes were funny because the performances were so bad and it was just badly written, you could see exactly where everything was going.
I've watched several episodes of Jeff Ltd., because it can take time for a new series to find its rhythm.
None of the characters are likable and that is okay because you can have a comedy show with unlikeable people but the characters aren't funny either.
I hope it gets taken off the airwaves soon because Jeff Lts is pathetically bad.
I am rating it as 1 just because I couldn't find any negative ratings in the drop down menu.
because they only had eight shows to air from the same season.
because in my eyes it was just another mild hit show that came from the WB.just another story base on movie stars right
When it's all over, Jack gets the promotion but has to turn it down because he feels that the city life is too much for him and his wife.
I say, I think, because I didn't stay until the end.
Colombians must have interests on this movie because you MUST take 5 cups of coffee to avoid sleeping.
The director shows almost a sadistic delight on keeping the camera 6 inches away from the unanimated character, thinking that this is enough to portray a study of human something (sickness, emotions, whatever because we never know at the end) and give a social commentary of something even more groped by intellectualoids: Religion and Sex.
I will always support foreign movies, especially from Latin America, but something I can't support is to perpetuate mediocrity by implying that because the movie was produced in Argentina or that the director is a woman, or that the theme is so controversial, it can get away by overlooking quality, coherence or merit.
I believe this has a lot to do with the direction of photography because the director obviously wants us to concentrate more on the characters and their interactions involving those around them.
I said " true " story because I felt this TVM may take a few liberties as to how true things were .
I thought neo Nazis were anti drink and smoking , but it's never revealed if the racists are neo Nazis or plain ignorant racists   Black people are good singers and dancers because they've got rhythm ?
Ah well that's because in certain American states churches are segregated something the producers only hint at .
I only watched it because I went to High School with Corban Allred.
Indeed, much of the success of the show could be attributed to the fact that the proverbial pair of mismatched cops it featured drove a tricked out Ford Gran Torino -- an otherwise uncool make of car which somehow became cool because it was given a remarkably ugly red-and-white paint job.
Ultimately though, the film does not satisfy because whatever message the film is putting across is too obscure.
Scenes do not flow well and the dialogue sounds as if it was almost entirely post-dubbed (not surprising because the film was shot mainly on location in pouring rain).
Might be inspiring for upcoming make-up effects artists, because it's the one thing this stupid movie manages to get right.
I'm sure the people that made this had a ball filming this, however It's most likely going to be a painful experience for everyone else, and the ending is terrible as well, as it made no sense, plus It was really hard to pay attention because it was so bad, and incredibly dull.
Unfortunately is is often overlooked in the competition because it's not as much fun to watch as MANOS or PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE but honest, believe me, you won't fail to be disappointed if you watch this.
And you can empathize with George and Gwen, because down deep you realize that actually having to live through such an ordeal would be anything BUT funny.
Mainly, it's because the people who made this film have no sense of pacing.
Unfortunately, because of lousy storytelling and incompetent directing the viewer isn't sure either.
I simply wanted it to end, because the film doesn't capitalize on a premise that could work in a more talented director's hands.
Somehow one guy into UFOs lets everyone else know it is UFOs because, well, he is into UFOs and knows aliens from Mars moved into Earth's core 8,000 years ago.
"No problem, I'll just look on the CNN web site..."  I can't give INVASION FROM INNER EARTH a 1 because I actually watched the whole movie.
He gets to his NYC hotel six or seven hours late, and his room is gone, because as his reservation CLEARLY stated, after ten o'clock if they don't hear from you, the room is then open to anyone.
It's an urban action,which is funny, because I could of swore it was a comedy.
Trash like this is worse than "The Apprentice" because it has six year old kids, tuning in and thinking its "cool".
I have seen this show three times, the first time was because I was flicking through channels and I thought it was a really stupid commercial.
The second time I watched the show was again out of disbelief because I still thought it was an animated short whipped up by the network during a commercial break.
The third time was because I knew that it was an actual show by now, and I realized that there must be an audience.
While it was on, I couldn't wait for them to cancel it because I somehow knew that I'd like it more in hindsight.
The basic pattern of each episode involves something terrible happening to Tom, usually the entire town turning on him because he was the only one sane enough to foresee and try to prevent something terrible from happening.
The show gets the viewer to empathize with Tom so strongly, that in the second season, when several stories see Tom accidentally kill and maim much of Jefferton, it became truly cathartic and hilarious, partly because Tom is the last guy on earth who'd hurt a fly, yet he truly deserves to eviscerate every last Jeffertonian.
It's not comedy-drama because it's not funny and it's not a drama because it's laughable.
The film started reaching for emotional moments it hadn't really earned because they'd never been established during the story and then it tried to cover way too much ground following Dorian from High School to college (in Greenwhich Village yet, where he manages to keep away from men for two years!
Apparently, the Twins Effect films are not supposed to have any continuity because it's just a franchise vehicle to market these popular HK twin celebrities.
Which is sad, because the first film was entertaining.
I honestly found myself fast forwarding a lot in this film because I kept getting so disinterested with the plot.
Which upsets me because I love HK films and rarely do that.
And as for that little sister, let me tell you what *she* does: she looks forlorn, cuts herself, starves herself, looks forlorn and hungry, acts like an angel on the altar in the middle of church, passes out during said performance, dot dot dot, and finally jumps out her psych ward window to her death (and if you think I'm being callous then that's because you didn't see the film's eleven second treatment of her death).
Because please, all I'm asking for are two true hours, a darkened interstice of theatrical time when I don't for once have to slap my knee with a rolled up paper, clap my palm to my forehead in an exclamatory wince because I've just been suckered again.
It should also be pointed out that because it's a stage play the dialogue is very important but due to some very poor sound mixing it's almost impossible to hear what the actors are saying .
The latter is especially bothersome because Strindberg himself wrote in his preface (around 6 pages printed before the play text explaining to the women and other invalids the action of the play) that Christine was meant to be a dull character, and empowering her alters the direction of the play.
Julie is physically gorgeous, but, her sexy voice is monotonous and absolutely massacres the character because of this.
Maybe it was because I have never smoked pot and never will that it didn't work for me on any level.
I fast-forwarded it at some points just because I wanted to get to the ending.
The position was not much more than a figurehead because all the bureau was involved in was the amount of morphine etc that were in medicine like cough syrup.
Hearst didn't like this notion because he owned so many timber yards and such, so he and Anslinger agreed to work together to get hemp criminalized.
This marihuana must have been laced with amphetamine, because one thing you never see in stoned people is frenetic behavior unless it's toward food.
It must have worked because the disaster thus far has been averted.
I saw the film as a comedy, because it really is ridiculous.
The solution is simple: force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU!
Many times I have viewed this film over the years mainly because I am a big fan of Sandy Dennis, (Gwen Kelleman) who plays the role of a wife from Ohio and her husband, George Kelleman, (Jack Lemmon) who wants to go to New York City for a job position that George would like to have and they encounter many problems that they never expected.
But she works hard and this is partly because we know her oeuvre.
It's all rather sick, but not because of the incest issue, which isn't really very shocking due to the ineptness of the script, but more so because of the abominable selfishness and stupidity of the characters.
I rented this because I think Stephen Poliakoff is one of Britain's best story tellers.
So here enters Phillips as a quiet dignified Lakota Indian who teams up with the hard boiled Kiefer because the diamond baddies stole his people's sacred lance.
Partnering up because of the sacred lance is without a doubt the absolute worse excuse to have two people join forces in an action movie I've ever seen too.
I told him that he had to watch it because it was the funniest movie that I ever saw.
On the contrary, it is worse, because the dialogues are so ludicrous and so inane that they make Lara Croft seem like a Shakespearian heroine.
I absoluytely hated every scene he was in, which is sad, because most of his scenes were alongside Ewan McGregor, whose brilliant (as always) performance was the only thing that kept me alive during the movie.
I only wish we could have seen him fighting more, because the short duel with the geriatrics poster boy Christopher Lee (who is a fine actor, but was duped into playing a lame character) was just not enough to satisfy my craving for midgit swordplay.
Episode III must be very long or the opening very long because we have only one film left for Anakin to change and become evil, reach high power, and appear as Darth Vader.
I gave this film 1 out of 10 because it is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen.
The original Star Wars Trilogy were not labelled as the greatest films ever made because of Light Sabres, or Storm Troopers, or groundbreaking motion capture special effects, but because of the human side.
...from the train, and almost all the way through the part where Ben (Andrew McCarthy, playing the FBI agent) is telling Billy's (Aaron Lohr, playing the really bad guy) sister (Portia de Rossi, playing the sister) about his mom dying because he was put in a room with an electric doorknob.
Starting with the circling around the airport, I remember once circling an hour and a half at Newark Airport because flights were backed up and that's after an hour delay from Rochester.
It's not a badly done TV movie but it's irritating because the movie seems so determined to whip us into a rage and justify it by such cheap means.
I first saw it when I was a teenager back in the 1980's, but I rented it just last week because I needed to be cheered up.
In the same Year Augustus died she committed suicide, because Tiberius stopped giving her a Pension.
I usually forgive errors in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate.
The only reason I give this boring mess any stars is because I always find Peter O'Toole entertaining.
I have lost it for B-movies because of American Cyborg Steel Whateva!
The only reason I sat through the whole thing is because I was hypnotized by how much it sucked.
Just because it has a better story.
The driver showed it because, I think, he thought we all knew and loved it.
I say this primarily because this is not a movie that tried to do well on a tight budget or to some odd notion of what constituted entertainment.
Unfortunately, the problem is that because of this you can actually hear what's going on!!
That's because the two leads warble operatic style songs that make Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy seem like pop singers!
And because I did, I wasted nearly two hours of my lifetime.
And no, its not just because they paired Chris Rock with Ben Stiller.
Not one joke in the film worked, and even if it was a mediocre one (which is the best they had), it still was terrible because of Matthew Perry's awful timing and the overall bad acting.
Lemmon's shear repetition of wanting to get everyone's phone number and address is hysterical, because through his fatigue in trying to cope with one problem after another in The Big Apple, he still finds the strength to take down everyone's name and number, and promises to retaliate at a later point in time.
Whoever is responsible for the story and screenplay--the producers Anna Maria Davis and Doug Draizin (whose own romance was seminal to this picture) or writers Joan Taylor and Katherine Reback--should have started at that idyll of Salma Hayek's in the Mexican backwater, because they give her character Isabel Fuentes more color and history than anything else in the movie.
They make Alex do it, because he believes it's the right thing, but that leaves very little for him to do but follow Isabel's lead.
I hate it because: -The plot was changed -important characters were cut out -every excitement was banned -they even put a 15th century armour on the one of the villains...
Children (don't think so because of the 9yo age limit).
I bring all of this up, of course, because The Out of Towners is one of the earliest examples, if not the first full fledged "hell handbasket" film.
It may not be one of the best films of the genre any longer, but only because its successors have taken its pioneering lead and upped the ante.
Of course, things start going wrong, beginning with the flight to New York, which is first put into a holding pattern because of excessive traffic, then later sent to Boston because of the weather.
in the book he goes back in time out of scientific curiosity, in the movie it's because he can't handle loosing some stupid socker game.
in the book he gets things done with his intelligence, being a leader because he has earned the respect of his comrades, in the movie: no intelligence, no hard earned respect.
He constantly wakes up in the middle of the night because of the nightmares he has of that fateful night.
for free because of Henriksen and James, and for the one or two decent sequences in it.
Don't ponder for meaning, because if this is an anti-war movie, it fails to prove any point other than mayhem.
Perhaps their plane is powered by wishes and daydreams, because they certainly have no way of getting fuel.
At one point I literally sat staring slack-jawed at the screen for probably ten minutes because I just couldn't deal with it.
Uncharacteristically, Mr. Hopper is called "Fly" because he wouldn't hurt one.
I'm still "rewarding" this film with a generous 3 out of 10 rating, only because the murder sequences are ingenious and remotely gory.
A beautiful, young, American couple goes to England because of a mysterious business proposition and because the movie takes place there 'cause it's always gloomy and foggy and coldish and this is a supernatural thriller in a big house and finally because most couple in these derivative though sometimes enjoyable outings are a bit on the slow side.
The movie never explains because, hey, it's a movie, and it's not supposed to make any sense.
You better get used to this whining, because mostly that is gonna be what you hear during the rest of the movie.
It seemed unnecessary to have compressed 3 books into one film because they were getting each guardian over and done with in about 2 days.
And telling Mr Carrey to get off the screen (even though he can't here me) because his interpretation of Count Olaf was dire.
While her debut embodied verve and a vitality borne of its low-budget, Strange Planet has the opposite effect, mainly because of its bigger budget.
Anna is left for 5 years by the love of her life, Johan, because he has a wanderlust.
I am certainly not averse to watching junk, indeed some films are enjoyable precisely because they are bad.
The TV series on which this movie was based was marginally better; possibly because the censors were on duty.
the iatolla of rockinrolla from 'road warrior' (a movie that i refuse to rewatch because the dog dies) is in it and anthony hall and his buddy must fight them to be popular.
I am just glad a friend of my loaned me his copy of this movie because if I had to pay money to see it, I would be really incensed.
It could be better cast choices because as said, Gere is too... what can I say?
I'm not though, because I have not seen it.
But I will most definitely see it soon, because I was very impressed with "Strange Planet".
It was also hard to believe the relationship with Lancelot because of Gere's performance.
Godard has now to my knowledge brandished immature affronts to two of the most talented filmmakers working today, Steven Spielberg, accusing him of capitalizing on the tragedy of the Holocaust with Schindler's List, and Woody Allen, for an unclear reason, not to mention Jane Fonda because of her political activism, just subsequent to directing her in one of his films, which itself served as political activism.
But because of the rambling nature of his question, the context regarding TV, and the bumblings of the interpreter, Woody misunderstands and takes it as literally referring to cathode tube radiation from the television set.
And also unfortunate, because what would have been an interesting question is then quickly brushed over.
Don't get me wrong, this movie did have some good moments, because why else would a sequel have been made.
That's because there is almost no suspense, no twists, Bey apparently always has ESP (how else can he do what he does in the movie?)
It is a tired plot, mostly because there is little chemistry between Foster and Karloff (although that is not a fatal flaw - he is fixed on her, she need not show any type of fascination towards him).
I will give it a "3" only because it is visually good, but otherwise it was a waste of time and money.
I say "kind of" because this movie manages to veer away from the dumb-but-enjoyable premise of fighting the unkillable for almost two hours and needlessly complicate the matter by involving power-hungry white-collar bad guys.
Presumably, J.J. is his real nickname and he plays himself in the movie because the movie is based on events from his life.
I thought my wife was going to leave me just because I rented this movie, yes it is that bad.
Even the presence of a few "cult film" types, like Tony Todd, George Wendt, Brinke Stevens, and even Lloyd Kaufman, can't save this, because their roles are pretty nondescript and brief.
I would, however, advise people to see HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE because I believe the director did a much better job on this earlier effort.
I rented because I had a credit to get a movie free and because Christian Slater was on the cover, so I thought this could be a nice movie, nothing too good but at least a regular movie.I have to say that I'm thankful that I didn't spent money on this.
This film was average because it resembles True Romance too much.
Christian Slater is the only good part in this film and the only reason he is in it is because he must be a bit hard up for cash.
I don't blame the actors for the cheese in this film because they weren't overly that bad, but the writer, some lines were terrible.
I think there are many fine actresses that could have played Hunter's role and because of her anti-American positions, I think the role should have been given to someone else.
A strange irony that this film, supposedly sympathetic to the plight of families suffering because of corporate greed, was shot in British Columbia during the film crew strike.
All the above said, I did enjoy this film, because it is so easy to laugh about.
So it's a bad movie, but it's also disappointing because the premise of a campy slasher flick seemed to have potential.
Partly because he has good lines and partly because he plays the role well, but only when he is in drag mode.
Android of Notre Dame is one of the worst shock intended movies I've seen and the most trifling part in the series because it offers absolutely nothing significant for the viewer.
I only watched it because Ally Sheedy was in the cast.
I loved it because of its quirky comedy and "clerksy" feel.
He is nothing more than a male gold-digger using Tori for exposure because you can NOT convince me that he finds her the least bit attractive!
I feel pretty bad saying this because I am a fan of Tori and Dean, not so much for their acting, but I do like their reality show.
I kept up with it because I'm a Star Trek fan (features, of course, Bill Shatner and a short appearance by Walter Koenig), and still want to like Columbo, but with this, I'm not sure anymore.
Thinking this was a horror movie (billed as such) and starring guys like Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill, I wound up disappointed.....even more so because this movie started off pretty well and had promise.
So check it out, because I guarantee you, you have not seen THIS before.
In one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like Noah's Ark.
When I first watched series "Miami Vice", with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, I was very happy because that was a hell of a show.The plot was good,actors was fine and of course Miami was here.
Mostly because I have so loved MM in the past that this destruction of a beloved memory by bad acting, bad casting, and non existent direction really hurts.
I honestly believe that it is enjoyed primarily because it is tradition -- it is beloved, so people love it.
There's a reason this has never been a hit in the UK - because most of us have a sense of humour more developed than that of a three year old.
I won't be cynical here because even the harshest critic recognises Geldof is nothing but sincere and he'll always visit Africa to do his best regardless if there's TV cameras filming him or not , but Live 8 must be the most cynical concert event in history  First of the artist line up .
Oh and seeing as there's all these kids dying in Africa because of lack of medical facilities or clean drinking water I wonder how much money the performers spent on drink and drugs that day ?
I won't condemn them all of course because as I said Geldof is a genuine living saint while other artists appearing are genuinely caring about the suffering in Africa especially Bono whose set with U2 was far superior to the performance seen at Wembly 1985 .
both of us own the movie on DVD because we enjoyed it so much, and have in turn showed the movie to others who have also enjoyed why we had to kill bitch.
Let's not even get started on the music, because I wouldn't know how to characterize the noise I heard.
Railsback looks stiff and old, and his fight scenes are over within seconds because he obviously can't fight.
This is partly because Railsback doesn't give her any response at all.
As a vehicle for Railsback Termination Man fails, because he's by far the worst actor in the movie.
I give it 3/10 simply because it was amusing to see how far this thing could get out of hand from the start on.
Especially dark because of the lighting and colors used during daylight.
I read the reviews before buying it and decided to get it anyway because it's Jim Carrey.
'Introducing... Janet' makes more sense because of what the story is about and the ending.
she's a talented writer, so she helps him beef up his stand-up because he's just awful.
Thank goodness for that, because this finally beat Godzilla 1985 as my pick for the worst movie of ALL TIME !
In 1995, I rented "Introducing...Janet" (aka "Rubberface") because it showed Jim Carrey on the cover.
It's too bad the creators of "Rubberface" didn't have the same sense of pacing, because this movie runs about 43 minutes too long.
(I make a special exception for Alien3 [WARNING: SPOILERS of series-spoiling elements in Alien3 & 4 FOLLOW], which, though not bad overall, will forever be my choice for worst movie because of the GLARING PLOT HOLE and contrived, character-killing plot devices at the start of the movie that COMPLETELY DISREGARD the plot, characters, and story lines that Cameron et al.
But where other bad sci fi movies fail, ROTOR succeeds... because IT GETS WORSE.
I can't disagree either because I think that this craptastic thriller is so ineptly made that you can't help but laugh.
This movie gets a 5 out of 10 not because it deserves five points, in fact, I don't think the quality is such that it deserves one point.
If you can find something worse, please bring it to me, because I need it.
You can't get angry at these movies, because it's obvious they were made by people who simply didn't have the talent or the budget to make something even halfway decent.
A friend of mine sent this to me for evaluation because I watch a lot of cheap horror films like he does.
I hope THEY enjoy their OWN films, because no one else does.
for a white man to sing mammy in black face go down to a black neighborhood and tell the people that.As a non-black that lived in black districts I can tell you it upsets them.When this movie came out on TV in the 1960's it made me cringe because I knew a lot of people around me were going to be upset.Yes,the good old 1960's when the riots started,showing a movie like this didn't help prevent them.The people that support and broadcast-ed this movie go around oblivious to realty.While their safe in a sheltered world during the riots I'm on the funky streets trying to be on time for the graveyard shift.Some persons now believe Leif Erickson discovered America instead Of Columbus.A change is needed in movie history too.In the best interest of a happier society I'd like for this movie not to be given any claim to fame,sweep it under the rug.May a technicality give the fame to a more decent film.
A real bad film but I give it a 2 because it is historically important.
These scenes in itself were monumental to film and the movie has a part in the world of cinema because of this.
These scenes in itself were monumental to film and the movie has a part in the world of cinema because of this.
And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has talked himself out with his respect for the films of the silent era
I downloaded this movie because I had nothing better to do.
The story revolves on two macho buddy cops (luckily they wear their badges around the neck, because they looked more like dock workers to me) who put a lot of time and effort in unraveling a network of human smuggling.
And then still this movie fails to impress because of its many boring sequences and the completely illogical structure featuring at times.
When exposed Hunter doesn't care because he's in a rather loveless marriage to the rather frigid Katharine Alexander.
Some tastelessness is highly enjoyable (most of Tarrantino's work is) because of style, panache & great dialogue.
Wasn't it funny when that actress nearly drowned, just because some schmuck of a director couldn't get the shot that he wanted?
How about when Henry Silva, an actor petrified of heights, almost p*ssed himself with fear because a camera crew took him 70ft off the ground without warning him?
Which is a shame, because such analysis may have justified the film's existence.
I swear the actors must've been reading off of cue cards because they put absolutely no emotion into it whatsoever, it was like they were all monotones.
And whatever vague connection these two movies share, really makes no difference to me, because big-budget cinema ain't my cup of tea, and Beware: Children At Play ain't worth a damn.
John Dewolfe, along with his irritating little family is driving out to rural New Jersey to help out his old army buddy (sherriff of Rural New Jersey) and his irritating little family, who are all stressed because his daughter was kidnapped.
Is it foul play, or did they simply take off because they were sick of this lifeless town?
For those that walked out the theater, I'm sure it was because of boredom and a general disgust at the subject matter over feeling truly disturbed at any of the hokey stuff that goes on in this garbage movie.
I guess we built it up to be more exciting than it really was, because by the packaging, we were practically led to believe that this was going to be an absurd, shocking, and possibly humorous.
Personally, I was sadly disappointed, because the movie was more serious than anything, and frankly it really didn't have much that appealed to me.
It also had the unfortunate effect of ruining any of the impact of the movie, because it was extinguished by the horrible use of music.
I gave it a 4, because the plot seemed to be decently thought out and executed.
I kept watching because it said on the box "rated R for sex and a shocking scene."
That being said, i know many will feel entitled to tell me that a lesson learned from anyone is still a lessoned learned, which is true, i suppose, but it is still keanu reeves, and he plays a chain smoking dentist The argument is further broken down into pathos and logos The pathos of this movie is most likely the strongest element, not because it is in anyway strong, but because the logos is poorly executed, there is no logic to this movie.
The story was so dull that I actually envied the main character in the scenes where he is in the dentist's chair because root canal surgery is preferable than viewing this film.
so racoon city is now over run and milla jovovich and jill valentine team up with various other survivors to escape from the zombie infested city, whilst being pursued by the umbrella corporations new toy, project Nemesis, an uber hard as nails villain, there s a less than engaging sub plot involving a doctor guiding jovovich and her lot to saving his daughter in return for there escape, and thats about it, there's no gravitas to any of the proceedings its just shoot explode zombies run and repeat, you wont care about the characters because there's nothing to make you care about them they act as eye candy and Little else.
Where on earth to start...oh my, I'm trying to sit here with my friend and figure out how to best describe the utter stupidity presented in this movie...truly a waste of the breath in my lungs...  OK, lets start with one of the main characters, Alice whom my friend and I repeatedly referred to as "Boomer" because of her ability to constantly amaze us.
2:Thier's no character development at all you don't care if any one in this movie dies because you don't know what makes them important.
Anyone else watch something else because anything beats watching this crap for the next 90 minutes.
I had a small pinch of hope for the sequel, namely because the hack known as Paul W.S.
How is it that you cant shoot one of those licker things in the church with bullets because they dodge them, but the hero of the story can jump off of her motorcycle and crash it into the monster sending both the motorcycle and the monster 100 feet into the air... Then blowing the motorcycle up, a perfectly good vehicle to use during this chaos.
What a waste of money (I actually bought the DVD, shame, shame, because I liked the first RE).
As the sixth victim falls, in the court room seconds after being acquitted Church finds himself pressed by the police to aide them as well as the defense attorney responsible for most of the acquittals (he fears the end to his career because who would hire him if you win only to die?).
The reason I don't give character names is because there are none.
This is only really worth mentioning because the Whitehouse features at no point in the film.
I elected to devote three hours to watching this remake because I am a big fan of the original movie.
So I'll vote awful simply because I'm afraid they've messed up a great book!
They couldn't make it just like the original novel/movie, because the original is not that obscure, and there isn't any good way to change the story and still make a reasonable production.
He's dying because it's a radioactive pool, geddit?
In the end: (1) scientists figure out how to use the vent-bacteria to kill the virus, thus saving the world for the moment; (2) the military conspirators kill each other because some of them have a change of heart; (3) the President decides to go ahead with the vent-mining anyway (4) a cigarette-smoking man saves a sample of the virus in the International Space Station so it will be available for the future.
But the real Future doesn't care, because they created an alternative Future (not theirs) that took the fall.
You've heard of Michael Crichton because he has written lots of exciting and interesting science fiction, much of which has been turned into movies (of varying quality.)
You likely haven't heard of him, because he's been asked to write almost nothing else for the screen.
That's because the Phoenix team was chosen on the basis of knowledge, expertise, and ability, just like the the original Andromeda Strain scientific team.
It actually seemed to me like because they had a few ex-24 stars, they felt like the thing needed to happen in real time.
The story develops too slowly and, because of that, the "climax" is such a let down that you can't even believe that anyone working on the movie could make a decision about where to end it.
Instead, I will let anyone who reads this, read the other comments because they are all basically the same.
they claimed it was because of wax on their shoes?
The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child.
Too bad, because some of it is pretty cool.
Reeves lets him surf off into oblivion because the movie is really about the love/hate relationship between these two space cases.
Rose McGowan had an even more restricted character, probably because the awful scripts gave her nothing to work with.
Watching it, made me remember Power Rangers episodes because like the Power Rangers series, Charmed became increasingly formulaic over the years.
The Zankou character like Barbas made the show worth watching, because there was a demon that stand out from the rest and was hard to kill.
No one does things because they're evil.
I'm a HUGE HUGE HUGE Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, but not because of the plethora of attractive women that appear on that show.
No, because of the writing, depth, and emotional resonance.
let me sum up the first 7 years, since i haven't seen the 8th one yet (but ill watch it just so i know how the story finished)  I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch "maybe this is an innocent we just cant save" i love you *insert overly attractive male stars name here*, but i cant be with you because I'm a witch.
I'm honest to myself, i watch it because Alyssa Milano is simply a goddess to be worshiped.
I wouldn't suggest ANYONE to watch this show, because it makes ME seem like a bumbling moron for even suggesting it.
Only reason I sat though it was because my sister and brother-in-law chose to watch it.
This show was so sad, however it really upset me because it was "ripped from the headlines" and at the time, the headline it was ripped from was my school.
I found the film cheap and mainly bought it because of Kinski I must admit.
Art-house cinema is full of traps, because amongst the many amazing films within this genre there are some truly inept flops that are so unambitious and mind-numbingly awful that one simply cannot avoid an occasional pitfall here or there.
Now to the two largest gaffs This creature is strong enough to rip out an engine and overturn a jeep as well as capable of pushing over the Ranger's tower but it cannot move the rocks in front of it's cave, and during one pivotal scene an expert on the monster gives the heroine a book of legends concerning our beast (which incidentally is never referenced again) saying it took shaman 500 years to bury the evil in his cave, must just be because they couldn't catch him home because all that was needed was a baby gate in front of the entrance and he was screwed.
Yes this movie is bad...the only good part is that Cerina Vincent is hot...other than that....I cried when I watched this movie because it makes Jeepers Creepers look good...I watched it all the way...twice...only twice because I wanted to show my friend how bad it was.
I don't know what the monster looked like or what he was up to because I couldn't take this unbelievably boring and poorly acted film.
3/10, because 1 and 2 star are reserved for real low-rated gems.
The only (and I do mean _only_) reason I didn't give this film a 1/10 is because "666: The Demon Child" is worse.
But you don't really care because the movie is so boring and so drawn out, it feels like it takes a hundred years to watch it.
She spends the whole first half of the movie wallowing in a pool of alcohol and self pity because she caused the death of her best friend in a drunk driving accident.
Oh wait, that's because, as is explained by the requisite secondary character who conveniently appears just to tell her "the secret", she's "at the center" of this thing.
It's unfortunate, because there's some really beautiful scenery in this thing, and the setting, up high in the air in a ranger tower, could have been very effective - if it weren't housing someone who spent the whole movie whining and crying and having flashbacks to something utterly unrelated to the story at hand.
I started to get aggravated with this movie because of the constant reminders of how difficult Peter's life is, especially the scenes with Aunt May.
I was expecting the best comic book movie of all time because of the hype, but it turned out to be worse than the first one, which I didn't think was that great either.
It's too bad because I usually enjoy comic book movies.
Phantasm is one of the most creative horror films from the late 70's/80's.From the imagination of Don Coscarelli,it doesn't play like a slasher film,it's a lot more clever.The setting of the horror is a Funeral home/Cemetery.A smart move,people fear funeral homes/graveyards because they associate them with death.I'd say it a cemetery is a smart place to set a horror film,because we fear it to begin with.The plot is about a boy named Mike,who lives with his brother Jody,they have a friend named Reggie who is an ice cream driver.Mike/Jody/Reggie are the main characters of the film.Their friend is killed in the cemetery.They bury him in the cemetery.Mike hides in the bushes,and sees the funeral home director known as The Tall Man,take the casket.He suspects something is wrong.Mike doesn't hesitate to investigate the cemetery.He sneaks into the mausoleum,where a flying sphere nearly kills him.The Tall Man attacks him,and he cuts off The Tall Man's fingers.Yet the finger still moves,he locks it in a box,and shows it to Jody.Jody decides that they have to investigate.They encounter dwarf slaves,they look like Jawas on film,but I'll forgive Don,because of the low budget.These Dwarf slaves are actually the corpses of the dead of the town.They bring Reggie in on it,and decide they have to find and kill The Tall Man.
Phantasm is a great horror movie.It is fun,and a lot more clever than others.Don Coscarelli is a gifted film maker,he makes great horror films on low budgets.I checked Phantasm out because of his recent Bubba Ho-Tep which was great,and because a teacher at school who I talk to about horror films loved it.I'm glad I did see Phantasm,it was a great horror movie.
At the expense of his victims and their families the film wallows in filth and was offensive in the extreme because of it.
It's a perverted reporting of a perverted person and because of this they have more in common with this man than they may want to realize.
Recently got one of those Mill Creek 50 pack of horror and mystery PD movies (Tales Of Terror) because there were about 25 of these programmers I had not yet seen.I was already aware from experience that the quality on most of these is less than desirable but some can't be had anywhere else or were not worth paying ten bucks for alone.In this case I was taken royally as this print is missing the first 8 minutes or so leaving one to guess the rest.
I do think this movie matches up to Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm st. because its different.
I like Lou Gossett Jr., but he must willingly continue to appear in these Iron Eagle films for a paycheck because god knows they certainly aren't good movies.
Anyhow this Iron Eagle sequel finds Gossett putting together a bunch of no-name Canadian actors, some who play Americans and some who play Russians who when they splice in the 'we can't get along together because of nationality' clichÃ© story element, you have this movie in a nutshell.
Chappy received this high rank because he was drawn out of the National Guard to complete a mission with Russian forces and a crew of so called Misfits.
The reason Gedrick didn't make this movie is because he was busy making the Oscar-winning movie "Rooftops" (note HUGE amount of sarcasm here)at the time it was made.
The first film was more of a Teen movie, it stood out because of that fact.
(I know this because I used to study and teach Soviet combat tactics.)
People just love this anime because they are so blind to this fact.
I can't say too much else because I don't want to bore you with complaints, but that's all I can really say about this atrocity of a film.
Only because they've been made to enjoy it by drivel like this.
So don't come and complain that we're rating this as an adult's film when it isn't, because you rate films on what they're meant to be.
The only reason I did not give this a 1 is because I'm sure the bottom end of the target audience, kids up to maybe 5 years old, will like it.
The opening of the movie, with two white kids in a foster home ripping off a store owner with a box containing a rock instead of a cell phone because they want to buy some burgers for their dog, is the first blow to the movie's credibility.
So they don't like the dinner their foster mom makes them, so their dog is a stray after 3 years because these kids are irresponsible, so what?
If it was trying to be like the later hit "Lost Skeleton of Cadavra", I'd just have to say it failed mostly because it was too modern in some parts.
I'll give it 2/10 just because some of the fight scenes were mediocre, not terrible.
In many interviews director Mitja Okorn tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didn't cost a lot of money.
It's completely annoying and is one of those films that the best part is the credits because the viewer can now breathe a sigh of relief that they made it through the film.
I would endeavor to guess that the main actors in this movie donated their time and talents gratis, because I cannot imagine anyone paying for the services of professional actors just to let their talents languish in the doldrums of obscurity, drivel and overall bad acting.
The Specialist is one of the worst movies of the 90's and even Sharon Stone's sex scene isn't that erotic, mainly because she is sharing it with Stallone.
I'm not gonna rip on stuff like how completely unlikely it is that someone (especially in 1994) would have as complex of devices as they had in this movie because lets face it, this isn't Stallone's first unrealistic movie nor is it probably his MOST unrealistic movie.
And that's a good thing because you can't really compare this ingenious muddle with mainstream slashers.
Things become complicated when Ray's old CIA buddy turned baddie Ned Trent (James Woods) show's up wanting to kill Ray because he hurt Ned's feelings back in 1984 & that's it basically.
I really, really dislike The Specialist & would call it more of a thriller than an action flick although I'm betting the trailer makes it look like it's full of explosions & action scenes but just don't be fooled because it isn't.
Rod Steiger's accent, which I believe is supposed to be Cuban because he pronounces "you" as "chew" a la Scarface, comes and goes.
I give a grudging point towards the kitty not being killed by the Columbians or Woods--the one thing that I didn't see coming, because every time Sly came home looking for his cat I expected him to find it nailed to the wall or something equally hideous.
I never had an interest to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, because it looked so horrible, but my friend said it was pretty cute and to give it a shot, so I did since it was a free rental and at least I finished the sequels.
But it did waste my time because it was so sad hearing really lame voices and the costumes seemed to be different.
This was such a bad change, to be honest, if the directors couldn't get the original cast, not including Casey Jones, he shouldn't have bothered, because it was so disturbing hearing Splinter in a scary high pitched evil Japanese voice, you have to admit, it was scary.
He couldn't make Part II because he was in rehab, getting off his heroine addiction.
because we didn't know these characters from the cartoon show and they don't look cool there just siting on a horse shooting guns and ones the gos guy and other is the bad guy and the Michaelangelo gets kidnapped witch keep the turtles back April as well gets set back in time where her and mike and prisoners and the turtles costumes just look so awful it isn't funny and there is only a couple fight scenes not involving all the turtles until the end at least the previous films had more then one for scene with all the turtles more then once so as you can see they pretty much went wrong where ever this is buy far the worst tmnt film as well as it being one of the worst films and let downs ever and goes to show that most three's in a sequel flop the first,second and fourth tmnt films are all great so lets just pretend the fourth is the third and leave this horrible film as a past and killed off memory.
Honestly, I was a fan, but then I started to hate the turtles, only because of THIS MOVIE!
Given that the first film was dedicated to Jim because it was one of the last things he worked on before he died, this is quite the sad come-down.
The turtles, in their usual confused weird-species adolescent fervour, take it upon themselves to go back and rescue her, because we all know how an adolescent turtle would go all bug-eyed at the thought of rescuing a woman who looks anything like Paige Turco.
It shouldn't really because Phantasm is just as good as the classics.
It seems all the love goes to over rated films only because they're so talked about and not actually analysed.
The actors who play Reggie, Jody, and Mike appear in all of the sequels (with a minor switch in two), an important continuity because it gives the "Phantasm" franchise a real "contained universe" feel lacking in most horror series.
It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here.
If you want to buy just one DVD because of the extras, you should get Phantasm if you can track down a copy(it's gone OOP now).
That's strange, because not only is "Africa Screams" easily worse than "Go to Mars", it's probably one of the worst films that Abbott and Costello ever made.
The scene where he mugs to the camera for about 3 minutes straight because he is scared of a gorilla is more excruciating than funny.
Examples: Barrett is a brash and aggressive black guy from the ghetto, Cid is an older guy who smokes and swears a lot because he's bitter, Tifa merely fawns over Cloud the entire game, Yuffie is hyper and steals stuff, and Vincent is a gloomy and depressed guy who doesn't talk about his past.
Those newcomers played the game, liked it because of the aforementioned reasons, as well the flashy graphics and high-quality music, and further drove the hype machine.
Perhaps the director feels the world may have something against him because he once directed the long forgotten Madonna star vehicle WHO'S THAT GIRL ?
They are rich because they know how to get money and then how to hold on to it.
Just because they found Indian people in England and put them on screen doesn't make it Bollywood.
That's a shame, because I'm a huge fan of Bogart and Bacall.
Edge in a Triple Theat Matchin a good match, then again it might have only looked good because of the lameness that came bore.
It's like watching someone else's fever dream...and that's exactly what it's supposed to be like, because it IS someone else's fever dream.
I was glad I stayed to watch because it's so very unusual.
Have they gone mad because of the virus?
This is quite disappointing because the idea of the film has so much more potential, although it is an idea that has remarkable similarities to about 20 other zombie type flicks.
-If the infected kill because they have "rage" and not for eating the people, then what do they eat to survive.
I think it's good that this film does leave some loose ends, because it goes along with the movie's overall feel.
For me, this film remains a nice little piece of spooky and original nostalgia, and I'm glad my mom decided to scare the daylights out of me with it at such a young age, because I grew to love this movie later on.
I don't want to give any false notions by assigning a higher rating because this movie is truly bad.
The most innuendos, and not all funny ones it should be said, come from Sommer and Williams, mainly because of Sommer's weird Russian accent, it's just not as funny as it tries to be, and there's worse to come, trust me.
Actually, Tom Everett Scott's role should have been casted to someone else because he stunk up the whole movie.
However, because of bad casting, the movie was nothing like There's Something About Mary.
Its futile attempt at comedy leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth, simply because the jokes are all old and recycled.
Trivia: This was awarded an X rating FOUR TIMES because of the sphere killing...Coscarelli went all the way to the head of the ratings board who overturned it and gave it an R--a rare occurrence that the ratings board kept in a gore scene!
Two roomies who hope that their third roomate dies so they can get A's because of the 'dead roomate' policy.
I won't say it's overrated like many other people, because it's just my point of view, someone else might think this is the best movie ever.
"Loser" woman assumes role of attractive professional to get the guy who's "unavailable" either through another relationship or because he would normally be out of the woman's league, all the while ignoring the supposed "loser" who is in love with her.
It has to hit on all fronts to be considered and this one only hit because the three stars were passable against almost insurmountable odds.
In my opinion don't watch this series because it can put ideas into peoples heads about how to physically abuse women in one episode, but then confuse you by saying it's wrong in another episode.
My score is raised a little more than the above description might lead you to think because the mountain scenes with the actors are filmed really well.
because evil dead is merely a five year old's rendition of army of darkness.
I remember this show because it was rural and set in the Heartland of Nebraska.
This is because the idea of people breaking into lip-sync songs is pretty peculiar and may not be for everyone!
It's a real shame because the special effects were great, with the exception of the shots of the microscopic robots traveling through the bloodstream.
This movie is very strange though, because this would never happen.
I did always like the movie box when i was a child though, because you could switch it from the picture of the little boy to the fake cupboard door, and i got a key with it.
All in all, I would not recommend this movie for you to watch, because there are many better movies available for your viewing pleasure.
But then we decided to watch this movie, I really became excited because I thought that the movie was really going to be like the book.
The movie was updated, instead of taking place in England, like it does in the book, it takes place in the United States, you can tell that it is New York because you can see the World Trade Center towers in one scene!
You can go ahead and watch it if you please, but I sort of would not highly recommend it to you, because of the tedious arrangements they made with the plot.
The same was true with Klaus Kinski because his performance was too remote and did not narrate the story all the way through.
The story was so confused that it failed to make real sense because it deviated from the original novel so much.
They act that way because there's a camera in their faces.
But that's OK because only a few of them are.
Again, that's OK because even fewer do.
Yes, once more that's OK because none of us watches these movies for their Oscar-deserving performances.
I'm generously giving this movie a 2 rating only because we laughed so hard we cried at several points during it.
I mean "don't" as in, "Don't do this, because it looks like you can't tell your ass from your elbow, anyway you slice it".
I rented this because of Jake Gyllenhall, a fine actor (go see Brokeback Mountain and Donnie Darko if you don't believe me), but his character exists in a drug-addled haze to Leto's brain-dead pool boy, who isn't high and has no excuse for his imbecility.
Yes, you read it right, this defines insane action movies, not because of the huge amount of action, but because it's completely insane.
Thats not because of me, it's because it has the most glaringly obvious plot holes EVER.
It seems that the script was improvised as they went along, because anybody could come up with a reason for looking at the old fort, but they DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT EXISTED!!!
I upgraded my PC to Vista because Halo 2 would not run on XP and to become up to date.
Still, there's fear in the air because the man who already destroyed the town once is most likely to come back...
It adds very few to the genre of western-drama's and it's only worth a look because of the terrific acting performances.
As another reviewer said, in the old West, any idiot who tried to do what 'the bad man' did in this movie would find himself dead in side of five minutes, because back then, people stood up for and defended their family and property and town.
I can almost forgive Henry Fonda for appearing in this cow plop of a movie because his role in 'Once Upon A Time In The West' was so powerful.
History did not note them, because they were nothing that anyone would want to remember.
this is one of the lousiest movies i've ever seen.The only reason i kept watching this is because i was trying to understand why H.Fonda was in this movie.It seems to be trying to promote pacifism but its so stupidly done that it actually manages the complete opposite,the viewer is convinced by the end of this movie that guns and violence are absolutely necessary.Fonda's character doesn't make any sense other than he is a total spineless coward.There is absolutely no rational excuse for his actions.The whole story is supposed to convince the viewer that Fonda's character is right,but there is very little argument in favor of a man who just sits around doing nothing to stop evil because he is afraid.
By turns jaunty, tedious, unfathomable and unwatchable, it actually suffers from a greater absence of structure than the town it purports to chronicle, a place which keeps being, er, burned down by a laughing madman who no-one can stop because he's A Symbol.
Most of the time, of course, this doesn't matter, because Kennedy thinks he's directing a musical, a sort of Seven Whores for Seven Miners, as a result of which one scene after another has dancing girls a-dancing and drinking men a-drinking, all of this to the accompaniment of a music score that if not played by someone tone-deaf was certainly written by one.
Until he shows up again... And when he shows up again don't get mad and - for chrissakes - DON'T go for the gun because, honestly, it won't solve anything, it won't bring back the dead, and it won't eradicate all the other "bad men" roaming around in this tough world.
The point, because many seemed to have missed it, is that in order for the railroad to work, EVERYONE MUST GET INVOLVED.
If you watch this film, it's hard to understand why, because his routine was just not funny.
I gave this movie a poor rating because of the stereotypes, and the ending is Hollywood's "everything will be alright" cliche that makes you mad for watching the whole thing.
This is the story: Two babies are switched at birth, one from an upper middleclass family and one from a lower class family, because of a jealous nurse.
Micheal Moore did a 2 hour documentary on the tragedy and didn't mention it once, maybe he is in on this whole tyranny thing to right... or maybe its because your a liar.
I say fanatic because he believes so certainly in what he wants to say, that he can't afford to be put in doubt by being neutral and actually showing the whole pictures of his alleged evidences.
Sometimes they are shocking because they are made *means for an end*, just the thing that they claim is done by your government... And this one falls to the latter category.
It is true because I said so.
OK now look for my documentary on the subject...Its all fact because I said so.
Don't look at the mainstream media because they are part of the conspiracy.
Further more: all the so called "evidence" can easily be read in another fashion Â that is: his entire conclusion can very easily have been misread, because it is based on very few and very easily disputed evidence.
As a documentary it is untrustworthy: because Alex Jones doesn't really have any sources for his wild claims.
Just like now, with Iraq and Katrina - there have been so many leaks, just because of a hurricane and a war.
If there are hundreds of leaks because of a hurricane Katrina and a war against a foreign and aggressive country like Iraq, why weren't there leaks about the biggest genocide in American History???????
No one wants to have any thing to do with it, because it is full of Â¤Â¤Â¤Â¤.
and secondly: if Bush and the shadow-government where willing to kill 2000 - 3000 people 9/11 because of power, why do they hesitate to kill Alex Jones all of us that know of the documentary, if the documentary is the truth?????????????
Bush did not plan 9/11 - 9/11 happened because of incompetence, and that Al-quada simply outsmarted the US, the were totally unprepared.
Don't bother seeking this out, but if you find an old VHS really cheap, it will look good in your collection because the artwork on the Medusa label is quite cool.
This movie gets two stars only because of Gene Kelly and ONJ.
I shouldn't even be calling it a film because there's not much of anything resembling a story, acting, quality, whatever, to be seen in a single frame of this embarrassing disaster.
It's sorta "so good because it's so bad" because of its bad fashion sense and the overall look of it but the actors are so boring and lifeless that XANADU doesn't fall into the quotable campy "bad" films.
The lousyness of this film has only been surpassed in my mind by Saturn 3 (another film with great stars, Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel, but horrible story; perhaps Kirk did it because he could be cuddly with Farrah).
They said that it didn't do well because they edited too much with out going back and adding more scenes to replace the ones that they edited.
They said that because of this it made the movie confusing.
I am now happy that I was too young to see it because I finally saw this film on television and there are a bunch of birds flying around and some down and out actors looking embarrassed to be there but nothing resembling the claws and eyeball on the poster art.
This movie is a rip-off even if you don't pay to see it because it steals your time if not your money.
Just because allegory is used does not make this profound or deep.
The plot is impossible to summarize, mainly because there are too many story lines and it really doesn't make the slightest bit of sense as a wholesome.
No less than Jesus Christ is giving us insight (if you can call it that) in the situation, and then he sends out an elderly angel to Atlanta, because that's where the final earthly descendant of the evil sorcerer Zathaar lives.
We went to see because it had such a good cast.
The improvement must be done in women casting, because men were real!
honestly, the first several times i watched this movie, i turned it off an hour into it because it was so boring.
the only reason i actually watched it the whole way through is because i wanted to make an educated comment here.
I gave it a 2 because I've seen a lot worse movies.
The script and filming must have been put together really quickly because it seemed like there wasn't much imagination behind it.
Possibly because it means that for the first time (in his life, quite possibly) he can tell himself, 'I'm not a buffoon!
An atrocious mess of a production, with even worse direction, it's a real pity because its story could have been something quite interesting, but this is a clear example of some idiotic filmmakers trying to maximise sales by casting B list American actors.
With an added excuse to bring in another American name, Marty Kove of Karate Kid fame, a wannabe tough talking American cop to investigate these murders because obviously the English don't have the correct qualifications for investigating murders, the film becomes a comical example of a bunch of filmmakers who don't know how to tell a story.
It's a shame, really, that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at (mixed metaphor intentional), because Kinski and Coyote - both supremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - have wonderful chemistry together, and the always-provocative Fairuza Balk didn't hurt the mix either.
It was not because of the movie itself, but because I walked into that theater willingly, and almost immediately I was trapped, and all I could see was rotten garbage.
I am not talking about just story here, because you can have a bad story but still keep people guessing for more.
if someday the devil will make you choose between damnation or watching Waynes World II (because there really is a sequel on this), what will you choose?
because they all sucked for myriad reasons.
Don't even get me started on the plot because quite frankly, Superman fans and true believers, THERE IS NONE!!!
Trust me because after seeing this "film" you may want to seek remedial attention.
Even when Superman ISN'T evil (and the "Superman goes evil and fights himself" scene is the lowest point in the film), Christopher Reeve comes off as smarmy and insincere (probably because he realizes the film sucks).
Adults can't make accurate comments on this, because we KNOW engines don't talk and shiny time isn't real.
But I was thinking maybe it's just because I was just more used to being excited about some kind of comedy, but the problem was that it seemed like the comedy took over what could've been a great super hero story.
when i saw this for the first time i was more of a kid than now......a little kid and i was a big superman movies fan.....i even liked this one a bit....and when i see it right now i still enjoy some of it....it is enjoyable to see superman turn evil....it is the best part of the movie....or maybe the only good part of it......richard pryor is too dumb at some parts of the movie and the opening credits belong to a Charles Chaplin movie.....a bad Charles Chaplin movie........the musical score is not bad.....mostly because it is filled mainly with John Williams' music but still it could've been much better........the only excellent thing in this film is Christopher Reeve's performance......but the rest is disappointing....specially when the big computer battles superman....disappointing but certainly better than the fourth superman movie........** out of 5
I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.
I start with this anecdote because Angel Cop is so bad, the cheesy and unnecessarily vulgar 80s dubbing is the least of its problems.
If there's anything I have to say, you can't fall asleep through a movie like this, because you can't wait to see what ridiculous thing will happen next!
It's hard to describe my feelings about the movie, because I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen, yet at the same time I suggest people check it out (if you get the chance; don't spend a hell of a lot of money to purchase a copy of it!).
You can't play elevator music during a horror film, because it brings it to a complete halt--or any film for that matter, but especially in horror.
I felt like reading that screenplay after watching this, because as horrible as I think it is, it can't be as horrible as this movie.
The twists in this movie aren't surprising to the viewer, but I wouldn't expect the characters to figure out what was happening too quickly because it is so ludicrous.
That is why I give this movie a 10, because it was made exactly how it was intended to be made.
That's because the acting is abysmal, the editing was done by a chimp, many scenes featuring screaming Korean peasants went on too long, the music highly inappropriate as well as annoying and the dialog is among the worst I've ever heard.
I gave this movie a rating of 1 only because zero wasn't an option.
In the 1950s, most people were disgusted with Gay people outright- as shown and maybe in part because of this film.
I had high hopes for it when I heard that it was being made back in 2001 because I read "The Devil and Daniel Webster" when I was a kid and I found it very interesting.
I finally found out who it was and thank god i did because if i had to look at another terrible movie starring Julia Roberts brother, i was gonna pass out.
Well, its because Eric Roberts is made out of garbage.
No, seriously, he drips empty soda cans and banana peels from his pockets because he literally is garbage.
First of all i would like to say that the producer of this is now labeled a moron because who would make a sequel with NONE OF THE SAME CHARACTERS okay?
I borrowed the movie from a friend because I liked the first one.
Several points:  1) ACTING: None  2) PLOT: Must've have missed it, because I was probably protecting my eyes, from this tragedy  3) CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Does the main actress going from shy and idiotic to ghetto and idiotic, considered as "character development"?
They didn't make a sequel, which is good because the story just sort of wraps up at the end.
In fact I'll stop typing this right now, because that movie is still occupying my time, and not another second...
Maybe I'm biased because I'm from New Jersey, but I've never heard any of my peers use the phrase "Shut up!"
have you ever been embarrassed for the actors while watching a movie because the movie was SO BAD?
and it all makes sense because the same person wrote and directed it.
i really wanted to like this movie because freddie and julia are cute people but my god... no way in hell.
I almost cried because I had to sit through it in the theaters.
Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple.
This is the closest thing to genuine comedy that Iascsson comes up with here, especially when one of the guys warns Al "to cross your legs because your panties are showing."
First of all, let me just say that after viewing this film, I seriously thought about writing my own screenplay, because I know I could write something ten times better.
Funny because for a movie that didn't get a theatrical release in Indonesia (that's saying something because they put anything on theaters here as long as it has picture and sound), some people who admitted to be scholars even had time to write long comments on it.
Clearly written by someone who doesn't speak Indonesian because the dialogues do not make much sense.
Focusing on the toys more may not be a wise idea, though, because with one or two exceptions, John Buechler's creations are little more than well-crafted hand puppets.
Just because "Puppet Master" is possibly a winner (see separate review) and "Child's Play" is a winner, combining the two doesn't ensure a winner if it's handled by no-talent hacks.
I dislike it because when it came out, the production team and every newspaper and article claimed that this movie was made absolutely faithful to the book.
"Playroom" is boring, mainly because you never care for Chris or his bad case of split personality syndrome.
Maybe it's because some of the fights are so overdone so that everyone know that it isn't Mr.Seagal doing most of it anyway?
That doesn't mean that this one is any good, because some of the others are pure garbage.
The shocking rape scene was really well done but I didn't like how she treated her boyfriend afterwords since he was helpless to save her.And then to kill herself afterwards was cowardly and not believable.Yes it was traumatic but I have never heard of rape victims taking their own life because of it.What the skinheads did was rotten,but then so was what the group of black men did to her and her boyfriend.And then later the same group of blacks targeted the white girls.I am sure it probably happens a lot also,but they don't seem to be depicted as bad guys which is a total double standard.At that point I was waiting for the skinhead group to get even with them for shooting an innocent kid who was only lured into it because he was mentally challenged.And they were also protecting their female members from being nearly assaulted which any gang would do no matter who they are.
This movie was ugly to watch because of the poor cinematography and acting.
The reviewer must have been the brother of the film-maker, because the movie sucks.
Stay clear of this one because it's a real stinker.
It gets a 3 from me because despite all its flaws, my 3 year old loves it, therefore giving daddy a much needed rest from time to time.
Set in 1953, there is great excitement in the village of St Mary Mead because an American film crew is coming to shoot their production of Mary Queen Of Scots at Gossington Hall, which is owned by Miss Marple's old friend Dolly Bantry (WENDY MORGAN).
There is zero chemistry between Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor and it is not because they are older than they were in Giant, it is because they do not seem to care, certainly the audience does not.
I'm going to quickly cite some of my qualifications for rating this film because it's relevant to what I have to say: I'm a HUGE Christie fan -- I've read every book/play (some 2 or 3 times) that she wrote (over 80 in all), her Mary Westmacott pseudonym stuff, her tome of an autobiography (not a very good or honest work, BTW!
Everything is rote, from the obligatory crew of friends (Black, gay, boyfriend) to the really awful story transitions that actually come from nowhere; you're just expecting them because that's how these tales go, and not because the script properly sets them up.
The contrivance is embarrassing and pointless because she has not changed as a character.
If there is determination to make it (or as Streep's character infers because they are so alike) it is not apparent.
It was unclear if Streep's superficial relationship with her children was because she had no life outside of the magazine or because she was indeed that superficial.
In fact, it must be in Lancaster, PA, USA, because the Strasburg Railroad locomotive #475 makes a few appearances in the movie (in Strasburg and Harrisburg, PA) and I doubt it's ever been across the Atlantic.
I assume that the marketing folks needed a few more new characters to work into the merchandising mix because there's no excuse for the plot damage caused by the diesel.
The basic message of this movie is that you shouldn't be ambitious, because if you are you will be punished by your friends and family--is this women really need to hear more of this bullshit?
In the real world, partners go through periods when they become absorbed by intense spells and relationships survive, because in good relationships partners support the long-term goals of their sig others.
The extra "behind the voices" featurette on the second disc is better because it's REAL (why the hell did Miramax see fit to give this sad movie a deluxe set boggles the mind, by the way).
My favorite actor was the gregarious cameraman, mainly because his impersonations were spot on and he alone provided some of the movie's only laughs.
But because this series pilot is supposed to be setting us up for a series similar to "The Grand Hotel", and not just a detective series, the filmmakers have to flesh things out with human interest and character tags.
Its kind of sad too, because I really like most everyone in this movie, but as we all know the best actors in the world cannot save a lame script and ham handed direction.
I came to this site to prove a point to people because these kids in my home town recently decided to start their own "gang" call "The Butter Creamers" i almost died laughing when i heard this.
I rented it because the cover had Apachi helicopters, and army guys running away from an explosion.
After watching the movie I was disappointed because there were no Apachi helicopters, no army guys, and no explosions.
This is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain.
So you are tempted to read it again to see what you must have missed, however, you don't, because you come to your senses and don't want to waste your time.
Stage requires a lot of talk because of the limitations its nature imposes.
This is all a shame, because it starts off fine.
I gave it two stars largely because at times it's shot well.
I assumed that it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original.
I think that I thought this was BII because this has a similar title to one of BII's alternate titles.
In the end I gave it only a "3" rating because the movie falls flat.
I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews of this goofy movie, because I thought it was really lame.
Bad idea, of course, because unknown galaxies usually is where big slimy monsters live!
But instead of keeping her in character, she becomes sappy and simpering, because she's destined to destroy the Earth.
They went ahead and introduced all these new Titans, but hardly any of them had any screen time, because the show didn't have enough episodes to hold them all.
You may likely feel glad when the film is over, because you don't have to witness the wretched suffering of the addict characters anymore.
However, I found this very disappointing, not only because it was so depressing but it's too talky, the photography disappointed me and I think it tries to be a lot "smarter" than it comes across.
Normally I stay away from these movies (I don't say film because it's not) because they're terrible and movies made by amateurs don't entertain me, but this was at the library and the library usually doesn't have these "shot on video" movies, so I duped!
He was thinking "because they're unpaid extras.
I know all this because I directed the film and with the help of our talented D.P.
While this movie may somewhat accurately depict callous British imperialism towards native populations, and is sympathetic to the trod-upon Maori, "Utu" (Sumerian for sun, but for the Maori it means revenge) ultimately fails as a story and film because so few of the more prominent foundations that the film lays at the beginning are actually paid off at the end.
Should the viewers assume that this is because the British are on a campaign to wipe out the Maori to take their land?
However, this is because I am a former addict.
The people in the cinema cheered when it was over, but not because they liked the movie, just because it was over...
I gave this movie one star, because that is just what it deserves.
Also, whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film, because they kept calling Suzanna Love's character Natalie, when it's Lacey.
This is a throwback to the horror and action-adventure movies in which the tension is based on the threatened woman who cannot get out of the way of danger because of her passivity, gullibility, or other gender stereotyped disability.
What makes for good fight scenes in movies are those which stretch the limits of credibility but never leave you laughing in the aisles because they have lost all touch with reality.
This ridiculous charade repeats itself several times and in each one there is never any suspense because you KNOW that Banderas and co. will calmly allow the villains to empty their arsenal and then our boys can go on a slickly filmed, stylish killing spree of the bad boys.
It dies because it has been defeated in a battle of ideals, or, on the contrary, it has fulfilled its ideal by dying.
A character played by Tarantino is introduced, apparently because Rodriguez thought it would be funny.
It is then killed without any real reason and without any emotional effect on the audience, maybe because it is not really possible to withstand such an idiotic and unrealistic character for more than a few minutes.
The closest Rodriguez came to Woo is in "El Mariachi", if only because in that film, the leading character is interesting to follow: He knows that as a man who lives for music, he no longer belongs in this world which cares only for money.
The movie had soul, if only because Rodriguez quite obviously thought of himself as a Mariachi of sorts when he wrote the script.
I can accept the fact that this librarian will take him in, treat his wounds, and put herself in extreme amounts of danger even though he is a complete stranger and, probably, is the last person you should trust, all because he saved her life.
all because the natural assumption was that it was somehow remotely connected to Bram Stoker's Dracula...at least in terms of production values.....nothing could be further from the truth...
I laughed until I cried...perhaps it was because of the glass(es) of white zinfandel I sipped while watching...(..hey, lay off..I'm a Raider fan, whaddaya want!!)
The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later.
The ending however made me smile because I was into the good main character.
I want to keep this review brief and to the point because this film deserves no more.
I won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as I'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a "Boogeyman" sequel.
Literally 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress Suzanna Love's original character's name (Lacy) right.
I gave this movie a two because it never made me want to kill my self... but its still very, very bad.
He was good in Conan and Terminator,because he has a great body and very few words to say...
This is because I have voted using the same criteria for all of my other votes.
This is not a film that you laugh at because it contains good jokes or satire, this is a film that you laugh at!
Hmmmmmm, well this grizzly bear must be a kick boxing one because i swear he puts up his guard ready to take on the mighty Hercules!
A lonely soul "Pretzie" (so called because he sells pretzels)wanders the streets of New York alone.
Though it is indeed supreme if you need one and a half hours of cheep laughs i rate it 1 because it is technically the worst movie i have seen.
It is perhaps one of the all time worst movies ever made, but so bad and because it includes the Governor of California in the all time worst performance of his career well, its just priceless!
Still, this could be considered something of a cult item today, because it feautures Arnold Schwarzenegger in his movie debut; he is already impressive-looking, and his voice is dubbed throughout by a man who sounds nothing like him!
This may on one hand actually well be the worst movie I've seen, on regular movie basis that is, because on the other hand it's also the funniest movie I've stumbled across since I saw "Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail".
He even has the great ability of killing actors dressed as bears by lifting them up in the air and throwing them around, destroying cabs because he's angry and impressing ladies by ripping off his shirt in front of them.
Then we have main supporting character Arnold Stang, an actor which has exactly two different looks: one of utter confusion, probably because he's wondering about what the hell he's doing in the movie in the first place and one look of not so utter confusion, which he often uses when Hercules flexes his muscles for him.
OK maybe it's supposed to be there just because no-one ever even thought about editing the sound and that reality works that way: what you don't alter is most likely to stay the way it is.
We watched because we had no other choice.
Just because it owes so much to Odets doesn't make it a bad movie but Odets is there in every frame because Polonsky has opted to write about a world familiar to Odets and employs sub-Odets dialogue.
I recently watched this movie, and let me start by saying it is a step up from Talledega Nights, but a step down from Jolly Roger, simply because it just wasn't funny.
But overall this movie was abysmal, and was just one step below "Private Resort", simply because Private Resort had Johnny Depp (who went on to do great things), I'm afraid this cant be said for this movie.
I can even give this film to anyone I know, because that would be a serious insult and not a nice present... And to sell it would be fraud!
i was actually somewhat excited to see this movie because i am a big fan of orlando jones, but i was extremely disappointed with this movie.
let's just say that was the LONGGEEST plane ride ever because of this HORRIBLE movie.
It is also surprising that he got a scholarship because throughout the movie he rebels against the coach.
Just because this film is different from the usual horror flicks I don't know how anyone could possibly like the film.
The reason I went ahead to see this flick was because of the near 6 vote it had and much of the commentary which was rather positive.
However, this is another case where a first time director, working from his own plot, is felled (and his projects fails miserably) because there is no director to call the writer on the weakness of his plot, or no writer to argue with the director about where the move is being moved or pushed away from the script -- or simply to toss ideas around with.
No, the problem is it's all too obvious and overly symbolic, and the dialogue is annoying because it's not half as clever as it thinks.
It bothered me that she would sleep with Marty's brother, because I thought possibly they were writing one character who wasn't screwed up.
The mother was also not amusing because she allows this psycho (Jackie O) to continue with her behavior and doesn't even care.
But sadly, everything was in vain for me, because I just couldn't stand the pretentious tone of everything.
Genevieve Bujold as the disconnected mother is the best thing in it, but these days, that isn't saying much, because so many people are disconnected.
He resurrected the father because he wanted to punish him for being such a jerk by making him live longer at his sucky life as a poverty stricken coolie.
The father never studied in school and constantly reminds his son that they are poor because he is uneducated and can't get a better job.
The son, Dickey, is ridiculed at school because he comes to school dirty, his shoes and school uniform is from the dumpster, and it is obvious that he is poor.
There`s no character development because there`s no characters just a bunch of one dimensional cyphers like a giant who is ver big , a dwarf who is very greedy and a elf who ... well what does the elf do ?
I seriously recommend this movie purely because you will laugh/cringe so much, even though you most likely won't last all the way through.
Just because some dying character actor lobs a mindsword at you is no basis for a system of government."
Naturally for a naff movie this boasts a good UK DVD, with a superb transfer (but then it's not as if the negative got much use) and an array of more on-set interviews than any sane individual could ever want to watch, including one great moment where Marcel is asked if it's true he turned down a $10m budget because he didn't want to cast big names: "That's a load of rubbish" he replies while trying not to burst out laughing
It's kind of fun also to see how the scenarists managed to leap from one implausible, contrived plot development to the next - but that's a secondary matter because most of these films were beyond belief.
The point here being: evil gangsters, beware of the authorities because they'll get you!
having been somewhat looking forward to this movie, more because of the titillating title than anything else, i finally got round to seeing it.
The only character who has any back story is Tammi, who's broken up with the boyfriend who cheated on her, therefore we're supposed to care about her; and because she's the only one who protests, momentarily, joining the guys on the boat, we know she's the one who will be the 'last man standing'.
Strange how I've heard such positive things about this UK flick, because I actually found it enormously dull and drawn out.
"Dead Calm", however, works as a thriller because it emphasises tension over actual violence and gives us characters, particularly the young woman played by Nicole Kidman, whom we can care about and with whom we can identify.
I only watched this because it was on Film 4 last night, and wanted to see if it deserved the bad reviews, well it most certainly did.
I will admit that I rented this movie because of the title.
The reason why I gave this a 3 was because the plot does have to deal with the basic idea of human instinct in extreme situations which is an interesting  theme.
Any real chance of characterization sinks as soon as the characters begin to do awfully predictable and silly things, just for the sake of packing a punch to the audience - which in turn fails because everyone can see them coming.
This is one of those thrillers in which every cast member gets a turn playing the volatile psychopath, purely because the script can't get around the fact that the previous character to go loopy has just been safely locked in a cupboard.
And it's a real shame because the actresses are all wonderful.
Diane Keaton plays the shy, insecure, stammering spinsterish Lenny, who feels herself inadequate to attract a man because of her inability to bear children (due to shrunken ovaries).
The only reason that I watched this crap was because Harland Williams was in it.
I give it a 1 simply out of pity, and because a negative option wasn't available.
cant believe i'm even taking time to write how excruciatingly awful unfunny boring clichÃ©d this unspeakable thing was, the movie studio allowing him to make it must have been because they wanted to see him  as the assistant manager at a taco bell not writing producing movies - that is the only possible explanation  with something this bad one must not have many friends to clue you in before it too late 'hey this is bad bad bad' 7th graders on you tube have better writing skills.
No one has chosen this route because it too painful a way to go.
Not because it's a good movie about the fight business Â which it is Â but because it is, of them all, the only one that uses the story as a blatant metaphor for the sham of the American Dream (although Bogie's effort in The Harder They Fall touches upon that idea).
I almost forgot about this show and I really wish I had completely forgotten about it because Punched Up was horrible!
I hope that they destroyed/erased/burned/buried the tapes of this show because it was so awful I can't even believe it.
Whoever is making these important decisions needs to have their head examined and should have been fired a long time ago, unless they have been firing people in which case look at your hiring process because you keep hiring people who don't know how to pick a good TV show and obviously do not have a single idea of what is funny.
the jokes are lame the written parts are poorly written and the improv parts remind me of college kids hamming it up for the camera to get attention, because they know they're funny because their friends told them so.
The concept is pretty crappy to begin and it feels likes a rudderless, directionless ship from start to finish (I didn't actually get through the last commercial break because my trusty remote put its foot down).
Maybe we just feel like we have to because its a "classic".
It was horribly sickly and cheesy and conventional and I am giving it 2 points because it managed to keep me watching till the end despite my almost reaching for the OFF button on a number of occasions.
You can make films to please the box-office that don't completely massacre your intelligence as well and still have the final product (that's what they seem to call it, because they don't make films anymore ) be intrinsically Bollywoodish.
But when it comes to character portrayal, she wouldn't know where to begin because neither her nor the script are interested in it.
And do not take me wrong: I gave the movie 3 not 1 just because Ash is there.
As for the court room scene, I was supprised at the verdict, because there was so little evidence to even help the defense.  
It's not because he's a bad actor.
If a movie is based on a true story, it makes sense because the viewer is curious about where the characters are now.
Rules of Engagement starts off relatively strong, although I was confused because I came into the theatre about 3 minutes late.
Philip Baker Hall, Blair Underwood and Anne Archer, all capable actors/actresses, barely register because of the 5 minutes allotted to each of them in varying roles.
Unlike A Few Good Men, still the best of its kind, Rules of Engagement falls flat because even as none of the character actions make sense, nothing is surprising either, and that is the biggest sin of all.
But they're upsetting less on account of any contemporary resonance that might echo in the wake of 9/11 -- truth to tell, there isn't any such resonance, anyway -- and rather more because of the realisation that one has coughed up Â£3 25p in order to view a movie with so little idea of the rules of engagement where audiences are concerned that writer and director ought to get back (or possibly,enroll) in the nearest neighbourhood film school as soon as possible.
It's a shame this is her only movie, i heard she gave up her career because she found Hollywood corrupt and moved to Bristol, England to be a lawyer(!!!).
It must have been a success because this negligible film is a shameless and bathetic rip off.
I don't want to mention this but Erwin Rommel was a member of the Nazi party and he was the most respected German general by the allies because of his code of chilvary while many Wermacht non party members committed war crimes every bit as brutal as their SS counterparts so don't be fooled that everything is as black and white as seen here , as the caption at the end shows Schroeder himself was questioned about crimes against humanity after the war   There's a couple of other flaws with the script .
The wife only told the truth to Stella, only met her once, which was because Stella came to her.
I found it hard to view the user comments on this film because of all the partisan ranting from demagogues of both parties.
I guess maybe some people liked it because it was a train wreck.
This is not a happy story, i sat through all the frustrating bits in the movies, putting my shirt over my head whenever he tried to debate with his enormous stutter, thinking its okay, because I'm gonna see some scenes at the end where he has finally lost his stutter.
I was convinced the inevitable transformation was going to be in his speaking patterns so i wasn't particularly interested in his views on love, because I'm sorry, i don't mean to be offensive to anybody but having a speech impediment as BAD as that, is something i couldn't bear to hear for the rest of my life, you have to try and do something about it.
At the end of 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' i was left thinking, despite its lack of a clichÃ© happy ending, that the main characters were not doomed because of it, that they could bounce back from the issues in the movie.
Please make intelligent comedies but because they are intelligent.
Well I don't know how to put it exactly, I had a very high expectation on this movie before it came out, mostly because all those excellent ones made by Chen Kaige before.
OK, you can go now..." I can safely say that best part of "The Promise" is when the credits roll, because you know it is finally over.
It's not fair to describe it as Asia's Alexander, because although often horribly executed, there was a governing intelligence behind that.
Unfortunately, despite a promising initial premise and mostly game performances, Kaige really isn't suited to this kind of material and seems to be throwing in elements simply because they worked in other people's hit movies.
It's a one on one brutal action sport that has inherent in it good drama because of what is at stake for people who most likely came from nothing and used their fists on the street.
Too bad there are no decent prints of this film (the DVD transfer is awful), because the bots and Joel would have done it proud.
Well, when they arrive, they find the place is infested with zombies (though because the budget was so low, you only see one--late in the film they inform you that the place is infested with them).
Putting Ben on his payroll as his trainer, because he feels that he owes Ben something after what he did to him, Charlie defends his title a number of times but now he's up against a much younger and more formidable opponent then those he fought, Marlow.
Marlow has been going around claiming that Charlie been ducking him for two years because he's "yellow".
Charlie tells them that they aren't smart to know what the real things in life are and that's why he's successful and their not and he's the one who's been supporting them, his family & friends, all these years because he doesn't think like they do.
It's a lot worse than that because our lady scientist who's a poor woman's Gale Sondergaard is a Russian agent.
In fact she's begging her superiors for more time because the Russians are getting ready with an H-Bomb attack, but her method would be so much neater and would leave all those nice cities intact with a population of slaves.
Teenage Zombies has a no name cast most of whom I won't mention because you've never heard of them.
He couldn't, thank god, because not an inch of stock footage made it to the screen.
I liked his "Empire of the Ants" because it combined that trick with big model ants, but this one is mostly rear projected rats.
I only watched this film because Pamela Franklin, whom I'm a huge fan of, was in this film.
Some people like this film because it is so bad and cheesy; I mean I usually get a big laugh out of films like that, but this film is a total bore.
Perhaps if I watched it stoned, I might find it funnier, because everything is funny when you are high.
They can't swim OK, and we're not just saying that because we've already filmed the ending before someone pointed out that they can swim.
I had to back it up just to see the giant plastic chicken because it was so funny.
I found this little jewel of cinematic pooh on a collection called "Night Chills" and trust me..this is one of the better films in that collection...I personally love crappy C and B grade movies because I'm sick of the Hollywood factory made movies that have the same stupid plot as the last 50 Hollywood movies I've seen
*** Possible Spoilers Ahead ***  First of all, a group of people play roleplaying games (I didn't realize that people who are in their 30's played roleplaying games, but I guess they are trying to act like teenagers for the film), then one of the losers kills themselves because they are in love with one of the other losers (ooh, very dramatic).
Movies that you see and really enjoy because they offer something new to you and 2.
Finally, it's a pity to understand so little because it seems to be a good comedy about Hollywood.
Someone must have owed someone else a big favor, because this film should never have been produced.
3/10, only because of John Cleese and Ralphie from The Sopranos
A good thing they hardly ever show Montgomery because he is completely unbelievable as Marlowe.
Unfortunately, just because it had the words "film noir" printed on the VHS box didn't guarantee it was a good film.
Boxing is the ultimate sport to depict in film because such interesting character studies can come out of them.
Other sport films seem to suffer because more has to be captured and the sport itself is usually portrayed poorly and unrealistic.
This grade-B flick is actually a cut above your typical made-for-cable fare, notably because there is a semblance of plot to add to the by-the-numbers action sequences.
They are chasing some guys because they apparently have a code that they need to stop a missile from launching.
Not because it's slow.
"Apocalypse" expects it's audience to forgive it's definitive lack of anything even remotely resembling competence because it's intentions are good.
This all makes for a kind of cheesy movie that doesn't accomplish much because of it's obvious intended purpose Â to save all us poor lost souls.
I was quite surprised, because I was really expecting to love this film.
I'm giving it a 2 here simply because I figure I should give it the benefit of the doubt for getting completed despite political and financial disadvantages.
The movie is entertaining only because it is ridiculous.
Tortilla soup has the right idea, mainly because it was done once before and more successfully for that matter.
Maybe because his character is supposedly from AndorraÂ where Spanish is NOT spokenÂ).
Mary's son was just surnamed Carey because Henry had got involved with Anne by then and so no royal bastard surname for him, but he was made Lord Hunsford.
Also Anne was not exiled to France because of showing off for the king, that was a random addition to the story line.
In the closing "write-over", we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy; in fact, her family looked down on her and even rejected her because she brought down their status.
Running through the laundry list of other inaccuraciesÂ.Anne was not EXILED to France because she fumbled her attempt to seduce Henry.
You need to get a sense of what's a good movie and what's a bad movie because you are completely lost.
I would honestly recommending watching it while you are a little overtired because it provides some laughs and a lot of confusion.
I'm not really sure what happens because I don't think it was ever clear.
In the films favor the muddledness of the movie does add some creepiness to the film because you never can get a handle on what is really happening, but at the same time the film falls apart because what you do understand doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.
The opening scenes strain credulity for their "meeting cute" -- what normal straight guy decides he may be gay because he can't commit.
She immediately has a "delayed" orgasm (only that piece of fiction could be written by a clueless male fixated on a fantasy that doesn't exist in real life), after which they suddenly decide they are in love and oh, by the way, it is six months later all of a sudden because it has been established for the sake of the story that he is so neurotic that he can't remain in a relationship longer than, what is it?
So naturally, he leaves because he looked at his watch and by golly, it's been nine months.
Particularly because the legendary Donald Pleasance ("Halloween", "The Flesh and the Fiends") plays the obsessive hunter, and because the guy in the director's seat is Lee Madden ("The Night God Screamed", "Unchained Angels"), I literally ignored all the negative warning signs and nevertheless hoped to have stumbled upon a genuine hidden.
This annoying little gimmick does not only interrupt the pacing and tension; it's also very pointless because the wildlife footage is unclear & fuzzy anyway.
The principal and the coach won't even talk to this man in the hallway anymore because he admitted this.
I enjoyed it a lot, because it gives lots of insider info on a band that I've loved for over fifteen years.
I would have enjoyed more scenes of that classic show in Austin TX, mainly because I was there, in the front, and it was the most fun I've ever had at a concert in my life.
OK, Lou Diamond Phillips is quite funny at times, but as often as his character is funny, he is also annoying, simply because he is too exaggerated and stereotypical.
I list those because I want to establish a standard for good.
The American scenes are poorly done because it is fairly obvious that the producers have never been to America.
There ware no close-ups of the sexy babes shooting big guns, half of the time the action was stopped because someone had to say something stupid and the whole thing was full of errors and stupid crap.
I think people who say they like this movie probably think it is great only because it throws in a lesbian relationship as the core of its theme.
because guys don't look nearly as good in the mandatory "Catholic schoolgirl" uniform) can lie, though it isn't exactly clear how a seemingly innocent test question can determine how well a person can lie.
(the movie never really clarifies if the "S" is part of the acronym or if it is to distinguish pluralism): Max, the on-edge African-American girl and squad leader; Amy, the blonde who got a perfect score on the secret portion of the SAT; Janet, the doofus of the group; and Dominique, who you know is French because she is a sex addict, smokes non-stop, and speaks with an accent so obvious that it can almost visible.
is an acronym for "Discipline Energy Beauty Strength") The film is definitely going to be a 'head turner' not because it stars some very attractive actresses, but because of the 'love-story' that sprouts between two of the lead female characters.
Yes, because there are some very attractive 'eye candy' actresses starring in it, some of whom also end up locking lips at several points (I won't spoil that part for you).
Yes, not only because there are many humorous references that only females would truly understand (I'll be honest, I didn't laugh at some of the 'jokes' because they were probably intended for the female viewers.
), but because there's a certain amount of plot that only female viewers can really latch on to.
(Gave it 2* instead of 1* because I laughed accidentally once.)
Still, I can't dignify giving "Failure"a one out of ten because it does show sparks of originality and shows some potential at times.
The premise isn't too contrived: he is a slacker guy who doesn't move out of his house because of some issues in his past.
She is a girl that dates guys (for money) to help them get over whatever issues they have that prevents them from leaving their parents' homes (because of issues she has in the past).
If someone like me with no scriptwriting talent was writing this movie, and I wanted to show that even though the leading man looks like a bit of a playboy, he has the potential to be a committed and caring husband and father, I might think of having him mentor a cute kid and taking him to baseball games and stuff, and that would have comic potential because when the character needed to be told certain things, I could have the kid saying it and it would be precocious and funny and cute.
The only reason I didn't give Fs is because the actors at least showed up.
I went to see this film because I have admired Kathy Bates' acting for years.
The scenes drag far, far too long and instead of cutting on a joke or trimming needless scenes (maybe because there are a lot that don't go anywhere), they linger.
and the cam operator - I guess it's funny because they're lesbians?
But by that time, you'll be walking out of the theater or turning off the film because the movie doesn't seem to care and neither should you about seeing this film.
Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star.
I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then "Dream Quest".
"They Raid by Night" is worth watching only because it has actor Lyle Talbot as it's top star playing the head of the British rescue team Capt.
Please, do not believe that this has been a good description of what Sicily is, because it is not.
The movie has already done the damage, because the motherly advice consists in considering the relationship with a Mexican guy, apparently on the basis that he is Mexican (and therefore, almost Sicilian, here the comment is not clear).
I rarely watch Arnie movies, because they're usually all action and no plot, just one head bad guy against another head bad guy, and his hench-men shooting it out, until Arnie steps in.
But because I was bored I gave this film a shot (pardon the pun).
Arnold plays Mark Kaminsky, a small-town sheriff who used to be in the FBI, before he was forced to resign because he brutally beat a man who had raped a small child.
His wife (Blanche Baker) hates him because he resigned instead of fighting for his job, she's bored in small-town America, prompting her to ice a cake with an expletive frosted on the top.
And the viewer is inevitably going to wonder: why did they torture us for over an hour with all the secret-agent business, just to get to a "Commando"-type final showdown, where Arnie is able to kill dozens of enemies simply because they are too stupid and slow to get him first?
I think the main reason is because the story is too mediocre and the movie didn't have any fresh twists on the vigilante genre.
I think the only reasons I stayed with this film was because of Schwarzenegger and some eye-catching explosions and action sequences, but I just couldn't get into the story.
The movie has this Hollywood like ending but is justified because it's completely with the realm of the characters, and not forced.
OK, he puts it into the blender, so that the plot unfolds in a non-linear order, but this doesn't add a damn thing to "Kill Bill" because there's no complexity.
At least I didn't pay anything to see it, because that's what it was worth.
Tambor seems to have no notion of what a handsome lug he is, and his aw-shucks shuffling and nervous body language is that much more appealing because of it.
I have no interest in "Part 2" because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords.
What we are left with is more Matrix style garbage, a 10 minute anime introduction to Lucy Lui's character, black and white photography for no reason and the bleeping out of the bride's name just because he can.
All of this is looked at as being brilliant by the critics and those in similar circles because Tarantino has a free pass right now.
Is it just because he can?
Or is it because he thinks he is so much more clever than the rest of us?
The original director had to bail out because of illness but they couldn't find a young director to spit this project out?
Farrah's blank 'oh my gosh' stares make for a dissonant counterpoint, her star must have been fading around now because we get some gratuitous boob shots.
Although "Saturn 3" has the elements to make it a minor classic as sci-fi suspense thrillers go, the movie flounders because of awkward scripting, phony special effects, and Stanley Donen's lackluster helming.
We have plenty of time to wonder about this, because Hector is slooowww.
That's because, after all, he's a guy in a cumbersome robot suit.
And it's a shame, because the dog was the only decent actor in the flick.
Into their lives comes Harvey Keitel (His voice was dubbed by Roy Dotrice because his Bronx accent didn't wash) and his friend, a robot named HECTOR.
You can safely assume they took these parts because, at the time, these may have been their best offers.
They are happy to be alone because it gives them a lot of time to dress and undress and dress and undress.
It has been deservedly forgotten because it is wretched.
It's just as well because the script is poor, the acting (Douglas and Fawcett particularly) is laughable in some places, and the special effects are on the point of being disastrous.
At the risk of being ungallant, I'll say that one reason I found this movie so unpleasant is because Aline MacMahon is so ugly.
Maybe because I never liked the character of Captain Jack and couldn't bear watching a whole series dedicated to that flimsy character.
The local girl's acting was awful from start to end and it ranged from "I've got a hard attitude but I'm only 10" to "I'm going to turn on my mobile phone because I'm hard."
It looks the BBC are trying to infiltrate the entire country because it's the first success they've had on a Saturday night since Strictly Come Dancing (and no I'm not going to mention Robin Hood).
Just because its part of Doctor Who and has the awful Russel T Davies as the creator doesn't mean it has to be on the air for another pathetic series.
It took me three-quarters of the film to fully establish what aircraft type he flies because of the poor continuity this film suffers from.
I feel like the audience is being treated as a fool because of the appalling continuity and dumbing down for effect of this film.
However, thinking back, I may sound self-contradictory because there was one highlight.
I can quite often enjoy a movie even though I know it's pretty bad, because there is usually something there worth enjoying.
John, Elizabeth, and the videographer are out scavenging for food because they have run out of anything to eat.
The videographer and John flee into the woods, but the videographer executes John because the latter is too far gone.
Similarly, a decent cast is wasted because we gain no insight into their flat characters, least of all the murderous Goke.
Again, while Christopher supposedly fears intimacy, no fear is actually shown -- he relishes intimacy and honesty (and has a male friendship exemplifying these) and the under 25 women bore him because they offer neither.
A team of four documentary filmmakers head outside London to a remote farm to hold an interview about the possible pandemic but find themselves trapped & isolated as large parts of London are evacuated because the virus hits & hits hard, the virus appears to turn the infected into mindless flesh eating zombies.
Don't get me started on the make up and special effects because the average Goth in the street looks scarier than what this director let loose on the world (and that's taking into account the first person camera and the darkness)  In short, I don't really understand why some critics can be so positive about this movie and the current score between 4 and 5 seems about right  other titles I recommend: Diary of the dead, Rec, 28 days later (for the English angle)
Of course I was not confident because of the reviews I read prior to buying it, but I thought it would be better to have an open mind and decide for myself if "The Zombie Diaries" was good or bad.
The way directors Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates arrange the stories rather bugged me, truth be told, because they had opened the film with a young news crew heading outside London into the country to film an interview piece, and then completely abandon them.
The writers make it impossible to care about any of the characters because there is zero character development - the characters themselves could have been zombies and it wouldn't have made any difference.
The thing that annoyed me about this film was the shaky camera movements, it was tolerable at first but became a nuisance after a while, the storyline is very confusing, it even at times felt like there was no storyline, because the characters were never really developed enough for me to care about any of them, they actually bugged the living hell out of me, it also never really built up any suspense, at least not for me, because given the fact that I didn't care for any of the characters the film just bored me, plainly put.
But this film was SO bad, all I can say is: keep any and all sharp objects safely out of reach while watching this movie... because trust me, you will definitely want to slash your wrists before its painful 80 minutes are up.
The only spoiler I will give you regarding the story is the following: in the end, the zombies all die of starvation... because there isn't one single person in the film with a brain worth eating.
This film is unworthy of even existing, I own over 600 films and and love everything from evil dead to good fellas, night of the comet to American beauty and I can honestly tell you that i feel like destroying this film because it is a disgrace to my collection, avoid it at all cost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I gave this film 1/10 because the score by Ennio Morricone was soothing.
My father rented "The Bible Collection" DVDs over the Easter period, but I was interested in watching only two of these and that was only because of who directed them - this one by Italian film-maker Olmi and the already-reviewed SAMSON AND DELILAH (1996) by Nicolas Roeg.
I rate this movie 3 out of 10, just because there is little hope of Crocop being a real action hero.
Linda needs the money because she is going to Arizona to see a man she met on the Internet.
One of the reasons why I was interested in seeing the movie is because I heard that all the dialogue is improvised by the actors.
Well, either I heard wrong or I was lied to, because in the DVD commentary (which is very good, by the way) Soderbergh explains that only the scenes between Nicky Katt and Enrico Colantoni are heavily improvised.
I'm not a big fan of experimental films in general, because in most cases the directors are simply being self-indulgent and pass their work off as high art, simply because they're being different (or "revolutionary," as the more pretentious directors phrase it).
A mix of troubled characters related all to the movie business create a confused and complicated web of feelings, relationships, weird behaviors and "rendevouz" that are let to almost pure improvisation by the director, and in retrospective it sounds very interesting but we haven't seen many movies with such a proposal maybe not because nobody has thought about it but because it's very hard to make it successful and achieve a fine piece of work.
I rate this movie even worse than Burt Reynolds worst failure with Dom Deluise (when he and his cast appeared to be having a great time making an unfunny movie) because Soderbergh and crew have the skill to do so much better.
Claude Rains, Fay Bainter, and Donald Crisp were capable of saving just about any film, but even though they ganged up on this one, it was hopeless, not least because the movie's arteries are again clogged with the frothy Lane sisters and three feeble counterparts (Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn).
Just because it's so over the top with gunplay and sets a new standard for bgrade action films, plus there's a Baldwin brother in it, so hey...I'd give it the extra point for that alone.
If you're considering this movie because of a "supernatural battle against the ultimate evil" blurb (from the DVD I watched), you're going to be disappointed.
Anyone who will find him-/herself rooting for the "good guys" must have the patience and love for good only a buddhist monk can have, because the script and the acting aren't helpful in any way to feel for those guys.
A friend of mine got me this little turkey for Christmas, because he knows I enjoy watching bad movies.
Perhaps that's because there were three writers.
I rarely do that, because I like to watch the whole thing in order to write an informative review.
Accordingly, I won't go into the plot, because I didn't watch enough to figure it out.
At no point was I engaged by the film, and I only left it on until the end because I very rarely turn off a DVD early.
because here, this is no matter of feeling, Dakin's 'offer' is not, as he so kindly expresses it, a favour he gives Irwin in order to thank him for his admittance at Oxford, it is an attempt made by an immoral being in order to confirm to himself that he can control and manipulate others by exploiting their secrets.
The only sympathetic character is Rudge, and his character is also involved in the only piece of truth in the whole shoddy exercise - he gets into Oxbridge because somebody knew his father.
But Bennett doesn't make us care anyway - he's too busy with his odd thesis for that - but don't ask me what the thesis is because that's not clear either.
We just don't care when he dies, and we don't care what happens to the kids, as told in the final scene, because the script doesn't go into who they really are, or what they want.
The fact is, just as Rudge got into Oxford because of his dad, Bennett got the film made because he's a luvvy, with a troupe of backslappers telling him every word he writes is as clever as hell.
Much of the dialogue was authentically 17th century, but it was hard to listen to because the sound mix was bad, and the print was so grainy it looked like a pirate DVD.
I do not intent to because I have already seen the best; but will read the book when I find time so to confirm what everyone have said.
I am glad to have at least a completely perfect version to watch because I dubbed it from the PBS broadcast, but VHS will not last forever and I would like to own a DVD copy for my grandchildren someday...
I give the 4/10 just because of Terry Farrell.
Its hard to say if "Last supper" was supposed to be funny or is unintentionally funny because the crass overacting and the over the top sound FX that remind me of one of those horror-sample CDs are laughable.
The movie is dreadful, because by the end of the movie you'll wish you never seen it cause it is too slow and boring.
Morris wins because he gives his lines all the emotional inflection of a dial tone, and when he cuddles up to cutie Marla English for one of their many painful clinches, she looks like she wants to bang down the receiver.
There's none of that belief here, probably because the cast of movie veterans knows they're on the downgrade and can look forward to little more than the next Social Security check.
It is, however, rather watchable in an odd sort of way... Not quite in the Plan 9 fashion, where you're left laughing all the time, because the production values here aren't all that bad for the time.
The movie's budget must have been as tight as English's sweater because bullets don't even leave dust marks on the monster's Victoria's Secrety bosom.
Go check yourself, though, because I've seen the last of this one.
I think my favorite part was Marilyn Manson's cameo, and it's just because of the back story.
Watching Darren Stein's Jawbreaker makes you realize just how difficult it was for Waters and Lehmann to make their film, because in every way Heathers succeeds, Jawbreaker fails.
This is excusable because Sara was supposed to seem quiet and older than she really was.
No wonder why everyone is selling this movie cheap...it is because it doesn't capture your attention in a way you would remember it and make your jaw drop.
I think maybe it's because the main role doesn't reflect the hard conflicts he's living in and with the exception of Byrne and Roth -both giving strong performances-, the rest of the cast is halfway through the intensity I assume was really needed to make us live the plot.
The movie never really flows because it features some pointless and unneeded plot lines.
It's a shame really, because the movie started of actually quite good and I expected to be entertained.
The story itself is ridicules because it lacks a solid main plot line.
And that really disappoints me because I'm very much interested in anything that blows the whistle on the arrogance of international organizations whose self-interested gains appear to be the only reason for their existence.
First of all, there is nothing to disagree with, because the movie contains a single claim of any political relevance: apparently, trade agreements have reduced the power of governments (but how could an international agreement fail to restrain governments?).
The concept is pretty bold, actually it should have been the best prank in the movie, but it falls short because we do not get to see the targets of the prank when they realize that they have been taken in.
All are ignorant amateurs who reject the scientific consensus (in this case, of professional economists regardless of political leanings) because it conflicts with their ideologically created world view.
It reminds me of the critical praise given to "Bulworth" and "Dogma," both poorly directed, but praised because critics supported the message of the films.
We began with a tribal African warrior, genetic mutant chic from the future to a neo-German trash naked killer who likes to liftweights in the film because it helps her think.
Nine Queens was a great Argentinian film, and then there were, of course, remakes of this first movie because of it big success.
There are some things you may not understand, because are local people codes, but everything in the Nine Queens movie is excellent, from the scrip to the finish song and the titles; everything.
For nearly four years Sara Crewe was distinguished as the "show pupil" at Miss Minchin's,a time in which she was materially provided for with the finest extravagances, as she had been accustomed to in India.Having lost his wife during his child's birth, the wealthy Captain Crewe had prodigiously indulged his daughter, affording her a life of luxury.Despite her awareness as to her station,Sara was kind and generous,ever considerate to those less fortunate than herself.She was quick to befriend Ermengarde,a pariah amongst the other pupils because of her academic dullness, Lottie,the spoilt baby of the classroom for whom she became a surrogate mamma,and the ill-treated scullery maid Becky,who had never been shown a drop of kindness in her wretched life.Then,on her eleventh birthday, the fateful news arrived that her father had died,having lost his entire fortune in a speculative investment.Bereft of her only family and almost all her possessions,Sara found herself reduced from being the privileged pupil to an ill-used skivvy at the seminary.Nevertheless,she strived to bear her hardships and remain a princess on the inside.
Amelia Shankley was absolutely wonderful as the dark haired,contemplative Sara Crewe:not only did she look like Sara,but interpreted the part with such conviction, as if she were truly living the character, enduring her adversities with the complexity of a myriad of emotions that swelled in her young heart and pictured clearly on her sore-plagued face.But her eyes lit up immediately when she was approached by Lottie or Ermengarde,or any one she thought a kind soul, partly out of the comfort it gave her, partly because her proud little spirit would refuse to have it otherwise, but mostly because of her consideration towards others' feelings:she knew, because of her own craving for it, what the warmth of a kindly smile could do to kindle and cheer a lonely heart, and thus she afforded them with a conscious good will.
This one succeeded in the first but only because it failed in the second.
May be it was because I hadn't seen "9 Queens," but I really wish they had explained why the twist had occurred by throwing in some more background at the end or something instead of just abruptly ending it with me feeling like I stepped out during the part of the movie that would have a) let me see this coming at all and b) me care enough that it did any more than just the feeling that I had been taken for a confused ride.
If you haven't seen 9 Queens then watch that instead because it is better.
If this film had been an original I would be inclined to give it 7 or 8 stars but because the best part of it (the plot) is lifted (and in the final credits it acknowledges 9 Queens) and also because I am really annoyed by pointless remakes - (Don't even mention Nikita!!)
The director needs to go back to film school and study suspense again because this movie doesn't have any.
This movie should have provided action in the form of Stone Cold Steve Austin but it fails miserably because we can't figure the F out where he is hitting and who he is hitting and what damage it does because the FRIGGIN cameraman is having a seizure while filming !
The writing fails to deliver, mainly because it fails to follow up on what you see in the trailer: the contrast between the extreme violence some of us come to and the people that profit or witness that very same violence.
I got sea sick, because camera is the one that rolls and pitch more than "fighter" themselves.
It can be called action just because there are few fights, and sick not because there are poor filmed few tortures, and not because of sick idea of story, but rather because of sea sick that viewer gets, because of camera shooting.
Austin, the wrestler, is thrown on land, too, and survives because obviously wrestlers fall from 100 meters height every day and live to tell the tale.
Actually, that would be poetic justice, wouldn't it, because most murderers are cowards and kill only from a position of physical strength and by surprise.
Audiences will be more excited to see Jones on the screen because they will know that something will go down.
One can also see that Vinny Jones seems to be having more fun with his character than the rest of the cast because he has something useful to do.
It gets highly ranked because it is independent and the theme is popular, but it is just not very entertaining.
I'm self-destructive because my mother baked a vanilla cake on a Wednesday and I like chocolate on Thursdays.
People watch LAW AND ORDER for 20 years because it's technically well written.
And finally, I'm bringing this critique to a close not because I have run out of things to say, but because I'm tired.
Well, because it was fairly necessary for the plot of the movie, the aliens had to have the usual human shape with slight variations, such as the -- oooo -- BACKWARD knees.
I'm not trying to convince anyone who saw this that they viewed a bad film because nothing is more subjective than comedy and I do believe that there are some solid laughs found here but many of the subplots in this story are just so obvious and predictable.
I rented this film because the trailer looked very funny.
A movie like Dodgeball moves slow because the characters, after they come into the scene and give you that one laugh, like the gym owner or the pirate guy, don't seem to have any more steam and the viewer is suppose to enjoy it for what it is.
Then, if you get the DVD, there is an alternate ending that made me laugh, not because it was funny, because it was so bad.
Not only because Kobayashi is one of my favourite directors and arguably a true titan of Japanese cinema any way you look at it but also because if his brand of socially-minded, emotionally cathartic tragedy could make the leap from his jidaigekis set in Tokugawa Japan to any other genre, that would be the war drama.
Idenitifying with Kaji's holier-than-thou idealism is hard, not because people like him don't exist in real life, and I hope they do, but simply because this kind of clean-cut idealist character doesn't fare well in a dramatic context.
Some reviews have suggested that some people find the film unamusing because it is 'dated.'
Some films age badly because of the focus of the material.
These films are clearly dated but retain entertainment value because of their anachronistic fashions and dialogue.
This is baffling because the writers make little effort to drive the story with witty dialogue.
Most of the minor deviations from the plot I assumed Â still do Â were because Sara had to be shown growing up and the story had to fit within length restrictions.
Parts of the film are sad and, because we (viewers) have become fond of Sara, a little frightening at times.
I really wanted to enjoy it, because I'm a fan of all the main players involved (de la Iglesia, Segura, Wyoming, Angulo), but I found myself staying silent throughout the whole thing.
But it doesn't work as a tragic drama either, because the story is so exaggerated and so absurd, that it's impossible to take it seriously.
My rating is 4 out of 10 (and I'm being generous because I'm spanish).
You can tell because when the dog growls he bears his teeth and you can see the canine's canonical canines.
Perhaps that's because quite a few haven't read the novel, or just because it's a classic, dismiss it as "boring" and "irrelevant" to today's society.
In general, I love BBC productions of novels, because of their faithfulness to the original stories, and because of their length.
It was very disappointing and showed that the budget for makeup must have been about $9.99--which is sad because the basic story idea and much of the acting was actually very good.
There's an unnecessary sex scene between Colum and two lesbian women(..Julie K & Regina Russell)that should also be erotic but comes off surprisingly empty because the director fails to establish whether or not they're actually even on top of him!
(80%) Perhaps that is why the movie never made a box office impact in India, because it was too busy pleasing its Jewish sponsors.
I am giving it 3 out of 10 only because of Preity Zinta, with her dimples.
IN KARGIL, it was General Musharaf who initiated the conflict because of his fear that India and Pakistan might FINALLY sign a peace deal (Bhajpayee going to Pakistan as a gesture of goodwill and meeting Sharif............after Kargil Bhajpayee said he felt he had been stabbed in the back).
Musharaf used the paramilitary Northern Light Infantry, and irregulars to attack India, not with the objective of winning, because you don't use paramilitary forces against India if you are serious about winning, but rather to scupper the possible peace deal between the two nations.
Or do the sons and grandsons of the "liberators" of Nazi Germany have to indulge now in their past, because the present does not look so glorious anymore?
I can at least guess, because it's definitely not for teenagers, 'couse they're gonna laugh at almost every scene (for some time, because THIS movie isn't even funny in the way Ed Wood movies can be), older viewers will easily spot all the plot holes, bad acting and terrible idea.
This is the kind of movie you can't stop laughing at because it's so bad.
I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd.
Anayways, do watch this film because of it's awfulness.
The ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this.
I just can't understand the mainstream critics who swallows this pompous and totally boring piece of ....!Just because the movie deals with serious issues involving God and forgiveness and so on it shouldn't be praised as the work of a genius.But i guess there will always be a bunch of pseudo intellectuals which enjoy these kind of movies with their red-wine.
If you want too see a good Norwegian movie, see FATSO, it's underrated and it didn't go well with the critics...maybe because it's filled up with good dialouge, exiting characters and spot on observations, but i guess that doesn't appeal to the elitists in the media.
The reviews we get in out media are very often undeserved praise, the reason being that the media do not wish to offend the film industry, because we live in such a small country, and it would be suicide to give negative reviews to poor films.. And in some way or another, all Norwegian films are founded by the state.
I stem the tide, because I want to see better Norwegian films, "Reprise" is the only great Norwegians film I've seen as far as I can remember, and there is awfully lots of film that's supposed to be "Masterworks", witch is just not true.
The story falls flat, because there is nothing left to tell.
Maybe because the momentum of the story really is in the past, before the story of the film.
I mean this seriously because the middle of the film, strangely enough, lacks his presence.
I grabbed it because of it's title, because I think it's funny as all hell.
The whole movie is covered in darkness, half the time I couldn't see what's going on the screen, because there isn't any lighting.
There is little gore, at least little gore that you can see because it all happens in the dark.
It is certainly because, Kitano did not write the scenario.
According to me, seeing this film is total waste of time, but if you are a fan of Kitano, you should see this film because Kitano is a good actor.
It wasn't just because it was EXTREMELY violent (though it was needlessly graphic) but because I just didn't care about the characters and the script lacked finesse.
You really really have to watch this DVD because its one of the funniest you will ever watch I Love LP Frat Party at the Pancake Festival
The part where Naomi Watt's character is all "Fuck protocol" was hilarious because that's what they'd been doing the entire movie.
It could be because we have been given no reason to be even mildly interested in the main protagonist.
Sure, you might point at the rampant sex, but let me point this out: the guns in Westworld don't fire at human beings because they are warm-blooded.
Yet they fire at robots, presumably because they are not warm.
And the robot-gunslinger can hear Benjamin's breathing 100 yards away in the desert to locate him, but somehow can't locate his breathing four feet away in the castle--because the fire is distracting him?
I had to purchase a copy of it because none of the video rental places had a copy to rent... don't buy this movie
I mainly decided to comment because I scrolled down to find a comment from someone in New York who says this was 'a conventional continuation of the British obsession with World War I as being the most symbolic war'.
The decision to never leave the trench until the final scene doesn't really work, partially because we have no indication of the world that awaits them, but largely because Boyd's finale is just too televisual to have any compensating shock value.
.... because the opening title sequence is very bland .
Take for instance the 16th battalion of The Royal Scots which was formed in one week and was called " The Hearts battalion " because it was composed mainly of supporters of Hearts football club .
A pity because I`d be very interested what they thought of it .
When they divorce, it is because Oliver "wants a place of my own where I can work"--without a wife or child getting in his way!
Secondly, they should have shown Olivier undergo a genuine transformation into a truly decent guy--not the same old guy who has mellowed some because he's now a successful writer.
(3) Dean Smith - some chubby guy with brown hair appears to portray North Carolina's men's basketball team head coach; he looks nothing like Dean Smith; the film doesn't even mention the name "Dean Smith", probably because the filmmakers didn't bother to cast an actor who looked anything like Dean Smith; this seems a major oversight for the role of such an important figure in Jordan's basketball development.
The film pretends like it never happened, because when the film shows time run out in the game, Jordan is in the same spot where he hit his jumper, and his teammates rush to him to congratulate him.
In fairness, I'm giving it a few extra fractions of a point because I didn't watch the whole thing.
In fact if anyone wishes for me to see this movie again, you better pay me $1 million, because I just won't do it.
It's particularly spooky because the building is an ex psychiatric hospital in which the owner years ago went mad and slaughtered staff and patients alike.
I don't even want to type anymore because it isn't worth my time.
Before I can begin to review the "remake" of House on Haunted Hill, we must first throw the plot, effects, and script out the window, because the movie does a pretty good job of that by itself.
The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because one of my favorite actresses, Bridgette Wilson, was in it and I was excited about seeing her camping it up in a horror movie like she did a few years ago in I Know What You Did Last Summer.
I gave it two stars instead of one because of one somewhat exciting scene at the beginning.
This fact made locals very suspicious and unfriendly, because of superstition of murdered nun's revenge.
As for me, it's probably top bottom of Lucio Fulci's movies and it's a little pity, because the plot is quite good.
Isn't it compelling to watch someone struggle to suppress their real feelings for the sake of a promise made because it gave her "comfort", even when the reason & need for said comfort has been removed?
1. when her father disapproves of him & she tries to honour her engagement to another man - 2. when she feels too guilty to be with Gable now that her father's gone, because dad died while chasing her (!)
--Anyone who watches this video should definitely also watch Television's Vietnam: The Real Story, and The Media's Impact because that video would break so many of the lies contained in the PBS series.
I'm not yet willing to blame the directors of the writers because I can't imagine how or why any writer would intentionally ignore the title character so completely like that for 12 solid episodes.
So you can't just turn it off, because something good, or cool, or at least picturesque might come along, but you can't pay attention because you have to wade through endless stupid clichÃ©s to do it.
The tribal folks are cardboard cutouts who suffer mutely and have the moral high ground because they are victims.
That's too bad, because I was prepared to like this movie, and yes, the scenery was nice.
Well anyway Hunter (Michael Beck), our hero gets involved in the plot because of a girl, that is no less then Straker's daughter.
We see before the War ever begins, that we're watching as rotten a group as one can imagine - deeply self-pitying and selfish people - women without any kind of femininity ("sure, I'll have sex with you whenever you like once I've married a rich man"), men without any kind of masculinity ("sure, I raped as many women as often as I could - committed war atrocities, sure, the lot - it was WAR and I know war and you don't" (and I can't stop talking about it because I'm as self-pitying a human as you'll ever ever meet!
This was a grave disappointment because I have really liked so many of the actors in other things - from Nicholas LePrevost to Jennifer Ehle, from Rosemary Harris to Toby Stephens, from Paul Eddington to Felicity Kendall to Richard Johnson.
I thought is mighty odd, but using my DVD unit to view these scenes frame by frame, one reads English on the signs plunging into the street, not Russian as they should, because this film is supposed to be set in a Russian government town in Siberia!
I prefer the Bastian of the show over the movies, because now he gets to be a boy.
I also think the addition of a love interest was a good idea despite its inaccuracy to the book, because that wasn't the goal of the show.
You can't help but think about how disastrous the current situation in Hollywood is when the umpteenth representative of the infamous category "clichÃ© ridden, sugar coated American cute movies" arrives, and you've got to go see it because your niece is crying about itsince the first announcement.
I didn't think Kitt Kittredge: An American Girl could've been an exception to the rule, but I was hoping it kind of would because I thought the atypical scenario, different era and diverse cast could have delivered a rather unique movie.
You can't blame the actors for everything that's wrong in this movie, anyway, because the script certainly didn't help.
This was a real shame because the American Girl series provides young women with good role models and strong moral messages.
so i took ticker because the casts sounds good.
Secondly, I gave it a "2" because, no matter how unlikely it seems, there is probably at least one movie that is worse, and I'll need to have the "1" available for that.
The plot is awful and the budget must have been small, because the police station looks incredibly small.
I was extremely stupid to buy the DVD of this movie (believe it or not, because it cost only around US$ 3).
This movie is rubbish  Anyway, no use going over the plot because most of you people out there want to know whether the big man has any good fights.
I cant really remember what goes on in the rest of the film because the story line is muddled and i lost interest.
The only reason it didn't get a 1 is because it was so bad it was comical!
One point because this one's better than "Out for a kill", one for Tom Sizemore, one for...
Point your finger at the director because he is responsible for this low-level picture.
I kept watching because I really wanted to find out what happened to Pablo Bryant's character, about whom I cared tremendously, but not enough to rank the movie as better than awful.
Of course this is something to be resisted because the Internet has become the last bastion of free speech.
I couldn't wait for this movie to end simply because I knew exactly how it was going to and indeed did pan out.
I must also say that it wouldn't have mattered which character bought the farm in this movie because I couldn't care less about any of them.
My negative review isn't because I fear this movie is shocking enough to have governments reaching for the control switch.
I can't say if it is because of being a TV movie, because it was made in the early 90's or just bad interpretation.
Though, there are some stuff that you'll miss because you don't have the background explanation.
I gave the maximum mark to this because I can't be fair with this.
But by this point the plot holes were so glaring that I was only continuing to watch because I was with my wife.
I assume that because Howard Hughes owned RKO and was well into becoming 100% unhinged, he personally must have made the casting decisions.
Just that my 2 out of 10 rank is because there are some average battle scenes and incredibly you have the feeling that producers didn't try to save money though the outcome also looks cheap.
To see him as a 'gunfighter' is, in any case, inaccurate, and not merely because Mongolians of this period did not have firearms.
Wayne not only is miscast, be he seems woefully unsure of the heroic aspect of his character, which is fitting, because Kahn was not a hero.
I rented this film because of Angus MacFadyen, who did such a great job in "Cradle Will Rock."
Another really bad part was where they did the filming, you could tell that it was filmed out in the desert out in Utah, because since when did the Gobi Desert have small plants and cliffs and rugged terrain in it?!
After seeing this unbelievable atrocity, I thought that whoever was in charge of the casting department for this movie ought to have been fired, because casting John Wayne as Temujin, or should I say, Ghengis Khan, was perhaps the worst mistake that they made with this movie, because I can't picture Temujin with John Wayne's voice!
I'm only giving this movie one star because I have to give it one star.
Hopefully Howard's check cleared the bank for all concerned, because a decent pay day is the only reason for everyone from John Wayne and Susan Hayward on down to have stuck it out.
It only gets as high a rating as it does because of the quality of the cast, maybe the most shameful waste of talent players in the history of cinema in every sense of the word.
And yet, we get to know from the bonus interviews on this DVD that the porno cinema, which plays such an important role in the story, was a real problem in the adaptation because there were no such places in London, due to their laws.
We would have given an additional star because we had a good laugh, we just didn't have it in us.
It was as though the veterans of the series were just going through the motions because they had resigned themselves (with great resentment) to being typecast and performed mechanically out of some sort of obligation (or necessity?).
This film is really bad, while you have several characters from the Great TV series, it is clear they knew crap when they saw it because they gave nothing in their performances.
However, i would not shed a single tear if this film is trashed and they were to start over, because this movie is just plain horrible and an embarrassment to highlander fans.
Hell the team and even him don't seem to be bothered with doing the production notes and b lo g on their own official site, so from that are we to take it they are re doing the whole thing to actually drill in some intelligent action with a spot of special effects and dash of story line that will blow our socks off, or should we take it that they simply have given up and are now hoping they can get away wit the slow progress of a crappiest produced film of the 21st century and I've now just read that its in fact going straight to sci-fi channel, How pathetic is that Im highly saddened by this because this was going to be the ultimate film for me to watch, I've been a highlander series fan for years and just gained the box set, so to know that they have simply destroyed and made a film worse than end game is soul destroying.
I can't even really say that if you aren't a Highlander fan it might be enjoyable - because even then it didn't make a lot of sense.
Perhaps it's just because I love the original Highlander so much, that I am so angry.
I rated it awful just because there was nothing lower.
It fails because it is not very erotic, not very thrilling and not very mysterious.
It seems that the movie makers have been too much concentrated to train the bunch of actors to love and play soccer because they have forgotten to finish the drama part of the movie.
The match day is worth watching but it may render you only sad because everything that comes before it is rather unpleasant.
I know because I collected them all.
You're too lazy to change the channel because you lost your remote.
Braddock just goes through the motions, because that's what the plot calls for.
Of course that may be in part because I'm a fan of the Rambo series and am offended by cheap knock-offs.
And it's a shame, because it does start promising enough and there is a funny moment here and there ... but not nearly enough to grant this movie more than two stars ... it's still a waste of time!
It was good in the sense that it kept you interested somewhat because you are watching it to figure out what in the world is going on.
Is it because Earth is under peril from natural and man-made disasters that is described in the prophecies of Nostradamus?
Oh yeah, and the spider man thing is because the daughter for no good reason had spider hair.
The reason I'm mentioning this is because the monster we saw for two or so minutes in this scene was far more interesting than the real ghosts of the movie (and, it seems that the people who packaged the DVD realised it too, because the monster appears on the back cover)!
It doesn't scare too much, maybe because i begin to be tired of these ghost Japanese children...
Mainly because of the Sadie and Ben character, there a little bit funny in the beginning, but there humor just quickly vanishes.
I just think it's a shame because I feel all the actors could do so much better work....Two stars go to Mandy and John because they did an okay job in this movie.
Don't see this movie if you want to get married because it will ruin your marriage.
This movie was tacky and offensive, all the more tragic because of the hilarity potential of Robin Williams and the likability potential of Mandy Moore and Jon Krasinski.
I only watched half an hour into the movie because it was so cringe-inducing, distasteful, unfunny and insulting to relationships.
He's an evil, manipulative man, and we're supposed to laugh at him, because he's played by Robin Williams, and he's constantly shooting off zippy one-liners.
The character hangs over the movie like a black shadow, and causes everyone to become incredibly stupid, because no one can admit to themselves that this man is wrong.
That's because Reverend Frank keeps on hijacking the movie at every conceivable opportunity.
License to Wed is a movie that goes so extremely off course, and it's all because of one man.
I fear I have fallen victim to the because it's foreign and independent it must be good and I'm a filthy commoner if I don't enjoy it crowd.
Obviously again noting since that this Camera "captures the death of a moment" that would make sense because the children should have a life instead of slowly dying like the old man.
I gave it a 4 strictly because of visuals.
The problem is not that its so bad as to be bad, rather its because its so badly paced that its really really dull.
- I don't think so...) says that she really appreciates being forced to mingle with the public in the companionship of her "sisters" because otherwise she might have become an antisocial person who watches TV or sits in a corner & reads books.
Perhaps Muslim women don't want to be "free," because the alternative is no better and has the additional negative of being unfamiliar.
You get to alter your appearance on your skin, which helps in both ways because that way you get to be sexy too.
Its odd, because if you go to the website, you can find some characters there who successfully weave a story of intelligence and independence.
Supposedly a syndicate of rich folks backed her efforts because they wanted revenge for all this the kidnappings this mobster did to them.
Simply because he wears a black hooded robe.
The swords must be made of plastic or wood or something, because when they fight, it looks like they're fighting with stick, whacking each other over the head with not a drop of blood in sight.
The pilots seem to be pretty inept too, because multiple Apaches are shot down with RPG-7 which is actually anti tank-short range weapon.
I do hope that filmmakers have been used as practice targets because this is really an incredibly huge insult to Apache pilots.
Neither did she, because the hot bad-ass babe pilot forgot about the guy who killed her brother, and started to sob and cry and yell "don't die please don't die I need you you can't be dead don't die!"
The woman that shows up in a squadron of men, they make fun because she's a woman, she proves herself to be just as worthy, one of the guys falls in love with her.
Setting a film in this city is always a plus because you are guaranteed an interesting backdrop.
In this film, the veil scenes are simply "cheap suspense" because the script fails to create any honest suspenseful/horrific scenarios based on the storyline, plot, characters or dialogue.
And despite the camera that was all-go (hand-held, because it's easier and cheaper than to use camera grip equipment), the story was so all-stand-still that I couldn't take it.
I gave this a 2 only because of the one guy who keeps yelling 'I'm Comiiiiiinnnnng!'
As the most recent installment of Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies I have seen (Parts: The Clonus Horror doesn't count because I've already seen it) I immediately went out and rented this movie after I saw the show.
I simply feel that a movie should automatically be voted so low merely because it was shown on MST 3K.
Boy those two quotes really made that one episode worth watching because most of the stuff after that wasn't really that great.
And because the whole thing looks like its straight out a Renaissance festival, maybe the setting is supposed to be California?
Of course, that plan backfires in the mother and daughter's faces shortly after their new adjustment due mostly to the racked-up guilt that the young woman has for not being a real mother to her child, and instead having her own mother build up a facade around the actual truth of the situation just to save face of both her mother's and her own, also for not telling the baby's birth father her reasons for running out on him was that she was pregnant and scared and finally because of the interest a childless sex-education/sociology teacher (played by Jane Krackowski), herself trying desperately to become a mother with little luck, takes in her seemingly odd situation eventually forcing Panabaker to reveal the truth behind it leaving her character wondering if putting her baby up for adoption wouldn't be the best answer to her and her family's pressing problems.
In and amongst the somewhat complicated story we see Panabaker's much younger sister (played by Clare Stone) falling apart at the seams, a la becoming more and more introverted and wild, even going so far as to attempt a quick runaway one night which she finds to be a big mistake because the streets are a dangerous and frightening place to live on at any age.
Seriously, folks, it's jaw-dropping misfire after misfire, as Lord David Warner chases David Warner the Taupe with an army of vikings, ay-rabs, pirates, and various castle types who thankfully have very short attention spans, because they never chase Warner and his ward for very long... or maybe Warner lost 'em at the inn/whorehouse.
A beggar buys the kid for one copper, because nobody else wanted him(what a surprise).
He recognizes the girly slave boy as some kind of special prophet that the Knights have been waiting for, because he can translate a 'red book' left by Archimedes to point the way to the treasure.
I wonder what happens when you wipe out your Doppleganger... One annoying character down, a man we couldn't forgive anyway because of an earlier scene in which he threw his own urine onto a passing 'villager'.
The National Legion of Decency classified this movie as unsuitable for children because of Rooney's scenes with Dane and his man-to-man talks with his father (Lewis Stone) about fidelity to one's future wife, whoever she may be.
Her mother seems to sexually abuse her too, she treats her first child like an animal because the girl has down syndrome.
It make me feel like there are groups of people, sub cultures, cities even, that we should just wipe off the face of the earth because there will never be enough programs or charities or money to dig them out of the hole they put themselves in and they are just going to drag society down with them.
I'm neither impressed with the acting or the story or the writing and I can't for the live of me figure out why it's getting such rave reviews, except may by people who equate "gritty" with "genius" because they don't know anything about the world and want to feel hip.
Or because Oprah had something to do with it.
The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the performances.
Is it because it represents every stereotype out there about black people.
We come off as monolithic because we're always falling into the bag every time.
Mamie and the kids triumph in the end because You Just Can't Keep A Good Girl Down.
In fact they made the mistake of having Mamie sing three of the numbers (because in the script she and her sister were hitch hiking to Hollywood to make it big, donchaknow ).
At what high school do kids start throwing food at someone just because she is a teenage mother?
Practically every scene in this film is directed in such a way as if they were the climax: a car crash is not just a car crash, it's a spectacular ball fire explosion of a car crash; a funeral is not just a somber affair but something as revered as a funeral for the Pope; a gunshot to the head is not just to kill the bad guy but to be as gory as a Tom Savini scene in any horror film; the characters are not just people affected by the circumstances of the drama but are as extreme as those types in a Jerry Springer show; the unusual attention to details is not because the film wants to be true-to-life but because the film confuses such anal-retentive attention to details as validation for the unpleasant, over-baked story it's trying to tell, and in turn, becomes almost a parody of itself (Rourke's hair being the best example of this); the dialogue is not just dialogue if it's as loud as a Russ Meyer script; so on and so forth.
Had we known her a bit better maybe it would have worked but because the film only showed her bitching and screaming at Rourke that her death didn't seem that important to us.
For a film where every scene is over-directed, the resolution to is remarkably disappointing because it's so low-key.
It was painful because two terrific actors are wasted and worst, are being put on a ridicule position here...in a movie that has no direction at all, no believability and just nothing to offer...
Cecilia Roth (his then wife) and Mexican actor Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal are good actors, but they are unable to generate any emotions, because the elliptical unsastianl plot is a mix of genres and clichÃ©s.
Cecilia Roth is always great, and the movie is not a complete fiasco only because of her performance.
I was going crazy because of this show; unfortunately, I turned my winter break into a disaster because I didn't find this show.
I didn't quite get what it was all about because the whole movie just seem's like an endless montage of violence, one scene more violence than the other and of course there is also a lot of sex scenes.
I only really wanted to see this because of Robert De Niro.
However the rest of this film lacks his typical visionary edge and I suppose it's because he was still learning (and that's clear in every frame).
It's not too explicit nowadays, but we're left wondering WHY De Palma had to cram so much unnecessary sex and nudity into his film, because it seems like it's just there for the sake of being controversial - and almost 40 years later it is not controversial anymore, which makes it all the more outdated and pretentious.)
Scream is one of the worst choices to parody, because it displays fewer of the cliches of horror, and highlighting absurdities is the whole point of parody.
To say the least, I probably laughed once or twice through the entire 90 minutes, and that was only because I was shocked that a movie could possibly suck so bad.
When I sat down to watch this it was purely because I had nothing else to do; this subject area's been done to death.
Most of the actors in this movie aren't known too well, and I don't think it would even matter if they got better known actors, because this movie would still be horrible.
As soon as I watched the opening of 'Mondo Trasho', my complete admiration for 'JW and his anti-Hollywood statements' had vanished because he can shock and gross out audiences without resorting to animal deaths/cruelty.
It speaks to the contempt that the film's producers hold for the American viewing public that they had to use Khruschev because his name might be recognized rather than present historical fact.
More because of the music than the film itself.
Of course, the big guy is prone to sea sickness, Frankie and Tad may get booted off the team because they're spending so much time coaching Herc that their grades have slipped, their girl friends have fallen for Herc, their coach loses his glasses, and Herc has a secret that's discovered only after the team wins.
It made me cry because I felt like I could relate to her, like I was giving away my son, thats where Danielle really shows her true talent.
It's a happy ending though because the guy who finally sits on the throne is a doctor and an idealist, and we are compelled to hope he remains that way instead of discovering that, hey, it's good to be the king.
The title will fool you(at least the U.S. released video title-Cry of a Prostitute) because this movie has very little to do about a prostitute except that she is a minor character that pretends to be the wife of one of the many `Don's' in this movie.
Eddie Quillan was an odd choice to play the lead in this detective film because he was essentially a small smart-allecky little pip-squeak--not the brilliant or studly hero you'd expect to see in this type of film.
Alas, you'll only be disappointed unless, like me, you want to see it because you've heard only bad.
MUSCLE UP... is a somewhat curious piece for me because it's the only short from the Besser era I can think of that seems to have a decent script behind it.
Django didn't feel supernatural because he was being beaten and didn't feel real because at one moment he became transparent.
Perhaps its because of her deep performance or perhaps the striking resemblance to Lindsay Lohan ala Freaky Friday.
But it's interesting because the entire feel of this movie is very different.
I gave this a three because the finale (once I got past the special effects) wasn't bad.
The whole film is dark because of the pollution problems.
Hitchcock should never have accepted this lethal restriction given by the novel on which the movie is based, because from now on the movie spins around in trivialities.
When the old attorney gives the case to a young specialist, this one follows of course the line of the other, but simply because he earns his money by being a defense attorney and not a state prosecutor.
When Mrs. Paradine hears that, she turns from hints to a full confession of having killed her husband because she was in love with the valet and wanted to start a new life with him.
That's only because he limits himself to raising an eyebrow or suppressing a grin while Peck, Valli, and the rest of the cast alternate between performing their one-dimensional roles in leaden fashion, or else overemoting whenever producer David O. Selznick's script takes one of its hairpin turns.
It's still enjoyable because upper middle class London in the 1950s, the relationships among the people, their entertainments, the beauty of the homes, the clothes, the accents, is a pretty enjoyable place to be for this movie's duration.
I think the main reason why the film is so lackluster is because of the weak cast.
Well, the point is that I wish more movies like this were made because they are so much fun to make fun of because they are so horrible.
Not surprisingly the entirety of Canada must be part of the dorky cult because somehow they show up at dork's house, looking for dork and the notes.
Finally, the 'bad guy', Satoris, is apparently evil because he has a big face, wears a black trench coat, has a deep voice and waves a cane around in the woods.
Now I know that most everyone has seen this movie only because of the comedy genius of MST3K, or Mistie to the loyal masses.
Evil cult members in ski masks and tank tops come after Troy (the nerdy kid), because they want the map (which is to a supposedly lost city, but really a map to a great big pop-up book).
The hero has a few health flaws and seems to have the hardest time running from one action scene to another because he is always out of breath.
But I hope the director watched that episode because I wanna see a Zap and Troy spin off, that would be an awesome show with an occasional guest appearance of Mike Pipper.
Then, Gunter of Burgund had two brothers, both of whom were quite intelligent young men who ruled Burgund together, not just one lad barely out of puberty, who just happens to *sneak* onto the ship they sail to Iceland with, just so he can get some more screen time, because he had to be introduced to the public for the next Harry Potter movie, in which he will be starring as Cedric Diggory.
To tell you the truth I was blubbering wreck by the end because there was so many resonances with my own life, with the relationship I have with my own daughter, with the way men behave in real life.
Let me put it this way -- I was videotaping it because after reading the IMDb.com reviews, I felt sure this would be one movie that I would want to watch again and share with friends.
I didnÂ´t like this movie, because of the malicious intention of a reaction in the public, based in a cheap exploitation of homosexualism.
On the other hand, the deletion of those graphic scenes, would have made a great movie, because the intention of the book writer, was to show the subtext behind homosexual behavior, not the behavior itself.
The only reason I can think of that Asia got this part is because every other actress turned it down!
Unfortunately, this set-up is so ludicrous that every time the issue of "love" between the Phantom and the rats resurfaces (and it does, often and ineptly) you cringe because there is no way you can dispell the absurdity of it all.
The most perplexing thing about "Fantasma" is that Argento did not need to make it because he had already made his Phantom movie.
I think I found her character funny, mostly because of her rather disgusting appearances and behavior.
Basically every aspect of this movie sucked, and the reason I'm not giving it a 1, is because of the occasionally good sets.
The fact that Christine fell in love with him because of this just made her seem like a weak-minded bimbo.
Because of this, and because he kills anyone he dislikes, he's not a sympathetic figure.
The main message seems to be that nobody can be happy alone, although the irony is of course that all are alone (or lonely) because of one abusive relationship.
Bottom line: This movie suck like rest of the Ray Dennis Steckler movies, but if you are fun of his work you might like this (but you may not even if you are fun because this movie really sucks!).
Well, it was purely because I am trying to see the films of the great auteur, Ray Dennis Steckler--one of the most craptastic directors/producers/actors in motion picture history.
That's because when Steckler made the film, it was silent!
He accepted many parts from so-called poverty row studios probably because he needed the money.
Despite this cool start, I also immediately realized that because it was made by a so-called "Poverty Row" studio, that the budget and overall quality would be suspect.
Yet, because the acting is so flat, the script so limp that even these crazy story elements can't breathe life into this soggy biscuit.
MarÃ­a is not too pleased with her mother's presence because she has a lot of problems herself: She is not content with her life as a cleaning woman, she has a serious alcohol problem, and she is pregnant by a graceless truck-driver who refuses any responsibility and wants her to make an abortion.
They use a laptops to hack from the top of the buildings, from the roofs, from the subways - because the laptop is such a powerful tool (in movies hackers almost always use laptops) - this device is meant to display "ACCESS GRANTED"!
So, if you're anything like me, you were expecting this movie to be like the rest of Jackie Chan's early career: silly, unrealistic, and largely nonsensical, but fun nevertheless just because of Jackie's sheer force of personality.
I spent several months scouring DVD stores and P2P networks, looking for Harry's Game, simply because I'd heard from numerous sources that it was the most authentic portrayal of the N. Irish troubles on film.
That's not a problem because that's the way it is with most films these days, especially formula comedies.
We don't laugh, and we don't hate her, because we just don't care.
Now, I warn you to stay as far away as possible from this movie if you haven't seen it, and don't even bother reading any other comments, because all you need to know is what I just told you.
I rented the film because it has Ving Rhames name on it.
And it just didn't seem enough to deliver much impact because of a sense of contrivance.
i loved PJ because everything flowed and the shots were awesome.
This is not because I am an ugly American.
My original stance on foreign films stays as is: they tend to be overrated by critics simply because they weren't made in a Hollywood movie factory.
Giving it a 2 only because a few scenes are actually quite interestingly photographed.
I saw the bad reviews on this one, and decided to rent it anyway because I love pool and I'm still waiting for a decent pool movie.
Lastly, the only reason why this film gets a 1, is because they are after some rare diamond (although the plot is still pathetic) and the beginning titles was actually decent (like showing the 7 ninjas individually).
But I did find it somehow compelling enough that I watched it all the way through (after falling asleep a couple times because there are long stretches with no dialog or "action").
Not only because the stars in it I've watched THIS for 3 times !!
It's not what it claims to be because Kirstie "gets work" even as a fat actress.
And are we to be sympathetic to people who take the law into their own hands, and use nepotism and small town politics to usurp the rule of law simply because they don't like outsiders?
I would have watched it in a flash, just because Genevieve Bujold was in it.
After she arrives, she starts crying with loneliness because she needs her boyfriend - after one day in a vacation hotel with her girlfriend!
The scenes from the original show jarred terribly because they were so much better written, acted, and directed... and because they cut them at odd places, even editing out sections from the middle of a skit!
I watched this one because I'm a Skeet Ulrich fan, almost turned it off it was so bad but managed to hang in till the end.
I knew before I read it here that the director had done music videos, because that was what this movie feels like in spots.
This movie fails in the same way as 'The Spirit of St. Louis' because solo protagonists require an intrusive amount of narration and soliloquies to advance the narrative.
Also, if you want to rear-project most of your settings, and the only background is clouds, the cloud types needs to match in continuous moments, because viewers are going to notice that.
Good thing, too, because The Old Man and the Sea is Hemingway's tersest statement about what it means for a male to live a worthwhile life: live vigorously, test yourself, fight what threatens to destroy you (within and without), and emerged bloodied, but unbowed.
I saw this film because I was studying the book and hoped it would give me another perspective.
The acting is nonexistent because the narrator frequently reports character speech in third person rather than the actors speaking.
But even the saddest ones (and they now, because they have had a fight about who the saddest one was) can shift to a better life.
I wish I could give this film a higher score because of the lovely portrayals given by Ethel Waters & Brandon de Wilde.
At the end, it's revealed that she really is a psychotic 20 something escapee from a mental hospital, and every one else is playing along, because she's a serial killer or something.
As for the rest of the staff, Brandon De Wilde does very well for a young --mostly because he really is a young boy.
And the film does manage to get a few points because Ethel Waters is, not surprisingly, wonderful.
For years I thought I had made it up because I could not locate information about it anywhere.
They were only bearable because Shariff is a great actor in the hands of anyone else they would have been a lightening rod for ire.
The film is not character driven because none of the characters are on screen long enough for their personalities to be developed and consequently we can feel no sympathy for their plight.
Our lead characters know more about Jesus and talk more about Jesus than Tammy Faye EVER did, but somehow they aren't worthy because some dude didn't touch their for-head and go "you are saved"?
You will find yourself laughing out loud a lot, but not because of the awesome writing, but because the writing is so bad you can't believe people actually talk this way.
She lays out the Welcome mat on all falling bits and pieces into her eyes because, there isn't anything falling, props forgot to drop stuff from the ceiling, except for an air duct and some lumber but those are too big to fall into your eyes, so Patty opens them up for all the world to see, go Patty GO!.
Heck, he apparently only turned to piracy because his crew gave him the choice of this or death!
I cried watching the movie because of the end, just look the scene when the mother's sleeping in front of the sunset.
Although Selleck is bad, he still delivers the best performance in this film, because the other actors are so incredibly bad -- perhaps with the exception of Nigel Bennet who plays Harrison Pendelton who's good, but unfortunately only on screen for about a minute throughout the whole film.
Fantine is not a prostitute either, because it's bad to promote prostitution as a way to survive when you cannot support your starving child any other way.
And, because everyone has to believe that good things happen to dying people, Valjean goes and fetches a not-so-young-looking Cosette, who is reunited with her not-so-sick-looking mother.
They end up at "The Convent of the Child Mary" because Petit Picpus is too hard to say.
She does it because, well, that's the way it is for women of her generation.
Hang on to your seats because it's a real spoiler.
Very poorly written & directed, I laughed a few times, fast forwarded it a few times and mainly kept watching it because Vincent Gallo kept popping up.
This sets up the whole scene with the bad guys are trying to kill Princess Sira when she's on the barge with unsuccessful results because Ursus is there.
Rented it because I'm a Sophia Loren fan.
I eventually became a Tom Hanks fan after films like "Philadelphia" and "Forrest Gump," but for several years I was leery of anything with him in it, because of this film.
I liked some parts of this film mostly because of its Chicago location shots, But I thought the film's production values were very low budget for a Hollywood film.
The ONLY reason I gave the movie a three out of ten, was because of the good animation on Saphira.
I am currently a film student and i would have volunteered all my time to help them make the movie because apparently they needed all the help they could get.
The belief that just because your movie looks a bit like "Lord of the Rings" it must be good like it, is incorrect.
spellers, good luck in life, because after this movie, i'd be surprised if you were in a hallmark commercial.
I was kind of looking forward to this movie because the book was pretty good but the movie just killed it.
I have not read the books that gave life to this film but I hope it was much better than this because the movie was a letdown.
The writers, director, and producers missed a real opportunity to make this into a great trilogy experience...perhaps they should have read the books first because they were much better than this.
The screenplay is a joke, with major characters missing from the original novel and the acting from almost everybody in the film is down right horrible and that's really because most of the roles are miscast to begin with.
The only performance in the film that has any credibility what so ever is the dragon Saphira and that's mainly because she is voiced by Oscar winning actress Rachel Weisz, who has more talent in her vocal cords than all the actors working in this film combined.
I'm giving it a generous 3 out of 10, just because I feel people should see it for themselves just to see how weird it is.
The reason I say all this is because I couldn't take it seriously and I can't imagine anyone else doing the same, each sequence just goes on & on, really, why does it take 10 verses to describe a man opening a closet door?
this is freaking hilarious for all the reasons it wasn't meant to be funny, because HE thinks it is marvelous.
give it a try- just be prepared to not be able to catch your breath because you'll be laughing so hard.
i'm giving it a "1" for awful because the writer's intent was serious, now if it was a spoof of an opera, that would be a different story.
That said the writing is horrible, mainly because the story doesn't seem to make any sense WHATSOEVER.
If nothing interesting is shown and you care about none of the characters, is a film well made because it looks like it costs a lot?
This movie is very boring and lacks all interest because you cannot identify with the characters.
(which by the way is the LAST thing a killer would leave laying around without washing it off - duh)  It's also unusually sad to leave the cute little son an orphan because of his dad's bad behavior.
He also loses his job because of his obnoxious ways.
The 1926 version is actually pretty good--probably because although the leading man is a jerk, they managed to tone him down a bit and making him less of a loud-mouth.
Hathaway mixes hard-won documentary-style footage with alarmingly transparent studio crap as Hayward wins over natives with her "big magic" (I'm going to ask my GP for some "big magic" the next time I see him) and Mitchum acts like an insensitive oaf over her dead husband, just because she won't immediately sleep with him.
The title escapes me, because the heroine uses an axe (again off screen) but also uses many other devices.
I cannot think for a reason that someone should see this movie, it didn't have a plot ,at least until the middle of it because i left from the cinema at about that time.
I think they wanted to make the movie only because they thought the idea was nifty, but never really did any actual work on writing or reading the script.
I would have given another point for creativity, but I took it back because the movie looked like a cross between The Langourliers and Silent Hill.
I gave it 3 stars because at least it was somewhat original in terms of visuals and had a surprise ending.
We missed out on a good chunk of the movie because of all the fast forwarding we had to do to get through that junk and about 35 minutes in we just shut if off because it was just making us angry.
If the film seems at times to be overly sentimental (even maudlin to some), I think it is because today most people think of that kind of optimism, itself, as overly sentimental.
I wanted to see this movie because I love music and movies about music.
I also wanted to see it because of the star filled cast.
That's because there are no quiet moments--only scenes where practically everyone is talking at the same time and it seemed like they were trying to cram 3000 minutes of film into one movie.
And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop.
It's funny--I have never liked Country music, but I really felt sorry for the people of Nashville because the movie seemed to paint them so poorly--like some sort of freak show.
"Roughly Speaking" is one of the most positive films that came out of Hollywood in the forties because it shows us a determined woman with a great heart who raises above of what life gave her.
I watched this on TV because the digital cable guide listed it as a film "starring Mickey Rourke."
Most of this movie has no bugs at all because it is really a Police Procedural movie with bugs.
You know who the stalker is straight away because of the spoiler-ish movie title.
I picked this up very, very cheap in a bargain bin somewhere (I won't mention the name of the store, but I'm sure you'll figure it out anyway), deciding to give it a chance because of the early appearances of Uma Thurman and Steve Buscemi, as well as one of the few appearances of Paul (older brother of Matt and Kevin) Dillon.
I feel that, even though I really don't want to, I should maybe watch this film again - to maybe see if I missed out any important details or something because from my experience this film has very little to redeem its creation.
The only portions of the film I enjoyed were most of the scenes involving the fat cop (who fancies Kelly) because he actually manages to act unlike the rest of the cast.
I rented this film because it had received great reviews by Norwegian newspapers and so on, 5 and 6 eyes of the dice.
This is all utterly pointless because in the second half, the alien plot is in and Chicken loses his reputation again.
No not me, I like the new films better because they cater to a wider audience, are satiric, and they demand more intelligence from the viewer because archetypes (like heroes, villains) are not as defined.
I thought my endless affection for these modern kinds of animation would mean I would enjoy Chicken Little (2005) - but I was clearly wrong, because this is a barely competent Disney film with very few laughs.
The only thing you need to know is that Chicken Little (voiced by funnyman Zach Braff) is someone who people don't take seriously because of his size.
Keep a look out, because there are also Finding Nemo (lawn-mower) and Signs (corn crop-circles) references.
But the good aspects end here, because the rest is an unfunny overcooked mess.
A pity, because I am the biggest Zach Braff fan there is - I think he is pretty much as funny as you can get, but here he is wasted on a silly overcooked little chicken.
I could not even feel for the poor Chicken Little as his shallow dad was disappointed in him because he was not the great person he himself once was.
It just did not pull me in because that part of the plot was weak.
Probably because the "dad" in this is a self-centered, faithless mook who cares about no one but himself.
It was also mistaken for Franco's DEVIL HUNTER because it basically shares an almost identical kidnappers-stranded-in-cannibal-country premise.
Aside from just two moments of gore (which are recycled from the aforementioned WHITE CANNIBAL QUEEN) and one scene of nudity (provided by Stanford during a hilarious bathing scene where she rapidly tries to scrub her body because she's obviously freezing her ass off outside in the "jungle") this movie is lacking in anything cannibal movie, horror or exploitation fans want to see.
That's because the "jungle" consists of pine trees, a couple of strategically-placed ferns, gravel roads and a snow-covered mountain backdrop to capture that authentic tropical feel.
Maybe lots of those 358.5M are because people couldn't believe that they had made a bad movie about a family that generations have grown with.
The reason for that, is because I think that often the reviews for most movies on this page are pretty fair to the overall score of the movie.
Most of the funny scenes are just funny because "it's an elderly woman wanking off men for money", and to be honest, I think a lot of directors could have pulled it off just as good, because this kind of humour doesn't have to be extremely clever to make people laugh a bit.
There are many times where you will guess EXACTLY what the actors will do because it is clichÃ©, and other times where you will wonder how anyone could make a character act that way in certain situations, since it makes no sense at all.
All in all, I'm glad I'm older now because I can see the errors of my ways, and the errors of others ways as well.
If you're over six, avoid this movie like the plague because its just bad.
Probably because of the script, this movie that starts off nicely, soon turns into a bore for grown ups and hardly a blast for the kids.
All this is unnecessary to the plot , at least I think it is because I`m not sure what the plot is , describing the plot of INVASION EARTH is like describing the plot of a James Bond film , lots of things happen but none of it adds up to much.
The only reason i watched this is because it was a double feature with American Ninja 2, and as i expected American Ninja 3 is crap plain and simple!.
I hesitate to call them prostitute and pimp because that would grossly overstate their actual vocations.
I write "apparently" because I couldn't help but conclude from this film that giving hand-jobs for a living is not all that bad.
The two of them had become friends, but Louisa (D. Gryllus) is unrealistically fired because, apparently, Maggie has taken away all her clients.
I give this movie a one only because laughability isn't a metric for movies.
The film ultimately is about watching Bradley and company mowing down men dressed up because real ninja would have finished them off rather quickly.
There's a good reason why you can buy it for less than $1 on Amazon - because it's really BAD.
Not because Mr. Naschy cannot be taken seriously.
Honestly, I got so bored watching this film, that in the end, the only reason why I didn't leave it incomplete, it's because I wanted to see if something would save it during the last minutes.
I have begun to even avoid its commercials because I still am astonished how its been on TV so long.
I just don't understand how this show was even thought about putting it on air, because its just so bad.
But, of course, things get more complicated, and not only because Maggie develops "penis elbow" and must wear her arm in a sling.
No spoilers here, because your experience is already spoiled from the moment you begin to watch the film.
There can't be an accurate rating for this film because you can't measure a rating that low.
Yes and No...Yes because there was better acting and no because it's 2009 and they still can't seem to get it right.
Also, he wipes out other crime families to be able to do it and is doing it because he wants a better life for his daughter Â if they hadn't repeatedly called him the head of a criminal organization, I might've thought he was just a decent hardworking businessman/superhero.
This man had four aces and traded them away because he didn't understand the basic rules to five card stud.
(I know at least the casting director saw those movies because Lou from MK is Gen) Worse, what the hell was with the fighting scenes.. Where is M. Bison's moves from the game, he does slides in the game, not standard martial arts, and where the hell was his Special MOVE?
Taboo as Vega: OK I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they mad this casting role because this itself screams box office flop.
Did not criticize Michael Clarke Duncan as Balrog because I am a fan of his, but the character in my opinion was pointless in this movie.
And the only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 out of 10 is because of Moon Bloodgood.
At the beginning, yes, because Maggie was squeamish.
But it was entertaining at least, and a lot of the characters were easily recognizable because they actually looked, for the most part, like they did in the games...especially Bison, albeit with much less muscle.
For anyone who knows anything about Street Fighter, set yourself up for disappointment because the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the game.
Take Marvel for example, their world interacts a lot of different marvel characters, but when it comes to their own movie/cartoon, they actually make the story relevant to the characters life(e.g just because Bison was the boss, it doesn't mean that Chun Li's life has to be revolved around killing him (which is what Ryu does)).
Remember - if the message is unclear it might not be because you didn't understand it - sometimes it just isn't there.
okay, how shall I start.. first of all, I like you to know that you should not see this movie because it totally SUCKS!!!
The only reason i rented this movie was because of the cute looking girl on the cover.
I'm not the kind who dislikes movies just because they are unrealistic.. but this is just too much!
I think the main reason why this movie is so awful is because of the direction.
Not because she's a good actress or anything.. but because she's just so damn cute!
Azumi even lacks a comic book atmosphere, because it has a grammar school production atmosphere.
I was accepting of it until Death walks out of the room laughing evilly?because he is going to be human.
But I feel bad for you because there's no chance you'll ever get a job in the acting field again, not that anyone watched this sh*tty show for that matter.
The film transcends into ridiculous cameo performances but fails to make them spark the film into life how they managed to get so many comic actors on board with this script is beyond me because quite frankly the film is just not funny.
For centuries, figures from Vincent Van Gogh to Martin Luther King, Jr. to Michael Jackson have been elevated to greater heights, or have become more appreciated, because they are no longer on this earth.
Although some people loved Sandler during his "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore" days and hate him now, Sandler's still famous because he grew up.
The writing isn't the only bad part, though, the whole thing is done on digital film because (educated guess) it's cheaper.
When asked by my husband how this compared to other Pauly Shore films, I told him that Pauly shore films can't be rated on the same continuum as other movies because they're all so bad that they fail any sort of logistical form of expression.
I, like most probably watched this film because the striking Anna Friel was in it and it was not even worth enduring this awful film to catch sight of her.
Even though Maggies knew job is far from what she expected it to be, she Accepts it because of Olly.
It was in all honestly about the only thing that initially caught my eye about it because had the film taken place in any other time period besides the 70's I might have just happily skipped over it altogether, which would have really been the smarter thing to do in the first place!
Mainly because these two were an exception to some of the self indulgent rockstars and wannabes, Sunset Strip was best when it focused on the relationship of Nick Stahl and John Randolph.
Oakie's character is interesting because he begins as basic comic relief and ends up becoming the moral voice of the film.
I echoed a very positive review for this film when I watched it and completely because I had not seen the Rekha starer Umrao Jaan.
It hence gets a 3 out of 10, 95% of it because of Aishwarya's portrayal.
The brothel is an idealized fantasy place where she can remain loyal to her true love all the while crying her eyes out because life's so unfair.
I thought the movie was extremely dull and boring and I suspect Mrs Rai was crying to some extent because she got trapped in this awful movie by JP Dutta.
I think there is a big problem with this film because it is so much imitating American films.
I really don't believe that this film is good just because it looks like it's from USA.
Perhaps because everybody in the film puts out great performance.
Or, perhaps I missed something obvious because my attention drifted away long before the sudden and seemingly tacked-on denouement?
There is an islander who can't go to China because he is wanted for a murder there.
This story falls flat because the main character, Davy, can't make decisions or do much of anything without adult direction.
I seriously think this should have been rated PG-13, simply because: What kid 12 and under wants to imagine that when they get rid of their imaginary friend by stomping his toy into the ground, the imaginary friend becomes real and gets a bunch of bullet holes in it and bleeds to death in front of the kids eyes?
It almost feels like the writer just went through a divorce and wants everyone to feel as empty as he does because there's nothing amusing or appealing about these last two seasons.
Please for the love of god write something worth watching because this garbage is not even drama.
The very premise of the show, wherein the main eventers were selected because of their 'ability' to carry on training for long periods of time without stopping and taking a break was rubbish because obviously the human body (male or female) can only carry on training for so long before they have to stop for a bit or risk dehydration, spraining ligaments or whatever.
In fact, Doll Face proves the point that most movies, whether made 60 years ago, 30 years ago or last week, are deservedly forgotten because they age so badly.
I was drawn to the movie because of Bening - I enjoy her other films, but this one is a mockery of her talent!
Even though the plot isn't really clear to me (or to anyone, I suppose) it seems to handle about a guy whose actions are controlled by the devil, because there's an ancient curse on his bloodline.
Seriously folks: This review has horrible grammar and structure because the sucktitude (a word I just made up because there is no word in the English language to describe such drivel) has me in a complete fluster.
I consider this merely because the only audience this film seems aimed at are fans of graphically displayed and unabashedly lewd sex acts, yet since this film doesn't quite go the XXX distance, it seems silly that anyone in that demographic would seek this out instead of opting for a purely pornographic offering.
However, this also works against Ursula, because since this is a relatively polished piece of film making, it doesn't even have the unintentional humor of ineptness that gives many trashy movies such as this cult following appeal.
At one point in the movie when Maggie is forced by her son to leave the work, I was longing for Marianne to go back to her profession Â because that had brought her self- dignity and self-esteem.
But, something tells me that Gabrielle wasn't hired for the role because of her ability as a thespian.
Wynorski states on the commentary track that they tore up the first screenplay and reworked it because it was so terrible.
Learn to pick your battles - you can't win this one, because your opinion is irrelevant to them.
Actually, I don't think I've ever rated a movie a 1 before, but that's only because IMDb does not allow a minus or a zero.
In the scene on the pond, it looked like the priest was being attacked by a furry bird, and you could see where the actors were going to walk next because the mike was leading the way.
Which is good because there wasn't that much else that was funny in this movie.
I stayed that long because I thought may be it would get better.
1 star out of 5 and that is only because of RenÃ©e Zellweger.
1/10 i can't say anymore because it hurts me to think about it.
The characters were never introduced and the plot was very uneasy because they weren't introduced.
About the plot, it was uneasy because the film had no emotion.
We couldn't care less about the characters so far in the film, mainly because we lack knowledge concerning them.
Not that it really matters where the problem is brought to our attention, because we don't care about the outcome of any relationship here.
The way the film is portrayed is not funny at all, mainly because after the gimmick is introduced we receive more and more of the same unfunny marital.
She says that this is because it is boring.
I say it is because we care so little and know so little about the characters, we feel tired and slumberous.
I give it a 2 because the photography was OK, though I don't think this is enough reason to make a film of this caliber.
Keira Knightley plays his wife, how they managed to get her to look that plain and that boring I don't know, because she is actually a lovely, interesting, young woman.
Michael Pitt takes insipid to new levels, and Sei Ashina has to put up with a credit as 'The Girl,' probably because they couldn't get away with calling her 'Asian Eye Candy.'
Is it simply that movie stars are unfit parents because they are too wrapped up in themselves?
But, word to the wise, don't watch it expecting good acting and wonderful relevance to the book, because you surely will not get it.
"And if you really want to roll over on the floor and have the mortician come to your house because you died laughing, I would recommend that you watch the whole thing on DVD and with French language (especially the wire hanger sequence).
Even though she was the first runner-up for the New York Film Critics Award, Faye Dunaway disavows her performance as screen icon Joan Crawford because the camp following this 1981 potboiler has developed over the years has probably been overwhelming.
Ever since accidentally buying "Ninja Terminator", I've become somewhat of a fan of Godfrey Ho, because his movies are just so mind blowingly terrible and disjointed they cause hilarity, albeit unintentionally.
It gets 2 stars because a) it didn't let me put in half marks and b) Nothing is as bad as "The Killing Edge".
I can't even say that its worth watching for a laugh, because there's nothing funny about.
I intensely disliked that film because it was implausible, not grounded in any reality, and because even the luminous Jeneane Garafalo couldn't save it.
If you are so desperate to watch this...then count backwards from 5 million and do it while chewing bubblegum and skipping rope, because you will enjoy it ten times more and it will make just as much sense.
Mainly because they don't have enough ideas for a sequel.
That's why I get nervous when I rent a sequel, because I don't know if it's going to be as good as Spider Man 2.
I picked this up for a free rental because I thought it looked cool; that was a mistake.
There is such a thing as "willing suspension of disbelief" and it is splashed around the movie milieu like mud on pigs Â because it NEEDS to be.
Now if you can ignore the silly and racially insensitive casting, you still probably will hate the film because of the horrible writing.
That's because it purports to be a romance between Massai and Nalinle, it's about the least romantic pairing in film history!
I really don't want to write too much regarding this film, a. because I believe the twist is so over hyped and that I pretty much figured it out 30 mins into the film ..  b. I didn't really believe the acting in the film, I'm not saying it was poor, just that me personally don't think that it was realistic decisions made by the main characters throughout the film given the situation.
Maybe this film hits deeply in America because of their fixation with terrorism there.
I watched this film because a colleague recommended it.
(I say presumably because you never really know if she was cured or not, you just see her getting medical attention and being told she can be saved)   Then there's the hole that the main character taped up his entire house, and won't even let his wife in.
This is never explained, because you can't explain it.
I love this movie better than Mask of the Phantasm because being a Batman and Robin fan, I was thrilled that Robin was included in this Direct to Video Release.
This film doesn't add anything to the previous works; worse, in a certain way it can even spoil some of the work done, because it should have had some evolution in order to keep it interesting and funny!
Freeze Subzero because it is a really good movie.
Freeze subzero because it is a great movie.
But i guess it makes sense because it was a low budget movie.
I'm annoyed because I am in a 'New European Cinema' Class where we watch movies from 1970s on from Europe, and two of the kids in my class recommended it and my teacher let us watch it without even watching it herself.
What a waste of class time, especially because there are so many better English movies, it's atrocious that she wasted our time.
With this show, you get the feeling that most of these people are laughing or cheering not because the jokes are funny, but simply because Colbert is playing to their shared discontentment with the Bush administration.
I was hoping that these episodes were churned out because they were using all the good jokes in the movie.
I didn't leave feeling disappointed because I wasn't expecting very much.
Keye Luke plays his sidekick and chauffeur Kato who because of the impending war was changed from Japanese to Korean for this serial.
You know they are inhabited because they all of a sudden speak in a stupid computerized "scary" voice that isn't scary.
Zombies breaking right through windows, then seconds later, being stopped dead in their tracks by another window; zombies jumping at great distances & crawling on the walls and ceilings, but then not being able to reach a few characters peeking through an air duct; zombies' heads exploding because their bodies have caught fire, (WTF???)
I appreciate it because it's elaborate and in such great numbers.
Instead, it is another "for dumb teens only" horror picture that lacks any real scares, is laden with awful clichÃ©s and ultimately fails because it bares the name and thus, seemingly tries to live up to the standards set by the infinitely better "original".
I gave this 2 because of the production value and set.
He stays there because it's the only place his body can survive without his clunky suit.
Also, remember how in zombie films zombies look how they do because they are rotting or because they have been eaten?
There's plenty of gore but I honestly couldn't give a toss because I'd lost interest in the film after 30 minutes and just wanted to watch everyone die.
I think Universal (or whoever had them) sold the rights on....probably because Zack wasn't available and they knew the movie would be crap.
The only reason I gave this horrible excuse of a movie a 1 rating is because "0" wasn't an option.
the gore is very poor indeed and the casting is incredibly poor with Danny Cannon stopping just short of saying fo'shizzle at the end of every sentence because he's a bad ass gangsta pimp army man.
One of the soldiers is infected, turns into a zombie, but they decide to keep him around and drive around with him in the car, because he might be useful.
I'm thinking 3 or 4, mostly because some of the make-up fx are pretty nifty.
The reason this movie sucked royally was not because it didn't have the potential to be a good movie it was mainly casting.
Also, if you want a sure shot at ruining your movie just cast Nick Cannon in any part and he will say ridiculous lines like "by the power or gray skull" or some random curse word when he kills his hundredth zombie because apparently he is a super zombie killer as soon as the outbreak occurs.
Now for the movie itself, i literally feel like the only redeeming factor in the whole film was Mina Servari (excuse spelling if its wrong) because she was the only actor that i believed deserved credit.
I don't blame them for taking the roles because they probably didn't know this crap fest was going to be as bad as it was considering the success of the Zack Synder remake of Dawn of the Dead.
The zombie's in this film must have been bitten by radioactive zombie spiders because they develop powers very similar to spider-man when they turn.
My brother and I laughed out loud as the chaos happened because it was a mockery of any zombie film ever made.
I also want to point out that i very rarely will comment on films because it is almost pointless, but this film was one of the biggest let downs in all of the movies I have ever seen.
I can only assume that people rate it highly because of the significance of Watergate rather than the actual movie.
However, the film attained it's nasty status primarily because of the graphic cover of a hobo being drilled in the head and also because it had a catchy and memorable title which the British tabloids could bandy about whenever they produced an article about the dangers that this new breed of violent films posed to civilisation as we then knew it.
A little more insight into what exactly triggered such a rampage would've been better because, hell, we all have bills but I always thought living with two hot chicks would compensate somewhat...
It is notable because it was the film that ignited the whole "video nastie" brouhaha in Britain.
And at the end, i don't know if this was a glitch of somekind like a bad transfer or something, but after he kills his ex girlfriend's new boyfriend, she begins to call for him because she doesn't know he's dead, and then the screen turns red for about 3 minutes and you can't see a damn thing.
because that confused the crap outta me.
I really don't know, but he shouldn't, because the movie sucks.
I feel really stupid buying this movie on DVD but just so you know, I will sell it as soon as I can because I don't want this movie in my collection.
The film is dubbed even though you can see Jackie talking english, the backgrounds and action scenes are very low quality, and most of all, Jackie Chan shows us once again that his humor gets old all because of his lack of acting skills.
This portion of the film is actually pretty sweet, as he works so hard to keep her alive--it's quite touching,...though once again, I had to remind myself that he IS a stalker and traveled a couple thousand miles into a war zone because of his bizarre obsession.
but beside these negative points i've made, the tiger and the snow is not a weak movie at all.it has a good sense of humor and is a drama in respect of post-war Baghdad .I really admire Benigni because of his style that tends to add up comedy and fantasy with human subjects.it's a simple story of a childish love to a woman that strangely begins in Italy and keeps on, in Iraq.but this romantic story can't be a lovely and memorable love story like great romances, because Benigni is very far from the character of a importunate lover, he is much more believable in the role of a kind father in the film like his character in the life is beautiful,his best movie.
I'll admit, I downloaded this movie purely because Liv Tyler was in it.
I gave it 3/10, just because of the fact that liv tyler appeared in her underwear, and that you get to see rene zellweger in skimpy clothing, but that was being liberal.
I saw it because of the good comments it received here.
I say this, because the only moments in the film that I can recall are the entirely negative aspects.
It doesn't work as an inspirational coming-of-age story not just because the two characters are already OF age, but because we don't like the two main characters!
It doesn't work as a comedy because nothing is funny, it's just sad.
I sat through this movie because I rented it from Netflix.
I feel this is all the plot exposition this film deserves, because Step Brothers is more about a series of failed gags and profanity for profanity's sake.
It serves no function whatsoever except to show Will Farrell's testicles because Farrell, who co-wrote the script with director Adam McKay, thinks it is funny.
I'd be liar if I said the film was devoid of any laughs, because it does deliver some, but they just feel cheap, coming solely from Ferrell or Reilly's tone of voice or facial expressions, and not from good writing.
I'm also a sucker for randomness, and it succeeded at making me crack a smile a few times because of it.
If you find yourself tiring of Ferrell with each release, then save yourself some time and skip it, because "Step Brothers" will probably be the film that'll break the camel's back.
This is the kind of movie that makes this exercise of writing up every feature I see kind of redundant, because it's not much of a movie.
The subject could have been endlessly interesting, not because of the man himself, but because of the musical revolution he instigated.
Shame really because it queers the pitch for someone else who may want to do the job properly.
It really is unfortunate, because he seems like an incredibly intriguing & intelligent person, but is presented in such an uninteresting way that seems to indicate that the director not only doesn't really care about him, but doesn't really care much about music in general.
This film was shown here with the title "Metal Force - Apokalypse in L.A.", so I did not expect a Knight Rider film, which was good, because it is not one.
Just to clarify the above statement quote"Michael Knight's evil twin brother Garth"   Michael Knight is in no way related to Garth because Michael Knight is an alias created by Garths father(cant remember full name) for Michael Long.
There is no doubt that more people would be interested in watching this film simply because of the title.
It was a bit like destroying your life with drugs and alcohol because someone had a better senior prom dress.
When her futuristic lover turns up, she's unable to listen to him trying to explain his situation because she's just too thick to understand anything much of what he's talking about.
She must have been crying at the end because her agent couldn't get her a better movie to be in.
Yes, there's violence because he goes on a shooting spree and kills many people.
because the characters were so vapid, even watching them get killed didn't interest me.
Not because she's a good actress you understand, but because her role as the comic relief slapstick foil backfires spectacularly as she becomes one of the most irritating screen heroines to appear in the Hong Kong Legends catalogue.
I much prefer Blue Velvet, maybe because it was new and shocking and original, whereas here Lynch seems to be copying himself, Nic Cage seems to be doing his faux-Elvis 'look at me all the time" schtick and Laura Dern just seems lost.
The acting is mediocre, which is worse than bad in the case of a film like this, because I can't be impressed by the acting, nor can I laugh at it.
Meanwhile, may this documentary based on an attack on his person remind us that we cannot save everyone because that is why it takes a Michael Moore to awaken those who can't find the light switch on their own.
In this entire film Wilson comes up with one original tool for propaganda- he shows himself deceiving someone (very lightly, because he isn't the bad guy here) - him and the producer then have a ridiculous moral conflict about the action - then they show Wilson realizing his mistake and apologizing to the camera.
Suburbs are happy, filled with black loving grandma's who feel safe all the time - towns where the infrastructure is ruined are still okay because the American dream lives on in a boy who makes coffee.
I also like horror movies but that's not because I think psycho-killers should murder people.
At a point I could almost see him crying off camera because Moore doesn't return his calls.
If people are going to get mad because things are shown that wasn't supposed to be?
Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble.
By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius.
This film, originally titled Outer Touch but now called by its American title, Spaced Out, is getting a bit of a cult following though why this should be is a bit of a mystery because it isn't really that good.
The "acting" (and I put that word in quotes because I'm not sure it's appropriate to call what these people are doing "acting") is abysmal.
In other words, Muslims come with guns and knives, raiding and killing, because they love Black people and want to take Black people into their families.
With that being said, the film is totally unforgettable, not just because it's so wonderfully bad but because there are some truly effective moments in it.
Just because it dares to try something a little different if for no other reason, it doesn't always succeed but at least those involved tried.
Never mind that, French threatens to use the cannon to level the town because he was smart enough to bring powder and shot and has in James Sikking one of Stonewall Jackson's old artillery men.
It's obvious that, as I referenced in my summary line above, approximately 99.99% of the budget went toward special effects because the film does not contain a single competent acting performance.
The agents are involved in this case because of a contrived reason.
Skinner says it's because of Ephesian's paranormal abilities.
Next thing that really bugs me is how much Scully is against trying to get information from Melissa/Sidney/whatever just because Mulder believes her personalities are past lives.
I did watch the deleted scenes where she acts out a couple more personalities that were actually pretty humorous and its too bad they cut them out because they could have boosted the episodes quality.
Its really too bad because I don't think its his acting that's the problem but it seems that way because of the terrible writing.
As I watch I find myself wanting to like this episode but just can't because of the poor writing and trying to force the explanation onto the viewer without letting them come to their own conclusion.
Johnny arrives at the warehouse and fights one (1) zombie and wins, because then Evil Eddie's voice can growl out of the shadows in an amused tone, 'Your kung-fu is impressive', so the viewers can quake with fear at how powerful Evil Eddie must be.
The whole town returns to normal, and business thrives because of the publicity.
This movie felt like it had been completely recut at some point, because it didn't even make any sense.
The only reason we stuck around the whole time was because we'd sat through it for so long that we couldn't get our $9.25 back if we left.
As for Trent Ford...I'm not going to discuss his looks other than in this statement, because I don't think criticizing an actors appearance does any good.
One can only hope that if Mandy Moore wishes to be taken seriously as an actress, she'll accept a better script next time, because she's not a terrible actress.
First of all I wouldn't bother spelling the title because for 1 thing I don't actually know how to spell it; "Surburben Girl?"
Writer Melissa Bank has been compared to Helen Fielding (the author of Bridget Jones' Diary) because of her skillful and funny portrayal of the challenges and problems modern women face.Her short story collection The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing received very good reviews and it was immediately acquired for being taken to the big screen.Unfortunately,at the difference of Fielding,Bank did not have any luck for finding a screenwriter who would effectively translate her "voice" to a movie.Suburban Girl is a truly tedious romantic comedy.
This movie is an absolutely insipid combination of Sex and the City and Bridget Jones' Diary which has absolutely uninteresting characters.Besides,Mark Klein's direction is horrible because the movie completely lacks of any style,rhythm or natural flow of scenes.
This movie rates a whopping 3 stars because I like SMG.
Perhaps that was because there was no story.
I watched this movie because I thought I'd get some of the Asian-style action movies that I like, or maybe an interesting story based on the what-if situation described in the tag-line.
Another thing is that the beginning is quite interesting - so you watch the movie because maybe it starts again to be interesting - and so you watch till the end.
But since its sci-fi, I can't go into much detail because at the end it's just not real even though some sci-fi films seem more believable than this.
In the end we know he's been transformed because he draws a life-like sketch of a handicapped child instead of doodling one of his refrigerator-art comics about how he longs to be a kid again.
There was a bit of controversy while the film was being shot here--Hopkins HATED working with Derek because she refused to rehearse.
The hysterical thing about this movie is that, according to the director, it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them that viewed it couldn't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst.
I try to watch it once a year because it brings back long-forgotten memories of what it was like to ask for your first date, the awkwardness of the first kiss, and the whole new dimension of relating to the opposite sex.
The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.But this is not a movie.Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC* with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music says "...I will pray".The thing is not about religion actually.But it ends up with this.How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.The lights are already shining on the truth.Its just that nobody wants to see it.
I won't spoil the ending, because I was too confused by the uneven plot to know what happened (I also stopped paying attention mid-way through.
It is difficult for me to give an anime a low rating because I like the genre very much but this movie deserves a 2/10 at most.
I started watching it because I believed the slugline on the DVD box, that it was a sequel to NINJA SCROLL, which of course isn't true.
I had to watch the whole thing, because I had to see how it ended.
Its films like this that make me hate Al Adamson films because they are such patchwork messes with new and old footage mingling freely.
Had that film been released (it couldn't get released because it had no stars) I'm pretty certain that it would have had a nice reputation and Adamson might have gone on not to be a hack.
That's because this master of the super-super cheap drive-in film found a way to make this film even cheaper and cheesier than the rest--he took apart an older film he made (PSYCHO A GO-GO) and pieced it together with some new scenes to make an entirely new film!!
Only because this movie hasn't graced MST3K, has it not received attention as the worst of all time.
It's bad enough when a movie "seems"to drag on because it's so bad.
Likewise, that the nerdy nebbish (Woody Allen without the fixation on the adopted children of his mate) gay guy -- who, unfortunately for him, was ten years ahead of the gay geek hotness era we find ourselves in -- and in any event, hot gay geeks are not Broadway musical fans much less piano players, would be in love (in classic Hollywood romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s fashion) with the gay hunk best pal and, ultimately, the hunk would (for no reason at all, without any real basis, after turning him down because the neb was clearly not the hunk's type, and after lusting in love with a guy who's only real thing in common with the neb is that they both have a musical background?
You might as well say that the hunk fell in love with them because they both breath air.
It's not a great film because it has little to offer, and it blends in with all the others.
I say "supposedly" because when he saw what they did to his book, King demanded his name be removed from any association of this film!
Actually, maybe he shouldn't because it's not that bad a premise.
Jobe has become a genius, he has a hot blond girlfriend who loves him, can now read minds, has the telekinesis ability, and he is angry because some guy called him retarded?
I'm giving it a 2 only because some of the guys were handsome, some of the acting was good and the climatic match was exciting.
The telling subtitle, 'Are you gay because you're not a real man, or are you gay because you wish you were a woman' (to that effect) is the crux of the movie.
Only because I couldn't bear to waste another hour or more on it.
Like how ** SPOILER WARNING** Anck-su-namun would leave her beloved because she is afraid of a little raining stone!
Mostly because of the lack of it.
Then, because the film makers ran out of ideas (not that they had any to begin with), they pull an Irwin Allen, and have a volcano erupt!
Just because you are gay and watching a film about gay men and/or women does not mean you have to abide by some unwritten rule forcing you to say that it's good.
The horribly conceived "it's time to grow up" moment in question though is when Sam (Shane Powers), a friend of Jacksons, kills himself because he's also secretly in love with him!
This factor cannot be attributed to watching a pan-and-scan version because, surprisingly enough, the film was being shown in the correct widescreen ratio.
More's the pity here because if Say It With Songs had been a hit Jolson might have abandoned the burnt cork and his historic reputation wouldn't have suffered so.
Jolie gets one of the earliest paroles in penal history, even for what probably is a manslaughter 2 conviction because little Davey Lee ages not a bit.
I wouldn't attack the plot too much because after all it is called 'Ghostboat' and so you expect it to be a little far fetched/supernatural so that's fine BUT... at the end when the Navy and the Russian Navy (or whatever they're called in Russia) closed the case on the strange goings on, there was no mention of and never any mention of, all the other boats they blew up along the way...and as for the hostile German aircrafts...well I can only assume that they were imagined?
MP, the man & the character in the film, was a loser from Day 1, who whined to be spared punishment for his sins because he was an artiste.
PROJECT X is seriously outdated because of the FX and the boring and cheap production values, which makes this movie look like a standard 1960s TV movie.
A lousy script about 3 guys who want to commit suicide because there not happy with married life (how realistic and funny).
I would of given this a 0/10, but because of the girls a 2/10.
the only reason i was laughing in the theatre was because i was laughing at the actors but not with them.
No one seems to realise that the reason that most of these flicks have vanished in the first place is because they were so jaw-smashingly rubbish that they didn't shift first time around.
But they still sell on ebay for prices that range from $50 Â to as much as a staggering $120 a pop, just because they've become as rare as a teddy boy's quiff.
The sound is no less than pathetic; and because this was shot only on a camcorder, the Casio keyboard-type score cannot be played at the same time as the dialogue.
I won't mention the performances because basically there aren't enough slanderous words in the dictionary to do them justice.
If you do manage to find a version available somewhere, then don't spend too much of your hard earned cash, because I'm telling you it's just not worth it.
And worst of all everything fell into place in the end which is really make it soooo irritating (because everything fell too perfectly).
OK, right, maybe it is just because you need 90 minutes of film and only have material for 80.
While some of Alpha's films are great because they aren't available elsewhere, too often they are grainy and never have captions.
Simply put, this show is a waste because apart from there being no good within any of the characters in the show, it seems to bring absolutely nothing to the table.
Zim only got where he is in the story lines because he was a pest to the race's leaders.
A wife is suffering because she is nearly an empty nester.
But in this awful movie, the wife is just pleased as punch that she gets to spend the rest of her life with a mentally challenged man, because he was kind of a jerk before he was shot, so you see, he and everybody else is better off because he was shot in the head and made retarded, the wife gets faithful husband, and the kids get the little brother they always wanted.
I bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic TV show.
), the glamorous stewardess (a pre-Charlie Angels Farah Fawcett-Majors), the guy who has a heart attack but refuses to be treated by the only doctor on board because he blames him for his wife's death, the practical joke-playing precocious kid (Danny Bonaduce from The Partridge family) and the harassed ground staff including the airport manager with an air disaster AND toothache to deal with, and the psychologist bought in to give a profile of the passengers who gets more and more unconvincingly disheveled as the movie proceeds (see Lloyd Bridges in Airplane!).
Without giving too much away the most jaw-dropping moments are the corny dialogue between the Captain and the cabin staff (all two of 'em), the sequence where it's revealed that the priest is an imposter because he's wearing nail polish (nail polish?)
I probably could of wrote this review without seeing the movie because of the formula for this sort of the movie is the same the players just change.
But for me because of the laziness of the script and the absolutely appalling acting from the lead the movie was barely watchable.
My dislike with the movie is because it was just a big music video with a generic script wrapped around it.
the reason this movie got bad reviews on here is because it's a cookie cutter film, not because we dislike christians.
It was also flatly directed, attempting some form of style (no wonder it's Phil Alden Robinson's first film in ten years), which only managed to irritate, and STILL that American anti-smoking message gets through, because, as this film wants you to believe, only neo-fascists who kill innocent people smoke.
This is a really bad film, which is a pity because they could have done so much better - even with Affleck.
In the novel, Islamic terrorists were the bad guys, which makes sense since they don't care if they live or die and because the Middle East would be relatively unaffected by a nuclear war between Russia and the US.
The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by military analysts because of reflection of the snow, and other factors.
Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb, and the tank battle that the German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin.
And that's a big problem because we feel detached from it and, thus, don't feel it is as sharp, timely and intense as Clancy meant it to be.
The reason that movies like "Fail Safe" and "Dr. Strangelove" were so brilliant is because they were gutsy enough to take on the public's fears directly.
(Harrison Ford would have been terrific again) Of course a scene aboard Air Force One is more eye candy that a President trapped on Camp David because of a storm and a damaged helicopter.

You'll just have to see it yourself - it's prime material for a Mystery Science Theater-style evening at home with friends and a drink or seven, and not just because you need alcohol to dull the pain of witnessing the black hole where comedy dies in terrible pain.
i personally wanted to watch it because i like tattoos and im into horror movies and supposedly The Tattooist was classified as horror movies,so 2 things i like grabbed my attention about this movie so i was certain its going to be very good BUT the only thing was good about this movie is to learn never have high hopes about any movie by just reading the title :)
In an idyllic Scottish village, poor collie dog Lassie fails at sheepherding because she's afraid of crossing through water; a crusty old doc inherits Lassie, but he doesn't much want her either, even after she warns him of a collapsed bridge down the road.
I say, "at least" because this Lassie film was a huge disappointment.
I mention this because it's odd for them to have done that, as it's clearly established later that the victims DIE after being drained of blood.
The Evil Queen wants to destroy Snow White because her mirror reminds her that she is the fairest of the fair and the Queen refuses to be upstaged.

I watched this movie years ago only because it aired on USA's "Up All Night".
He was taking away the title (because I had gotten such great publicity, including PEOPLE magazine), and keeping only half of what I shot.
Thus my story about girl who offed scum bags just because they knew they could...now became a story about girls who were abused, etc and so on.
Ekberg has her doubts because she finds herself acting in bizarre ways.
The rest of the cast is interesting but, apart from Paola Morra Â who, perhaps not to give the game away too early, effectively underplays her role as Ekberg's devoted 'room-mate' (incidentally, she would don the habit again that same year for Walerian Borowczyk's BEHIND CONVENT WALLS), clearly operating below-par: Joe Dallessandro (completely out of his element as a young doctor whom Morra effortlessly manages to keep in check at the climax Â if you get my drift), Alida Valli (literally phoning in her performance as the Mother Superior), Lou Castel (as a nosy crippled patient) and Massimo Serato (as the irascible elder doctor who, however, continually cuts Ekberg's clumsiness some slack because she was the most valuable assistant he ever had!).
None of the other actors deliver anything more than dull-eyed recitations of their bad lines, which makes me wonder: Are these actors all this bad, really, or are they this bad only because the script sucks so completely?
If you're not a Bean freak--avoid, avoid, avoid, because minus Bean, this has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it.
And the second one is even worse, you see almost no emotion in the leading role called george, it's like he studied the first movie (John Travolta), and is trying to act like John Travolta, almost like a robot, because i totally mis the emotion in his words and face.
That's because at least he wasn't an irritant--like his co-stars.
I love made for TV movies like this because it portrays a special blend of mindless cheesiness found only in 70s and early 80s TV plots that are pretty much extinct today.
Have no doubts, this show sucks, but its entertaining because it's so corny and unbelievably minimal in content.
Rodman should stick to basketball and the freak show, because he can not act.
I won't say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen, because I have seen BloodSuckers (Michael Ironsides) and DogSoliders.
That alone should be enough to turn most people away, but because I'm Mr. "Open To All Movies", I put in the video and watched it anyway.
But because Rodman was the "star" and didn't want to be upstaged up by his "co-stars", a way had to be found to bring him into this action.
Perhaps because he's almost restrained, the makers of this have decided to bypass intelligent character or plot development (a fact given away by its grammar-savvy title) and packed it with common-denominator bits that are dime-store quality even by the action genre's sorry standards.
I won't waste any more time explaining the plot because it couldn't have taken more than a few seconds to write it.
I mean, at one point Nick, the "good friend" of Simon Sez, has a gun in his hand, and loses it because he is making fun of the "bad girl" by playing a tyrannosaur.
This is the kind of comedy that you don't laugh at because it's funny, you laugh at it because it's so unredeemable and idiotic you literally can't believe it.
This reeked of a bomb, yet I had to watch it because Dennis Rodman movies always provide that so bad it's good theme going for them.
This was the worst out of the 3 legitimate movies he was in ("Double Team" and "Cutaway" were slightly better because they either had better actors in it to somewhat make up for the loss or at least fairly suitable dialog).
Rodman lets himself fall down a long column, while he holds himself onto it with his legs, because he needs his arms for shooting.
The classic bad movie "Double Team" was funny because van Damme was so damn serious all the time (not to mention Mickey Rourke).
I'm not sure whether to give it a 6 or 7, I think I'll give it 7 just because I genuinely think the filmmakers tried & it's generally good fun.
Don't look for anything more, because there isn't anything.
I`m surprised the scene wasn`t reshot because the microphone is so obvious it`s impossible not to notice it .
Seriously I`m certain he has because the sound mix after this scene is all over the place , when someone speaks the volume of their voice increases/decreases from shot to shot and there`s also plenty of scenes with obvious overdubbing , and not to mention bizarre background noises .
Not because he's a relentless one-man killing squad, of course, but because he's the living proof that you can still chase your dreams and realize your ambitions even if you're physically disabledÂ Yeah right, enough with this rubbish!
), everyone fears and obeys Mr. No Legs because he's merciless, is an expert in martial arts and drives around in a heavily armored wheelchair.
It is deffo frisby material but before you wang it out of the window it is worth one watch because you don't want to miss out on : What is going on with Bolo?
This made me laugh aloud, because it was such a badly done scene.
It's so funny, and its sad because it probably wasn't meant to be funny.
It's ashame because Lori Loughlin is a good actress and this will surely fall into the clichÃ© pit falls with this terrible vehicle.
It also succeeds because the story is played completely straight without any sort of schlock regarding No Legs: If it had been a smarmy tongue in cheek parodic or satiric attempt to get laughs it would have fallen flat.
9/10: I could see Mondo Macabro picking this one up, they have shown a willingness to present movies on DVD that other companies would never dare bother with, and I for one would love to see a re-release just because I know how many stupid Liberal idiots would protest it.
The plot revolves around a money hungry virus-vaccine producer who decides to make the virus first, put it airborne then make millions on the vaccine that he was ready to put out on the market because he knew their would be a need for it.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
Which is a shame really, because the movie just really blows.
Apparently in real life they got married eventually, but the characters in this movie could never have gotten married in more than a postscript, because they were just too ingenuine, and the movie omits any moments that could have explained why on earth they ever got together in the first place.
Bravo to the young actors that played Wes and Mac because they made it possible for me to finish this movie without gorging my eyes out.
They should have given her something more to her story and some more lines because she is one funny woman and I'm sure it would have improved it some.
Rebound doesn't really have characters; there are just static, singularly-painted figures that we can't root for because it follows every sports film clichÃ© in the book, meaning the audience knows in the first five minutes how everything will turn out before the characters even get there.
I will admit that the actors and actresses in this film seemed very talented, but because of the absent values of the film, didn't have a good outlet for their craft.
Most Hollywood movies only get a bad treatment just because they are made in Hollywood.
I can't give Rebound more than two stars, not because it was necessarily bad, but because it was painfully predictable.
The audience laughs because she's a girl!
There is no excuse for showing dull and naive movies only because "it's for the children"...
Speaking of, The Fly II might as well be considered a Dead Dickweed Movie, because almost none of the characters are fleshed out beyond being a bunch of absolute wads, and we have to put up with them for over an hour before the main character transforms into a fly and offs them.
My girlfriend dragged me to this movie because it was her turn to pick.
Sean's friend lets him go because of some stupid fake kidnapping plot?
I'm trying very hard not to take it personal that these kind of movies get made, because they're a downright insult to the public and solely made for the purpose of making money and making it big.
This is then interspersed with over the top acting and characters that it is hard to give any care for because of how cold they seem.
...But then, I had to buy it because of my name in the credits.
My mom says it's "Obscenely Insipid" I'm making everyone watch this movie, because it's so painful.
Also, when they figure out that the terrorists will next target Ron Silver (because of a certain bill that he sponsored), Brosnan goes over to his house - but instead of questioning Silver about who might be against this bill, who might want him dead, he just yells at him to stay away from his wife.
I say "seems" because it also seems that it's hard to tell what race people are supposed to be in this because they keep changing.
You can tell you are almost at the end of the movie because they run out of actors to kill off.
Of course, he sees the zombies on the Island and no-one believes him initially because he's just a servant.
The complications in the plot really don't help the movie because it moves at such a slow pace and even the zombies are pretty ho-hum.
We're given no credible reason whatever why Shirley stays with him, and when she seeks work as a dancer at her former place of employment it seems like a smart survival tactic, but this is where the story's true thesis kicks in: John is now the parasite because he's living off his wife's earnings.
That's because unlike other musicals, the songs were almost operatic in style and high-pitched warbling abounded.
Naturally, I would hate this movie, because Eddward Furlong is in it.
OK I'm 15 and i saw this movie one night after band.................i thought it was the worst possible thing ever i mean i have seen SO....many movies because my family are movie freaks so ya.......There was no music thats was it sounded like all together, the scenes were god awful and the whole movie was all together fake looking and u can tell it basically looks like a slide show thats animated and was photo shopped it was a disaster.
Not because it is too scary or whatever, but just because it is a pure waste of your time!
But the character played by the great Clancy Brown (Blue Steel, Highlander) is funny to watch and pretty effective "dead" man..But I can't recommend this to anyone real horror fanatic because most of the time, this is stupid and boring.
By the way, my fictional nation considers this as the most controversial movie, because it's disrespecting!
There is simply hardly any suspense in this (probably because the screenplay wasn't written by Stephen King, as it was the case in the first movie), and many scenes that are meant to be creepy are, if anything, more funny than scary.
I enjoyed the first "Pet Sematary" and rented this because I wanted some cheesy entertainment.
Clearly he was cast because of his participation in "Terminator 2."
The gore is stepped up a bit from the original, but this is because there are more flesh-eating dead people walking around this time.
Like everyone says, last 10 minutes are little gory, not really anything else 'bloody' in the movie (unless you count those nasty boils on his back :P)I too have seen the original Freaks, and I would not even compare them because...well...you just can't...the original was a cult classic, this one is no where near that.
That's why it was banned from 43 countries, because the countries would have to pay you to see the movie!
I don't particularly like scary movies, and this is a perfect example of why, because they're stupid, but I wanted to see this because I do like the original Freaks.
I forced myself to not be grossed out by the last 10 minutes because I didn't want to give the makers the satisfaction of achieving that from me for this stupid movie, which had the potential to be a lot more.
And the acting was bad.Terribly bad.And I'm not even sure this movie had a script as many of the actors seemed to fumble for their words.Or maybe the budget was so tight that re shots weren't allowed?The freaks themselves weren't really all that freaky except for the one that looked like a miniature version of the Toxic Avenger.Special effects were minimal,little bit of gore near the end but for the most part this movie was just people doing mostly talking.A couple of women showed their breasts but they were small and uninspiring.I think I gave it a 3 mostly because of the breasts because really this movie was probably a 1 or 2 at best.
Suffice it to say that the reason the film had no production values to speak of was because they had spent all of their money on the special effects for the last 10 gut-wrenching minutes.
It will not please any of your senses, because anything "positive" from this film has already been done.
or that andie would quit her job or even the story because of how she feels (even though she hated it anyway).
obviously he HATED when she did it originally, but because she was genuine he wound up missing her.
This is simply not a movie I am extremely broad minded when it comes to films and I adore low budget movies because it enhances the meaning of art behind the process of film making.
The original Freaks movie was great because it had all those genuine circus freaks in it and was very controversial at the time of conservative film making.
I was dumb enough to rent this movie just because it said that on the cover and I wish I had paid more attention and realized they didn't say where this quote came from.
Immediately I was drawn to it because the cover art states "Banned in 43 Countries"!
Matthew McConaughey really surprised me because he has played this role before without conviction.
The film "Manticore", for example was low budget but it did stand up because the acting was good.
Which I count as a good thing because that's what your going for in a spoof/parody.
As I mentioned before, Elvis was the only good one because I could see Elvis doing the "look out man!"
And that's sad, because apart from being the first "talkie", the JAZZ SINGER is a very clichÃ©d and old fashioned film.
At one point, Lee J. Cobb yells at his son-in-law because he was slapping his wife in public--"you do that in the privacy of your own home" he explains.
This was the highest-rated finale because people wanted to see the train wreck.
No need to issue a spoiler here, because anyone watching this movie should be thoroughly dis-interested in the ending.
Also, every animal they meet has lost their mother so every animal they meet gets depressed because they have no mother.
This is especially unforgivable because the actual events were more interesting that the contrived garbage shown in the movie; these were portrayed a little more accurately in "The Long Riders", a better film.
They justify robbing the bank because the amnesty vote was blocked by a Pinkerton bribe.
At the town's baseball game,the Northfield team wins because Cole Younger blasts the ball to smithereens with his rifle.Younger(calling himself "Mr. King")and Wilcox "converse" over "King's" nearly being robber,and how he wants to protect his money in a safe bank.
Back in town Younger encounters a wild-eyed,incoherent individual, "Crazy" Gustavson(Royal Dano).He is insane because his son never returned from the Civil War.
The only thing I did appreciate was Duvall's and Robertson's performances, but unfortunately neither warranted any type of awards because of the low budget antics of the screenplay.
After the horrid reviews, I had low expectations but still -this movie is so predictable, so false, so by the numbers that it just unfolds because it has to.
I must be in the minority because I find Kate Hudson so irritating and an awful actress.
Maybe for some, for me I was happy only because this insipid tripe was actually ENDING.
This movie was encouraged to be filmed at the time because Irwin Allen still had one film left on his contract to be directed and the film studio wanted to get their money's worth while they could.
Somehow Â presumably very large cheques and a promise not to direct Â Allen was able to tempt Towering Inferno stars Paul Newman and William Holden back to play more or less the same roles, which is handy because the film is more or less a rehash, even shamelessly recycling a couple of setpieces to infinitely diminished effect.
The suspense element of the film fails also, because it takes way too long to get going and is thoroughly predictable once it finally kicks into gear.
Oil is unlikely to be found near a volcano, active or dormant, and you wouldn't drill near a volcano, because the release of pressure would cause the volcano to erupt.
If a fissure like that opened up, the volcano would simply erupt because the pressure forcing the magma up would be greater than the pressure holding it down.
while the four Harvard roommates sit around wiping away their tears because they don't have anything better to do.
I gave this movie a 3 because yes, it does suck, BUT you could do worse in the horror genre.
If my description sounds vague, it's because, as an average lay person, i found this movie very hard to understand, i could not follow 3 hours of philosophical expounding, in French no less.
The plot is pretty wacky, though it could have made for an enjoyably ludicrous film if handled with a bit more verve (see The Lost Continent for a film which had an outrageous storyline, but worked OK because the makers had the courage to stand by their own absurdities).
I wouldn't spend the two hours of viewing time to sit through this again because it seem's to have been directed by someone with the emotions of granite.
Pity because it's so pretty and romantic in a visual sense.
Don't blame the British just because the film is slow and boring!
(***) The director should be banned from making films until he learns the rule; show don't tell - or at the very least do not show *and* tell, because that just insults your audience.
I was let down because I like the whole time travel concepts in films.
My first reaction to the dual title was that this writer is so self absorbed that he couldn't decide on ONE movie title, because he simply admires every idea he has, so he simply *had* to call it both!
I hope this helps someone, I write this because if I had read this, I would have saved my evening!
I suggest that everyone should see this movie because it really is funny.
This may be because of the negative stigma that often goes hand-in-hand with the Bra Boys.
It may be because I don't understand much of Japan/Korea history, but I generally appreciate Japanese movies (from Kitano's to Kurosawa).
There are some sexual scenes that are very hard to see, mostly because they are quite repetitive and don't make the story move.
In my eyes Yoichi Sai is a bad director because he hasn't put his heart into something that could have been a fascinating movie.
You'd expect the cheesy latest-tech graphics in Hercules or Xena because they're spoofs, but this $$$ movie ended up like Legend of Zu ... graphics fluff.
Adventure is mediocre at best because it does not make any sense.
Whoever wrote this script needs to get their brains rewired because anyone will puke at the sight of any of the romantic interactions.
Yeah leave this one for the last because they are all dry.
The picture seems so aimless because, having set up the basic situation, it is just marking time until the thwarting of the rocket launch and the final revelation.
Three stars because it's probably the best job they could have done with it at the time -- sad to say.
When a comedic movie falls into the same category, it is almost impossible to make sport of it Â because any frivolity in the review may be misconstrued as comedic quality that the MOVIE possesses.
I'm sure they had lots of fun making the movie because they look like they're having fun but it struck me as schlock.
The ending gave me the feeling that it was left wide open for a sequel because you get no feeling for what happened to the house.
It reminded me in a very small way of The Shining, but just because you liked that one doesn't mean you will this garbage.
It's called a Lifetime movie because it takes a lifetime to watch... For a "based on a true story" movie, it was ridiculously unrealistic.
Clearly the lesson remains: 'give us what we want' because the alternative is just too horrifying.
In fact, this is one of those movies that's hard to turn away from because the awfulness is so compelling -- this is a movie with serious Oscar pretensions that comes up short in so many ways.
Putting freshly-scrubbed Sissy Spacek in the role as 'the other woman' doesn't really sit right with us because, basically, it's tough to swallow Spacek as the proverbial homewrecker.
The main reason why "Red Heat" isn't very popular or even commonly known among exploitation fanatics is probably because the script aspires to be overly ambitious and politically engaging.
I think it's because when you look up the title of the movie, it comes up with 3 different ones... the title was too common and overused!
It goes to show how confusing the plot was because I completely missed that element!
1 out of 10, and only because the numbers go no lower than 1.
We are then reassured by the writers - through text that constantly and randomly appears on the screen in the middle of conversations - that she will not die because this movie is sort of a comedy.
His lover, Gil (Sutcliffe), had given his sperm to their lesbian friends Pam (Dern) and Diane (Clarke) because they wanted a baby.
Charley is almost certain that the couple is lying because they don't want to share their child with them.
In the third story, freeloader Jude (Gyllenhaal) buddies up to Otis (Ritter) because she found out his dad is filthy rich.
This lack of comedy-mood-setting music is devastating because this story is not inherently funny, and the only member of the cast that has a sense of comedy (or really has any funny lines) is Tom Noonan.
Noonan is a little more restrained than usual, although he still seems very hammy because his role is in such stark contrast to the rest of the cast.
with stars in her eyes, though the sex never happens because this is hermetically-sealed 1956 and, of course, people didn't do such things.
The main character makes a smart remark about the paper, and another guy walks up says 'Yeah I stopped subscribing because they keep running the same article.'
I admit it, I rented this film because Billy Campbell is in it, but it was a disappointment.
I thought this miniseries was an excellent because it shows how much the judicial system can be corrupt.
Alex, whom we later learn is a sailor who jumped ship, because of some trouble he is already in back in the states, hunts up Felix.
this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy.
The maniac is apparently in the mental hospital because years earlier he took a group of folks into the desert and allowed them to die due to exposure--a slow, lingering death.
Overall, this is a wonderful example of a decent idea for a movie that was totally botched because the film makers were apparently squirrels.
i feel sorry for the family because they had to go through all this the courts, wondering if the Taylor's were going to take the daughter and sisters baby but they didn't get to.
In 1975, Navajo Indian Calvin Duggai (Sonny Landham) deliberately abandoned five men to die in the desert because of an argument involving tribal rivalry and the powers of Indian witchcraft.
The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement.
I cant give any spoilers here because the movie never came me a plot.
I personally found the music and singers horrid(..but that's because I'm not exactly a fan of musicals, especially with a cast who can not sing)and the characters overbearing.
There is no real sense of danger or fear because the lackey who plays the "ghost" is ridiculous.
It's largely because of this stereotypical characterization that this cartoon is banned and in this case, I don't blame them.
I have recently enjoyed watching some cartoons that have been pulled from circulation because they offend modern sensibilities.
I paid $20 to purchase it, along with parts 3 and 4 ($20 for each)) on a VCD, because I had been looking for them everywhere, then saw someone selling the VCD's on Amazon.com.
But you know, I actually thought this was part 3, because they released it on VHS under that title (since 3 and 4 were never released here).
No film was wasted because it was shot on a Canon XL1 by using the factory electronic lens (instead of a manual lens where the DP could have better control).
The script was weak because it had no storyline other than a fake story to Dave (who is a parody of "The Source" magazine) which is a non-story in and of itself.
The direction was non-existent and I'm not certain if it's because of the lack of script or vision, but it looked as if someone free-styled every scene and had a guy with a Canon XL1 put it on tape.
I think the only reason people sat through the entire movie was because there was a Q&A session after the film with Dame Dash and Kevin Hart.
I don't think anyone even asked about this film...people mentioned the Woodsmen more than this mock-umentary...The only time it was mentioned was because the events in the film actually happened after filming them....
because I think 3 or 4 were actually the "real" actors' voices.
The only reason this dreadful version of a much loved book even garnered a four from me is because the scenery itself was beautiful, and the actual Orchard House where the Alcotts lived was incorporated into the filming.
Watching this film, one does not know that Meg pines away for riches because the family used to be wealthy, and she has never forgotten having the "little luxuries."
And good thing, because otherwise there would be nothing redeeming about September.
This is a haunting tale because it is based on a true story.
September is what I call a real estate movie, because what happens isn't nearly as interesting as where it all happens.
Was the reason Tina Louise disappeared entirely from the film because the editor was a drunken ham-fisted film school reject?
since he's French) but can't find him because he's always in the barn setting fires or strangling nymphomaniacs or whatever.
Lee's on the loose with the loot from a bank job that was obviously committed in America because it's in dollars as opposed to francs.
Please don't tell me it's a classic - just because it was made in the early 80's.
I think I must have seen a different movie than the others who posted reviews here, because there was very little redeeming about the dreck I watched.
But a hallucination would be an even bigger cheat - because the audience sees an actual transformation after Edward is unconscious.
I watched it only because I'm a Pfieffer fan.
Actually, that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well.
We'll call her CC (Casting Couch) for short, because I can't remember her character's name.
I can't even compare it to another movie because it was so dreadful.
Trust me that I'm being nice because of the IMDb filters with certain words.
gains two stars because, first, it is so horrible it will make you laugh.
Personally, I kept hoping the bug would get them all because they all deserve (need) Darwin Awards.
I'm not sure how the script for this movie ever won an award, because it's awful, it's got nothing new and some of the worse character lines I've ever heard.
This movie is bad, because of the script, directing, acting ..., everything.
That's because for some tyrannosaurus-Communist-red people, freedom of speech is such a bad thing.
Willie was hesitant, because the Russian mafia was watching him.
The ending was really unsatisfied because of the errors in the story.
I had the memory of a "Jacquou Le Croquant", hero of a TV mini-series of my childhood, who had lost his parents by the fault of an aristocrat and more generally because of the post-Napoleonean social classes system, and who came to a revenge by leading a revolt especially against that social system and against the man which incarnates the cause of the tragedy of his family.
If one can afford to see Laurent Boutonnat's version of "Jacquou" is solely because it's good-looking at.
The only positive thing that I have heard about this show, is that Jessica Biel is in it - didn't see anything interesting in the episodes I was watching, and probably it will stay that way, because I don't think it's worth it...
Heather eventually realizes that she has a supernatural power and that destiny has led her here - because these woods really do need a good burning!!
The one who they took in their home because his father was a marine (Martin) came closest, but was also a disappointment in the end.
I've noticed most people who defend this show are Christians, and as much as I'd love to do some well-placed bashing, I won't, because I happen to have a lot of friends who are Christians and yet laugh themselves silly at the idiocy that is "7th Heaven".
When I first saw an episode of this series, it seemed quiet funny to me: a sexless-Christian-perfect-family-universe with countless daughters who are each engaged for about the 20th time while not ever having married, and in the end, the parents ly in bed and cry because their son wants to marry a Jewish girl.
Also, if you have a few financial problems, have one beer, don't go to college because you wanna figure out what you would like to do, oh, no, you can't do that in the Camdon family, they'll just ship you off to Buffalo.
I would love to say something good for this show, but I can't really, because it's hard to think about one good thing that I could say, it doesn't really have anything good.
It also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible.
Who would have believed it if you'd seen him in ZIS BOOM BAH--because here, he's about as welcome as the Bubonic Plague!
I missed this movie when it appeared, and I saw it just lately, because I read some very enthusiastic reviews on it and, living in Germany, I think one has to cope also to the local cinematographic up-to-date situation.
Besides, the screenplay has too many holes (for instance, at the beginning she has all her furniture removed from her house in Munich, because she is leaving: but where is she sending them?
The movie was one I watched because I was doing some project on it and found the movie at the library.
This a the major tragedy because the so called 'horror' was so very lame and the scope for physical comedy was barely tapped.
In all fairness to the actors who doggedly go through the paces of trying to bring something meaningful to a thoroughly inane script, the film fails because the characters are shallow, two dimensional, plastic replicas of people for whom we're made to feel nothing.
I'm really disappointed, because being an avid horror fan who's always looking for a new and unique scare, I really thought this had potential.
I really only checked FACCIA DI SPIA out because of the torture scenes that have been hyped about it - and honestly, that's the only thing of interest in this one.
Judging by the title, you can imagine some of the things he does to his victims...no nevermind, you can't because a sane person in their right mind wouldn't think of the sick ways to kill a person.
The gore is cheap and you can't feel any sympathy for the victims because how stupid they were scripted.
That's a perfect description, because this terminally boring exercise in incompetently-staged bloody mayhem is terrible on every imaginable level.
If nothing else, the film lives up to it's title, because it's both violent and a huge pile of...you can guess the rest.
Its a shame since it was filmed mainly on the beautiful island of Culebra (i know its beautiful because I've been there, if you judge it from watching the film..well..its just OK)   The photography is just average, no consistent efforts (filters, waiting for the best time of day) to produce nice colors.
In fact I am really angry because there was a very good comment here but in fact it's someone who hasn't the same taste as me, and i'm displeased that he said it's the better mini-series or film made by Sci-fi.
It is fascinating that studio heads were still giving her "leading roles" -- but then, once you hear the lines she had to say, you'll come to the conclusion that she must've owed somebody something, because this film is absolutely atrocious.
The number of Oscars they won, totaling six - two for Davis and four for Hepburn - meant nothing because Hepburn won one for MORNING GLORY, which is now a historical curiosity, and one for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, which she knew was a joint one for herself and Spencer Tracy, while Davis' first Oscar was not for Joyce Heath in the badly written DANGEROUS.
Despite this story having been told in many different ways over the decades, if you love macabre films, I wholly recommend this film because of the inventive direction and the sensitive performance of Ms Bruchner.
I stuck through to see how it would end, not because I was tremendously interested but rather because I had made it through half the film and thought it might improve.
Somewhat predictable -- you can pretty much figure out which character will "surprisingly" reveal themselves as gay, or guess that ***SPOILER ALERT*** BADASSSSS is going to pull in the crowds at the last minute****   It's a shame, though, because the acting in this film is really REALLY good.
Sen hates Sunal, because in the war a hand grenade exploded in his hand and he got shot due to Sunal's clumsiness.
He can't kill him because Sunal works for the police.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, because the exaggerated acting of (especially Sunal and Akcatepe) the cast gets on your nerves.
When American POWs finally began to return home and describe the tortures they had endured at the hands of the North Vietnamese, Jane Fonda quickly told the country that they should "not hail the POWs as heroes, because they are hypocrites and liars."
Perhaps it is because it is dubbed over from it's original German dialogue, but even without dialogue it is pretty clear what is going on.
The reason the Venusians haven't gotten around to it is because their own advanced technology had already done them in.
"Look, your ship exploded because you parked it on top of that buried power cable."
I wonder who they were because we had seen neither of them before.
I think that if you read a review by someone complaining about the plot you should quit reading right away because that person, who probably never ventures beyond the top 10 in his musical tastes, obviously missed the whole point of this movie.
I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, but I am giving it a 1, because I cannot believe that it deserves an 8.8, which is what it is getting this evening, mostly apparently due to suspicious ratings from countries like Slovakia, India and Australia.
because Avatar isn't trying pretend to be deep anyway.
The tribe must be wiped out because of it.
Jake starts to like his new friends, because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature.
Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too.
Let's say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don't go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right?
The premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in Greece because they have done a little naughtiness in London.
There is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning, but even that is done without any care for how it is shot.
All this because a guy named Mc G decided he would make the most horrifically poor film he could.
The only reason i gave this film some merit was because they actually managed to string together a beginning, middle and end.
I'm really glad that he dropped out of the new "Superman" movie and let the supremely talented Bryan Singer direct, because if he had directed it then "Batman Begins" would have been the first and only great DC comics movie.
Whoever was the DP on this movie needs to beaten severely because the look of this crap gave me a headache.
AND, for about a quarter of the movie, all this talking is unintelligible if you don't understand French because the **(@#(*$ white subtitles get lost in the white tablecloth, in the white dresses, etc.
But that's okay, because there is no order or sense in the show, so even this is not much of a distraction.
Agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and Busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson.
Macbeth, because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end, as it were.
(which we really don't find out what it is 'til the last scene of the movie) A girl, played by Agnes Bruckner, is brought to the school by her parents supposedly because she's gifted and they want her to be their prize to gloat about to other parents, but actually they are just getting her out of the way because she's different.
Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'DÃ¼nyayÄ± Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..
This title is not originally meant to be a sequel.Not just because there is a 25 year gap, also there is no connectivity between two story lines.Only connection available is the former antagonist.
I won't go into detail because I am ashamed that there are people in this country who feel easy of depicting themselves like this proudly and call the film "turks in space".
I gave one point for this movie because there was no zero.
It was a hopeless effort to be a science fiction because of lack of finance, a very bad script, etc.
At a show in Amarillo, Selena refused to sign autographs and her 1 1/2 hour concert turned into 25 mins because the concert hall was only half full.
I always like days in Spanish class when my teacher is out, because she gives us some movie to watch.
Excellent acting crew, camera, director, screenplay and story were very much promising until beautiful nurse forbidden to alien Mila holding a baby whose mother left it because Serbs raped her (during the war in Bosnia probably-but not said).
I hope so because those future hippies are horrific.
It is terrible and I don't care that the movie was good besides that fact, because I do not support pathetic stereotypes like this.
Fine, they wanna make a movie that offends everybody that isn't as bad because it isn't a "racist" movie.
The show wasn't nearly as amusing the second time around, both because the shock of hearing uncensored bigotry on cable was gone and because of something my friend noted at the end of the first viewing: Lampanelli says that it's fun for us all to make fun of ourselves... but you'll notice she really only makes fun of minorities.
It's influence is so blatant because Ross recycles not only the basic plot, but even detailed plot points such as the drugged drinks.
Unfortunately, relief is brief, because now there's not enough film-time left to do anything with this 'new' tack in any detail.
I preferred the remake which wasn't the best film in the word, but its a better film than this, the action scene's are better executed maybe because it was made 30 odd years after its predecessor, and the way action sequence's are more doable with CGI and other advances in film making.
They seemed to give up just because the criminals closed a door.
We're not going to tell you because that wouldn't be artistic) Personally I think that's just pretentious garbage that even if the rest of the movie was done well I would still hate it.
They present him as a punchable boxer (he is untouchable in the book, but because he really makes an effort) who has no problems with money (he has to struggle even to get school stationary in the book) and who cares not one bit about the "Rainmaker" ("Tadpole Angel" in the book, where he does and fully accept the honor).
the story is weak, the movie relies on the occaisional tricky camera shot or gimic (which is strange and out of place because the film is otherwise shot in a very straightforward style) the "talent" cannot act and its not because they are speaking a different language, and, the movie is about 50 minutes too long and therefore is boring as hell.
The final battle was funny because the French-guy main character, who suddenly gained kick-boxing abilities in the middle of the film, shoots flaming ARROWS (HE HAD A FREAKING GUN!)
As I mentioned before, the movie sucked because instead of being a normal action/horror movie (the action is horrible; it's scary if you consider wolves in a procupine suit scary) it tries to throw in religious themes (which isn't in the film enough to justify all the freaking imagery everywhere.
And, because of that, it's difficult to know WHO Deneuve is--a drunk, an idiot or a person who LOOKS like a drunk idiot but isn't.
For example, in The Matrix, when we shown that it is Trinity's love for Neo that brings him back from the dead, the audience is able to accept this because the reality that has been established is one of sci-fi machines-rule-the-world type.
I don't even lend my copy to anyone, because I know that my friends will all hate it.
As a Beatle fan, it is in my collection and occasionally viewed for some of the songs, but not often because it is so hard to wallow through.
The reason this deserves a 3, is because I did enjoy some of the songs (which were spread out, making us wait through nonsensical sub-plots), and even though it was totally random, some of the daydreams amused me.
The only reason I continued watching it was because I was so amazed at how bad it was and was convinced it couldn't possibly get any worse.
On the plus side (and I include a plus side just because it is the right thing to do), it was nice to see Keshia Knight-Pulliam's return to TV and at the same time have a positive holiday movie that the whole family could sit down and enjoy.
I have reviewed quite a few martial arts films over the last few years, so my hating this film isn't because I don't like the genre.
Moving on, To add them to the story was also a mistake because you don't just add fairies to help some random reindeer go help find his girlfriend.
Even `Heat Wave' was saved only because of Monroe, whose sensuous delivery outweighs the actual blandness of the number.
That's what's good about the movie, it builds up quite slowly (also because actually there is not much story to build up) and when we are fully aware of the threats, the viewer is also aware of the fact that one cannot escape from a mysterious force that is everywhere around you.
It's one of those complicated conspiracy plots that are never believable because they always hinge on everyone who's NOT involved in the conspiracy behaving exactly a certain way at each key moment in order for things to work out - which is a very big chance for anyone involved in a criminal enterprise to take.
And that's because of this "16-year-old-talking-and-behavior" child.
some other points:   - they have studied us for a while, decided to destroy us and suddenly change their mind because of what?
He has done far greater work (The Matrix trilogy obviously, and my personal guilty pleasure, Speed), but because this role does not ask much of him by way of actual emotion, he soars through as the single best thing about the movie.
I won't go into the plot or story, because it's non-existent.
He belongs in that group because of the way he approaches his work, not because of the number of screams his films generate, or the clarity and logic of his scripts.
That's because the black kid and his mother have persuaded him that there is still good in the human race.
Nothing can be done about it because a vital military satellite has been disabled.
One sphere that is shown on the back of a pick-up truck being attacked by flame-throwers in some foreign desert town inexplicably contains squid, because, well, the shadows of squid inside a giant sphere look kinda neat, that's why!
The earth is supposed to stand still on this particular day because aliens have descended upon Central Park in a giant weather sphere of sorts.
This is a supernatural thriller that takes place at a spooky girl's school in 1965, and there are some strange things going on with a new girl (Heather) who was more or less sent there because her mother was afraid of her.
The only truly likable and memorable character is Isaiah, if only because he's just an impossibly cute little kid.
I kept watching only because I thought maybe it would pull together by the end.
The "style" of the movie is to cut away from shots and scenes before the audience can figure out what they are supposed to mean, because that's "deep" and "mysterious" or something.
I only didn't give it one star because of the existence of "Manos, Hands of Fate" in film history.
I guess we are suppose to forgive her anti-social attitude because she had quess what-a really bad childhood (who hasn't had a really bad childhood!).
But in a way, I feel like that brings me closer to God, because I've chosen--it's almost like a form of divinity.
But in a way, he feels like that brings him closer to reality, because he's chosen .
But because they are unusual and there are quite a few of them in "the South" (not to mention in the more Southern nations of the Caribbean and elsewhere all over the planet) they supposedly embody the aesthetic paradox of hell/heaven, bliss/torment, that characterize "the South"'s "atmosphere."
All this is done in a beat-up old car, because apparently Southerners don't own anything made in the current millennium (with Jesus hanging out of the trunk).
It is worth watching it, because you'll see some never-shown-before footage from Neverland, Jackson's ranch.
I watched this movie, because I was hoping to finally learn to know some facts about Michael Jackson, especially as a famous reporter as Bashir could interview him.
I won't go into the rest of the story of the film, because it only seeks to disarm you into thinking she is a good person who had good reason for what she did.
(9) A violent child snatcher is released only because the movie needs him to snatch the child a second time later in the movie.
Just hated this movie, I'm not sure why I watched til the end, probably because my 12 year old wanted to.
The gore is minimal but it nevertheless is an unpleasant movie to look at because far too many innocent people die.
The assumption here is that the character is rushing because someone is in danger.
Then latter in the ending sequence they keep repeating the exact footage not in flash back but because the director was simply too lazy shoot different actions in different ways.
This one in particular is bad because it is an endless cycle of quick edits of a hellish experience.
I would rather shoot myself in the head than watch another episode of The "REAL" World, because watching this show is actually more painful than that.
MTV has no idea what the real world is because they are so lost in their PC world of transparent nonsense.
This movie is about a lady that lives with her rich father and hates him because of the way he treats her and the fact that he doesn't understand her.
At least the music score is very good but the music always ends abruptly because of the editing.
When everything is said and done, I don't think SATAN'S BABY DOLL merited a DVD release of its own and would have been better served as a double-feature with MALABIMBA...not least because such a move would have decreased their collective purchase price and saved shelf space to prospective buyers!
It's sphincter-punckeringly banal, like the outpourings of some particularly dumb socialist under-graduate who thinks he knows all about the world because he's glanced through 'Das Kapital' in between drunken campus orgies.
And I'm not giving it a break because it was made in 1998 so overall I give it a 3.
', because I can't lie in this review.
When it wrapped up, I heard the music that indicated to me the film was ending, and I laughed harder than I did for any part of the movie because after all that going on and on and going nowhere, it ended with the result of: STILL having gone nowhere!
The only reason i give this film (if you can call it that) one star is because of the movie's case lured me into actually buying it and the beginning credits music, if you are stuck with the movie don't watch it you'll have a better time staring at the case and listening to the beginning credits music.
in conclusion, this movie isn't an action flick because the action just will give you a headache, this movie isn't a comedy because it's not funny, and it certainly is not a British gangster movie seeing that the creators of the film probably don't even know the definition of cockney is, to sum it all up, as a good British Gangstar movie would say "stay away from this Brad Pitt".
I guess I should not be voting because I haven't seen the whole movie.
Locke is initially hateful towards Arkin, but grows to trust him as her parents become more distant because of their own growing bitterness's.
Rodriguez is outstanding as the embittered black doctor who only treats Keach because of his pity towards deaf Arkin.
She greatly deserved the Oscar Nomination she received, because she makes what could have been an annoying character really quite likable.
Is it because, despite all the shockingly-bad acting, there were a few actors who could actually convey emotion?
Is it because the lumbering comedy moments were actually pretty funny, in an oafish way?
Actually this years contest was far worse than usual because the tunes seemed confused .
I watched this movie because I was expecting to get an inside look into the real Charles Manson.
Mainly because of the technical issues of the DVD = the captions last for 3 microseconds so it is almost impossible to know (unless you understand one of 2 versions of Chinese)what are they saying.
I rented this DVD because of the comments here on IMDB.
Even if it weren't based on a book, this movie would have been horrible, and its worse because it is nothing like the classic book it was based on.
However, this is because of the censors at the time.
Not only do I not feel sorry for them, I feel contempt because we the responsible consumers and stock holders of those companies are the ones who have to pay for it.
The answer is that it's because this movie is liberal anti-corporate propaganda.
The nickle-and-diming and usury is outrageous, but that's because we as consumers let them get away with it.
The folks who get into the kinds of trouble depicted by the movie got there because they lived beyond their means, the difference between their income and outgo being financed by credit card companies, albeit at outrageous rates.
You get the impression that suddenly these previously high risk areas have become profitable because the creditors have expanded into these markets and forced them to be profitable, with new strategies.
Profitability has dramatically increased and new markets have become open to creditors because interest rates have been steadily dropping, to now rock bottom lows.
The reality is that the credit card companies previously didn't expand into these untapped markets precisely because they were way to risky and would result in more losses from credit that is never repaid than profits from late fees interest.
It does highlight two college students that ultimately committed suicide because they applied for and received credit cards upon starting college, unknown to their parents.
It's hard to say because the segment is so short and unfocused that I wasn't really sure what the deal was, how long it lasted and why specifically it ended.
The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because the actors in this film are very effective in their character portrayal.
We can't do that where I live precisely because that stuff kills other animals too.
I was curious, because it was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
She breaks into her neighbors house and tries to stab him because she thinks that he reported her for keeping too many dogs in her house (which, by the way, he would have had every right to do).
Too bad there's a length limit on comments, because I could write volumes about how incredibly awful this movie is.
Far from being a pro-PETA piece, this movie strongly implies that the only reason anyone cares deeply about animals is because they are incapable - for one reason or another - of functioning in human society.
The movie's primary detestable assumptions are that a) anyone who has a close bond to animals only comes to that bond because they are incapable - for one reason or another - of forming healthy bonds with other people, and b) that people so bonded to animals are hopelessly blind to reason.
But one has to admit, it is really hard to forget such a movie and you couldn't stop watching it either because you just can't believe what you see.
Some movies are so bad that they're funny, but this movie is just painful to watch because it's bad but tries to pretend like it's not.
Killer Klowns is not a classic horror movie, because it lacks any real suspense, and it is not very scary.
This movie made me laugh, partly because of the persistent clown theme and partly because it is so cheap!
very soon he will wonder why he took her back (because she was hot in American Pie??
or because he used to drool over her topless pics when he was younger, on the internet??)
I must say that I actually fell asleep watching this and decided to watch the bits I missed simply because I wanted to warn people to stay away from this film.
When it all falls apart (because of her) she decides to have a go at the guy she wanted before.
Does she decide that she has made a mistake because she has been a complete and utter b*tch?
The acting is really bad, and that's no surprise, because there is not even one decent character in the script.
It also seems like Ruzowitzky had no idea at all what he was doing, because the film changes from a pseudo realistic "bad times in world war II" drama to a silly, unintelligent, extremely stupid pseudo "comedy" all the time.
I picked it up because I like Matt Le Blanc - but not as an actor - and seeing him in drag was, well, disturbing.
I bought ATQM because Eddie Izzard is in it and I'm EI mad at the moment.
I also bought The Avengers because he's in it but that's another tale of woe....
And then, the famous car chase takes place, but unfortunately it is pretty short, a few minutes and very unsatisfying, because it is mild like the movie itself, but the editing is really astonishing, cool.
The movie is visually stylish as said, but it is not enough, because ithe movie is lack of action and it was not boring, but it was not engrossing either.
And this is the peculiar part because Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not the worst movie I've "seen".
The only reason why I stayed in the cinema to go through this pain of a movie was because I was out on a date!
And I say it because I AM a fan of Death Note.
I've been a fan death note after the watching the 1st series of Anime; and I started reading the manga because the anime wasn't coming out fast enough.
At this point in the movie I lost interest because of the many twists that the movie introduces and the way they try to explain everything in 2 hours.
One star is the lowest I can give this film, but it deserves a second star simply because it got made and turned out to be a whole movie.
The zombies were more funny that scary, and it almost made me chuckle a few times because they act sort of funny, running around mumbling, the gore was good, I like when the guy got his throat bitten out, and when the one police officers fingers got bitten off reminded me of a scene from the remake of Wes Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes" which was my favorite part in that movie, so it was kind of cool to see a similar scene in this movie.
But if you like horror movies, and zombies and gore, then check out this movie, I'm not got promise you'll like it because everybody's taste in movies in different, but all I know is I enjoyed it.
it only gets a 1 out of ten because you cant select a zero!
some elements of the film could have been good ideas, the original script for romeros day of the dead had an army of trained zombies but due to budgetary constraints had to be cut - a shame because it would have been executed infinitely better than in this film.
Certainly the entire miniscule budget must have gone into the creation of the gore effects (which are juicy, to say the least), because all the other technical aspects (lighting, visual clarity, staging of the action scenes) are atrocious.
It's hard to really hate the film, because you know it means well....but that doesn't mean that you won't be looking at your watch frequently, even though it runs only 80 minutes.
Meanwhile in another part of town a cult run by a guy wearing old people's sunglasses, you know those huge black ones, is doing human sacrifices and worshipping the zombie epidemic mainly because the cult leader's son was turned into one.
Maybe it's because of the fact it is a made-for-TV movie, although I have found many other made-for-TV movies much more enjoyable.
If the novel and film were to be rewritten today the girl would be killing herself because she was sexually assaulted by the male teacher.
This generation of women, because of prejudice, went to Hunter and not Harvard, became schoolteachers and not something more glamorous or remunerative.
If you must watch this movie watch it for the few times that the cinematography breaks out of headache inducing mode and actually shines, as well as some of the special effects, because you aren't going to get much else out of Chronicles of Riddick.
Thandie Newton's performance deserves special mention, because it helps you understand why the movie version of Beloved was such a flop.
Karl Urban, who looked like a Harley dude in the LotR trilogy, fits in a bit better here, because people aren't expected to make sense.
Dracula gets these women naked and then insults them because they have small breasts or are too heavy or something.
A funny movie because of the new script.
I suspect that some of the reason this film is currently on IMDb's Bottom 100 List (the 100 lowest rated films with at least 1500 ratings) is because of its obvious political agenda.
However, just because the film is offensive does not mean it's an altogether horrible film nor does it deserve such a very bad reputation.
The crowd that recklessly spends their money because they don't care?
i only rented this because Carol Alt is in it (i really like her).
Yes, the ending is sad and shocking but, in this case, a good ending because it makes you reflect more on what perhaps you and I neglect to do: to remember that everyone needs encouragement from time to time, even the encouragers.
I was offered a contract with Cloud Ten but I rejected the offer for the job because the movie was so bad and I didn't believe the company could achieve their goals of marketing mainstream Christian movies to the general public.
You can tell he has turned evil because he shoots his own cute little doggie.
Furthermore, the humour used in this movie is the worst ever, there were _several_ humourously intended phrases, which have been known to mankind ever since the internet was invented, can you believe they actually said things like "I'm not a vegetarian because I love animals, I'm a vegetarian because I hate plants."
I say somebody's because even fundamentalist Christians are by no means united about prophesying things to come.
It's impossible to evaluate these films because believer folk will hang on every word and nonbelievers will inevitably scoff.
There was a scene that really wasn't terribly germane to the plot where a father turns in his son for 're-education' because he caught him with a Bible.
For years I waited for some movie to be made about Rubin Carter, because I loved to see him box at the old MSG, and to see this movie was very disappointing.I have alot of respect for Mr Washington, but he was awful and boring.There is really nothing good to say about this movie except I did like the song.
Unfortunately because of this disability he remains isolated from being able to take comfort from them when he needs it most.
Robinson , Hagler , Ali or Hearns he was not   Oh yes he was WRONGLY convicted of murder and just to lay it on with a trowel a very early scene has the sadistic warder from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION telling the wronged but noble Rubin to keep calm because he knows a cruel injustice has been done but there's nothing he can do to help .
Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist .
We know they're racist because the arresting officer states " Your black ass is going down " , but that doesn't worry Rubin because he defiantly replies " I know I'm innocent " and he is , such a pity that the twelve jurors were all white and all racist and decided he was guilty simply because he was black .
It doesn't play hard and fast with the facts because there's little in the way of facts .
You can also forget all about the racist arresting officer investigating the murder case because he's a composite character that includes at least one black detective so racism wasn't at the heart of the case .
Rubin Carter was dishonourably charged from the army and never had a distinguished military career , the jurors in the case included two blacks and he was found guilty by a unanimous decision so having " a black ass " wasn't a motive for finding him guilty , he was finally released on a technicality not because he was innocent and there's umpteen other revisionist aspects to the story .
Sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture.
The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*SEMI-SPOILER*) hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.
I do not like movies (especially Hollywood interpretations) that are based on "true" stories because they usually distort the "true" parts into something else, something not so true.
Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello.
catechism lessons from a necessarily ugly and frigid religion teacher (because a religion teacher can't be a nice woman, in accordance with the script) if his parents are unable to give him a right support to make him understand that six billion human beings can be easily controlled by GOD thank to His almightiness?
He hasn't any doubts about the INADEQUACY of the religion teacher and about the ADEQUACY of his twopenny halfpenny dialectics because what really matters, according to the script, is to strike blindly at everything concerning the religious element, especially at the issue of sainthood, without any pause for breath, without any alternative voice, profiting by every occasion to deny the existence of life after death.
Brooks gets an inordinate amount of attention and praise simply because she was a big feminist before her time, so Liberals gush over anything she did, even it stinks.
For the first half of the film, indeed, one at least can be forgiving to the film because the characters inherent (and physical) beauty at least provides some sort of motion to the storyline.
I think this movie was really bad, but I liked seeing it because it was shot in a house I owned in Ocean City New Jersey.
The original title "Down the Shore" was considered but changed because that is an expression that is used only by the people in the Philadelphia area.
What father would tell his daughter to kiss the first bozo that comes along, just because he can drive a race car....
I think something must have gone wrong in the translation because throughout the movie I had the feeling we were back in the fifties teaching the children that the women's place is in the kitchen or otherwise just look pretty and shut up.
The bonus feature is kind of neat because you can watch how they build a skeleton, add "skin", texture, muscle movement, and facial features.
HOWEVER, the story is slightly original because the characters get around on snowmobiles and are stuck in blizzard-like weather.
When people have Jesus things all over the place, sometimes you feel like they will act without thinking because Jesus told them to or something.
I'm even tempted to say that her performance is the one best reason for seeing this movie (which is surprising, because Stone has never been very good at creating compelling female characters).
To have Frid subconsciously conjure up these baddies, because he's got hidden grudges against his wife and friends, would have been a far more logical plot device.
These poorly done films from the Seventies always bum me out, often not because of the stories, but because they remind me once again of the seriously hideous fashion sense and hair styles the era produced.
I don't have the problem some viewers do with Leslie Nielsen as an dramatic hero, because I remember him from "Forbidden Planet".
... and not just because my copy looked like someone held their cell phone camera up to a 16mm projector.
I actually bought this movie because of the comments made on this website and thought to myself that it can't be THAT bad.
Lundgren isn't exactly a great actor (which shouldn't matter, because he's an action star), and when he has nothing to work with action-wise a project is doomed from the start.
Expectations were low from the opening credits listing (no not just because Dolph Lundgren was top billing) but a guy with one of the worst names in the business - Randolph Mantooth - was SECOND billing, obviously I wasn't expecting much.
so we pretty much just see him being him, not one line is delivered correctly, but always as if Kelly was really angry because he ordered a latte and not a cappuccino or with a huge hangover from partying all night.
The movie ends with Ned on his armor getting shot by the Brits, which is one of the memorable scenes of the movie, mainly because it actually seems to had been taken from a serious movie instead of a generic 70s movie.
But not only because of her role - she also got to kick much more ass in that one, while the script of "Intent To Kill" is poorly written.
Story line - very poor  Acting - mediocre to poor  Character Development - very little  Violence - heavy  Sex & Nudity - NONE  Tough cop Traci takes on a very bad drug dude, and in the end, she's the last cop still standing, mostly because it's her arrogance and stupidity that got the others killed.
Please don't waste your time or money on this dog, give some blood instead, you won't see any in this movie and when you do you won't care because you're ready to scream from boredom!!!!
I can say this because I have seen the worst of the worst B-Horror films, from Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space, to the early 80's Scalps.
There are actually scenes in this movie that made me very sick because of the camera movements.
Alice's family blamed her for the entire tragedy and Alice had gone mad with guilt because she blamed herself.
This movie might be OK to see if you had smoked some wicked herb or taken some acid, though because i hadnt it just made me angry.
The only reason the actors could categorized as "good" actors is because they had a maximum of three lines each in the movie!
The only reason I rated it a 2 instead of a 1 is because I was put through the high school movie production of "Near Death" last night.
I thought it would be a laugh to begin with seeing as the catch line is "he's not clowning around" and seeing the hilarious evil clown photo... it was the hardest movie I've ever had to endure because I honestly did not understand any of it.
It is sad because it not only suffered from too much "compression" (which is some times a legitimate decision) but it replaces the actual Biblical dialogue with its own similar but very misleading telling of the stories.
It's only because everything is SO bad in this movie that makes it so entertaining.
A lot of things happen but because we don't know the characters.
The two children evolve into teenagers that assume the usual bad habits and make the usual bad choices, but there is never any crisis ensuing, and all is forgiven because nothing is really wrong.
The more I see of this so-called new independent cinema, the more I think "independent" simply means an amateur, shot-on-video production which otherwise never would have seen the light of day because the makers obviously lack the talent to succeed in the real movie business.
Whereas shot-on-video productions such as The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast succeeded because of their innovative approach to the format, this film, or should I say video, makes it abundantly clear that affordable public access to video technology isn't necessarily a good thing.
-SOME SPOILERS- Without giving it all away, Ann Margret's character lies her way into a murder conviction just because she wants to get her abusive, alcoholic boyfriend put in jail too.
The only HERO, Marg Helgenberger, is sort of ignored; and the seedy character of Ann-Margret is the one who gets her way all the time, flaunts the legal system, gets several innocent people killed, and gets away with it because she is an older woman with abuse issues.
If you're making a movie about the music industry, please get some good music first because the whole reality of the film falls apart once we hear the crappy music.
This is simply one of the best movies ever made because it's so funny and the creators didn't intend for it to be.
Thus we have the present day equivalent of the White Telephone film, a film which exists because the writer/director, Lisa Cholodenko, needs to make films in order to be a filmmaker.
I found the movie a little redeeming because it's quite easy to make fun of it while you watch it.
A friend of mine told me that I simply don't understand the movie or the lifestyle it portrays because I'm not from LA.
I can't buy into this because Mulholland Drive is easily my favorite movie.
If you sense something a little 'odd' during this movie, it's that every sentence feels inauthentic, because there are certain words that all the actors doing  accents simply can't pronounce that well.
You know, I must have missed something here because this story just didn't make much sense.
"Deadtime Stories," however, is a horror anthology like no other, basically because it's utter CRAP.
I didn't see the third story because I was falling asleep by then and turned the TV off.
The reasons why these fables are more or less interesting are because they introduce interesting variants on the common monsters.
If your main reason for watching it (as was mine) is to see San Diego locations, forget it, because in the 45 minutes I lasted before walking out, I saw none (and I never walk out of movies).
Jlo today is an actress with no career just observe the golden globes on Sunday giving out an award because Angelina Joli wasn't interested in doing it.
Movie loses major points because of Marc Anthony.
I was really looking forward to this film because of the good reviews and the fact it was about Salsa ( having Jennifer Lopez to look at doesn't hurt either ) but it really was spoiled.
In fact the only reason I am offering a review for this little mess is because of all the 'good' reviews.
First this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor geeks with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the "real" actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldn't get anybody desperate enough to do this movie!
This movie was horrible because I had no clue what was going on at any given moment.
I bought this movie strictly because Julian McMahon starred in it and he was only in the movie for like five minutes which was very disappointing.
Well I think I'm not able because I was so disappointed the first time.
That's because the setting's plainer (the entire movie's in the man's house, a lifeless six-figure suburban hovel), the characters are plainer (especially against Lynch characters), and the plot is a lot simpler -- almost predictable.
However, even is this is true, the script should have made reference to this hard to believe 'fact' in dialogue, simply because the situation was so unusual and would have breached the strictly enforced wartime regulations concerning the blackout.
For example, a girl puts on a video which is of her mother in a sex movie, the doorbell rings and she doesn't want to answer it because the visitor is an old boyfriend, so she hides without turning off the video.
Oh and be ready for some cheap jokes at lesbians' expense because apparently the movie is that sophisticated and smart (*snerk*) - many that can be see as offensive including the 10 year old mentality that girl + girl couple = hot lesbian action.
I gave it a chance because of that rating and it has a good cast.
I gave it 3 stars because I had a few chuckles and Zooey is sweet but that's it.
This is an episode that seems to be aired less often than average--perhaps because it is a pretty weak one with a lot of plot problems.
This was one of our favorite Star Trek adventures to act out when we were kids because you could use a bean bag as the pretend space pancake and smack each other on the back, beaming it with your wooden shop class phaser to save each other.
The (in)famous sex scene between Maria and Henry takes place at Mansfield Park rather than in London and, because Rozema has played with JA's chronology of events, Fanny is already back from Portsmouth, and it is she who catches them in the act.
And flashes of brilliance throughout the film are forgotten as the credits roll because of the cheap Hollywood ending.
starting to grow on me, and I had somewhat high hopes for Spooks Run Wild, because you never know what will happen when Bela Lugosi is on the scene.
Unfortunately the 'Running Wild' portion of the title can be aptly used to describe the movie, because this just goes all over the place, and uses weak excuses to justify it's actions.
1/10 because i cant give 0.
By watching this show you would never guess it was made in 1993 because of the grainy, outdated 70's animation.
I rented this movie because I love Bob Odenkirk's comic genius in the Mr. Show, but this movie is a complete waste of time, an excruciating exercise in bad breath.
However, I actually wish that a less witty one had been selected, because then I might not have bothered with this silly little slasher flick.
However, this idea is squandered immediately because of the fact that his voice sounds ridiculous, thus giving the whole piece a jokey sort of feel, and it's squandered further because most of what he's saying is delivered in a very patronising manner.
To be honest, I'm glad that a lot of footage for this film was lost; because I really don't think I could stomach much more of this film.
Most low-budget slasher flicks are entertaining in some way or another because the director was a fan of horror films.
I didn't keep watching for much longer than this because the film was frying my brain.
I have seen this movie because I have heard this is "the new Swedish wave", "this is the hope for Swedish cinema".
The acting is universally bad, with the possible exception of the guy playing the soccer-coach, but only because he's supposed be dead throughout the film - the other thespians don't have that excuse.
I just love "Dark Angel" - and not just because the spunky charm and great looks of Jessica Alba, but also because of Michael Weatherly, whose brilliant, low-key performance single-handedly provides a counter-balance to the series' outrageously futuristic plot.
If he does, I would not even let him direct cart-traffic on a golf-course, because of the legal ramifications, let alone the bloodshed.
Just because a painting has become a gay icon does not mean that one should make a movie about a real individual who was NOT a gay icon.
Well, for starters, I feel that this show is somewhat stolen by the rather entertaining character 'Panic' (because he never panics apparently).
I also liked the fact that the ticks became the way they were not because of government experiments or evil big companies dumping waste but because of weird growth agents being used by the Marihuana growers.
This may have worked better with some 'Tremors'-like humour - the horror elements are too weak because of the one-dimensional characters; this is a film where you really do not care about anyone and the whole experience is like watching a cartoon.
The movie is an utter disappointment because it had the potential to become a laugh riot only if the dÃ©butant director, Sajid Khan hadn't tried too many things.
Overall this movie deserves 1 out of 10 star (some points deducted because of hyped expectation which it fails to meet).
First half was good it really made me laugh & cry but in the second half when Vidia Balan came then got quite boring for some reason maybe because she spoiled it even Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance couldn't save it.
Inspired from Three men and a baby I can't remember when I saw it because it was a very forgettable film as well as this one.
The moment i got to know that "Sajid Khan" was directing the film, i had already lost any hopes of the movie being any good anyways because he already has a very idiotic, blunt and stunted sense of humor and such a guy making a whole comedy movie.....Still i took my chances!
When the movie was over, it felt like Chris was having a laugh at my expense because he knows what it a piece of crap it is and he intentionally wasted my time, and it was damned hilarious to him.
She is delighted because it's Halloween and she's going trick or treating with her overweight friend.
I was roped into this travesty because... 1) I enjoy zombie films 2) I usually enjoy both Debbie Rochon and Trent Haaga and 3) For some reason I still think there's hope out there for Full Moon, who have lost most of my respect over the years with a succession of incredibly bad releases.
I use the term movie loosely in this case because it is more like a group of friends that got together and made a video, but sure enough it has some Troma in it.
For someone who is informed it's impossible to relate to the main character because of the exaggerated affects it portrays.
I was even a little angry because I suspect that the movie's marketing is aimed specifically at "stoners" as evidenced by the box cover and the casting (Ferris and Danny Masterson who have appeared in films and shows that are popular in the pot culture).
look, i rented this because Jim from the office is in it and i love him.
It really annoys me when big stars get away with making junk just because of the weight their name carries.
He plays Morty as the usual kooky/crazy Walken stereotype, and it only works because it is funnier than almost anything Sandler can throw at the audience.
I found myself pining for more Walken, just because everything else was so ridiculously unfunny.
It actually makes these moments seem better than they actually are, just because of how professionally done they look.
I felt like crying yes, but only because of how atrocious the things going on on-screen were.
Through a misunderstanding he finds himself in a brothel, but totally fails to realise the nature of the establishment, because sex was never mentioned in the light comedies of the era.
Cecilia envies the characters she sees on the screen because they are rich, beautiful and seemingly happy.
Tom, on the other hand, envies the inhabitants of the real world because they are free to make their own choices and do not have to go on repeating the same scenario ad infinitum.
Cecilia is devoutly religious, but Tom has no knowledge of God, because religion does not feature in the plot of his film; when Cecilia explains the concept to him, Tom conceives of God as having the same relation to the real world as the scriptwriter does to his fictional one.
It is this dual personality that is the main fault of Click, because it simply exists at two opposite poles.
Click never delves too deeply into the psychology behind being your own God, because it is more obsessed with making it a personal tale rather than make the main character a metaphor for the audience to relate to.
Some of what happens is fairly funny, just because we all know we'd love to do the same thing if given the chance, or because we manage to revel in Michael's joy with his new toy as he makes everyone speak Spanish or has James Earl Jones narrate his life.
i really didn't want to see this, because i end up hating almost anything Adam sandler does.
i gave him some slack because i enjoyed "punch-drunk love", a movie where he actually seemed to stretch a bit as an actor and try to make you forget for a few moments that it's him on screen.
Appalling because a student film had won the Academy Award for best live-action short.
Appalling because it is so bad.
I use all my strengh to see 7 episode, only because I downloaded all 13 episodes at once, but it was so bad that I couldn't see the rest, this show tried to be a lot of things, science, fantasy, sci-fi, history, action, comedy and drama, unfortunately, it was mediocre in all, the only thing this show manages to be is a waste of time.
Rating: 2/10, but only because of the mildly amusing deaths
First of all, I have to tell I mainly watched this movie because the special effects was told to be made by the FX group and the poster was very promising about them.
It's ashame because James Mason is terrific in his scenes.
well, the truth is they actually shot the movie somewhere in new jersey, because the real long beach is not in any way the place they describe.
At parts where the movie was supposed to be serious, it turned into a comedy for me because I was laughing so hard at how bad the movie was.
CITY BY THE SEA recalled me Verhoeven not only because of CatonÂJones' BI installment, but also because of Dzundza, much better as Douglas' sidekick; Verhoeven knows how to do exploitation, CatonÂJones doesn't.
I picked up this movie with a friend because the front cover made it look like it would be pretty good...I never realized how deceiving a movie cover could be.
It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over.
Read the book because that truly is a masterpiece.
Well, unfortunately the makers were right, because there are a lot of people that like it.
If it's not rated at all, they should rate it because children would just think, "ooh, I MUST see that because I LOVE nature."
The story is not nearly as exciting as the first movie, probably because Ralphie Parker, fourteen-years old in this movie, has moved beyond the crisp imagination that he possessed as a grade school student in the first movie, which produced a film mostly from his childish perspective, and one that many could enjoy.
We grow to like these two men, and I felt cheated, because one of them we never see again, and the other, the engaged one, merely serves for the rest of the movie as a body for Deanna to tell her story to.
Eventually, Gene escapes from prison and hides out in the nightclub to kill Deanna, because he assumes since she's working there, that she must be sleeping with all the patrons.
She must be one heck of a person, because David Duchovny certainly didn't marry her for her potential as a mega-star.
Ida's story is the most confusing, because you're left wondering why the script writers put it in the movie.
Forced Entry was never meant to be a mainstream flick, but it would appear that Sotos was trying to turn it into one with this film as the plot is basically the same but we don't get any of the sexual violence, which is a bit of a shame because that's the only thing that most people will have tuned into the original for and it's always going to be difficult to make an R-Rated film based on this plot line and make it a success.
Or maybe its because everybody else sucked so bad!
Devito probably took this role because he hasn't had an on-screen kiss since Twins!
I am not going to tell you about the plot because there's no plot at all.
The whole development of this plot is little more than "I can't let the good guys destroy the monster, because then the aliens won't come down.
There is a part where Tom ends up in a whorehouse and he has no idea what the women are talking about because his character didn't need to know these kind of things.
Every time we see how Tom Baxter is incapable of doing or understanding things, or the opposite, because his character has no idea of real life.
Ed Wood's movies became classics because they were so earnest, yet so genuinely bad that they became funny.
"Younggary" distinctly fails to be scary, simply because it is so utterly silly in all respects, and the storyline has more holes than swiss cheese, but it may have some minute appeal in the similar vain as Ed Wood's material, provided that the audience is in the right frame of mind.
You could never hear what the alien dudes were saying to each other because they were always mumbling.
It was a laugh riot, not over the movie being funny (because it wasn't) but more over the fact that such a piece of crap was even being aired.
It was difficult to distinguish the actors who were supposed to be actors and the actors who were supposed to be "real gangstas", because all of the acting in this movie sucks.
The only reason I gave this three stars was because of the fight scenes, especially the Scarface-looking one where he was on the car screaming "AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA" like a nut... the one with all the gang members in the house facing that crew of Malibu people holding a f*****g whale harpoon and a rocket launcher was the only funny part of the movie IMO.
The only reason that this misshapen mess of a film was made was because Ray was something of an idol to Wenders, and dying of cancer, not long after the two men met filming The American Friend a few years earlier.
Wenders shows this for seven minutes and the result is borderline pornography, full exploitation, and plain old sadistic, because nothing is gained.
after seeing a marquee at a local movie theatre which reads something to the effect of "Coming soon: 'Unmasked part 26'" hinting that he still will never be able to stop killing, no matter how much he may want to, because the producers will keep bringing him back again and again in more sequels.
For one, it doesn't prove Wade was "moral", just a schizo because he's yapping about escaping in the hotel a few minutes earlier.
When the bad guys see the good guys with a Gatling Gun they just laugh because they know the good guys can't hit the broadside of a barn with anything.
Apparently the bartender/hotel clerk in Contention, AZ, whom we've not been introduced to until this point in the movie, is in cahoots with the bad guys because he make a point of surreptitiously and eagerly directing the bad guys to the location of the incarcerated Mr. Crowe.
The bigger problem with this movie is its message, which is this: People who do the right thing because it's the right thing to do are fools.
Lead actor Richard Norton, a poor man's Chuck Norris, luckily doesn't speak too much because he's one of the most wooden actors I've ever seen.
This movie should have been released on DVD first because its only worth a one day rental.
I am beginning to think he is just trying to finish out some contractual obligation because I honestly can't see where his heart was in it.
Or else he just sucks these days because this movie stinks.
The movie has been re-sold because of Leslie Nielsen's success with Naked Gun, but this movie is very bad.
The only reason to watch this film is because you lost a bet (and that should put anyone off of gambling).
One could be excused for thinking that the cast members appear in this film because they lost a bet with Kimmel.
Like many people I believed this to be funny because the title was Naked Space.
No matter how much you try to laugh at the jokes, you can't because actually there are none.
It doesn't deliver for action fans, because the action has a cheap, amateurish feel about it.
It doesn't deliver for suspense fans because there is no excitement, just lots of noise and mayhem.
It doesn't deliver as a "thinking-man's" thriller because of its insistence on mindlessness.
And it doesn't deliver for those who fondly remember the old TV show because it has virtually nothing in common with it other than the fact that it features a bounty hunter named Randall.
Interested enough to leave the film, much to the consternation of Herrmann and the other characters in the film because they are trained by the fact that they were shot in a way by the film company and edited to follow the same pattern forever.
Because some of the cops looked alike and because the filmmakers only attempted to explain half of an interconnected story in order to preserve the final surprise element, I wound up confused in the beginning (until they make it totally obvious that Hauer is being set up).
Furthermore, there just wasn't enough develop among the characters (possibly, because there are too many people involved) that you never really get a real sense of anything.
The only reason I gave this movie a rating of 2, and not 1, is that my kids under 6 found it mildly amusing (emphasis on mildly), but I can't even recommend it for kids of that age because of the gratuitous potty humor.
He learns about "flatbottom" (the open ocean), and that all the fish avoid it, because fishing isn't forbidden there, and there are numerous fishing nets.
As the day of the fight between Troy and Pi gets closer, Cordelia begs Pi to not do that, because Troy could kill him.
In this way I'm not even sure that Troy really is a tiger shark (because I think that tiger sharks have some kind of stripes on them).
* There is a walrus or something in the film, and, during the whole film, he did not go to the surface to breathe (I say this because walruses can't breathe under water).
I guess the "big stars" offering the voices must have all cringed at the final product because it is embarrassing to watch.
I guess the fish know that because one of them must've seen a discarded issue, amid all the other trash, on the bed of where Pi was living at the very beginning.
I gave it a 3 because some individual frames in "the haunted shipwreck" looked nice.
Meanwhile, the actors in the movie on the screen are stuck and don't know what to do because they can't finish the movie without Daniels' character and they are seen conversing with each other about what to do and to the audience in the theater, who for some reason, sit and watch the actors on the screen trying to figure out what to do.
It's a funny movie, but not because the play is a comedy, but because it's all so horrible.
I tried this version out solely because Diana Rigg was in it.
); and this is a difficult play to do well because its plot is so hoary, and the play-within-the-play so tedious, that these actors can hardly be held accountable for the bard's sins.
I gave it 2 points because of the great photo shots.
It cannot be called a documentary because there are no interviews or commentary -- it's just someone following people around with a camera in Cuba.
Perhaps people think it's good and arty because it's "different" and not like the average documentary but seriously, there is no movement, direction or purpose to this and it's 85 minutes of my life I will never get back!!
I'm not convinced that this film is not more well-respected just because director Robert Altman's name is attached.
Let me mention the positive aspects of the film first, because otherwise I'll likely run out of room.
THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO has got to be one of the most original and inventive of all the films Woody Allen has done--and all the more enjoyable because we're not subjected to the Allen character in the film itself.
It beats out grade Z movies because of its "deep arthouse movie" pretensions.
They're like bees because they dress in yellow and black stripped ballgowns!]
See most of the other movies which are out right now because this one has to be the worst of them all...with the exception of Pitch Black.
Apparently, this passed for humor, because Nichols depended on this noise for about 30 minutes of the film.
Of course, "The 40 Year Old Virgin" came out five years after this movie did, but it was a bigger hit (and was far less forgettable) because it was smart and had a surprising amount of heart to it.
Woody's stories are often derivative, but he's forgiven that, usually, because the results are good and ultimately do deserve his signature.
The triumph is amazing, because, despite the depth of the symbolism, PURPLE ROSE can also be seen as sheer entertainment; on its surface, it is still one of the most entertaining pictures Woody has ever made.
I can't tell you what happens after this... because I walked out at this point...
I'm not going to comment on the acting that much because this isn't a movie where dialog is superior to anything else in the movie.
Makes no sense...and some of you may end up accusing me of nitpicking, and you're damn right, I expected a brilliant movie to rank with the works of James Cameron, Ridley Scott and John McTiernan because that's what was promised, and yes those movies are what I judge this one by.
These predators were slow, easily sneaked up upon, and had no seeming idea of what was going on, but just seemed to kill because that's what they felt like doing...or...something.
The end is obviously open for a sequel...I say, bring back Ridley Scott or James Cameron for the love of all that is holy...because they are the only ones that could save this franchise now.
Trivia: Lance was in Aliens (an actual GOOD movie by James Cameron) and Alien 3 (a bit of a fail, though) He eventually wins because it turns out he was a "good" guy helping (WTF?!)
It really sucked to see the Predator win because I was rooting for the Aliens.
And then, our heroes venture inside this ancient edifice and are trapped inside the pyramid because they decided to take some Predator guns.
I understand that it makes your job a little tougher because you want to tell a story about an alien, and you need to have it bust out of somebody's chest pretty early in the story... but you're getting paid a lot of money to figure out a clever way of making it work."
The film is predictable because you know where its going and who's going to survive.
The plot had so many holes in it, I thought it was that pair of socks you have that you wear everyday, and have worn them since 1994, because they are you're lucky socks.
Not only was the plot terrible, lets talk about acting, because apparently, they did not discuss it before casting anyone for this debacle!
however the one "main" predator who is the biggest wuss ever to come from the predator home world because he has a soft spot for humans, well human, kills dozens with relative ease also, in aliens the acid burns through a lot of METAL floors, however this woman's face has developed the ability to with stand this potent acid?
I'm not even going to complain about the PG-13 rating because it is what it is.... just a bad movie.
Just because you're a fan of both franchises doesn't mean you have to swallow this and embarrass yourself on these pages.
Those parents who complained when the studio didn't accommodate them because they were too stupid to realize a film based on a video game which is in turn based on Night Of The Living Dead might not be a good babysitter, I hope you are proud of yourselves.
Above I said "true battle" because there is technically another battle.
The previous Predator films are contradicted as well because the Predators are portrayed as creatures who are noble warriors, who actually respect humans and will help them if need be, rather than the ruthless merciless hunters who killed for sport and would kill a human just out of spite if he looked at him funny.
I kept waiting for one of them to pull out a cellphone because most the performances were phoned in, for me the beginning was the worse stupid twinkling lights in the background of scenes of them on the ship while long shots with harpies flying over head were of a cloudy twilight sky, so where did the twinkling stars come from....this is just pointing out one of many flaws and of course this ship was filmed in a studio with no water at all, I'm sure of it.
If you're a fan of sword and sandal sci-fi adventure with sorcery and magic it only barely acts as an apetizer, a lightly flavored one at that, leaving you wanting terribly that you had The Odyssey starring Armande Assante in your DVD collection because watching all the hours of a rerun would be more satisfying than watching 90 minutes once you remove commercials of this drivel.

After hearing for more then 2 hours of Quran suras, because one of my neighbors had to play it very loud, i looked forward to this BUCK movie.
No wonder this religion produces terrorists, because hearing this voice screaming suras is the living hell.
I could give it 1 point, because as a BUCK fan i am disappointed, but i don't have to.
The film fails because of two things: The plot gives the impression that the script only existed of a few key scenes which were strung together inaccurately.
I hope that everyone was paid well for this film because I don't think they were doing it for artistic acclaim!
The movie would have us believe that someone could get away with betting that a shot could be made on a player's turn and then being able to take the next shot because the player bought his opponent's turn and therefore the subsequent shot was still his.
Well, I believe the two weeks on the script part because the script is utterly wretched, but I don't know about the ten years part because this movie rips off "Rounders" to a huge extent.
Johnny double-crosses Joe for reasons that I'm not going to get into because they're stupid, and later has to face Joe's new hustler Brad (played by a slumming Rick Schroder) in a high-stakes game of pool, while suffering from a broken wrist given to him by an angry Joe.
Since the guy is the 13th ranked player in the US he obviously doesn't crack under pressure because if he did then he obviously would be unable to make his living playing pool for high stakes.
After seeing this movie I understand why there is not a single positive comment listed here: it's because this movie does not deserve any!
It's like I wasn't even watching an actual movie because well, the two plots completely cancelled each other out.
You don't care about the monster because I think it was imaginary (or something), you don't care about the girl because she's wasting precious monster time.
There's an intense boredom involved because nothing really happens, we know from the first minute these are all dream sequences and hallucinations.
Maybe it was because I was tired, but hardly anything in this film made any sense at all, and wasn't one of those "teenagers" the demonology expert from 'Night of the Demons 2'?
Anyway, this Pusher 2, of which I hear the only reason they made this, is that they thought they could big money on a sequel and they needed it because their production company's Fear X was a big flop in America.
The audience could do a better job of identifying with Tippin, because he was "an average Joe," who was introduced to the spy life.
Having watched all five seasons, the only reason i did that was because i watched season 4 & 5 first so i had to watch the first three for closure.
The condescending forwardness with which Sydney conducts herself is a miscalculated attempt to portray her an independent strong woman which backfires because we are all aware that such conduct wouldn't fly with any credible organisation let alone a government agency like the CIA , please,   3)Agent Vaughn's wooden acting, no doubt Vaughn is a cute guy but his face seems incapable of rendering an emotionally rooted performance   In conclusion i feel obliged to recommend to anyone who's planning on catching this show on DVD or tivo DON'T or you CAN'T but if you insist let someone who's watched season season 1 - 3 tell you what happens then watch season 4 & 5
But in the end, we'll never know because it's not explained.
This film is apparently about the Jersey Devil, I say "apparently" because there is NO Jersey Devil in this film.
"The Last Broadcast" fails miserably as a film not because of its low budget, or cheesy production values, or less-than-stellar performances (all of which exist); rather, the movie creates its universe, then, for the finale, decides to disregard everything that it has presented, in an attempt to be 'surprising,' or 'crass' or 'hip.'
Yeah, let's leave the Jersey devil thing intact because their "clever" idea failed - it just doesn't fix with the rest of the film.
The documentary had me glued on the screen because I was anxious to see what would happen (like a real documentary) and I got deeply disappointed anyway.
A second hired hand is convicted of the murders (this isn't a spoiler because it's stated at the beginning of the film).
That's a big problem, because the film hinges on playing like a documentary.
While the idea to use purposefully bad camera-work isn't flawed, the execution is flawed, because the camera-work is so ridiculous that it again comes across like an amateur filmmaker imagining what bad camera-work might be like.
Normally directors try to rip off good movies, like the guy who directed "The Italian Connection" based on the "The French Connection" (good thinking because sometimes Americans confuse the French and the Italians), or the other fellow who directed the porno "American Booty" based on Sam Mendes' "American Beauty."
But even based on that sordid criteria, "Return to the Blue Lagoon" fails because even the sleaziest, worst acted pornos at least do something to your libido.
"Return to the Blue Lagoon" does nothing because it has all the bad acting you would expect from a porno without any of any of the great sex (not least because the actors are underage).
It has gorgeous pictures of a tropical paradise, far better acting, and you won't feel dirty and guilty by the end of the film because the actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, were both in their thirties (though they look like in the their twenties) at the time of filming.
Some great actors got their start though because of this film.
I watched this movie for the first time last year because I loved the first one.
For example, in the movie "MalÃ¨na" she was great because she didn't speak much, in "IrrÃ©versible" likewise, etcÂAs regards to Catherine Deneuve I never liked her very much but I was surprised to see her in such a bad movie and doing an awful actingÂ More surprised I was with the German actor Moritz Bleibtreu.
All the same, the story itself borders on the utterly ridiculous - it was pointed out to me that the end of the movie works out in such a way that the lead character(Hanks) actually manages to hurt his chances of achieving his dream, largely because certain elements of this movie apparently exist in fantasy-world, where the right choice is always the one accompanied by cheap sentimentality.
This is a shame, because with a little work and a different ending, this actually could've turned out to be an interesting film.
I won't give anything away though, because the plot will reveal itself immediately.
Mom, Beetlejuice, Multiplicity, and probably even funnier than Johnny Dangerously (because Dangerously is intended to be pure slapstick and black humor COMEDY all the way).
I rented this movie because (a) I come from Orange County, CA, and (2) I wanted to see how Colin Hanks did in his first starring role.
It can hardly be compared to a British 'La Haine' because, unlike La Haine it is so lacking in aesthetic material, i.e.
Another poster on this title claims some connection to this dreary movie, defending it because the cast and crewed "cared" about what they were doing.
Ninety percent of this tripe is shot in close-ups, evidently because you'd be able to see the edges of the sets or the kitchen sink.
I gave it a 3, because I like b-horror films,i like Frankenstein movies and you have to give Leigh some credit.
John Woo's Ying Huang Boon Sik/A Better Tomorrow(1986) was groundbreaking when first released because of the stylistic depiction of the action scenes.
I enjoyed it when Mark Gor places guns inside flower pots as backup because the idea is cleaver and original.
The death of Mark Gor is a big sacrifice because it makes Ho and Kit Brothers again.
The Toast of New York, despite the lavish look, top-notch cast and occasional bursts of energy, is a ten-ton bore - chiefly, I think, because of the long-winded script and pedestrian direction.
Their casting is very successful because it must be hard to pull of such characters.
I don't know whether to love or to hate this movie because, despite it being a obvious ripoff or omen to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" it wasn't all that bad.
Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so.
The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does.
I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!!
just one thing: I cannot comment the last 30 min... because I fell asleep!
I enjoyed it, but just because a character is endearingly nicknamed "Hamlet", and there's a few (well acted) verses recited, "Best Men" is no Shakespearean work.
Even more ridiculous is that because the guys are "nice",they end up basically helping them too.
The dialogues lack ideas because there is no time to develop them, so they have to be reduced to standard phrases.
If you are going to see this movie, I would recommend seeing it with a completely open mind, have no pre-notions of what it will be, because you won't get what you are expecting.
I hope he finds better work, because this show can not go pass its fourth episode.
!i notice it has the talentless limited no range guy or girl (because hes kinda like pat from Saturday nite live) that made that stupid you tube video shoes!
Then there is the "hero" who seems indestructible, is filled with angst because of his traumatic past at the hands of his grotesgue former commander (who is now of course his prime enemy).
(Remember, I'm embarrassed even to be writing this, because I just bought the movie.)
I was going to give it a 3, because of the animation, but the style of the animation is totally generic; in point of fact there IS no style.
And Geroge Raft-first he's sort of a good guy gangster, then he turns completely cold-blooded brushing off the death of a completely innocent 21year old woman by his partner, then he turns to be a good-guy again because the writers could'nt think of anything else.
Too bad IMDb doesn't provide negative numbers for ratings, because this howling dog deserves a minus 10 .....
its hard to tell whether those who made the film wanted to snipe at the middle east or the Americans, because both will be insulted after seeing this film.
i rate this film 0/10, which is rare, because i see no redeeming features in it whatsoever.
You have trouble identifying with any of the characters because they are so unrealistic.
I am so sorry that i do not have GUTS to recommend this film to anybody here because this is a BAD film.
Please also don't go on the Good Comments here because i think it was created.
The most memorable (because the funniest) is "the finest writer-director in the world" who summons her to Amsterdam.
I'll give a "last letter" here ... "D-," a grade that misses "F" only because I HAVE seen worse.
If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.
First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie.
Overall, 4 stars and only because it's him - probably the worst best picture Oscar since "American Beauty".
I don't want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get (or will get)a bigger success then the original movie.I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original.
Maybe the only way he could punctuate and hold together this cluster was with regular, loud, brain blasting, because if it weren't for the continuous bang-bang-blast, in-your-face-insults and face-punch scenes the story would've resembled a garbage pile.
Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago.
Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films.
I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time.
Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity.
He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him.
It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it.
I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due.
I watched this because my wife wanted to see it and the synopsis on the back of the DVD case made it sound interesting.
Not that it bores me to sleep, far from it...but it's more fun to watch in the evening because of it's setting and premise, NY morgue employees-turned-pimps who do it all at night.
That's because some of them are horrible, some are just OK, and only a select few are actually really good.
This is the kind of movie you need to see on DVD so you can skip straight to the performances, because there's really no other reason to watch this movie.
I'm not to happy with what I said because criticizing something doesn't mean attacking it or cursing it.
It's a post-"Laugh In" series of sketches which might've been personally felt out, but they fail to grab hold because, technically, they look terrible.
Of course we are privy to this intent because we are told so by the plot, while characters in the story are given bits and pieces.
I try to have a policy of not walking out of movies because I can usually find something good about them.
I have to stop writing because I'm finding that words can't describe what an awful experience it truly is.
I brought my 2 sons (11 and 13) to see this movie because one thought it looked funny.
), I was utterly offended because of what my children were seeing.
I am willing to bet my, and my future kids testicles in saying this is going to flop SO badly because you have to be an utter moron to like a movie like this, even taking into consideration that there are many morons out there... this would be too much for a large majority of them too.
Throughout the movie, I found myself uncomfortably irking in my seat hoping to fast forward the scene because of too much stupidity in it.
The only good thing about the movie was the Knight Rider scene, only because of that, and some SMALL laughs it get's 2 stars instead of 1.
I caught this on cable (nothing else on) and my jaw dropped minutes after it started and I kept watching because I truly could not believe it could get worse.
I'm being generous in giving it a 3, but only because I chuckled a few times at some of the 80's references.
He is incredibly funny in it, and I'm sure most of his stuff was improvised, because it's the only bright spot in a badly directed, badly lit, badly everything turkey that should've been released in January or February.
This made no sense because it wasn't Nick's fault that the letter and the ring were lost.
As it turned out, that line was better than any of the scripted dialogue in the film, and the best character was the grandma mainly because she was mute!
I've tried to omit spoiler content, because I fear that extended spoilers may ruin the fun!
The only two who can act were Dave Quimby and the actor who played Bobby Brazzel (I notice that his character is not in the credits on IMDb, is it because he doesn't want to admit he was in it?)
The story is depressing because the characters are all so hopeless.
Actually, I watched it because i expected the bellboy character to evolve through the four episodes.
In the first story, called "The Missing Ingredient," written and directed by Alison Anders, Ted checks in a clan of witches who try to perform a resurrection but can't because they lack a certain component in their spell.
I'm glad it came along when it did, because I was painfully close to ejecting the tape.
The only part I liked is the Rodriguez one because Banderas is really funny and the plot and the circumstances are fine.
Maybe it was because I was expecting so much.
I hope everyone had a good time making this mess, because the end result is not worth seeing.
I'm afraid I can't give a complete and proper review because I walked out on it after watching just over half of it.
Evidently everyone involved fees were high because the stench this one will leave behind will follow everyone who took part in this travesty of a drama to their graves.
The only reason I didn't was because I had already handed over my hard earned money to see it.
It is a great shame, because Leslie Nielsen has made some great films, none better that Flying High(Airplane) and The Naked Gun.
Leslie will never be as funny as he was years ago,it would take a miracle,the reason being he is accepting all these ridiculous scripts,just because hes in it doesnt mean it will change anything.Spy Hard has a very few funny scenes,and i find this film very similar to Nielsons other unfunny films like "DRACULA DEAD & LOVING IT" & "WRONGFULLY ACCUSED".I always wished their would be another Naked Gun,that is the only way Nielson can get his spoof fame back,now he is the same as any other star like Charlie Sheen in a spoof movie.
At times you really don't know what is really happening on screen or why, just because it doesn't make sense.
It was a wise decision because this is probably one of the worst comedies (and films) I have ever seen.
It's funny, but it's not brilliant, but I cannot complain because it did let me laugh.
What to expect: overexposed photography, lame fight scenes, non-existent "acting" (it should really be called "line-reading", because it's nothing more than that), ludicrous sound effects, fake gore and a plot lifted wholesale from "Marathon Man" with Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman!!!
I give this film 0 stars because it is truly terrible in every possible category, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch.
There are worse movies and there are far better movies, but I honestly watched it because I'm in the process of watching Ewan McGregor movies because he has this presence that is so strong that you just have to watch his work because he draws you in, and you end up sitting there watching, totally mesmerized.
But it's most of the time really boring as hell because you know what will be the end after five minutes of the movie.
And it's sometimes even more boring because its made that perfect.
Things fare better on the nudity front but the actors used aren't exactly model material, unusually there is full frontal male nudity although I only mention it because it is unusual & not because I'm gay or anything.
Too bad, because I'm fan of slasher films, just not this one.
I think no one will be fooled because it's just too obvious.
Anyway, the girls' boys are unable to stop him either, which makes this film hard to swallow because the killer isn't very imposing, except for his drill.
I love the first SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE partially for nostalgia value but mostly because it's a genuinely fun movie, so I figured I'd give a go at this one, ignoring warnings such as the 4 Star Joe Bob review on the front of the video box.
This is a low-grade horror film which has been culted into a reputation beyond its worth because of its director's involvement.
Of course she isn't the one because she's the heroine and we can't have the heroine turn out to be a bad guy.
Newbies, please don't bother because Ariel's friends' magical spirits and her all of the characters are altered and changed because this is way too emo for me, look for something better.
The dialogue is just absolutely silly (like when Bill and Chuck are fighting in the office and all Bill can say is as he's crashing through glass and junk is that Bill should be careful because Chuck's wearing white).
There's that ridiculous scene where everyone is getting covered in mud in the subway, and all the model rockets and the rock are not convincing enough, because you can tell their models, especially with the crappy explosions.
I gave it a 'two' because I was thinking, 'if the asteroid is in space, it's weightless - so why do they need 20 hundred-megaton warheads to divert it?
I skipped seeing Moonraker for a long time cause i heard it was awful, i wished i never saw it because it was 10 times worse than i thought it would be!
I say 'mini' because we know little to nothing about them and then they are gone.
Probably because the average shot duration is 0.2 seconds and you have no idea whose doing who as blood is shed.
Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) is a harried, put-upon nerd who gave up a prominent career on Wall Street because it was making him a nervous wreck.
Must be because it's a Russian production ...
I, like several others, was inspired to write my first review because of this film's blatant failure to deliver.
Decent movies that have touched on this idea at least possessed the ability to convey that message indirectly with added tension and development of suspense, where as this movie has its characters simply blurting out this intended message because the incoherent plot fails to do so.
Then we have the typical opinions of the writers about various subjects like Christopher Colombus discovery being insignificant or football making whole continents insane, those are also quite annoying, specially because of the emphasis they are given.
It makes me as a viewer feel like an idiot, because I am being pushed very unsubtly into an opinion which may not even be mine.
Not because it was exciting or incredibly interesting, but because our extremely boring Swedish teacher forced my class to see it.
The props is horrible, maybe because of the low budget or a lack of inspiration.
Perhaps "Tre Solar" is the perfect example of the majority of Swedish films - some wish-to-be-made movie is granted financial support not because it is something people want to see on the big screen, but rather because it seems like an interesting aim to some people (namely the academy granting money to support Swedish film-making).
Essentially, because it's NOT an "adaptation" of the source material: It's a straight line-by-line reconstruction of it, with no concessions of any note made to the adaptation process, to the differences in story telling technique which are required for film, as opposed to the written word.
Come on guys, us Lovecraft fans have to be forgiving occasionally by the general low quality and/or budgets of his related movies, but we shouldn't let this film off the hook just because it sticks fairly close to the original story.
I gave this film a rating of "1" because of the terrible things it contains.
But when small technicalities get in the way of justice, you have to compromise your morals and let rapists and murderers on the loose--just because the police may have performed a search without a warrant, or taken garbage out of a truck before the lever was pressed and it was dumped into the back with everyone else's trash, thereby becoming "trash" and not the garbage of a certain individual.
You'd probably feel pretty depressed knowing that confessed criminals are being let loose because of a small error in their arrest procedure, right?
I was wrong on all accounts because the story left a lot to be desired, I mean If I had cared about the characters a bit more perhaps I would've like it.
Plus, when Toto's all grown up, he starts seeing another woman just because she's a lot like his sister who blew up!
And, it just so happens that BOTH a Bonnie and Clyde style couple are seen nearby and are being chased by the police AND a plane is about to crash because it's almost out of fuel and the only place it can land is at Atwill's landing field!!
Funny enough, Serbs see him as stereotypical Albanian... Toni GojanoviÄ... is chosen for this role simply because he's Croat... Croatia have much better actors than him (is he an actor at all?
Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories.
It is not worth the price, and it is not worth for free, because it is deadly boring.
I gave it a 2 because the actors did not phone in their parts; but a 2 is a gift.
I won't go into the plot too deeply, because it's just plain stupid.
I was disappointed in him, because he is a great actor who doesn't belong in this movie.
I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke.
Also, the killer is supposed to be almost superhuman because its the last film.
(ANOTHER SPOILER)I'm sure Wes Craven wanted to make something unpredictable,so he made the outcome of the movie unpredictable,but in a BAD way,because it was Cindy's brother all a long,that just doesnt fit,Its impossible for Cindy not to know that she's had a brother for so long.The only good part about the movie is that...uh...there is no good part about this movie actually.I do have to give credit to the acting,it was pretty good,but that dosent make up for a bad movie.Bad ending,a BIG lack of entertaiment make Scream 3 a terrible horror movie.I give it a 3/10.
Just because you get your movie picked by a cheap distributor does not mean that the film is worse a damn!!
I'm sure it helps to assure that their film gets seen because its the look that film festival organizers seem to like, but for me a member of the paying audience I find it more on the order of lacking in creativity.
Its a shame because the story is a good one, even if the pay off is announced at the opening.
With "Clerks" and "Office Space", I was able to relate to the humor of the workplace because it was clever and smart.
There's, of course, the modern "socially-concerned-Hollywood", which depicts the Catholic Church as a decadent, senile and misoginous group of eunuchs and frigids, emotionally frail and codependant, obsessed with sex and rites, completely ignorant of the true meaning of human dignity and who do not understand that this church has to accomodate its ideas into the most common idiosincresies in order to take its place where it belongs: equal to and along all other churches, because they're all alike and none holds the absolute truth.
Their conrnerstones are Faith, Hope and Charity, and it's precisely because all faithful are united through Christ where its meaning relies on.
A film that argues that the Church might enforce the abolishness of Mass based on obedience is absurd precisely because such obedience is based in the Holy Spirit.
I know it was released at least 3 or 4 months ago although with films in this category the distributor is pushing to get it to video release as soon as they possibly can because the video release is where much more money can be made and in this case video release will surpass domestic profits.
I watched as PPV on home cable after reading some reviews and taking in the marketing several months ago, and only because I like Jennifer Anniston and I was bored with X-Mass shopping and am not very familiar w/Vaughn.
I watched 'Friends' seldom but when I did, it was because I liked looking at her.
"The Good Girl' was so good but yet made no more than her previous attempts in film work (I would imagine rentals put her over the top because rentals are rented mainly based on consumer 'word of mouth').
she gets to make more of this genre' which is a shame because she is capable of much more than the horrid 'Break Up' and I am afraid she will be stuck in this type role.
I say apparently based on reading other reviews here because I could't stand more than about 40 minutes of it.
The ending actually surprised me, however, because it was not your typical romantic comedy ending.
Thomas Van Hasebroeck (teasingly nicknamed Van Chickensoup) is a lifelong dreamer because he fears action and commitment after his precocious sister (Alice) is killed because of his demands that she do something that will prove she still loves him.
In part because of a fair amount of humor and whimsy but also because of the introduction of a third alternative to living.
There is not a single weak performance, especially amazing because the main characters are portrayed by a succession of actors of differing ages.
Even after breaking up, they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live, and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who (annoying).
In 2003 there is NO excuse for films in which the only homo characters are either raped or killed, 2/3 of the queer women characters speak of childhood abuse (because of COURSE no one would be a dyke unless "men did us wrong") and the bisexual character ends up with a man in the end.
was the best part (Tracy) because she had the most authentic rock & roll lady thing going on...she must have done her homework on donita sparks (L7).
I feel as if I've been served sour milk and then been told that I've just drunk something of aesthetic merit - because it made my eyes water.
Serbians are better than most at depicting this because they're that much closer to the event.
But in place of a story we get a series of static and talky (because they come from stage-plays) and disconnected scenes, all much the same as one another.
I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke.
I watched the movie because Ciaran Hinds was in it, and I normally LOVE his work.
I did find the updated dialogs annoying at times, because it often obscured the real motivations for the characters actions.
She seems to think that Jane is some feminist archetype, bold and sassy...when in reality Jane, because of years of oppression at Lowood knew "her place" yet, was so good, she answered Edward's questions truthfully...even if her answers seemed bold.
Jane only speaks up as the story progresses because of Edwards goading her, and her own desire to finally have a voice.
I would have fled, if I were Jane, because with all that yelling I would have been afraid of a man like that.
This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and CiarÃ n Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation.
Yes, people may want to kill him, but it's definitely not because he's written something that will change the world.
3) I watch movies because I want to be entertained or moved or see something intriguing, not because I want to walk away from it dumber than I was before.
I hope Shamalayn's ready to soak up ever bad review because by jove, he's earned it.
I wish the toilet paper in the restrooms had ads on it for this film, because metaphorically and literally, this movie deserves to be kissing my ass.
I can see it becoming a great cult film because there are so many people who desperately need to be re woken into life.
In fact it is exactly for this reason that it will become a cult film - because it does not deliver on any level.
Unbreakable wasn't exactly my type of movie, but I found it entertaining and wouldn't take issue with it because of the genre.
And the few things that were a bit of a surprise didn't help because they just seemed to me like an obvious attempt at being "cutesy".
It reminded me of when a lousy comedian takes the stage and you get a few people laughing at things that are completely not funny just because it seems to be the thing to do.
I have never written a review at this site before because nothing has ever moved me to do so like this dud.
Not many people question the rationality of Star Wars because the movies make their universe believable.
This makes Chee ever superior, which is very ironic, because in the books, Chee always feels vastly inferior to Leaphorn because of his much greater police knowledge, education, and experience.
The plot is not interesting or engaging mainly because I never cared about any of the unexplained characters.
In a movie as deprived as "The Crew" an inquisitive audience member anxiously awaits the conclusion, not only because they are overcome with pleasure that the pitiful waste of time is finally over, but also because the ending usually brings a sense of accomplishment to a production, regardless of how horrible.
Because it gives you an idea on how this movie is, it should have been called "The Crud" because that is all I got out of this piece of junk.
The retirement complex that these men live in is losing the old and bringing in the young (because they love the ocean view).
I can't say I hated this movie, because I did get quite a few chuckles, but no real laughs.
I give this movie a two, which is 100% mark-up for what it really deserves just because of the cinematography, set design, and editing.
This movie will trick you, because the DVD cover has Bruce Lee's picture on it when it's not even a Bruce Lee movie.
Maybe I was just to loyal of a fan to the great one, because I can't watch this without turning it off.
In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee's original version would've easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here.
However, this film is very disrespectful, because it shows real footage of Bruce Lee's funeral - including his actual dead body - just to further the plot of the story, which is the lead character (who is meant to be Bruce Lee) faking his death.
It wasn't easy, because not a single one of the purported bioflix came anywhere near the Truth.
of the partiers, who pretty much deserve everything that happens to them, because they clearly outnumber their captors, and have ample opportunities to disarm and even disembowel them, but blithely allow Alex to terrorize them in lots of nasty ways.
It's funny, because David Hess casually and openly discusses his relationship and interaction with the other actors in the film, but when it comes to talking about his wife's role in the film, he understandably becomes guarded.
Although it cost Â£18.99, I decided to buy it anyway because I heard it also featured Deodato's other film House On The Edge Of The Park, a film which I had heard quite a bit of hype about.
I think the reason I found this movie so uninteresting is because you are never asked to identify with either the hunters or the prey.
I used to have to sneak watching it because of the strong content in it and my parents wanted me raised in a more "sheltered" lifestyle but I am a survivor of tragedy in my own life and could never forget what these women went through just to live through to the next day.
The ruffian apologizes because he insists no sheepman could possibly wield a shooting iron with such dexterity.
Ha ha hmm  I gave it a 2 because I got through the whole thing.
i turned it off after 1hr 15. and then wrote this, cos i hate people who think this stuff is some how great, and if you don't like it, its because its just too cool to be appreciated.
There isn't really a moral to this silly story because let's face it, with a complex and controversial subject such as sex, in Crash with car accidents and people having sex with each other and other people, how on earth can there be one, for sure?
It's like an eight year old child that you get in stores or any other public place, begging their parents for more of what they already have and making a really big deal about absolutely nothing for no reason; it's like the attention hungry child who wants everyone to notice them or the co-worker who 'bigs' themselves up to the point where you just don't care because you don't believe what you're hearing Â in Crash's case, it's 'hearing'.
I feel like I can criticize it harshly because I am a Cronenberg fan and this was nowhere close to his best work.
It would have helped if Victor Mature's shifty circus owner were either less of a jerk or an out-and-out villain, and certainly if Vincent Price (who seems to have been cast as the ringmaster simply because of his moustache) had been given more to do than to stand around in unbecoming leisure outfits.
Just because there both up on stage or something?
I couldn't believe it was made in 1978 because I felt it probably was one of the training films made by new actors and actresses in order to develop their craft for Mia and Rock.
The print I viewed from the Mill Creek Entertainment set of 'Cult Classics' was of questionable quality; it was easy to pick out the night time scenes because they all looked like they were filmed completely in the dark.
Such films as MARIJUANA, MAD YOUTH, REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS were all schlocky trash that skirted past the boards because they were supposedly educational.
Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education!
Heavy-handed movie-making at its worst because there's talent wasted here.
The only reason I saw this movie is because it had a young HARRISON FORD play a small part as one of the hippie students on campus.
As someone who was involved with important issues like the Vietnam War and civil rights and free speech, I was totally offended by the film's nihilism, the ideas that students demonstrate just because that's what today's students do, and that there are no substantive issues involved.
In addition, (as I recall) we are clearly supposed to sympathize with the main character for being in trouble because he was caught cheating at an exam.
Most of this is because unlike these other teams, there is no distinct personality for any of the three Ritz brothers.
It's even more perplexing because the rest of the film is played so straight and the Ritz moments seem almost tacked on or an intrusion.
I would say, nice try, they did it because they have guts, less afraid to fail.
Or because they eat brains.
However, 'everybody else' must have liked it because the cast stuck around for D'Amato's next Caribbean offering, PORNO HOLOCAUST (1981)  OK, I admit I was turned on by the hardcore threesome between Manlio Cersosimo and the two Dominican whores he had up in his room, but the rest of the film was totally un-interesting, horror-wise or sex-wise.
It's worthy of watching at a drive-in, where you don't have to pay much attention to the plot because you are too busy ... doing other things.
The watch seller's mother went crazy because her husband died.
I was going to write an interpretation, but any interpretation will be unconvincing because the movie was so completely ambiguous.
Though it seems naive to assume that real life boredom will be film-worthy simply because it is real.
I will give the movie credit for the scene where the German rider falls off his horse because for some unexplained reason I found this rather amusing in a movie devoid of amusement
It's a pity because we haven't really had any good snow in these parts for many a year.
I know one of the experts interviewed, although I won't mention his name because he is tort-happy.
I say luxuries because we don't need it, but want it.
It seems like farm animals and 8 year olds made up this show, because it's really stupid and terrible.
I never, ever laugh at this show, unless I'm laughing for not good reasons because the show is so stupid and boring.
Just because the majority of the show may not make you laugh, don't be so negative.
Instead they should say "convicted unless proved innocent" because that seems to be the attitude of the police.
okay, now i know that this won an award at cannes but i can only presume that this is because the judges were working under the principle that seems to afflict literary critics from time to time.
I could not stop watching the movie because I was waiting for something to happen.
He is a Beatnik because he plays chess there as his front.
Not because they're mute, but because it's, y'know, artsy.
And clearly it is, as she decides to spare his life because of it; she's convinced it must reach civilization.
I didn't mention how Kurt Cobain really fits in because, well, he doesn't.
I believe this movie was a straight-to-video release because the studio had no faith in this movie to  stand up at the box office.
Sequels, by their nature, are supposed to be inferior to the original because they no longer have originality at their side.
Too bad, because the actors do some good work, but the movie, sporting a thankfully short running time, does itself no favors.
The thing is I don't know if I missed something because the final 20 odd minutes came out of nowhere & I actually didn't really understand what was going on.
He also has this bag of stuff which I presume is the killer bugs blood so they won't attack him but I'm only guessing because that's what happened in the first film.
Rear window works because we see everything from the main character's (Jimmy Stewart) perspective, namely the wheelchair, in his bedroom.
I shall now close this review, because if you're anything like me, you'll spend the next 5 minutes in hysterics.
Mr.Woodcock is a boring comedy which did not produce me any laughs because all the jokes are clichÃ©d and tired.That's a serious problem in a comedy.Billy Bob Thornton is criminally wasted in this movie.He's an extraordinary actor but this movie does not show all his talent.He should appear in more movies like A Simple Plan or Bad Santa,which really take advantage of his talent,and not in craps like School for Scoundrels or Mr.Woodcock.Director Craig Gillespie shows nothing of artistic zeal.His work is simply mercenary.It was very difficult to me laughing with this movie because,as I said,all the jokes are tired and they left to be funny 20 years ago.I do not recommend this movie.
I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because I have a step father who I often feud with.
In fact in one moment our "hero" cames off as a bit of jerk to because it seems he did not care much for her at all.
Over all what could of bin a good movie falls apart because things are never resolved, characters are unlikable, and sends out the message that abuse; verbal or physical is cool as long as your mom love him.
Whoever did the advertising for this "film" should get some sort of special achievement academy award because it had me totally fooled.
I did chuckle here and there, but that's only because Thorton is abusive to little kids.
Definitely worth seeing because of the leads, though, and the music (aside from Innis' inept crooning) is worth hearing.
BUT this movie tries to be both a comedy AND a serious movie, and fails in both guises it fails to be a comedy because the subject is way to serious, and it fails to be a serious movie because woodcock is exonerated at the end of the movie.
I saw this because I had nothing else to do... And, really, it seems I should've just stared at the walls for a couple of hours instead of watching this flick.
The name of Neve Campbell made me buy this DVD without any further reference, because I try to see her movies since "Scream".
Quite certainly the WORST movie I have sat through, with the exception of some really bad porn, but that's okay with bad-no-plot porn because its expected.
Just because it is an independent movie, it does not make this movie any different from a Hollywood, formula-driven spanker flick.
I can only imagine that Roger Ebert raved about it because he likes Neve and wanted to give her flagging career a boost.
huge surprise for me, because I thought there was no plot up until this point.
To those of you still determined to watch this because you think it might offer some sexual gratification I can only say again "THERE IS NO SEX IN THIS MOVIE This film is as entertaining as athlete's foot.
Running 81 minutes, about half of the scenes went about twice as long as they should have - which comes out okay, because the other half had nothing to do with story progression or character development.
That was okay, too - because the story didn't have anywhere to go to, and after the first 15 minutes, you don't want the characters to develop - you want them to either make sense or go away.
i have never rated a movie before because i have never been so compelled to rate a movie as i have this one.
I have to give it a couple of points because at least at the beginning it tries to give you a background on the reasons why Koteas did what he did, but the way the movie develops is poorly executed.
This picture was doomed to fail, because only Welles and Tarantino can do this.
This picture is good because it's bad and that's the reason you should see this film: to watch and learn how you shouldn't make movies.
Unfortunately this flick has a terrible and messed screenplay, and the story begins without any previous development of the characters, probably because of the restraint in the budget.
Harrari has as a henchman Bernard Worringer who is jealous because Yvette Mimieux likes the new American settler better than him.
Now for a big star, yeah, you take a dive on it because of the money invested and the name recognition.
Rating: 2/10, and only that good because Moment By Moment still exists.
Must be a very evil villa, because basically squatting was about saving empty buildings from neglect.
I will say this though, this movie didn't suck because of Adrien Brody.
Mainly, that the gang kill and rape indiscriminately, just because they can and depending on their mood at the time.
I watched BLOODY MAMA because I love Shelley Winters and wanted to see where Robert De Niro started as an actor.
Maybe it was meant to be a science fiction story about a retiree with some kind of special power to perform acts of magic that defy any sense of logic, because this movie defies logic.
I admit that if you haven't read the book you may enjoy the movie only because you don't know how good it could have been.
It was a little confusing figuring out who was who in the beginning because the robots all looked pretty similar (cheesy robot masks with moving jaws almost carelessly placed atop suits and ties that are hanging on coat hangers).
But honestly I thought it was a waste of time and money because it just got boring!
I really must have blinked once because I didn't see the nun either.
(where the film was made) No doubt still laughing their way to the bank because suckers like me rent this drivel.
And Porhowski does find him, in her car, and he's taking her back to the parking garage where his ordeal took place because she must die in his place (the price for his being set free).
You can't even really use the poor budget as a justification for this film because many of the problems have nothing to do with any budgetary constraints.
The problem with stuff like this is it makes no real effort to transport you to another time and place, because costume and set design alone doesn't work.
Some unknown barbarian who hails from Atlantis (yes, Atlantis of all places) tries to join a noblemen's army, gets rejected and humiliated, and ends up being their King because the dying King thinks its comical that a barbarian should take a crack at it?
a pity, because the static mummy-dummies in the cave looked very promising.
This is odd, because he seems to be a foreigner since he seems to know nothing of the local culture.
RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film.
I give this movie a 4, only because the special effects weren't too bad.
I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan.
I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie.
I gave it 2, only because there weren't more Caulkins in it.
He's got the title role as one nicknamed Scorpio because of the way he strikes.
Before I even start I have to tell you that I had to stop watching the movie before it was over because it was THAT terrible.
In a fit of boredom (or perhaps it was because the bullets broke his bottle of booze), Mitchum decides to stop merely watching the fighting from his balcony and tosses out a few grenades--endearing him to the Revolutionary leader (Gilbert Roland).
Sequels like this should be forbidden, because such movies are just made, because the original Film was a Blockbuster.
Maybe because of his lack of acting experience he was very unconvincing and unable to wake up the audience.
After Draco died he completed the constellation Draco, so tell me if it's completed because the last dragon is there how are there other dragons?!
You'd think the fire and ice would cancel out or explode or something, but anyway, If you liked Draco in Dragonheart, see this one because Drake (The young dragon) is the only similarity to the first film.
2/10  Three people left he party during the movie because it was so horrible.
Draco's death was significent because it was to be the last dragon's.
But, unfortunately, he should've just settled for 'no,' because when he shows up one night, she bombs out of the building and burns to death.
And of course, just because Christopher Walken is in a movie, doesn't make it a good movie.
because it must have been a cult that financed this movie.
Normally, I would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual.
And it's a pity, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all the Roman emperors.
One star, because there's no way to rate it lower.
The two boys hung in there during the movie; patiently (although there was A LOT of sighing) and I kept thinking...something good Has GOT to happen because Dustin, Natalie & Jason would never haven taken a movie with such a dead beat theme and ending.
I'm very sad, because this movie took my money, my time and got me in trouble with my family.
because they are Asian looking?
4 stars because its in color I guess, I actually would rather a lame show like friends over this and I always turn the channel when Friends comes on, so there ya go.
I gave it 3 points only because it looked good.
In my opinion, the largest is calling this a "docudrama" because it is patently NOT true in almost every aspect.
This is the first film I have ever felt the need to comment on and I am doing so because I was completely offended by the portrayal of the Marines and I want prospective viewers to be aware.
But because of its documentary style, there is a certain amount of dishonesty in "The Battle for Haditha" that I find difficult to accept.
I put watching this movie off for so long because I basically knew I was going to have mixed feelings about it.
If this was a fair movie it would be 99 minutes of Insurgents killing innocent civilians and 1 minute of us killing insurgents with some innocent civilians getting accidentally killed because the cowards hide behind women and children and use them as shields.
Some will say that I hate this because it's a "Chick Flick" but I disagree.
Jessica Lange comes closest, as Big Edie, to a convincing portrayal, since she builds her character from the inside out and doesn't depend on impersonation, but still falls short because she holds back (as has always been her habit as an actress), especially in the later scenes.
This is a well made film that to me became a big bore, because the 2 main characters were such hateful selfish nasties,I could not care for any of the film.
So Wizard of Gore only gets three stars, mostly for the stomach-churning stage sequences wherein the putative 'Wizard' disembowels, maims and punch-presses his victims to death in front of a live audience, only it's OK because it's all an 'illusion', only it's NOT really OK because the victims all die horribly soon after.
It's a compelling concept - murdering women in full view of an audience and getting away with it because the REAL illusion is that they weren't harmed - but it's literally the only thing the movie has going for it.
Such a shame because a plot like this deserved something better.
* Just to get this out of the way: Just because I give this a low score does NOT mean it isn't an enjoyable movie.
Just because a movie is obscure like this one does not mean it's gory.
Just because a movie is popular doesn't mean it's made by weak pansies.
She wants to book the magician on her show and later he wants to investigate him because all of his stage volunteers keep coming up dead hours later.
There is a tiny germ of a good story here but because the entire production is so sloppy and stupid, I can't recommend it to anyone except bad movie fans or those who actually believe that Lewis could direct.
It is almost impossible for anyone to pay attention to this film because for most of the film, nothing happens.
Playing for time Jennie puts on a Doctor Kildare act in trying to save Kendell's life only to end up killing her because she had no idea of what she was doing, which has her.
Many Irish films have failed because they try to be too commercial - The Courier (attempt at an Irish gangster film), I Went Down (attempt at an Irish Tarantino), the list is elsewhere.
The scenery is really nice (even though I personally can't stand being in the north of Sweden because of all the snow and the freezing cold), but lovely nature pictures of it doesn't make up for the complete lack of anything resembling a proper plot.
It's hard to put into words a description of this film because there are so many great things i can say about.
The only film i can compare this to are Lock ,Stock and Two smoking Barrels ,but this lacks the humour of that film ,or Get Carter because of Paul Bettany's Brilliant Michael Caine like performance.
There may be a merit in cinematography that raise the artistic value of this movie, but because the story is non-existent and the characters utterly unsympathetic & boring to watch, cinematography -- stationary in some scenes and moving in others -- somehow negate the enjoyability of the movie by focusing on the ludicrous aspect of tedium as if Sofia could bring back the element of silence inspired by silent films of the early 20th century.
Mr. Malick is a completely different filmmaker who knows how to convey the meaning of silence in the poetic setting because Malick has experience observing nature and human qualities as a former philosophy professor & translator.
Sofia did not because she doesn't get the aesthetics combined with silence without the backbone of a rich story and characterization.
The kidnappers are, in my book, scum because kidnapping is not cool at all.
I couldn't care less about what was going to happen to them because, well, they're scum.
And because the horror never registered, WHISPER was doubly forgettable.
The characters were not convincing at all in part because they were so oblivious to this kid behaving really strangely right from the beginning (He was never scared!
I found myself asking if it was a Lion's Gate film because of the the horrible films they have been putting out but to my shock it wasn't.
I usually don't give 1 or 2:s to movie because there is always something in a movie thats good, This movie however has nothing good in it.
I really like watching bad movies because i can laugh at them, But this isn't even funny, in any way.
One girl stabs another (it's not a spoiler because nobody can possibly care enough about the plot to be disappointed when the predictable happens yet again) and apologizes...but she's kind of laughing when she does it.
I'm the kind of person who quite often rents movies i know i won't like, just because laughing at bad movies can be almost as much fun as seeing something i really appreciate.
And why on earth it appeared on the big screen (because it did in Sweden a short couple of weeks).
I rate it 1/10, simply because there is no lower rating to give.
After seeing this, I'm actually considering upgrading the other movie, because I'm not sure there is another movie that completely lacks every quality in the way Camp Slaughter does.
I'll admit, the only reason that I ever wanted to see this movie was because it featured Peter Cushing in one of his last film roles.
I feel sorry because this movie is NOT one's typical B production...they shot scenes in lavish locations in England, Wales and France, and were thus beyond typical B stuff...
Not really much to say about this movie, only that Sean Connery is the only reason I gave this movie a two because he is a favorite actor of mine.
However, he does not really add anything to this one, but it just makes the movie surreal just because an actor of his caliber is in it.
this was categorized as a scary movie..........to a 10 yr old he may pee his pants but i don't think it should for the later,this i would say because the ghosts in the movie(a Totally GRUDGE MOVIE RIP-OFF)are shown a lot of times in daytime.......that totally ruins it.....we can clearly see the white powder on the ghosts..............and lot of the movie is 'The Shining' 's RIP-Off.........i don't remember whats scenes are but some like when the kid rides the3 wheeler bicycle and the camera follows him like the same way in the shining......and the background music too was playing same.....DAMN!!!
First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so.
At first, I was all hyped up to see this film, mainly because I am a fan of Michelle Rodriguez.
I have nothing bad to say about her, Taryn Manning on the other hand, well, let's just say that she must have had sex with all the right people to even have a career in show business because I just don't get it.
My advice: All fans of Michelle Rodriguez should watch this movie at home with the sound turned all the way down, because watching her is the only true enjoyment this dud of a movie has to offer, And That's All There Is Too It...
This movie is a disaster from beginning to end and I justify my summary because even though it is suppose to be a terror movie there is not terror anywhere.
Being a guy who's had a lot of dogs, I could tell that the dogs were in a happy mood for most of the time, which is good for the dogs BUT bad for the movie-watcher because all the tension is thrown out the window.
And the end was incredibly bad as well, because well I won't spoil it BUT the end is not satisfying.
YOU Know the Expendable Black Guy is going to be the first one to get it, because the Expendable Black Guy is always the first one to get killed in movies like these.
Wondering if the dogs piddled on the script when they marked their territory, because it certainly seems like they did.
The film was so boring with extremely terrible acting, the only good actress was Michelle Rodriguez and the film was watch able because of her but what is the use of having a good actress in a rubbish film?
It is not mentioned clearly that why these dogs are killing people without a reason probably because they see whipped cream & a cherry on top above people's heads.
My personal advice would be to avoid this film because it will save your money & time.
If it had a point to prove, they blew it by waiting decades to state it, because with time facts and footage are lost- so if this films investigators couldn't find facts or footage it must be because Moore was lying...dumb way to prove your point.
They're lucky Moore wouldn't waste his time discrediting these hacks, because all this film had going for it is Michael Moore's name.
Like ones who influence the world because they RUN IT- and not watch it on CNN while eating chips and thinking up conspiracy theories?
All of this falls flat, partly because it is done with strident self-righteousness, not the humor and humanity of Moore's own attempts.
But it mostly fails because using Moore's manipulative tactics to show how wrong those tactics are is a rather silly thing to do.
They showed a group of Flint High School girls doing some sort of irritatingly silly amateur schoolie play that mocks "Roger and Me" (the kind that only the mostly blindly adoring of right wing parents would be able to endure in their pompous little brats), and then the teenage girl "writer" of this play is interviewed, and she claims that Moore "fabricated" a news report that shows a female reporter stating that a Nightline report was cancelled because their news van was stolen, even as the scene from the film with her report is being shown over the girl's claims.
If so, its funny because I cant seem to find any mention of it anywhere else but on this site, about this film.
It's not because he's avoiding you.
It's because you are insignificant.
If this sounds ridiculously obvious, that's because it is.
I use the word "fan" loosely here really because while I've enjoyed his documentaries and come away from them believing I'd learned something, I've also had problems with them.
However this film fails to satisfy my doubts because it laces the documentary with such bias itself that you cannot extract whats true and what is just purely anti-Moore propaganda.
In short, the movie fails because it aims an empty gun at Moore and fires repeatedly.
The clown ghost stuff is interesting but because of lousy 3-D you really don't get a good look at it.
Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices.
But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women.
Obviously, because he's so wealthy.
In fact you know there's a piece out of it because McNally just all of a sudden shows up in an army hospital being treated for a gunshot wound you never see take place.
This straight to video film when I was young was quite good because it went back to the original style of Scooby-Doo the TV series.
King Ralph falls short in every possible way because it lacks proper foresight and planning, and the whole title, plot, and idea is quite "outdated" even for early 90's standards.
It's a shame, because the set-up (gauche, unclassy American takes over the stuffy British aristocracy) has good comic possibilities and Goodman is generally a fun actor to watch.
Alright, I just found this game rather bad, and I'm only posting this because I was surprised not to find any other bad comment.
It's difficult to comment on their acting because, aside from some memorized exchanges, it seems that most of the time the director simply aimed the camera their way and said, "Okay, make something up."
People chuckle and giggle because they can't seem to think up anything else to do.
(He sulks because she contradicts herself.)
He hits a dog while driving the Hummer because she's blocking his window.
Not just because of what happens to Katia and David, but for reasons the producers probably never intended.
Despite the stringing together of numerous interminable takes, nothing of interest happens and the setting is not particularly inspiring, largely because the director doesn't seem to know where or when to shoot his indulgently wasted footage.
Ultimately, their pointless wandering gets the two of them into a real pickle because they are doing it in a potentially dangerous place with no way of defending themselves.
When they are bushwhacked out in the middle of nowhere and he is brutally dealt with by three wayward scuzbuckets who strangely leave her almost unscathed, we can't develop too much sympathy for him because he's a jerk who has been sexually exploiting her the entire time.
We can't develop much sympathy for her, either, because she's obviously nuts and has been acting out at the slightest pretext over the course of this boring non-story.
The funny part is that I hired this because it was based on a game I'd played years earlier that had a great story and great characters!
but that's probably only because this one is quite short (the only redeeming quality of the movie).
She apparently goes off with Vittorio de Sica's character because she finds her husband boring and inattentive.
I decided to give it another chance in a real theater, because I'd heard that it's such a classic.
But because of the light opening, the characters are not three-dimensional enough to support a serious story.
I'm not going to even attempt to go into it in detail because it's so twisted and things come out of left field that I could never do it justice.
there really isn't a problem i can say with this, maybe the film should be on for a little longer because of the shortness of it due to so many other gangster classics surpassing the 2 hour mark.
Don't know why I'm posting this as it coming this late no one will be reading this, but I've got to get this off my chest because I've heard so many people say great things about this movie and I'm not just a little disappointed.
However they fall VERY short of the mark because through their obsession with their aerial money shots, they seem to have forgotten the human story of the true horrors of combat and what it does to the human soul.
Other fingernails on the blackboard include "9mm Spandau" machine guns (they were 7.92 Mauser) and "canvas" covering on the wings when cotton or linen were used because canvas was much too heavy.
This is appropriate, because while I would call "Lock" primarily a comedy, this was most definitely not.
The films are related because of Malcolm McDowell, who figures prominently in both films, by the way that the young Gangster 55 is photographed glaring into the camera in a very similar manner to McDowell's Alex in the earlier film, and by the general level of violence.
I went because I read some very strong reviews.
As I said it's an OK way to pass the time, just don't expect a masterpiece because this ain't it.
However, the story is very disappointing, and I particularly liked two scenes: the nudity of the gorgeous and sexy Claudia Lyns, and the funny line of Sheriff Jones, when he says to his skeptical assistant: "- Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly."
And that only because I kept waiting for something to happen.
It's the type of production that one does for money only, not because one has a real story or a genuinely artistic view to a story.
I had high hopes for this because: 1) It was called LEGION OF THE DEAD and had box art of some ancient Egyptian tomb king and a whole army of undead troopers.
It is gross, not funny because it is too simple.
Crispin plays the two brothers Stanley and Simon who are the same person after all because Stanley turns out to be schizophrenic and playing the role of his dead brother Simon (whom he obviously killed like everyone else).
And for those who are wondering, at the end the twins have our heroine Kate trapped in a basement and have apparently engaged in some intercourse with her because I assume they have had children,(TWINS!).
Hope this helps, but if not I don't care because you've seen the movie against my suggestion, and I've got better movies to waste two hours of my life with like (Insert movie of choice here).
That's right there isn't, because this movie doesn't deserve to be next to the immortal first film.
Her character is idiot, boring and silly and Dunaway chews her ridiculous lines with unjustified gusto because her Selena remains the lamest and worst of all the villains from the Superman-related movies.
But really Dunaway is the only reason for watch this movie because her camping is so over-the-top and her appearance is so bad than she becomes fascinating to watch in its terribleness.
In the backhoe sequence, we're asked to believe that the entranced landscaper could wander around the crowded town without actually looking at anybody, because Selena's spell dictates he'll fall in love with the first person he sees.
You know how sometimes you rent a horrible movie because you expect to be amused by it's awfulness?
This rivalry remands me to contrast between Snow White and the wicked stepmother because also here the witch hates her arch-nemesis because she's more young and more pretty.
Sure the difficulty of production not must have helped Odell: at the last minute Cristopher Reeve, that must have been Superman in a little cameo, leaved the project (perhaps because he their have realized the narrowness) and Dolly Parton that was the first choice for the villainies role disowned, judging truly grotesque and silly.
1 that it got caught up in this cycle, because it is a very good film, that maybe fails only in overambition, and that's not something we get to complain about very often.
I don't think there was a connection to supergirl there because she was never mentioned again.
I say fortunately because otherwise I would have had another film on my "worst film ever list".
A solid 1, and come on, don't vote this 10 because both you and I know it's not worth it.
As for those who credit this as being a great Bond film because of its likeness to Ian Flemings work... so what?
I suppose that's because of the clothes, which is an interesting study of the extremes of the time.
Its easy to see why people think this film is over violent and trying to shock, but then thats because they just don't get the finer nuances.
They are uncomfortable with people being portrayed as being comfortable with violence, and thats because the director wants you to be, and because the Actors are so good at it.
If this flim-flam plotline wasn't enough you've got Eddie Griffin, a black comedian who expects you to laugh just because of the fact that he's black.
And I think it's because the movie tries to be too much.
There really is no way to descibe or spoil the movie because the plot is such a mess.
I'll even spot them a point because someone who had never seen Jumanji would find much of Zathura new and exciting.
I'm not giving it a point because it was irritating enough to get really old.
the guy must have a vendetta against the female race or something because the young (18 years old!!!)
The one judge x's everybody before they start and then when the other two don't because they want to give the talent at least a chance to perform, he reaches over and x's their buttons for them stopping the talent.
No we tune in because we want to see the talent good or bad.
Take the x buttons away from them, they don't know how to appropriately use them and the show is very aggravating to watch because of it.
I don't normally ever watch network TV, and i'm not really big on reality shows at all, but i have been watching this because i thought it would be somewhat interesting.. turns out to be a poorly executed show that'll probably never recover from it's first season without some major changes (although it has already been renewed for a second season in '07).
i'm sure no one wants to see a little girl cry because she came in front of America and got told that she sucked, but does that mean she automatically gets pushed into the finals?
When it comes down to it the judges, and America, do not consider anything other than singing to be real talent, and that is a shame, because the variety is what could be the shows strongest feature.
Let me start by David Hasselhoff just because he is the only I know.
The fight scenes are poorly shot, primarily because there are no stunt people and the principal actors do their own "fighting."
I can't even begin to tell you what this movie was about because the photography was so bad.
But dear "Hollywood", you can't make a box-office hit if you first of all take the Danish humor away, and then take out some scenes from the movie, just because (my own opinion)you think it doesn't suits the American people.
Don't watch it in German, because what they speak there has nothing to do with the original..
And it's a pity because the first hour is genuinely eerie, with a fittingly claustrophobic mortuary as the ideal setting.
To be honest I could go on and pick at this film and break the maximum word limit on this because I was so disappointed in the overall quality of horror films and how Shrooms had the potential to break the trend of bog standard clichÃ© ridden horror flicks but no!
The result is an incomprehensible mishmash; ugly (not so much because of gore, as there is surprisingly little, but the direction), dumb and, in the end, just dull.
The twist should have been suggested a little earlier in order to hold the audience's attention because honestly I think that was the only slightly interesting thing out of the entire film.
I was able to come to this conclusion because of the repetitive mechanics that befell every incident relentlessly.
They're obviously spoiled brats because the only thing on their mind when they're in freakin' IRELAND is getting their hands on some magic mushrooms ASAP.
VotD girl gnaws on a mushroom that the Irish-but-British guy specifically said not to eat because it's poisonous.
Let me start by saying this: if you liked this movie, good for you but please don't think that I don't "get it" simply because I didn't like it.
Since childhood I've found the actors playing the bad guys more interesting than the main characters,at least till about 1970 or so.Many that I viewed in the 1950's didn't last long in a movie or TV program because they were an early victim to the star.Some eventually went on to make names for their selves but for the most part I liked them more when playing minor roles.Some of those minor role villains are in this movie and I found them very entertaining.There's Neville Brand playing King Fisher,a good performer but sometimes a little bit to scary even for me when dealing out punishment.Others like Faro (Lee Van Cleef),Sundown Whipple(John Doucette) and Blackburn(Claude Akins) are in top menacing form.While not a household name another quality performer is Robert Middleton playing Ben Ryerson.Whether playing a politician or a mob boss he gives a quality performance.In this movie he's a bit grubby looking but handy with both a gun and a knife.Then there's Willie (Elisha Cook Jr) one of Fisher's men.He usually bursts into a room big eyed bearing news but has to grab a quick drink before speaking.So much to my delight the cast includes a rouge's gallery of personal favorites,almost like a dream come true.For those who like the good guys the movie leans more towards a nightmare.Jack Palance plays Jacob Wade the main character.As usual he has the look of a strong tough looking man.His performance is better than usual but that just means it's not as stiff as usual.The story lacks a bit of direction also.Those two points are forgotten because of Anthony Perkins who plays Jacob Wade's son Riley.His part lacks direction or maybe a director as it seems like he or someone else wants to sabotage this movie.First off he's too old and big to be playing the part of the son.When he does show some sign of a emotion it's fitting more for someone at least 10 years younger than him.To the simple statement that his mother(deceased) was a fine woman he responds blandly"talk about my mother again and I'll kill you",really off the wall.Elaine Aiken gives a good performance and is nice looking.In another comment it was basically said her character with it's good qualities has no reason to be interested romantically in the wimpy Perkins character,that's hitting the nail on the head.So this movie was just about what I expected,the minor roles out shining the main characters.One of the main characters looked like a good friend must of gave them the part.
Naturally the reason it's been empty for so long is because everyone has heard the tale about the ghost that haunts it......many years ago a young girl lived there, with just 2 servants to look after her after her parents died, and when the girl too died, the servants (a married couple) were bequeathed her fortune; as was her wish for their kindness.
So I say, rent this movie, watch it, comment on it, and give it 10 stars, because I sure did.
That's because he's talented.
That's because she is talented.
I didn't like this movie because it was populated with a bunch of mindless losers.
If not, you should stay away from this one, because that's 90 percent of it.
I was especially impressed with Elliott Gould, partially because I haven't always liked him in other films.
Back at the time this movie was released, it was interesting because it dealt with social issues that were then current.
People tend to skip these lost gems, because they consider it to be rather 'ancient' - however it is so good, that if the same script and direction were used without any amendments, but with a different cast offcourse today, this movie would stll be a hit, and would even score at the Oscars.
Although I never expected to say this, because I'm a non-religious person, the gospel choir's rendition of "John the Revelator" sends shivers down your spine.
The title seems part of today's culture but not the film itself; that being the case, it's too bad because there's buried treasure here.
I rented this movie because I remembered one scene from 35 years ago.
The only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number, because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring, even if you really like the performer(s).
In fact, if you watch the DVD of the first film, you find in the deleted scenes and "Making-of" section that the Bluesmobile is supposed to be "magic", because it was parked each night inside a power transformer.
He gets involved with a jewelry store robbery because of his boss's gambling debt and an innocent guy ends up dead during the getaway.
Does David have a sense of moral superiority because he no longer has use of his lower limbs and therefore has suffered more than most people?
His character is doomed, because what happens to him now is not going to stop, and the worst part is that he knows it.
Sometimes I see Almodovar as a kind of Victor Hugo of cinema because he makes various complicated scenes not coherently inserted in the film that you should put in order step by step.
He probably will be strongly criticized for the oral sex scene, on grounds that he is abusing disabled individuals, just like he was almost damned by feminists because of the looong rape scene in Kika.
Curious, seeing this after the smash hits of "Todo Sobre Mi Madre" and "Hable con Ella", because this movie sort of prepared the viewers to what was coming.
He does not go and because the gun goes off the police arrives a couple of minutes later.
if one were to guess the year, one is tempted to say early 60s--say, 1962 or 63. but the film is significant because it documents a solid, burgeoning beach culture which had been in place since the years immediately following W.W. 2. this film is a rich summation of what transpired on the beaches of southern California in the 1950s.
I really enjoyed this film because I'm interested in going into the film business and it would be fun to be an extra in at least one film.
Though I expected him to be the down point because he was playing a Christian, he pulls it off with lots of confidence which proves he is a legend in Bollywood.
The movie begins when Kishenlal (Pran), a taxi driver for the gangster Robert (Jeevan) returns to his wife Bharati (Nirupa Roy) and sons after spending many years in prison because of a crime committed by Robert.
So Amar, Akbar , and Anthony all end up at the same place in the hospital because they have the same blood type of there mother(NO DUH!!!)
Also the girl who fell in love with Amar did horrible acting at first she said she stole money because there family was poor but she looked like she was giving false information(worst crying in a movie I've seen) I wouldn't believe her no matter what but it turns out she told the truth.
I guess the first one is closest to the "Night Gallery" series, but this film is much better than what comes after it because of Serling's strong involvement in every tale presented.
It's easy to see why studios won't release these again, for the same reason they don't release the other great classics of the past (Bronco, Sugarfoot, Laredo, The Untouchables-it's even hard to find some everyone knows about-Gilligan, the Hillbillies, Big Valley), because they want to make audiences think the old classics were the ho hum shows they air today so they won't lose audiences from new show.
The final story is relatively inconsequential, dealing with a nazi war criminal who is hiding in South America and is identified because of his association with a particular picture in a gallery.
All in all, this is a very entertaining piece of TV film-making that classic movie fans will enjoy discovering because of the classic stars who all give solid performances.
But NIGHT GALLERY deserves more respect and attention because of its overall creepiness than for the debut of a young "genius".
I can't wait to see the DVD release of this film with the features and commentary because it is one of those rare Noir films that stay with you.
Kelly is the ultimate Everyman who has become a cop because his father wanted him to, and whose wife unwittingly emasculates him because she earns more money that he.
Some bad movies I've seen in my entire life have been considerably good, simply because they've aged well enough to build a more entertaining purpose.
I gave it two extra stars because I was a kid growing up in Coney Island in the 70's, so there was a big nostalgia factor for me.
(When a woman tries to sleep with a gay men, he's tells her he can't because he's 'queer'.
The core scenes are all talking heads; the co-eds talking about guys on the dorm, the young people and their parents talking about sex, the woman who "prostitutes" for free because she likes it, his interview with a prospective model, even the "man in the street" comments about "how birds do it."
It's no accident that the film is interracial, because Funt's belief is that you can't judge a person by their looks.
While fairly average as far as musicals go, this movie is noteworthy for me because it is the only film that features my two favorite actresses, Priscilla Lane and Ann Sheridan.
Instead, I got a movie that sounded like a sex ed documentary, because it was too melodramatic to be considered a romantic comedy.
Eve (Emanuelle Chriqui) character was okay because of the message she wanted to bring up to the audience.
I'll give this movie a 1 out of 10, because I cant give it a 0.
The girl's performance was okay, but she has basically screwed over her entire reputation because she chose to be in this movie.
When I came across the DVD on Amazon I was only interested in buying it, because it had National Lampoons plastered over the front cover.
I liked Adam and Eve because it is a nice romantic comedy which contains college humor as romance ass-well.
She caves in and tells her deep, dark secret because one of our dopey investigators had the audacity to ask twice.
Goku is completely annoying and stupid while Vageta (Who's my all time favorite DBZ character) just stands around moping because he can't defeat Brolly.
It's a shame, because had attention been devoted at any stage to actually having characters or making the (actually quite promising) story more engaging it could have been pretty entertaining - the fighting is well executed after all, even if it's entirely one sided.
It looks more like Broly's training or something like that, because Goku and co. can't even hit him because he's too strong.
It's slow upfront but when the first person ('Franky', Frances) dies of starvation because the girl is on an extreme diet, the movie gets intense.
My father would get mad because we didnt care if we ruined the vrc as long as we could watch our movie.
I guess the way Sirius always said it made us confused because we called her Malta.
This movie is the longest of all, and the length isn't just because of long-winded fights that DBZ has become infamous for (at least in my opinion).
It looks like someone with a great deal of talent but a short attention span got bored with the film and rushed it to an ending because he was sick of it.
Too bad, because it had great promise.
This could have been one of the great movies if the script had been tighter because it is very well directed and performed with some excellent camera work and great music.
I first bought this movie because i had grown up with Robotech and absolutely loved the Macross-part of it, plus that i love Macross Plus, and I thought that the original could'nt be that bad.
This movie must have taken at least a few people's breaths away when it was initially screened in 1984, because, even when you compare it to Japanese animation of the time (including Hayao Miyazaki's much-lauded feature debut Nausicaa), the level of detail and movement on display is mind-boggling.
Unbeknownst to them, other people are also interested in the cannon because it contains the crown jewels of England: a history professor and Abner's boss, who moonlights as a crime boss, and an British secret agent who wants to recover the jewels for England.
I believe that Ernest Goes to Camp and Jail are the best "movie" movies of the series but my favorite for general comedy is Rides Again because of the small asides that Ernest goes into during the film.
This 100-minute film would have much better chopped to 80 or 85 because there are some legitimate laugh-out-loud scenes.
The quality of the actors that take part in this movie was only possible because they are friends in real life and didn't see the movie as a commercial product in the first place.
I gave one point because the kid that played Maniac in the movie I could see turning into Tom Wilson.
I was excited when I heard this movie was coming out, because I am a fan of the games.
On the negative side it's a film which I won't want to watch again in a hurry simply because once the twists are revealed the films impact is all but lost & I just couldn't get my head around Liz as a character or her supposed motivations.
Anyway, I'm a bit surprised because that actually sounds like quite a lot of money to me at almost $8,000,000 & considering there's no big name actors, no special effects, only two or three locations & functional rather than spectacular production design it seems a lot.
I remember this being the first movie I ever felt like walking out on, and only stayed because I figured at the time that there had to be some redeeming value to it.
1/10, and only because Saffron Burrows is good looking enough to fool you into stopping if you channel surf by.
Unfortunately, one must try to ignore all the goofs to enjoy this movie, and it is not all that easy, because there are so many of them.
But I've given this film 10/10 because it is so damn entertaining.
I wasn't expecting much, because the back of the DVD shows are not at all representative of the film.
I saw the movie because I'm a Keira Knightley fan and in that respect it was good, she brings a great performance as usual.
First of all, I avoided this movie when it was first released because of the bad reviews.
I say "objective" simply because I have never been exposed to the hugely popular game series, so I was seeing this as a film, not as a spin off (in which case I'm sure it would come across worse, simply because when you're used to one set of actors portraying your favourite characters a new team will never fit the bill).
It's just wrong and the main problem is this subplot of everyone hating this guy just because he's a "pilgram" decent.
And it isn't like the crew have the excuse of not having played the games, because the director is the same guy who oversaw their creation.
The nice thing is, that if you bought this because of all the hype about the underage Kiera Knightly flashing, you won't be disappointed and you see a decent movie as well.
I will get to see it for free and see if it's everything my friend promises it is, because I've got a perverse obsession with bad movies!"
"Wing Commander" gets a three, because of it's parody value and because it isn't as bad as my friend promised but it's close.
He told me he was going to buy it because it looked really bad.
A group of film makers are struggling with production, when one of the kids (I mean "kids" literally, because these actors look as if they were only 17 or 18-years-old.
So the kids spend the night roaming Hollywood in search of some house, trying to jog Lewis's memory along the way, because Lewis is a moron and can't remember where the house was.
They find the fortune, the director kid is upset because he lost Lewis, the old director is bankrupted because the kids exploit a fraud he committed back a few years ago, and to end the movie, they drive away in a limo with guess who driving?...
And as you're on your way down, don't hang onto me for support, because I'm not giving any!
But he is missing something, because her children are her world and they are in their own world, always taking.
He is portrayed as a husband to die for, thoughtfully preparing a surprise for his wife's birthday which is more or less thrown in his face because the selfish needs of the children come first.
There is a very persuasive argument to be made for such expansion of time because it is in these gaps of technical information that the audience's imagination is engaged and given the space to roamÂand few things are more vital if the art is to be successful.
It strikes me that this sort of stuff bewitches the French etc at their film festivals because they fatuously see in it a corrective to the Curtis/Grant Cool Britannia, "red London bus school" of UK film-making but in reality it's just as false and fatuous -- all that Leigh's ladelled out here is an unappetising,lardy dollop of council estate ennui, over two hours of it, with precious little action and few of the light comic touches that he usually throws in to keep us engaged.
I've just read some of the other comments on this film and am now engaged in a bout with writers block because in no way will I begin to shed a better light on our subject film than the engaging analyses already posted on this site.
I may as well bestow kudos to the rest of the cast as well because their contributions, both individually and collectively, greatly augmented the story line as a whole.
He doesn't care much for life anymore, because his wife no longer loves him.
Mike Leigh makes this movie as a sociological study because he wants us to be confronted with the state of mind of the working class of now.
While the film excels at its realistic portrayal of the French Resistance, it is a film that would be "box office poison" in America because its commercial marketability is pretty limited.
I really liked watching it in the beginning because the characters seemed real but after Doherty left, everything fell apart.
I liked this because it has a goo story and the acting of Patric Stuart was superb, he was the real hero of the show.
This is mainly because our author lived in the days when men wrote about other men as adventurers, and left all the romantic stuff to women authors!So there is room for a little poetic license, or the film would be made exactly like the original!
We discover what a completely manipulative sociopath, who is instrumental in the death of her friends because she wants to sleep with Harrington.
I started watching this movie with some hope to see the journey and life of my heroes from the book, but I couldn't even stand to watch half an hour of it, because it has nothing to do with the book and it's made so so bad.
It's too bad that the script was so lame because Nemo seems like the kind of character Stewart could have had a lot of fun with.
Speaking of the monsters, one of the worst has got to be the giant rat, because in certain scenes instead of running, it almost looks like it's hovering over the grass.
I won't even comment on the pirates, because they are uncomfortably childish.
I've seen some things I didn't necessarily enjoy just because of him being in them.
You won't have fun ripping it to shreds, because you'll probably be asleep or disturbed for most of it's duration.
I was looking forward to watch this film when I knew the local TV station was going to air it because I liked the book.
The kids may enjoy this simply because they are kids, but this is not something I would recommend for a serious fan of Jules Verne.
d)The door key magically appeared in Martin's pockets some time before, because he won't let us know who gave it to him, and if we knew it, that would mean that someone else knew about the existence of the hole, and that would have made it too complex for the writers.
That would because an alien craft has crashed outside Bellefleur, and is now sitting under a cloaking device.
I think because she wishes she would have done it herself.
I remember the Monday morning after THAT SINKING FEELING received its first broadcast on British television in 1982 , all my classmates were discussing it: " Did you see that bit where the guy said ... " and I remember thinking that my peers had been watching another film because I recalled distinctly hating it .
I actually love this film but perhaps thats because I grew up in Scotland in the 70's and it does have a lot of "in" jokes which foreign audiences could easily pass by.
I have no idea if it has aged well or not because I haven't seen it in over 20 years but I will say this in it's favour/defence, "That Sinking Feeling" gave Glasgow a voice and a character that's rarely been heard before nor since!
The character of Morgan Pym, it's one of my favorite characters ever, close to solid snake, because he's tough but out of clichÃ©s, the guy also have feelings inside, which is actually good.
I cannot say less, at the beginning I didn't want to watch it, I thought: "another mix of gore and mystery with nothing good to make you think" (something like millennium) But finally I found at least three good reasons because the Collector it's one of the best shows 1- Unpredictable: from the first episode you'll never know when there's a "happy ending", the stories are very dark but there's no use of unnecessary violence, everything has a reason.
It is especially fulfilling because it was made before American movies became dominated by crass taste, coarse language, and adolescent mindsets.
It is my favorite animated movie because of how beautiful it is.
i saw this movie on October 28 of 2005 and i have to  say that its a very great movie because it was 10   years older and its most impressive than others "when i saw this movie i think was real because  was SO real that i have change the channel to CNN  and other news ,i want to buy this movie or recorder  from TV but i cant but unless a question a have only say that this is that type of movies that you  need to see because the simplicity is the best  this is a drama movie but i have to say that this  movie scared me a lot more than other how scream or that type of movies
But I'm afraid to say that is because I distinctly recall it as being the worst film I ever saw.
We knows he's in charge because he has the word BIGMAN engraved on the back of his jacket.
I am indifferent, having had no personal experience with it of any kind, but this film did not convert me either way because it comes off more as a student film.
Not necessary, as it turned out, because the film seemed twice as long as it actually is.
I decided to give it a chance because I knew and respected the work of the American actresses in the film.
I especially liked how it touched on human trafficking and sex slaves because many people do not know that some prostitutes are forced into the profession.
Denise Richards and Daryl Hannah do little to save the anemic movie, mostly because their script is almost non-descript, predictable and totally lacks any concept of tension.
Shame really because it could have been good, especially when you remember that the original Exorcist wasn't released here in the UK for fourteen years!
The two female leads I thought really did a great job,Yeah, and there both hot, but the sex scene was so believable, and were good at their parts.Of course nothing will ever beat the Exorcist because it rocked, however this one held its own.
The casting was great because the main actress does a good job acting and her eye shadow gives her a scary look.
I enjoyed this one much more than the Fog 2005 because I fast forwarded through most of that one and that one is successful only because it is a remake and it had popular actors/actresses.
We rented this movie because we were looking for something scary to watch, I had seen The Exorcist before so this movie looked like it would work.
If you like to watch a confused priest, who wants to act funny and prevent the apocalypse to happen then maybe this is your movie, but definitely not the movie for me :P My personal opinion is that this movie really sux, and i had to write that down, because i saw the ratings here on the movie and expected something good.
With the aforementioned description, it seems that the film shouldn't be taken seriously because most of the mentioned elements make a hint to black humor cinema.
For some moments the demonic references may creep you about because most of them are very accurate.
Other moments will make you laugh out loud mainly because of the irreverences of the crazed priest and JosÃ© Mari, or because of their physical humor (it plays an important part).
In Madrid, because all the signs of apocalypse looks like it.
One thing is certain, they have to hurry because Christmas is only one night away...
It wouldn't do much if I named all the actors of this movie because their names don't ring a bell.
Gorehounds be advised because the cover and the title may make you think it's one big blood fest.
Finally after a long wait I got the chance to check out this flick, and what a damn shame I wasn't more safe when buying it the first time, because this was a really good flick.
I really hope this film gets more popular, because it definitely has the opportunity to have a large fan base.
And thank God for that, because fights scenes tend to get bloody with some good all classic chambara effects, such as the blood geysers and chopped of limbs.
I think the premise could have been interesting - the idea of 3 people's lives intertwined because of a winning lottery ticket.
He wants to make a financial killing real bad because he thinks that money will buy him respectability which he craves like nothing else.
The film is like a 90 minute version of a Twilight Zone episode, but that's not a putdown because some really classic stuff was done on that program.
That may have been an asset to the film because it concentrates on the story and the characters created.
Three Strangers is a B picture gem, one of those low budget sleepers that Hollywood puts out to great critical acclaim that turn a profit because of the low budget.
Movies like this aren't made anymore simply because movies like this don't really sell, unless they are being made exceptionally good.
The movie in the end is perhaps a bit too 'light' to consider it a real film-noir, also because it features quite an amount of subtle black comedy.
Lorre on the other hand provides the best performance because the grey cocktail of good and bad touches the viewer.
I'm not just saying that because I invested in it.
All of the idiots who gave this movie bad reviews are full of crap because this movie completely owns.
Whoever said that this movie has a crappy script or is not believable is a total moron, because this movie is epic.
This movie is exceptional in the way it show the common drug dealer it speaks to me because I live where this happens all the time; people dying because of drug whethe they are friends, or enemies.
If you rent it watch it early because there is a good chance that you may want to watch it again.It had me waiting and guessing whats next.
Also the acting from the "old" cast is so much worse than the "young" cast, I especially didn't like ALLEN PAYNE's character, perhaps it was because he looked like he needed to do number 2 on the bathroom half or all the time through-out the movie.
I think that is some of the reason for the amazing performances, because of the colorful environment that they had to work in.
Everybody thought this movie would disappoint because it's a sequel to a bad sequel.
I'm sure ur very impressed and extremely anxious to see this great film but hold ur horses :) Drive-Thru is a real test of character because it takes a real man/woman to see this movie till the end, where, like all great movies, it leaves room for a sequel.
Spike must have had a lot of suits because he gets soaked to the skin in several chapters.
Fantine's role has been reduced to just a cameo, and I have not decided if this is a good or bad thing, because the interpretation of the character couldn't be more wrong.
They were unable to change anything because they were being investigated by the draft board, who did not believe that they were gay, which of course they were not.
Notice that I have yet to mention the word 'thrilling' or 'thriller', which is extremely sad because this movies is obviously supposed to be just that - a thriller.
The less said the better, not because its bad, rather because its the sort of film that is best left to its own devices.
The screenplay from The Canyon does not offer too many surprises, but it produces an adequate level of suspense and tension thanks to its good structure.One of the fails I found on this movie is that I think a few scenes could have easily been deleted from the movie, not because they are boring, but because they add nothing to the story and they break the rhythm a little bit.And then, the characters make some stupid decisions and they occasionally do not behave naturally.
I immediately became intrigued because it seemed like the title of show that could possibly be somewhat interesting.
First, the show's main character is in a sad situation because he is working for the devil.
Second, demons and fallen angels are never righteous because of their natures.
However, some of the plots are enjoyable because they remind me of the Ghostbusters movies and cartoon series because the characters used "vessels" to capture demons and send them back to hell.
I first wanted to see this show because I am such a Kevin Smith junkie.
The show earned three stars because it wasn't the actors' fault.
Bret Harrison must've inherited some of Topher Grace's comic timing on that 70's Show because he's great as Sam.
One of the main reasons the show works is because of its hero, Sam Oliver.
I'd longed for a show that had not only a love interest for the hero who *stayed* on the series (and wasn't booted off simply because fangirls didn't like her), but also had a truly likable relationship happening between the hero and the love interest.
Don't miss out on this show just because it's on the CW.
So I made my self clear and because the review needs 2 be 10 lines long I need 2 make usless points.
I really hope this show becomes a hit because I would hate to see it canceled.
I recommend people give this show a shot because it's a keeper this new Fall season.
First of all, because the camera work is amazing, especially in light of the fact that the film was shot in 1978.
If you have seen the movie on TV you have missed out a lot , because the quality of the images deteriorates considerably, so I suggest you watch it in a cinema, although this could prove hard.
OK the acting can be a little iffy at times ("those kids do look up to you" said in a bit of an over the top way) but the story line, humour, and fights (very enjoyable at the party, not as much in Mexico because of the more serious tone) are all very good.
Hopefully Sanrio reproduces this classic on DVD because there is definitely a cult following.
The characters are guys almost any surfer from the late 60's and early 70's can relate to because of the bonding that would take place on the water.
Remake this movie...I hope not because it captured the essence of the California beach scene then and William Katt, Gary Busey and Jan Michael Vincent portrayed 3 very typical California surfers of the time, and it would be almost impossible to capture that spirit again.
As it approaches the end, the movie gains rhythm; the final, in every sense, encounter with the big wave is rendered greatly, surfing action is truly gripping, we perceive the strong emotion when facing and struggling against this force of nature, and we also get more intimate with the characters's inner emotional world, probably because the confrontation between man and nature, with the undeniable sense of human finiteness as compared to the greatness of nature, always reveals the real quality of human life.
It's because I am.
At the heart of this movie is this purity... and after the draft, relationships, addictions, and just plain adolescent insanity, the characters find that their friendship is still alive because of a common love.
I won't say that everyone would like it, because there is always someone who will hate it.
Lombard could pull it off for the same reasons Katherine Hepburn could do it, because she had the refinement.
I will start with the introduction for asking if any of you ever watched a b horror movie from the eighties, yes you will adore this one because the movie gives all the clichÃ©s and serious acting applies for another star for the movie, except "Larry Joe Campbell" from "According to Jim".
I'm giving you ten because I'll be watching you.
(There's also been conjecture that Gable and Lana Turner, who were making "Somewhere I'll Find You," were having an affair at the time of Carole's death, and that Lombard decided to fly home because of her suspicions.
Jill Clayburgh comes off slightly better simply because she is given less to do.
I didn't see the ending because I was cut off for some reason.
I look forward to seeing them play in more movies soon because they certainly can act.
Most of the fun was because of the lacking script.
Captain Mattielli is on the case, but because of the situation he's soon following orders from the up-and-coming, well-educated Lieutenant Pope.
The claustrophobic script cooks up many interesting sub-plots with authenticity and emotion, as the pulsating violence never overstays it's welcome because it's established through the material, then just being there for the sake of it.
The moody performances are simply top-rate because of fully rounded characters.
Later, the cops arrive in droves with Captain Frank Mattelli (Anthony Quinn of "The Guns of Navarone") heading up the investigation until another officer (Tim O'Conner) pulls him aside and points out that a younger guy, Lieutenant Pope (Yaphet Kotto of "Live and Let Die") has been assigned to the case for political reasons because he is black and the crime occurred in Harlem.
A thirty-year veteran who conducts an investigation his own way, Mattelli rubs Pope the wrong way, but he knows the ropes better and gets results that Pope cannot because he doesn't have as well oiled a machine.
He finds out in short order that in spite of his high rank, he is ordered to report to Lieutenant Pope (Yaphet Kotto) because of the racial politics involved.
Pope tolerates Matelli because of Matelli's informers and friends on the force who can help solve the case.
The film is a race against time because two parallel manhunts are at work for these perpetrators.
The end scene is very powerful and memorable mostly because it is so tragic and sad and also intelligent and thought-provoking.
Eisenstein in particular is good for this approach because one thing that ties music and imagery together well is rhythmic editing, something he is famous for in the first place and also something that he had previously successfully used to create sound-like impressions in completely silent films (like, for instance, quick cutting between a machine gun and its firer to represent the sound of the machine gun unloading).
I do not regret to have rushed to see this movie without proper documentation, because I spent 119 minutes of pure joy, spoiled by an inexplainable ending (solved since).It is of course a testament, but I am only five years younger than Alain Resnais and I prefer to spend them without too much questions asked, about death mostly.
the reason why i laugh during any horror movie is because how creative horror movies are with killings.
That's because much of the film is word-for-word Dickens and is like so many, many other versions.
And, herein, lies perhaps this film's ultimate dilemma: while certainly not a perfunctory or redundant effort, one is not likely to forsake the earlier cinematic rendition because of itÂ
Mac also regards the police as incompetent fascists, and doesn't tell them anything she's discovered about the murders because she believes she's got a better chance of uncovering who the killer is.
I'm glad it wasn't listed as a Documentary, because it is certainly anything but.
If we were to become suddenly sucked into some time vortex and transported back to this era, we would probably go mad because of stricter standards demanded of us not only by government, be it local, State or Federal, but by our respective religious beliefs as well as the people around us who would demand that we conform to their thinking.
Remember, these images were stronger in the minds of those who saw this film in 1952, because it was just seven years after these totalitarian regimes were defeated.
Back when he was poor he was living hand to mouth with a near do well father, Frank Morgan, and a gentle mother who took in washing because her husband couldn't hold down a job.
In this low-budgeted comedy/thriller they play a trio of clumsy (on the verge of idiotic) private detectives hired by the wealthy Walter Stevens because he received a warning note that a murderer at large will kill him within 24 hours.
The score of 4 is only because Atwill and Lugosi infuse a little bit of life into this dull film.
The gorilla also is heard speaking throughout the movie ,without the slightest hint of a gorilla accent, on the radio giving instructions to those trapped, because of a violent thunderstorm, in Uncle Stevens' mansion.
There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers.
Bela Lugosi is featured as the butler, Peters, and he plays the role perfectly straight (in a sense perfectly cast, because I can't picture Lugosi doing comedy) and that straight performance adds both to the comedy and the mystery (Peters comes across as mysterious throughout.)
It barely earns a "2" from me, and only because of the fact that any movie with a guy in a gorilla suit gets extra points.
Not because they are funny, but because their performance is so ridiculously terrible, that it evolves into funny.
The adorable Daley springs to mind, not exactly because he's gay -homosexuality is very common in anime- but because during his few moments in the spotlight he's always delightful (and damn it all, he's -cute-).
I really liked the movie because it stayed true to the TV show ( mostly ) and also because it finally touched on a subject that many whom are familiar with the TV series had been wondering about: the estranged fathers of the boys.
"City of Men" is about the absence of fathers, and about two friends who find themselves fighting on opposite sides because of deeds committed by their own dads -- sons literally inheriting the sins of their fathers.
Paradoxically, it also has a more positive arc than 'City of Men,' because its hero works his way out of the slums and into mainstream Rio de Janeiro to become a photojournalist.
Columbo lingers in the harbor, in no hurry at all, works together with Mac (because his boss insists), makes him drive his car, gets entangled with Robert Vaughn in the car, with the telephone, tries TM on the deck of the boat.
And Columbo always had it's own patterns and in-jokes, but because of many different directors as well as guest stars and considering the fact that the show ran for 35 years, there is no such thing as the one formula it sticks to.
this is very good movie about the wreck of titanic it is unscripted and the don't now Wat they are doing they test new robots name bot1 and bot2 later the changed their name into Jake and Elwood just like Blusebrothers and then they explore the ship in places that had never seen since 1912 i will give this movie 8 because i liked it wen the were telling the story about the ship and they show the rooms digital-ed in computer it is very cool.
About thirty minutes into the film, I thought this was one of the weakest "Columbo"s ever because it had the usual beginning (a murder happening, then Columbo coming, inspecting everything and interrogating the main suspect) squared!
It was boring because I thought I knew everything already.
The film is full of irony, and looking back, I must admit that the whole episode is great work of the writers because the ordinary first part is a mere tool for creating this irony, creating a huge fool-the-audience-scenario.
but I wanted to watch it out, because some movies, as La Vita e Bella, are at their best in the ending.
I finally got my hands on the DVD of this documentary and well I was blown away by the stuff they showed from INSIDE the ship, it was a pity that they didn't show more, because they could've easily omitted parts where they were on the Keldysh and the poorly recreated scenes from the ship.
This documentary are very fascinating and interesting, because they have found so much fact about Titanic, passangers and the crew.
The museum pieces are important because it allows for the memory to be respected and a teacher to future generations.
Christmas movies are supposed to be kind of cliched, they have to be because Christmas has become a cliche to most people.
I say mystery son because it is never explained if the son is from a bad marriage, out-of marriage, widowed, etc.
Perhaps because Desi Arnaz was the only Cuban in Hollywood (he seems like a third string talent compared to that era's Cesar Romero and Ricardo Montalban)?
"Lucy & Desi: Before The Laughter" is depressing because these two people seemed to be destined for a life of happiness.
Even though I was not a major fan of either star, I found the movie to be sad because I never realized just how bright their early careers had been, and how much they had going for them when they became so popular with the "I Love Lucy" show.
That's because it sets up the sequel featuring Reggie and Jack , like I said contrived .
So Jack is in big problems because he is likely to be charged with manslaughter.
The reason you shouldn't read any reviews is because they invariably call this is a whodunit.
"Columbo" is one of those rare series that succeeds because of a strict formula, not in spite of it.
The only parallel I can make is an odd one: Chuck Jones's "Road Runner" series also works because of its formula.
For those who haven't seen the film, for God's sake, don't rent it, because you'll want your money back.
This delightful film works well because of the perfect combination of William Powell and Hedy Lamarr.
Just because the main character is oh so COMPLEX does not mean the movie is going to be interesting.
And just because Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors in the world does not mean he is also going to be a great director and screenplay writer.
Apparently Duvall did not want to let a younger actor play Sonny because he could not resist the chance to preach.
He is a despicable character but not very interesting in his odium because as we hear over and over ad nauseum he Loves the Lord and therefore is not a villain.
Apparently he cheated on his wife because they talk about it.
Just because it has aspirations does not mean it succeeds in those aspirations.
You feel very much for Duvall because you can see the power and belief of his character and the self-destructive streak that results.
I only gave it a ten because Robert Duvall was in it, and also June Carter Cash.
I loved the movie, because I hated Sonny so much, which is a tribute to Duvall for doing such a good job of portraying him.
Duvall has created an imperfect hero, a hero much easier to relate to because he has shortcomings and flaws.
Hollywood would have made it bigger than life, I liked this because it was as small as life.
So, I rented this because I wanted to be uplifted.
I refer to the cast as 'actors' because aside from numerous character actors, Duvall being one of the greatest, the film is inhabited by non-actors.
It deserves your attention when you loved Ong-bak and the Russian Night Watch because it's a perfect combination of those two.
He must of seen a lot of southern preachers as he grew up, because he wrote this as well and the role suited him to a tee.
This is not a film not to watch because you don't like monkeys.
This is not a film not to watch because you are a card carrying member of PETA.
This is a film not to watch because you will gnaw your own arm off and wish you were dead.
Maybe this is why this movie is all but forgotten about because this movie is somewhat out of character for Richard.
The fact that The Divine Woman is a silent film really makes the movie stand out from Miss Garbo's other movies, and because it is silent, the passion, sadness, happiness, and all other emotions of the characters shine through more than they normally would in a talking film.
I know this because I was an extra for some scenes - my one and only venture into the film world.
I will give it 8 of 10 because it's a very nice in it's class... And I grade it also as really worth viewing 2 or 3 times in 10 years and a good buy, if it's hopefully get on DVD and you like this type of hilarious adventure films...
It receives a generous rating of 2 because I have seen worse.
In spite of, or perhaps because of the talkies being firmly established and no longer stilted, Bird of Paradise seems more than anything like a silent picture.
Let's start with the actors, because they really give their best.
Well I guess because all in all it's kinda silly or at least its executed in a silly manner.
because they seem him disappear?
She probably sold her portion to Pitt because she wanted nothing to do with him or it.
Every time there is a bit which is awkward, yahoo a bit of explanation (slowing the film down) or just bus along and hope the audience will go for the goo (I couldn't get back for a fortnight, so I missed Xmas, or I'm travelling more because of the drugs I'm taking!).
Actually nothing to say would make you understand how great this movie is and you don't even need to read the reviews before you watch it, All you need to do right now is to watch it because seeing this movie is a MUST.
This movie could very well have the best original score I've ever heard, which is saying a lot because I pay close attention to such things.
This fact might have weighed on my ultimate decision concerning my enjoyment in seeing the DeTamble family's story on screen because I actually really bought in and was swept away for the journey.
You see the bond forming and fate working its way in, setting a specific path as both tell each other future details they know because of the time traveling; he telling a young girl what is in store and she telling a young man the words his elder self passed on.
Again, though, just because I know the novel is a masterpiece should not detract me from the film; it is its own entity.
Henry's random and unpredictable escapades are often dangerous, terrifying and sometimes life-threatening ordeals because he ends up buck-naked and starving in unknown places and times.
The book was a bit confusing at times because of its particular narrative structure and the movie inherits the same problem.
This is because it was an older version of him that travelled back to her childhood and earlier years.
She had no intentions of reading it and only went because I had tickets.
This idea actually makes a lot of sense because his condition is part of an odd bodily function and his clothes would not be affected by the travel.
We don't really need to know the science behind it because, simply put, science can neither logically explain its paradoxical nature, nor prove or dispute its possibility.
The scenes between Henry and young Clare were especially moving because they took literally the notion of feeling like you have known someone your whole life.
What's more, the principal characters are children, who, in an odd twist, are able to mature only because they've found the bliss of being young.
Actors and scenery captures the story for us, of a little boy, motherless because of an accident and the garden that claimed her life.
The young actors in this film are much more impressive than young actors often are (this is the kind of actor that is most likely to be forgiven for a bad performance because they're so darn cute), each portraying wonderfully the characters as they are presented in the novel.
The 1933 film version of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel covered maybe 3-5% of the novel, which completely changed the meaning of the story and transformed Frankenstein's monster (Frankenstein is, of course, not the monster, but you already know that because you've read the book, right?)
I had to watch it with one eye closed because of broken glasses, but this wonderful fairytale deeply moved me, brought many tears to my eyes nd transcended me in a happy world where everything is fine.
I gave this movie an excellent rating because of the story line, the excellent adaptation from the book to the movie, and a truly exceptional cast.
It is a real shame that Kate has decided not to pursue acting as an adult because if she was this good in this movie as an 11 year old she would be a phenomenal adult actress.
Despite the Industrial Revolution and the consequent leaps and bounds of technological progress childbirth and womens' health was very much a side issue in a patriarchal society.Colin's father has no interest in his son's upbringing despite - or,arguably,because of the fact that his wife,whom he clearly loved had died giving birth to the boy.He is an intelligent man and knows that such an attitude is not reasonable,but it is the status quo for a man of his position .That he loves and understands children is made clear by his attitude towards Mary and his defence of her against Mrs Medlock,but his gender and his own upbringing are not easy forces for him to overcome.
It's beautiful to see the changes of Colin and Mary: He learns to be more confident and less pessimist, changing the paranoia of being all the time confined in his bedroom because of 'spores', to go to the garden and try to walk again.
I know more than he does because I believe Anderson set out to clear some things up.
A lot of people who play the games may be disappointed because the movie isn't 100% like the game.
I would be disappointed if people didn't go and see this movie just because its based off a video game.
This Movie Was Terrible to put it in 1 word.....  3 out of ten is actually quite good for this movie.....  With its complicated in depth story which never makes sense anywhere through the film to the characters terrible performance which lacks emotion within them, really makes me ashamed to say I am a fan of the game.This film doesn't have a hero to be straight,i am actually by the end glad there all being killed of because you honestly don't really care and have no reason to care what happens to them, if your still watching it by that time that is.
I had my worries when i saw Paul Anderson because i hated Event Horison And i hated AvP ( grrr avp is the worst movie ever made, it brought shame to both franchises ) but to my surprised it was pretty damn good.
The story is nothing short of brilliant because it will have you captivated and immersed into a world of zombies that like to bite!
But the first movie was good because it had stayed true to the fact that zombies (whatever the virus infect-ant was) were the main theme.
In that famous game, you find yourself trapped in a mansion crawling with the undead because of a mistake made by the Umbrella Corporation.
When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing.
Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game.
In the end Alice & Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.
This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid & boring especially House of the Dead, the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people.
That's because it's a movie.
I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way, they made little notice of records and files lying about, no matter how relevant they were or were not, and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game.
This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise.
The movie's effectiveness really lies in the context that people can be so easily controlled and fall victim to cults, rather than the fact that Khorda possesses their minds because he is a vampire.
This was largely because of atmosphere.
Ewing is a very unlikely hero, a kid out of his league against a far superior foe..but the film allows him to become a worthy adversary, because of the very fact that he's not particularly your prototypical knight-in-shining-armour.
The movie's effectiveness really lies in the context that people can be so easily controlled and fall victim to cults, rather than the fact that Khorda possesses their minds because he is a vampire.
There is a reason that you have seen almost no one from this film in anything of consequence...it is because having taken part in it probably stained their career forever.
AUDIO: Frankly, I never clearly heard the director comments others have noted because he was drowned out by other ambient noise.
It's like, wow, maybe i did fall asleep because this stuff is so complex.
I had never heard of Venus Wars before and I think it's a shame that the flick hasn't got more recognition, because it really is one good film.
It is nice to see characters that are true to their natures and which do not exhibit that nasty tendency to change personalities in midstream just because it was convenient to give a shortcut to the plot.
i had to pause ... because of crying myself ..  of course the polish V.O.
2, and because of that, I can watch this one anytime that I want to see the Three Stooges!
Basically this film is disappointing because Jean Arthur becomes pretty unsympathetic, the 3 characters in the love triangle are all sophomoric in the extreme, and there is no resolution at the end of the film.
This is because in this version alone are the two competing spouses portrayed as equally worthy, charming, and attractive by actors who were close to one another in those qualities, as well as in their respective levels of stardom at the time the film was made.
Also Mega Man 2 is not as difficult as the first one because the worlds of Dr. Willy's creations are easy to learn and memorize.
In all I believe some people may be frustrated because there are many things and processes to memorize (jump that, don't jump that; use that weapon with that enemy, learn the AI patron of that other one)and also some good reflexes are needed of course.
It's sad because I thought the previous Scary Movie movies were good fun.
I can't wait for the 5th part, because it will never bored me...
Maybe the reason is because it's spoofing War of the Worlds (2005).
I don't know if it's because I watched it an hour after slamming my finger in the car door and I had cried myself into heaves and needed something to laugh at.
Or perhaps it was because I am a fan of the majority of the movies that Scary 4 spoofs and I took them a little too seriously at the time.
I won't say what I liked the most, because I don't want to give it away, but the end with the guy & the woman, is pretty funny :] Anyways, this movie wasn't worth seeing to me, but at the same time I guess it was.
I'm only hoping that 5 will be a step up from this - which should be easy because this was about as funny as watching a person snore for 90 minutes.
See, i feel sad in side because this sort of satire could really have some potential if the real hilarity wasn't so overshadowed by the disproportionate amount of really dumb jokes that would best appeal to 10-yr-olds (who, incidentally, are not allowed to see the movie).
At first I thought it would be bad acting because that is the case with a lot of soaps.
But after a couple weeks I really enjoyed it and actually hated leaving during the day because I would miss it.
I also admire Sammi because of her determination, meaning she is not one to give up even if she may hurt someone else.
David Zucker is not trying at all anymore,perhaps because his prime audience is now ten year olds who snicker at the word penis.
Killing off Charlie Sheen was a bad move because he was the funniest character in 3.4 has the most celebrity cameos but they don't take advantage of the talent.
Sad really because the genre has brought laughs when other comedies failed.
Airplane was a great film because it had a brain behind the silliness.
I did not have high expectations on this movie, mostly because films following "The Gladiator" were facing a too big challenge, but this was worse than I expected.
I want Shawn and Belle to be together and i want Stephanie with Max and Chelsea could take a hike because she is just so evil.I want Bo and Hope to be together and I want Billie and Lockhart to be together.
Otherwise it's hard to really differentiate when we're supposed to be scared, excited, thrilled, or really feel much of anything because nothing really slows down long enough to build a sense of tension or drama in the scenes.
Its sad that this wasn't marketed because it felt better that most straight to DVD horror out there (Even Horror That Gets Released At The Theater) The story revolves around a few men appointed to find these mysterious objects.
It is an inspiring story because it tells of ordinary people getting on with the job that, due to a world war, has to be done.
They flirted with having one gay character but there must've been a protest or something because he disappeared quickly.
This film shows exactly what don't like in Hollywood ;the real nature of sexual relationships ,that's the reason why a superb film like this never will won an Oscar.It shows the extreme passion that everybody can feel about somebody ;your life could be like one of the characters of the film , you only has to meet somebody really special , and ,If you think you never would do the things the characters of this film made ,you will instantly change your opinion , why?, because when you are absolutely in love with somebody , you would anything for that person that make you feel so good...That is the human nature.
It feels as if Polanksi, through the characters of Nigel (Grant) and Fiona (Scott Thomas) whom have been happily married for so long, is trying to say that you should be thankful for what you've got and going bigger and better because your impulses demand you do, isn't always necessary.
His world, in which he would submit to the presence of Mimi purely to feed a curiosity and because he was able to, but would later find himself on the other foot when she submits to him; his world, in which ego driven positions of power were exploited and the phrase 'what goes around, comes around' didn't exist Â not least, until now.
He's bored because he and his wife are doing the "normal" thing.
Besides this few topics of discussion (to which I could add some more if I just remembered them right now) I found this film very well directed with some beautiful scenes... also some strongs scenes that stay with us... Excelent performances for the three leading roles... Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn't allow her to show more than she did.
The tale is so engrossing because it concerns Oscar's beautiful, sultry and seductive wife, Mimi, played mesmerisingly by Emmanuelle Seigner.
I really believe that `Bitter Moon', Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner have been not nominated to the Oscar because of the problems of Roman Polanski with the American Justice.
Secondly, the fact that this movie's subject (SPOILER)is a waitress who because of her social status can never achieve anything in a rich men's world, but who has a heart of gold can be enough reason to leave this movie unseen.
Just because of the great acting abilities by veteran actors in combination with Rebecca De Mornay at her ultra-sexy best I can recommend this entertaining but shallow movie.  
The rest of the picture is told in three individual flashbacks as it is explained just how and why Sheilds deserves such animosity, with Pebbels also explaining just what they all went on to achieve because of him and in spite of him.
Film producer John Houseman and director Vincent Minnelli convinced MGM production chief Dore Schary to switch the story to Hollywood partly because the film ALL ABOUT EVE had covered Broadway territory so well just two years earlier.
And with the movie industry in decline (because of TV) Houseman thought it was ripe for a story about a producer from the Golden Days facing a new era.
You can't take this show seriously because it's outrageous.
Of course, you can't take anything on this show seriously but that's because we already take life too seriously.
If you want fun, you will watch Days of Our Lives because regardless of the show's story lines which are outrageous, the cast pulls it off better than any ensemble around.
But whatever she does, it's certainly a refreshment to see her in the interval dividing Lana Turner's screen time, because unlike Grahame, Turner does not, in her impersonal approach, appear to have any internal dynamics.
This film pretentiously tries to imply that a somewhat ordinary fellow with lots of opportunities is just this wicked, wicked man because he wants to do things the right way.
And that's appropriate enough, because this is a film about film-making, a fictional insider's view of four main characters: a director, an actress, a writer, and a producer.
I say all this because Vincente Minnelli, with a decade of growing successes behind him, directs this new one with finesse, creating an elegant masterpiece of film-making that falls short of being legendary most of all from its finesse.
And it all flows together, and of course needs to conjoin this way because in fact the three stories are all the same large tale built around the legendary, difficult director/producer played by Douglas.
In the end, like the three characters, we are disgusted and yet can't help listening in, because of the inglorious magic.
Jonathan ruins the film because he has no talent as a director.
The reasons for all of Johnathan's bizarre doings, is for the most part, because of his own need to live up to his father's name, who founded 'Shields Productions', and became a big player in the industry.
First off, Drake did NOT leave DAYS on his own because he was unhappy on the show or because he wished to retire...simply put, Drake was fired!
Never bought any of the toys but i think it was because i was just slightly too old for it when the toys and TV show came out in the UK.
A very interesting plot.Is the hero of the plot in it for the money or is he really an ok person?I saw this film in my late teens and have overall seen it about five times enjoy it on every viewing.Like most films because it has some complexities and twists and turns keeping you guessing all the way the first viewing really stuck in my mind.Well worth a watch,unpredictable in my opinion.Again why is this film not available especially on DVD?
That said, neither the subject matter nor the direction particularly suits a cinema presentation; I strongly suspect that however strong the box-office returns, they will be comprehensively eclipsed by the video and DVD sales because this is a deliberately small-scale and intimate movie.
I would have swapped the two leads because Helen Mirren's strong suit is not comedy.
As for Chris, her husband unwittingly tells a tabloid journalist that his wife has not made love to him in weeks because of the constant attention she receives from the calendar.
Although the story is easy to follow, there were some scenes where my wife and I lost lines of dialog because of impenetrable accents.
Many of these folks are very recognizable because they've been the staple of English comedy since Shakespeare.
This unpretentious movie offers some joys,I watched it because I wanted to see Mrs. Mirren and Mrs. Julie Walters,as I think they are gorgeous.
The US aided the right wing because US foreign policy blindly labeled all rebellious groups in the America's as "Communist" insurgents and worked overtime to eliminate them.
The film is interesting to watch because it shows the controversy over the difficult roles that many in the Catholic Church felt compelled to play in the midst of the situation.
According to the film, when Romero was instated as archbishop it was only because he was viewed as an intellectual moderate who would keep the church from getting too involved in the political affairs of the country.
While it is a moving film, it is also very disturbing because of the graphic nature of some of the abuse suffered by characters in the film.
I saw this movie because of buzz I heard over the net and wanted to see for myself.
I gathered that she was homicidal because of the effects of the drug, but the film didn't really clarify, either through a back story telling about her addiction to and reactions from the drug or some other device.
You just do not get the story because the film is not finished.
Good job guys I try and support Indie Movies simply because I am tired of the same rehash Hollywood spoon feeds us.
1998's _Life is Beautiful_ received some criticism, but mainly because it contained comic elements where people felt there should be only tragedy.
I connected with it instantly because I have been through similar circumstances.
Georgio says he won't escape because he had too many ties back in Italy.
The system runs because everything is compartmentalised, everyone is in charge of their own section of the pie.
She is a ghost of the past, and Giorgio cannot attain her because she has long turned her back to the living world.
They're different from the other Jews because wealth and privilege have bred them into a family as proud as it is vulnerable.
Note: this short is on the Criterion Collection DVD of "George Washington", evidently because David Gordon Green felt influenced by it.
Of course, something like this would never happen then, but it was immensely riveting to see thousands of people disappear because of a drawing on some kid's wall.
I personally found this riveting because it was a fun ride, and nowhere near as stupid or pathetic as "Love and Monsters".
You also can't help notice that because the plot was one of those written on the back of a cigarette packet efforts then there's so much padding centered around on dysfunctional family issues , in this case single parenthood .
First I must take issue with the reviewer who found this film boring because he classed it as a disaster movie, and felt there was not the suspense necessary for a good disaster movie.
The idea of a funeral to be held at night because the deceased, the daughter of a very wealthy man, had been blind sets the tone.
The point of the film cannot be to show how two contrary characters complement each other, as Andersson was even more happy with von Sydow before and because it's all told in such a detached manner.
Very funny movie about a simple minded young man who's simply afraid to move out of his parents house because he doesnt want to be alone.To make up for his lack of an interesting life, he constantly lies to the only people who he can let his imaginative frustrations run wild with - the neighborhood kids,who idolize him.Does he realize this ?
You feel a bit sorry for Monk's obsessive compulsiveness and yet have to laugh at his good fortune because of it.
I like it because i can relate to the main characters, Jim and Josie.
I liked it movie because of the situation where the personages are involved, Jim and Josie, prisoners in a supermarket.
A couple little kids follow him around, because they think he's important.
She knows all of this because of the rumors about him.
Basically because in this movie that's all Josie's ever heard... how she's such a great piece of a$$ ("the town tease"), and the redundancy of these comments she's encountered up to now has her almost proud of that fact.
I say this because it is well known on the circuit that this is Mr Ikimi's first picture.
It's hoped that it can now find a newer and more appreciative audience because it's one of the better B Westerns of the late 1950s.
I still remember moments in the movie as if I just saw it yesterday because of its gripping mature story line and deep rich character portrayals.
Its pretty obvious that Regina Carrol was cast only because she was Mrs. Adamson, and Zandor Vorkov may well be the most uninspired Dracula ever on screen.
Regina Carrol is absolutely horrible as an actress and I'm sure that they cast her only because of her two, more talented screen fillers.
That's because both J. Carrol Naish and Lon Chaney, Jr. both starred in this film shortly before their deaths.
I think, because of the low budget, it had a reality factor of 'too close to home for comfort' as if it was all taking place in the next town and pretty soon all these creeps were gonna come over to my town and mess with me.
because they think she's a cop, and after a bad trip she wakes up in Anthony Eisley's bed.
Just sit back and watch and gape, because you will, and not in horror either.
You can't really judge Dracula Vs. Frankenstein by standard film criteria, instead you just need to sit back & enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch.
I would rather shoot myself in the head than watch another episode of The "REAL" World, because watching this show is actually more painful than that.
MTV has no idea what the real world is because they are so lost in their PC world of transparent nonsense.
People ONLY love it because of it's satire of society, which makes no sense.
The film however...I'm not one to compare a book to it's film because they are two different mediums and are not meant for comparison, however for any of you who desire to see this film I suggest you step back with your hands out and get the book instead.
The first twenty minutes were okay because it was not boring, then holy crap, the rest of the movie was flat out dreadful!
We have a main character we hate because he enjoys raping and killing innocent people.
We are then supposed to sympathize with him, which we don't, because we hate him.
Horrible things happen to him, but we don't really care, because he's a bad person.
We do not get this sense of irony because the movie is CONTRIVED, some examples being: how Alex just happens to run into everyone he ever did wrong one day after getting out of jail (the bum, his droogs, the cripple), or how after Alex luckily is not recognized by the cripple, he goes on to sing the SONG HE SANG WHILE BEATING HIM AND RAPING HIS WIFE while in the cripple's house, as if he were the most idiotic person in the world, which he is obviously not.
But, because of how adversely A Clockwork Orange affects me, I must dismiss it and can't recommend it to anyone.
And sadly, because it is so disturbing, I am deprived of enjoying the greatness that the movie really does contain.
I read the book by Anthony Burgess because the story is truly brilliant.
I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it.
Technically this is a sci-fi film because it does take place in the future and there is the plot which involves brainwashing.
It's because this film stands out as possibly the scariest image of the near future
`A Clockwork Orange' was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two.
It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted.
Alex is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves.
hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you.
the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad.
People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied.
Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement.
In the Valley of Elah, named for the place where David fought Goliath, works because of the well-cast Jones and an ending that leaves plenty of issues unresolved, to its credit.
Unfortunately, the reason his son is AWOL is because he has been murdered, which is discovered shortly after Jones arrives.
Plot is quite original for its suggesting war is terrible and wrong, not only because it is unjustified but because it has a corrupting impact on people, especially when they're back and return (try to..) civilization.
I guess with such success, the naysayers will usually be out in full force to make their voices heard, and I thought it's quite sad to have what I deem as steeling work so oft put down because of green eyed monsters.
The ending was the worst part of the movie, not because of the writing/directing/acting aspect.
There is a gray area as to whether this is a military or civilian matter, and the father (Tommy Lee Jones) finds himself stuck between an incompetent civilian police force and an edgy and defensive military police force, neither of whom really gives a toss about the truth, the first because truth is too demanding, the second because it's too embarrassing.
We feel every ounce of his despair and disillusionment without any histrionics, because the script is spare, and the acting superb.
Maybe a reason some people are praising the actors' performance highly but not recommending to see the movie is because the actual experience of watching "In the Valley of Elah" is just too unsettling, like a mirror of our actual experience in Iraq (whatever your political views may be).
In the movie it's pretty clear that Mike Deerfield is destroyed exactly because he starts out as such a good and decent young man.
Sad, I say, because I honestly believe TLJ is a much better actor than that.
The movie works because although it does have quite a few negative things to say about the current war in Iraq, the entire film isn't a two-hour tirade against it.
It's drained of melodrama and just sort of moves forward on really good performances of the whole cast, who all act according to their natures instead of because of stupid plot requirements.
Only Roger Ebert and the reviewer for Rolling Stone seem to see the truth here: this film is slow and elegiac because it deals with heavy matters, but it is never boring, not if you understand the situation and the depth of feelings being explored.
It's as if reviewers don't get it because they didn't really feel what the film is saying.
Susan Sarandon is not, as some critic said, "underused"; she gives a performance that is all the more powerful because it is restrained.
Not for spectacular cinematography, explosions or effects, but because this is one of a rare breed of movie that captures life... -real- life in such a way that you are -there-.
The film moves at a very slow pace and sometimes it's hard to follow the dialogue because it subtitled, but in the end it's well worth it.
The photography and camera motions can feel somewhat disturbing at the beginning, but this is only because they are unusual.
I think I'll give it a couple days and watch it again because there are lots of details I missed the first time around.
The ending shows the final confrontation between Takeshi and the yakuza clan who betrays him because the turf he patrolled and ran was the most profitable.
I think the people who criticize this film do so because they've been trained to watch movies the way Hollywood makes them.
The quiet (or as some might say, boring) moments are there because the characters exist in a realistic world where sometimes they can do nothing but sit and think.
If someone says without arguments or understanding to this art form some Kitano film is bad, stupid, gratuitously and excessively violent, unexplained or something else of the usual statements, it is no use taking those "opinions" seriously or consider them noteworthy because people who say so see exactly things that are NOT there.
Maybe their viewers need to be told what is what because it's hard for them to think for themselves.
Mary Tyler Moore has clearly shown us her true range as an actress here because in this film SHE IS Sante Kimes in all her ugly glory.
The Detroit Tigers won 103 games that year yet failed to win the American League pennant by SIX games because the Yankees won 109 games that year.
blah....sorry but I can't jump on the Billy Crystal Bandwagon and tell  everyone how great this movie was, because it wasn't really that  good.
I remember watching this series on HBO because it was always on and all I was thinking was that this movie is just great.
I say "eggs" because they are green.
Hank's screenplay shows both men & their flaws, but doesn't dwell on them, because the story isn't about Mickey's drinking or Roger's homelife as much as it is about the 1961 race.
One reviewer said this isn't a family movie because there is some language & innuendo.
What made Marri's and Mantle's chase of the mighty Ruth's record such a brilliant story to tell is because Babe Ruth is a baseball god, and seemed to have an ever present feeling in Yankee stadium.
No, there will never be another movie made about Barry Bond's breaking MgWire's record because he, in truth never did.
My original vote for this drama was a 6 but after reflection, I raised the vote to a 7 because some of the scenes were so very haunting.
this is a great movie and i think it will be considered a classic the thing that pisses me off is that Marris isn't in the Hall of fame most people who don't know much about him think he only had that one good year when he broke the record but he was the MVP of the 1960 season and he played well throughout most of his career he should be in the hall of fame without a doubt there's four people that aren't in the hall of fame that should be shoeless Joe Jackson isn't there because he threw the world series even though he played excellent and Pete rose should be in there to it doesn't matter what he did off the field its what he did on the field that counts Marris is the next person not in i already explained why but the most shocking person not to be in the hall of fame is frank Robinson what the hell happened there
You can't possibly understand what Maris went through that year just because his prowess for hitting home runs blossomed at record-breaking speed.
Maris didn't deserve to be vilified because he wasn't the "proper" Yankee to break this record.
I thank him for setting the record straight where Roger Maris is concerned because it was about time.
Mickey Mantle had inherited the status of 'Yankee favourite' from predecessors Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth, but Roger Maris had narrowly beat him in the poll for MVP the previous year, all the more remarkable because Maris was a newcomer from the midwest.
Sacred because it had been set by a man who revolutionized the game itself and was one of the most colorful sports personalities that America ever produced.
Suspense is lacking, because we already know how the thing is going to turn out, but it's worth watching if only to see the dressing room tension building and the effect on the team as a whole.
because of that Adrian Monk suffered a complete breakdown.
Babe Ruth's single season home run record of 60, set in 1927, was more vulnerable than ever because of two major changes.
(On a side note, I'm a Maris sympathizer because I can relate to being rejected by people who I don't bother simply because I don't follow the crowd and I believe in judging people based on substance more than anything else.
However, because this movie is unrated, I caution you that this is not a family movie.
this is the first Simbhu movie i've seen and wow!i just keep watching this movie over and over again.is it because of Simbhu himself?is it the songs?is it cuz Simbhu wrote it?or is it because of the twist?
This is because of the storyline of a serial killing casanova with a haunting past that makes him go pychotic till he falls for the lead heroine.
I think the main reason that I loved it is because I could relate to about 90% of it!
Maybe it's for the better that the question doesn't get a clear answer, because there won't be one.
In one sentence: This movie is one of those that shouldn't end because you want to know more about everything,the whole thing, so deep you will place yourself into the plot and you don't want to leave it.
I watched this movie because some articles made me curious ... the film is very thrilling and full of sophisticated humor.
It surprised me because TTWH is lacking in suspense but rich in humor, romance and mystique.
However this isn't the true problem because nobody seems to care for Harry in particular.
This movie is very dark in content yet because there is very little character development the viewer doesn't identify with the plight of the character and the absence of Hitchcock's signature suspense music allows a viewer to laugh at the awkward situation and the ridiculous actions of the characters rather than worry about what terrible outcome could come from them.
If they did, I would never get anything done because I would be laughing too much.
Too bad this movie is so unfunny, because the plot could have made it funnier.
You know that the characters are quirky because the script says they are, but it often seems forced.
But the film is surprising because Hitchcock manages to have absolutely no staircase, no flights of steps, with or without mezzanines, and yet don't believe me that easy because it is not flat country indeed.
And he is all the more with us because he explores the psyche of the human species.
Then they feel relieved because someone else assumes the crime they have committed till they feel guilty again and reveal their own doing in the crime.
But that is to no avail because life is stronger than illusions and death is even stronger than life.
So the crime comes back because it has to be brought out and registered for the life of the living to be able to go on.
Even though Natwick does claim to Gwen that the only reason she has invited him over, is because of the convenience of Gwens presence at the time of Harry death.
Perhaps the most surprising and powerful undertow in "The Trouble With Harry" (one hesitates to name it because it's handled so delicately) is Sex.
Nothing really special here, Granger and Powell are charming enough, but this film will always standout in my mind because of two musical numbers performed by supporting players Ann Miller and Bobby Van.
It's just an amazing number and because of these two musical highlights, SMALL TOWN GIRL is a film I will always remember.
Take in these little lessons and minuscule comments to heart because real life can be quoted, but in these quotes are left to bear more than consumed by a normal viewer.
I really loved the skit about the three super-scared guys who make an air flight miserable for everyone because they are scared of EVERYTHING--the punch line about the film YENTIL was priceless.
And some of the historical facts are skewed (for the most part, because we learned more about the occurrences at Pearl Harbor after this miniseries was made).
I liked Dennis Weaver's performance better now than in the 70s when "McCloud" was fresh in my mind, because his character was not that likable.
really i'm not lying, me and my friends are really disappointed and please stop making these horrible movies and i would like my money back(witch was 6 dollars) back you could sent it to me in a check or u could personally give me that money and i really hope that u stop making movies because truthfully you really suck at making them thank you for your time goodnight not love (at all) Jesi, Lexie, and Chelsea you have ruined my night completely goodnight you my e-mail me back if u have anything to say to prove to us that this movie doesn't completely suck ass
I recommend to just not waste your time with this movie because it will ruined the magic and awesomeness of the first one.O and no wonder it went straight to DVD!They knew how horrendous that would had been for them!
The acting was blatant, and though I'm not overly-critical and can usually set aside a poorly-cast film, I couldn't even focus on the movie because everything simply seemed forced.
Even she was unable to get herself into this one and only finished the movies because, even though you know how it will end, you just have to see it... well, because.
Just because.
No wonder Luke didn't want to do, because I bet he probably the same way, but just hold his thoughts through the whole thing.
There were so many parts of the movie that was just so laughable because of it's poor acting skills from some of the characters.
The whole budget seems to be about $100 because the clothes were cheap looking and the hair and makeup was horrible.
Both enjoyable enough films, but they fail at their core because they focus too much on the events that the characters face, rather than their response to them.
He became known as the Werewolf Of Allariz because his defense against these charges was that he could not control his animal urges since he was in fact a werewolf.
Even masterpieces like Big Fish, Edward Scissorhand, Chocolate, Green Mile (or already mentioned Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind) have a clear Hollywood sign, and after all those Rambos and American Pies, comics based blockbusters and remakes of French movies (what is additionally ironic because average American movie consumer would rather see a rattlesnake on the floor than French movie on the screen) this touch of Hollywood became odious, what is a tragic decline for this old temple of movies... just few decades ago the touch of Hollywood style was the best praise a movie could be given.
And their loneliness grows not only because this burden presses them too hard, not only because they are ashamed, but mostly because they are afraid to share it with anybody.
And as we follow these people, we will see how some relations terminate because of total loss of communication, while others appear and develop once the shell softens.
He demonstrates that sex scenes are not supposed to be provocative, erotic or stimulating at all; they can be grotesque and raw because the important thing is that they look real and are not idealized.
You can see how much the director, probably a high class "junior" (because nobody finances his own debut with 50K out of his own pocket), despises and makes fun very sarcastically of the lower classes.
Also the Mexican Culture and ways of life in the Mexican city also adds to the supposed plot.Some of the scenes was not needed (atleast to me) because they really dint add any value to the movie other than extending by a few minutes.Mascos looked good,Ana looked hot,Marcos's wife looked seriously obese and the marching soldiers looked fit and trimmed.
the reason why I'm giving it 2 stars are because this film is based in a non-Hollywood ideology.
It's not quite a study of Marcos, because we never got to be let in that deeply into his past, his motives, his whatever.
It's worth to watch you, because it let's you dive into a unique and different world.
The only good thing about this film was seeing Elsa Patasky's breasts, everything else was totally shite.It is even more of a shame because the idea has potential.
It was terrible, but I guess it got a decent rating here because of the free sex and the shots of a man's erection and a girl's vagina.
I enjoyed this movie but I think I enjoyed because when I learned it was coming, and being the curious person I am, I dug into the story of Manuel Romasanta.
As it is, just about everything that happens feels meaningless and remote, because Reygadas evidently has no interest in supplying his audience with any interpretive hooks, and unsurprisingly none of the amateur actors is skilled enough to fully inhabit on screen the bodies that they have so boldly put on display.
It's not easy to see real people doing it, because we may see ourselves in them.
I consider that one of the main achievements of this movies is to show many cultural traits of my country:   -The view of the Catholic religion as a resource to erase the mistakes one has made: "you can do whatever you want, don't worry about the effects because God will always help you"   -The notorious gap between rich and poor people: when Ana refers to Jaime's servant as "la gata" in such a despective -but common- way.
She needed to play it low speed because she did not trust people, and she did just that.
Is it because it's not gory?
Is it because there no real insight to the killing?
Or is it because it's based on a true story?
I must give this movie a 10 because it's just one of the best werewolf movies I've seen... and I've seen a lot!
There are no real werewolves, only that which goes on within the title character's head, and because it's based on true events the movie is incredibly dry and uninventive in the story department.
It's too bad, too, because the idea had a lot of potential.
At the same time, he gets to appreciate them because even if they are ignorant of the outside world, they are genuine.
Levi clashes with the mayor, a man who is a devout follower of Mussolini and his movement, because the way he wants to censor his communication with friends.
The story of Romasanta is interesting because it is based on true historical events.
It rates a three because I did laugh a few times and I didn't walk out in disgust.
I realize the man is not subtle, but clearly children are either going to get the joke, or just laugh at some of the words the character ends up using because they sound remotely amusing.
Even veteran voice actor Patrick Warburton (who appeared on Seinfeld) does not seem to be having a whole lot of fun with his role, and usually his characters are some of the most memorable because of his voice work.
Then all of the flowers die because the bees don't work anymore.
It doesn't entertain adults much either because it lacks the playfully devilish double entendre humor you find in animated cartoons like "Shrek" or "The Simspons Movie."
All the bee jokes are front-loaded and the film can't survive either on it's script - which has been left quite open for improvising - or on Seinfeld/Zellweger riffing - because that's a bit weak too.
The story and dialogue are unique and refreshing, but at the same time it almost feels wasted because half the audience will get a kick out of it.
He gets the idea that he should get his wife together with another woman and he does this because he is self centered, of course.
The only reason I give it a three is because of some semi-hot woman on woman scenes that you could probably see on TV nowadays.
So she invites over a friend (Humphrey) they know is bisexual (because of course anyone who's bi will sleep with anyone-and the more at a time, the better), and BAM, they all get it on.
Mariel Hemmingway was severely miscast as the bisexual wife, because she walked through the role like she didn't know what she was doing there.
The reasons why this film is most likely a Cult "hit" is because Binder put together a surprisingly diverse cast who seem to happily goof their way through this less than professional outing.
Some highlights: A furious McAdams throws her soda on Pena when he insults her boyfriend, killed in Iraq, by saying he was unfit to be a soldier because he supposedly did armed robbery.
At the end of the day, The Lucky Ones is a quirky little film with a certain gentleness that works mainly, because it focuses on the characters and their emotions and not on the war and it's motives.
When they arrive at JFK Airport in New York, all fights have been canceled, because of a blackout.
I recommend to all to look at, even to the children, although it is sad and too heavy for them, because it is an example to be followed for all, children and adults.
Mainly because total strangers know him because he's the greatest bouncer ever.
This is because Chuck refuses to sleep on anything but American soil.
Chuck fights a sea boat captain, and eventually is forced to shoot him because he's going to miss his ferry boat ride.
Perhaps because of how the movie is portrayed as a werewolf movie, the people who might best enjoy it, aren't likely to see it, and the people expecting a traditional supernatural horror movie might feel a bit let down.
It's a shame what he's become, because he was just RAW!
Claude Gillingwater is excellent as the cantankerous Earl who sends for the American boy who he had disowned because his late son had married a American commoner.
The story is that Miss Pickford was going to have her pictures destroyed at her death because she felt that time had passed them by.
We know this because the writers have made him chubby and he wears glasses.
Christmas is about to be canceled because there's a majority of children out there who have been more naughty then nice and Santa Claus (Campbell) is deciding to go away on vacation putting his oldest daughter Rudolfa (Haskell) in charge.
But the task is more challenging than ever because the family chosen is the Morgan clan Kyle (Kirk) & his sister Brittany (Prout) are two spoiled brats because their father widower & workaholic Bill (Dye) is always too busy.
He was judged in Spain in 1852. having confessed the killing of at least 13 people, he dared proclaim his innocence: he was not guilty because he was a werewolf!
The movie works especially well because the director has a personal relationship with the kids-turned-fighters in the film.
As for the acting...nobody goes into a film like this expecting greatness on that front, and it's a good job because the acting here is quite rubbish.
In other words, in Bidos Work, whatever happens in the future, is because the characters could not escape their past.
Could it be perhaps because such an award winning actor could not stain his reputation doing those vulgar gialli?
There's even an attempt to capture Argento's stylishness, but that fails because the film is rather murky and almost grainy at times, unlike the crystal clear work of Argento.
Still though, this isn't a bad film, although it's rather typical Italian stuff where you have to pay attention because otherwise you can't keep track of the players without a score card.
The reason I don't give character names is because there are none.
This is only really worth mentioning because the Whitehouse features at no point in the film.
Alright, I just found this game rather bad, and I'm only posting this because I was surprised not to find any other bad comment.
Like I said add some more elements in the valley and this would be really great, because for the most part when searching for the colossi you are simply riding your horse here and there.
It was probably because I was in the middle of my Final Fantasy 8 file and was used to long games.
And because of the story, you'll actually find yourself feeling bad for some of these colossi.
This game is one of the greatest games ever made because of how well it was done.
But make sure you have a puzzle in reserve, because as soon as you leave the theater you'll be ready to try your hand!
It is also a great date movie because it is not long and gives you plenty to talk about after.
Overall, great movie because it has a great message.
I think the movie is classified as a documentary only because everything in it is a true account of events happening to real people.
I went to see it purely because I knew an acquaintance of mine had a cameo in it.
I watched this because I love crosswords (I'm an "INK-er" myself, pencils are for the weak!
That being said, I liked this movie very much, largely because I was drawn to the people from the film who create and work puzzles.
The week after seeing "Wordplay", I solved the Sunday NPR puzzle, (name a famous American in eight letters, six are consonants, all of which are Roman numerals); I didn't submit my answer because I figured if I could solve it as quickly as I did, it had to be pretty easy...there were more than 1200 correct answers sent in.
I attended the movie with two friends, one who is no longer able to do puzzles because of failing eyesight; the other for whom doing the Sunday New York Times puzzle has become a religious experience; we were all equally enthusiastic about the film, although we were all rooting for different people to win the contest.
That pit of spikes, underneath a trap door where the poor victim lies as the pendulum swings, is also put to good use.And, I think that Gordon utilizes Rona De Ricci's beauty and innocence quite well..she's certainly a sympathetic figure we root for as it seems her fate is doomed because of the trap Torquemada has placed her in.
"Wordplay" is a film that will resonate more with crossword puzzle lovers, but it is a fun movie to sit through because the witty material and the pace it was given by its creators.
I love this movie because it's so cute to see Howie with Amanda & Kyle.
So there you have it, if this sounds exciting to you or you like watching people getting tortured then The Pit and the Pendulum is the film for you, as for me I liked it but mostly because of Hendriksen & it's torture scenes.
She tries to convince us that she is a "free woman" by choice, but it is painfully obvious she is only a free woman because the men who deign to sleep with her don't want her for anything more than sex.
And the whole "I don't get married because I've seen men do bad things and I don't want to get emotionally hurt" bent just seems so naive.
Fox's annoying hubris is a shame, because if she could have just shut up about her own stupid life for a second, she might've had a good idea for a documentaryÂand it would have been a hell of a lot shorter than a tedious six hours.
I can definitely buy that it was cut to pieces in the editing room, because the characters don't even get onto the boat until about 30 minutes in - the time before that being taken up by about three different, and inconsequential subplots that fail (in my opinion) to enhance the story one bit.
The producers must have reedited it, because it was not supernatural at all, nor was there a vampire.
I find this one of the most moving stories because it is not a frolic through the daisies, walking along the beach and live happily ever after stories.
There's a dark intensity about the movie that can hook one in but there's no denying this is not a pleasant film to watch and for those who like a bit of sweet escapism to their films, they should run like the wind if they put this on, because that isn't what their going to get.
The choice that Mo makes at the end didn't surprise me that much because by then one could see the ties that bind this couple were stronger for Mo, then anything else.
I'd give this a 7, not because I loved it but for the reasons mentioned above and will freely admit this movie stayed with me after longer then I would have thought it would.
I dare not say that everyone will love this film because they certainly will not.
(Oh, and it was so endearing when the 9 year old gave the adults permission to swear because after all she has heard worse.)
Well I guess I am now Officially Un-Hip, because even in retrospect - No, I don't get it.
Maybe this film is just too 'real' for me because I personally have dealt with this same thing.
The only saving grace for Travolta is that most people never heard of this movie because it was so awful.
Nick follows in the footsteps of his old man, John Cassavetes, who supplied the screenplay and you can tell because the down and out characters walk about with cigarette in one hand and a glass of booze in the other.
I've read one that stated something along the lines of, "How could a man go so insane that he's locked up for ten years because he's mad about another man beating his wife?!"
There were several scenes I had to back up and watch again just because some of the layers of small gestures and expressions and emotional choices are so genius, I just couldn't believe how thoughtfully turned out it all was.
Yes, I agree they oversimplified the whole missing ten years thing, but I don't mind because this was such a stunningly original, surprising little love story.
People are reacting against the movie, because it's troubling, depressing, and raw.
In family tradition, real life wife and mother Gena Rowlands has an affecting role as a release counselor, and this is curious because John Cassavetes used Rowlands long ago to scuff up stereotypes of mental illness in the difficult and penetrating A Woman under the Influence, among other films.
But maybe biased because I'm a huge fan of director Stuart Gordon.
And I do believe Gordon belongs to the most talented directors in the genre because he can handle all sort of horror topics.
And I would definitely wave off anybody who has ever suffered from mental illness, because they would find the flick downright insulting.
Too bad, because there are actually a few tinkling of something really good beneath all the stink.
If you've seen the classic Roger Corman version starring Vincent Price it's hard to put it out of your head, but you probably should do because this one is totally different.
I enjoy Brian Ahern as the scatter brain murder mystery book writer who, with is wife, Loretta Young, move into a basement apartment of an apartment building where the tenants all live there because they are being blackmailed.
Make sure you are not going to be interrupted for 90 minutes, because it is so riveting you do NOT want to have to turn it off even for a minute.
However, because of the subject matter, I am sure this sick film won't be to everyone's taste!
Also, because there are so many clever and small little touches to this film, it sure bears repeated viewing so you can catch it all.
I am giving it a 4 because of the idea which will hopefully be used by somebody else and made into a great movie which this should have been.
But in "Delicatessen", Louison, however naÃ¯ve he may be, is no fool; the enchanting Juliet, even as she fumbles her way through a disastrous date because she feel embarrassed wearing glasses, is no object of ridicule.
But you won't really care when you see it, because even though the story isn't really elaborate, what you have here is one of the most original movies you'll ever get your eyes on.
Water is a motif in the film--probably because of its relationship to food, as a means of necessary nourishment, although ironically, in a world characterized by food shortages, water is mostly wasted in the film.
Personally, I have no problem with that, but those who do want a movie to be deep and meaningful might find the film disappointing because of that.
I rented this movie because I love low-budget horror films.
It fails because it feels like a carefully researched numbers crunched cheese substitute.
Really enjoyed this one, primarily because of the vigilante angle.
), but it's wasted because the film is (a) too long, (b) too stupid, and (c) far too inept to notice that the potential for great film is somewhere deep down below.
Okay...this is not a perfect movie, and it is hard to categorize because it is not violent enough for today's action movie label, funny enough for today's comedy tag or serious enough to earn the drama moniker.
In the end, the mobsters (including a young Ben Stiller, who comes across remarkably like an arrogant little prick) can't defeat the dirty-fighting Hillbillies because the mobsters are sissies who like to look pretty and the Hillbillies, hell they don't care how dirty they get.
Many of whom feel betrayed because Truman left the simple country life for the bright lights of the big city.
If you're looking for Lawrence of Arbia, keep looking, because you're not going to find it here.
There really isn't a lot of action until the end, but I can't imagine it being categorized as anything else because the plot was so transparent and shallow that it couldn't be considered a drama or anything.
That's like comparing Tim Burton's ED WOOD to Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE because they're both in black-and-white!
They're both great movies, but it's ridiculous to stand them next to each other because they're so vastly different.
I wasnt sure what to expect from this movie because i knew it combined my favourite actor De Niro's stongest(Gangster roll) and weakest (Comedy)acting aspects in one film .
Any worries i had soon were dispelled because i loved the film.
I have just watched Miike Takashi' film Visitor Q, tonight, and i think that it is one of the most insane and disturbing films that i have ever seen, since Ichi The Killer another of Miike's films I almost found it too shocking to watch parts of it because of the film content.
The main character kills a hooker and has sex with the dead body all the while filming it, because he's an angry premature ejeculater.
I was uncertain at the beginning because the use of video quality made it seem all too real.
I did not enjoy it because it made no sense.
My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under.
This wannabe director, Miike, will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just doesn't have the talent!
They are NOT okay because they are "just in the film."
It's not imaginative or even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world.
One that really sticks out is when DeNiro consults Crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn't...get it up.
And there's a great interaction in which Crystal explains a theory by Sigmund Freud about a child in Greece who killed his father because he wanted to marry his mother.
We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up.
It's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be.
Partly because of the situation itself, and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this!
A stated theme of the movie in dialog is that Japan is falling apart because the traditional family is falling apart... yet that family comes back together through some of the most perverse acts ever recorded and distributed (besides Italian Giallo films, but this is better).
Visitor Q is probably the weirdest of his weird movies that I've seen yet, maybe more so because it's missing any of the supernatural elements present in most of his other films.
I'll admit that I did feel somewhat dirty because I got turned on by the opening scene...but hey, it's a just a movie.
But you see, the film is not only about the shock value, for Miike makes sure that there is substance to the story, because it really touches upon some important social themes.
All in all I thought this movie was hugely entertaining, just because of the fact that I couldn't believe some of the things that were happening on the screen as I watched.
It does have some gore and blood, but Id say its more a horror movie because of the places that it takes us on a psychological level.
At one point I did make the comparison with another great film "Man Bites Dog" because I found my self-laughing at situations so real and horrifying.
It's often compared to Pasolini's SalÃ² because of its shocking content, but, plot-wise, it's virtually a remake of the 1968 film, brilliantly updated and moved to modern Japan.
Also noticed Joe E. Brown, not because I knew him by sight, but his voice I knew from the movie "Some Like It Hot".
It must still be fresh in Stark's memory, because something in 'Julietta' smells derivatively of the latter film.
A pity, because lead actress Lavinia Wilson offers a promising performance which is wasted on this film.
I love bio documentaries such as these because you see more than just what is on the screen or read in People magazine.
This, in the long turn, ruined her life because the drugs created a dependency she was never able to shake.
Her variety show was an excellent program, but because of the time slot, it never got the ratings that were expected.
Sickening and chilling is the account of how both Mayer AND Judy's mother virtually forced her to abort her first pregnancy because it was the "wrong" time for her to have a child.
At first I only wanted to see the movie because of my father but I enjoyed the film.
One really can't fairly comment on good lighting or bad lighting because of this (this cheap approach also heavily impacts sound transfer).
This really was a strange little Movie.The Musicians in particular had a great time playing (or miming as happens in Film) up on "Sally Gap" in Wicklow in Ireland in November where it was at least 8 degrees below and the cast and crew were up there for 12 hours at the wedding scene.It really was freezing.I played Bodhran (Irish Drum) and i had to put my hand in hot water because it was frozen to the stick which plays the instrument.But for the fun value we had making that movie deserves 9/10.We filmed the pub scenes in Ardmore Studios which was a much warmer affair.Maybe i'm wrong but i seem to remember a day being taken off when Malosovich was captured due to Goran our Director being an immigrant Serb.
I really don't want to spoil it for you here, because the movie has not much else going for it than the twist ending, and even that twist is paper thin, almost as if Kevin Costner at the end of "Water World" had found out that he belonged to the latest Sea World attraction (no, it's actually not THAT bad).
Unfortunately, for SÃ¡nchez and Myrick that means that they will be forever condemned to have directed only one great movie, which is great only because it pretends not to have been directed at all.
Here they find a mother and daughter (the best actor in the film) the mother having tattoos that Victor notes "Never seen tattoo's like that before", possibly because they were drawn on with a marker.
They had to really and social services leave Libby in Dave's care, because you would wouldn't you?
This remains a mystery, in this film, because it is never completely revealed.
It is entertaining, and the film is good because it makes one infinitely think.
And since none of the imagery, dialog or plot element is particularly engrossing, we can't take a "mind trip" as if this was a Lynch movie either, because use symbolism in this film is weak and immature.
They arrive at a public phone near an old gas station where a woman is lying on the ground and her young daughter immediately warns the paramedics to hurry up because "they are coming."
Believers is most effective in the little details...the ever present loud speakers in the compound, constantly burbling propaganda you can only half hear, the glassy expressions on the faces of the cult members, the fact that these weird people are scary because they are NOT overtly evil.
I want to see it again so I can hear all the lines I missed the first time because I was laughing so hard.
A shame this is so bad really, because I like bad horror movies and actually rather liked the basic premise: Back when the Spanish were being generally unpleasant to natives in America, they enslaved the local populace and got them to mine all the gold out of the mountains and basically ended up with a wet dream's worth of gold.
How lame is that, plus is Drake suppose to be one of the seven monks, because they never said.
I can't comment on the 'stunts' because there weren't any that were bigger than someone rolling off a 1-storey roof onto the ground.
Still I gave this movie a 3 because of cast, acting, makeup and stuff.
You see there's a pattern now in the film industry - Hollywood does action films, because they cost so much to make, and the Brits do comedy or drama.
I think it was a good thing that he was a sensitive, slightly wimpy with the asthma, and afraid of heights, because this made him a much better Romantic Hero.
I'm sorry to those of you who didn't like it because of the language but it is rated R and it has Robert De Niro, what do you expect??
Perhaps I would have understood the dialogue better if it was spoken in fluent French because I had a serious problem making out the broad Geordie accents .
I can only talk about what was wrong with the first half because that's when I walked out and went to the pub for a much needed drink:  1) someone's standing on a balcony about to jump and so you send a helicopter to shine a searchlight on them???
Later, when she arranges matters less formally and straddles his lap, he apologies because he still can't perform.
There is a "twist" ending which makes no sense, again because the "curse" is unknown, and if the main character does supposedly know it, why is she happily having the babies?
The visuals are good in the movie, the director is fairly good, the early creep factor at a decent level but because of the ending I can't give this movie a good rating.
Not just for the eyes, because there's plenty there to see; but, she also builds the suspense incredibly well as Jill Michaelson.
However, as Roderick's book unfolds with the movie, we find out that Jill is there as a surrogate for Maddie, who went insane because of the incest.
OKAY, now watch the rest of the movie, because the last 15-to-20 minutes make it all worthwhile.
Roderick asks Jill to stay because he needs her, but she only gradually discovers his full intent.
At the time, I didn't really understand it that much, because I lived in the suburbs and the story of a young poor boy's struggle in the inner city didn't mean a lot to me.
Was there an alternate scene shot for the cat's death because the hanging was too horrible?
I used to cry all the time, especially because I experienced so much sadness when I saw the stray cats in my neighborhood who I wanted to bring home but couldn't & I'd see these kittens/cats every day.
I grew into adulthood acting and feeling the same way towards cats/dogs - feeding strays, feeling sadness because they are strays, wishing I can bring every last one of them home, I'm one of the biggest animal lovers you could know.
i was fascinated by this honest slice of life so different from my own suburban existence, yet so relevant because of its universal emotion.
A lot of the story I couldn't remember because I was only about 7 or 8 when I last saw it, I'm 43 now.
Apparently scores of other viewers felt the same way, because it was run again a week later.
One gets the impression that JT will finally grow up, because of the responsibility he took for the cat and that the cruelty of his life, the fate of the cat, will make him a man that his mother and grandmother can be proud of.
Everyone who watches this will have tears in their eyes at some point, but that's okay because "J.T."
I always thought his name was Derek Blackpool..to me that seems funnier somehow than Dirk (maybe because it rhymes with Eric?).
The only thing that I can think of that is a negative point for this movie is that after you watch this, Comedy is RUINED...because NOTHING is funny after you watch this.
I don't want to tell you much about this film because I don't want to spoil it for you by giving you account of the funny scenes.
It's the type of comedy where most of the characters are intelligent but still end up at each other's throats because of differences in personality and background.
They inadvertently take a can of tuna fish without paying, and when they're pulled over as murder suspects, they end up "confessing" to a crime they don't even realize they're being charged with, because of carefully parsed conversations aided by their paranoia about the rough-and-tumble justice of the South.
It avoids that fate partly because of a cleverly written screenplay, but even more because of the warm performances.
I give this movie a 9 because I've watched this movie a record 32 times (if not more in bits and pieces) and still manage to fall off the chair laughing through most parts of the movie.
"My Cousin Vinny" isn't the great court room drama because it's filled with things that are simply against the rules of court, but since the film is told in such tongue-and-check fashion, it simply adds to the great on-screen chemistry of the actors involved and themes of the film.
On top of this, he hasn't had a good night's sleep because it keeps getting interrupted by loud noises throughout the night, the judge doesn't like him and keeps putting him in jail for contempt, a local idiot who wants to fight him for $200 that he owes Vinny so there is a lot of factors working against him.
I'm not a big fan of comedies since the premise usually over stays it's welcome by at least half an hour , but screenwriter Dale Launer has crafted a very funny , well paced script that succeeds because of the amount of obstacles for the characters .
There are people out there that try to demean her Oscar triumph that year because the favourite did not win like anticipated.
I won't belabor relating and describing the plot, because that's been recited nicely by numerous others.
This film really never got on the public's radar the way it should have, probably because there are no big-name actors featured as box office draw.
This dialogue is brilliant because of excellent performances by both Marisa Tomei and Joe Pesci.
Great Guns takes us back to war days, a period when people were having to tighten their belts because times were hard.
The guest cast (the leads of which are picked because they're photogenic, and virtually none of them display comic timing) react against L & H as if they're a couple of bozos, but not because the duo are acting in any way strange.
For comparison, I suppose I would rate the Hal Roach "ChumpÂ" at 6 out of 10 (maybe a little higher because of the background music), "Swiss Miss" 7 out of 10 (I'd give it 7-1/2 if it were in color), and I'd rate "Bonnie Scotland" 8 out of 10 because L&H so thoroughly sustain the integrity of their personalities, and because they dance.
(By the way just because I watched the two in a row; I must say that "La Faute Ã  Fidel" is much more effective than "Persepolis" in order of viewing the world from a growing child's point-of-view.
I thought it was going to be a heavy dark film - and it might be on one level - but it's not at all on the other, mainly because it is about seeing the ('grown up') world from a child's point of view.
This is partly because of the wonderfully expressive actress playing the part, and partly because it is easy to recall how we felt about things as children and recognize how we would react to the clearly drawn situations of the film.
It is also remarkable because while most French movies let you know what characters think simply by having them talk endlessly, Anna keeps her words short and to the point and the adults around her never seem to explain things as much as they ought to.
This is a quiet, thoughtful movie and it took me a while to get into it, perhaps simply because I approach French movies with a certain amount of suspicion, which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8.
Despite this Anna is treated like an equal when among her parents and the "barbudos", because they make the effort to explain and reason to her the things she doesn't understand.
The manner in which these adults talk with Anna is short-lived, because as soon as she dons a uniform and becomes part of the strict and religious system (that is her school) she is no longer that free-thinking individual.
This is interesting because it serves as visual allegory for rebellion as it's in direct contrast with the notorious aspects of Franco's fascist regime and his renowned focus on traditional values.
It is impossible not to identify with little Anna, partially because she herself is so fair, and partially because it is such a thrill to see the psychology of the socialization process displayed so well and true in a movie, but also because Nina Kervel-Bey is such a powerful little actress who was so wondrously directed by Julie Gavras.
for example Anna's mother makes a comment that she can get the kind of issues-political writing she is turning her repertoire to published in Marie Clare, but later throws out a copy of the magazine when her article isn't published, proving that just because you want to save the world doesn't mean Marie Clare does.
Ben is currently dealing with a emotional patient (Molly Shannon) distressed because her spouse left and filed a restraining order on her.
Harold Ramis's comedy obviously borrows ideas from past comparable films like "Grosse Point Blank" and "Mafia," but as this production proves, just because it was done before doesn't mean it cannot be successfully accomplished again with the right casting.      
I wish there was more about her skills in the movie because her abilities and specificities as a character were the most exceptional and unique parts of the movie...  We see the big brother in the beginning as a cool and promising image, the brain of their smuggler team...
Rian Johnson omitted a plot point because he said (at the Q&A afterward) that he couldn't come up with a clever idea for it.
Johnson also omitted a scene because he felt it changed the mood of the film so dramatically that it didn't fit.
I found myself stepping backward by the last act, because I no longer felt connected to the story.
I understand that it's nice to discuss a film and have something to talk about with people, but to leave gaping holes in it because you couldn't come up with an idea on your own or because the scene filmed changed the mood just isn't the way to do it.
It does that, because it prepares you for the rest of incredibly shallow, stupid and devoid of any logic "creation" (can't really bring myself to call it a movie).
It all goes something like this: "he is a con men... never mind how and why, just go with it because I say so, I'm not clever enough to think of a good con to corroborate the story... just go with it or else I don't have a movie!"
But it sags in the middle because, for all its charm, it feels like an artificial construct from first to last.
They con a group of well-off schoolchildren into paying them for the privilege of entering a magical cave, and though they get caught and have to return the money, they profit from a kickback deal with a dry cleaning establishment because the kids get coated with mud in the cave.
So is the role of a con mastermind, because he is best at playing weak people.
I wouldn't, because Johnson doesn't' get the fundamental aspects of con jobs right.
Eastern Europe provided much of the picturesque backdrop on which the story got told, jet-setting from one locale to another, while the costumes and suits used in the film, primarily in black and/or white, were simply gorgeously designed, that you'd do a double take at how pretty they look (or is it because the stars have the charisma to carry them off).
As kids, they were troublemakers getting kicked out of orphan homes because of their appalling behavior.
Brody and Weisz seemingly begin to have seemingly soft feelings for each other because they seemingly understand one another's loneliness and displacement.
Rinko Kikuchi steals every scene as walking sight gag Bang Bang, so-called because she's a whiz with explosives, practicing on toys cobbled together from old Barbie dolls and other toys.
(I give it a 10 because I want to impress upon people the need to support movies like this.)
There are some movies which are so bad you can find them amusing, fun, easy to follow because of their badness... well, fascinating stuff.
Rinko Kikuchi steals every scene as walking sight gag Bang Bang, so-called because she's a whiz with explosives, practicing on toys cobbled together from old Barbie dolls and other toys.
It's actually, not too unlike Anderson (again, sorry), more European influenced in that regard as it takes us along on its journey because of the characters, not the other way around.
More because of Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz, who play off each other wonderfully as an at-first awkward couple who get further romantically involved (there's a wonderful, spot-on charming scene where we see them kiss, and we understand clearly Penelope is having her first French-style) and connect closest with how Johnson casts them.
Ultimately this movie made such a strong impression on me because of how well her character worked for me and the strong chemistry she had with Adrien Brody.
When looking up from underneath everything looks like it is one place but actually is in a slightly different place because water refracts light, changing the view for the submerged.
The younger, Bloom, has been playing the roles written by Stephen since they were children, always embodying the character so easily because it allowed him to be that which was not himself.
No one truly can tell what's real because not only are they unsure themselves, they know that every one of them has the potential to make-up an elaborate scheme to confuse and manipulate.
This film ranks as one of my favourite films because of its delightfully skewed world that at the same time holds true to itself.
It's a shame that this movie is so obscure and so overlooked because it deserves at least one look just for all-time sakes.
Think of a music video for John Tesh set in South Korea w/ a virginal 16 yr. old often dressed in white swinging back & forth off the bough of the ship & older men oggling her endlessly, interrupted periodically by scenes of a man old enough to be her grandfather shooting arrows at them because he's jealous.
Slightly uneven because of this seemingly last-minute inclusion, THE BOW is nonetheless worth a look.
Although at first the old man might seem like a kindly, albeit creepy, grandfatherly figure, the man's plans for the girl are not so pure because he plans to marry her on her seventeenth birthday.
Dressed in thin dresses, even in the bitter cold, the girl is not hesitant to sit close to the fishermen and because she has grown into a stunning young woman, many of the fishermen try to take advantage of her simple nature.
The lack of dialogue between the leads in The Isle and 3-Iron worked well because these couples could communicate with each other emotionally, and the absence of words only accentuated their strange bond.
The visitors (impure thoughts) were attempting to spoil the purity of his soul while he was protecting it with the bow (his focused consciousness, or could be by a state of meditation, because in a meditation the mind becomes as focused as the arrow shot from a bow).
I'm so proud because "Orient Express" is great!
I rated the movie at maximum because it really worths!
I felt very sorry seeing some negative comments from some users, and mostly because they were Romanians...
His movies are filled with "patriotism" because they have a history based topic.
That acting is wooden & somebody thought they were making something good, because it seems like there was some care in the making of it.
No characters has any interesting point besides the villain just because he remains a bit mysterious but we'll quickly discover that besides his strange eastern accent he has nothing more to deliver than pure brute stupid violence.
Also the usual Hollywood Non-Stop Running, Car-chase, Helicopter Raging Gun-battles are missing here-- again because of the different sensibilities.
I actually know something about this film because the producer of the movie was my landlord at one point.
The Psychotronic Man is a grade B movie that's true, but it is actually an important and noteworthy piece mostly because of its relationship to film history and several other oddities that surround it.
Many of the centrally located automobile chase scenes and running gun battles were shot on the sly without the permission of any authorities because no film commission existed.
Directors like Melville knew that they could not compete on special effects etcetera because of the smaller budgets.
I'm pretty disappointed not to be hearing about this movie a little more because it definitely deserves more recognition than it is getting now.
First of all, I love kinda movies like this one and I consider myself lucky of having watched it last weekend in my former girlfriend's flat because she has always been a b-movies freak and so.
MST3K hasn't touched this, only because there's not much to work with.
I pity the people who made this movie, because it has got to reflect some part of their bland, disconnected, below-average life experiences.
Now Bounderby talks with a lower class accent throughout the novel, and Mrs. Sparskit's amorous interest in him is based on the idea that he's low born and wealthy, and she is poor but aristocratic - they are meant for each other because she can raise him properly to his social sphere.
I am not sure if it has been released publicly or just because it was filmed where I presently live.
Gianna was also Marco's lover, and the two scheme to murder Nancy because when she "comes of age", the inheritance is hers.
You always wonder what might happen next despite the fact that writer-director Silvio Amadio lays the cards out on the table midway through regarding how Dorothy was killed, detailed how it was accomplished, letting us know that Nancy might be in grave danger because the murder was so well orchestrated.
The Flyboys caught my eye because of all the raving reviews it got on the IMDb.
This movie is powerful on many levels...the character development, the plot, the acting, the special effects, the scenery, the music...it is uplifting and "on the edge of your seat" exciting....you are not just watching this movie..you are involved in it because you are carried away by the story...you are so affected by the plot and the compassion that you feel for the characters...I was especially touched by the development of the friendship between the two boys and the influence of the grandfather and the uncle in this story....and the truth revealed that good things can come from life experiences that, at the time, seem too challenging for words!
I saw this movie at the Riverside Film Festival and was shocked to find out it has not been released nationwide because it was not picked up by the big studios for distribution.
I still cannot believe I wasted my time because of this movie.
And of course there's this sad ending where Goku Jr. cries all because the dragon ball didn't grant his wish, soon a figure appears before him, it's his great-great grandfather Goku!
The screenplay of "Hard Times" must have been a hard one to develop because of its crossover components but I do commend Cuenca and Alejandro Hernandez for their triumphant scribing effort.
Suburban Commando is a very good film and its one of Hulk Hogan`s best films.It is one of My favorite films.I was thrilled when it came out because back when wrestling was wrestling it was so fun watching the then WWF Prime Time Wrestling show and seeing the promotions on it while watching some of the best wrestling ever seen back in 1991.Anyway the film is action packed and has many,many funny moments.One of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd stars along with the Hulkster and he is very good in it.Christopher Neame had a very short part and I think he should have had a much larger role in the film.William Ball,Shelley Duvall,Roy Dotrice,and Larry Miller all put on good performances.I was amazed to see Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the film.
I have to say I was interested in this because I respected the director for energy he put into Wrong Turn and had really liked Dushku on Tru Calling.
I believe this movie went to theaters shortly and then was immediately sent to Video because the studio knew this was not a bad film.
If you like the CSI type shows then stay home and watch your favorite one of those because it will be more interesting than this flick.
Irecommend you this film as one of the good ones...because it's original...not one of the same old FBI movies and investigations that you wish you never watched to the end.
No one call tell me that that a captain of the police will let a mentally insane ex-detective on a serial killer just because they were engaged?
Then he wants to act all "iffy" because he might get demoted!
Then the police plants evidence on this mentally ill guy because they were sure it was him; yeah right...
In AlphaKiller, a renegade cop does her own thing, barging in on hostage situations, ejecting herself past all restrictions, not because it's plausible for a minute, but because a strong character (trans: loose cannon) can waltz over the problems of a poorly constructed narrative, and overcome the barriers that society places on "getting things done" (This is familiar from hundreds of movies dating all the way back to Charles Bronson's Deathwish in the 70s).
Perhaps audiences want to see someone go maverick because they deliriously imagine this conforms to their own lives.
No one has this much autonomy because society would be in chaos.
Mostly because we were both hoping for justice.
The film's second half fails to convince, largely because of its clichÃ©d plot contrivances.
Just because it's loosely based off a real life event does not mean it should become a movie.
That is not actually a rhetorical question because what he is like is clearly Stephen Fry on steroids - physically rather than intellectually you understand.Now I am old and flabby,but my excuse is that I'm also poor and anonymous,I don't go to the gym(I wouldn't know what to do if I ever got there)and I don't have a personal trainer,a life coach or any other of those completely essential adjuncts to showbiz fame.Mr Seagal has no such cop outs.He is an "Action Movie" star,not a bleeding couch potato yet his spare tyre is bigger than the one on David Beckham's Hummer.
The first ten minutes made me laugh more than the whole of "The Bucket List".A blonde - haired lady with muscular thighs and some sort of circus costume jumps on and off lorries killing highly - armed soldiers before disappearing from our ken rather mysteriously.That bloke from Bros should have stuck to causing pre - pubescent girls to lose bladder control because there's more future in that for him than in acting.
I say this because the film had me interested from start to finish.
So I went rented this movie along with Black Dawn because the thought of a good Seagal film got me overly excited.
If you watch this, DON'T RENT, and find a plot please let me know what it is because while watching the 84 minutes of this trash, in between the horrible acting and watching Seagal being out of breath, I couldn't find one.
I guess Seagal didn't want to get wet or the floor because his fat a$$ may have fallen down and not gotten back up.
), because they are trying to save a black kid and his mother.
It's no better than if the director looked at the camera for 5 minutes and said: "Hey, isn't this funny because I'm making fun of stuff you hate?"
And this is one of the main reasons the film succeeds, because its plot devices rely basically on our empathy for the lead character.
i had really low expectation going in.mainly because of the words MTV films appearing on the screen was surprised at how well done this psychological suspense thriller was.i found it very atmospheric,and suspenseful.there weren't a lot of cheap scares.it was intelligent,and well written,in my opinion.the ending was unexpected.i was also very impressed with the acting.Nora Zehetner as Christy was very good,but Matthew Settle as John really impressed.basically,my opinion of MTV films went up several notches after this film was over.i don't get the low rating(5.3/10).but that's just my opinion.for me,Beneath is a well deserved 8/10
Not that it's particularly "scary" in the typical horror film sense, but because of the human suffering and injustice involved.
Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river.
Watching it was amazing because I've seen this play so many times, and yet for some reason they found a new better way of doing it.
I stayed in the end because I figured that I might as well if I had made it through the rest of it.
Lots of "nostalgia" about a way of life that has been lost because of ecological destruction caused by man's "progress".
A lot of people don't seem to like it because it doesn't seem to have much point other than the sex.
I tried because the cinematography was so wonderful but one doesn't want to walk out of the theater whistling the camera work.
I wanted to see more of June because I was left not quite understanding how she worked.

I gave it a 9 because I felt it was a little slow in places, but besides the pace, I think this film has a lot to offer and we can learn from it.
I recommend this movie if you need a pick-me-up and if you enjoy Spanish cinema, because this is one of the best Spanish films I have seen recently.
The sex scenes earned their classification as "erotic" primarily because everyone moves slowly, and they're filmed mostly in extreme close-up--but they weren't nearly as sexy as the shower scene in Porky's.
I loved this picture because it has beautiful cinematography and settings of Paris.
Director Phillip Kaufman stirred up quite a bit of controversy when this film was first being released, most likely because of the intensity of the love scenes, but after watching the DVD I am now thinking that this film could have maybe slipped by with an R rating.
And I don't care, because Tilda Swinton is plenty of reason to watch any movie.
As other commenter's have noted, her scene in the public bathroom on the ski trip is at times uncomfortable because of how devastatingly powerful it is.
Tamblyn's performance deserves a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination at the very least, but because this film has barely been seen (even seemingly by the frequent movie-going audience of IMDb!
It's a shame, because this is a remarkable film.
I decided to see it again because this production had gotten good reviews, and it starred Jason Robarts, with Ellis Rabb and Colleen Dewhurst in the cast.
), which gives free room and board to several people like DiPinna and Kolenkhov, and which encourages freedom (Penelope writes stories because a typewriter was once delivered to the house by mistake, her daughter paints DiPinna as a discuss thrower, her husband makes illegal firecrackers in the basement,and her son-in-law earns his living with his small printing press (unfortunately printing Communist posters).
And in this case, those of us who never saw him on the stage get a big treat, because this was a taped Broadway production.
The book tells about the difficulties in making a movie in the Amazon jungle, because of the environmentalists, and the bureaucracy.
Tomme recognizes him and trusts him because he is the "man in his dreams" whom he calls Dada.
It is a bitter sweet story because Markham could never make his son happier than he already was, and lost forever chance of knowing his son and making him happy.
The film involves the viewer because the situation at the center of the story feels plausible.
All in all , because of the story, the acting and the direction, Lobsterfarnm feels very real.
While the film was set in East Africa, Shaft looks little like one of these people--mostly because almost all Black-Americans trace their ancestry back to West Africa--on the other side of the continent.
I rented this movie because it seemed so ridiculous and I thought it would be hilarious.
In yet another Seduction Cinema soft-core parody, Dildo Baggins (Misty Mundae, because she can NEVER not be in a Seduction Cinema movie *rolls eyes*) along with fellow Throbbit lesbian lovers, Horny and Spam go off to destroy the evil G-string, after drunk perverted Smirnof, the Wizard presents that quest to them.
(some plot content included, although there is no way to spoil this crap) Ok, here's the scene: Me and my friends are renting movies one night and we decide to rent this (thinking it would be funny, not a porn because of it's R rating).
Are those votes low because of the nudity?
I enjoyed this film as well as Play-mate of the Apes, and her others strictly because of her beguiling, overwhelming and underrated talent as an actress.
In the end, Lord of the G-Strings succeeds in part because it doesn't take itself too seriously, but mostly because it has the appeal of the "real deal", a true diamond in the rough, with the multi-talented, naturally beautiful and irresistible charming; Misty Mundae!
I give it a 2 only because Misty Mundae was her ever-amusing self in it.
I've been wanting to see this movie for ages because I love tongue in cheek musicals and Christopher Lee is good.
I gave this movie a 2 simply because the acting (aside from 2 women who make a brief appearance, only to be killed) was not as bad as i had expected.
While they spend great chunks of time rehashing plot points from the first movie, don't pay too much attention because they alter details at will; for instance, Julie Andelman is nowhere to be seen in spite of part one's tease ending.
This is a pretty unique picture, even if the roots of the story obviously come from Tarzan, because it manages to be three things at once; an exciting jungle action flick, an intimate family drama and a sobering environmental message movie.
It manages to achieve this I think partly because of the excellent script by Rospo Pallenberg, and partly because there are no big-shot movie stars in the cast looking ridiculous in the jungle.
I don't want to spoil the movie because I think it really deserves to be watched.
However, this fact is even more disturbing than the earlier film because the girl involved in this case is not yet 12-years old!
I'm thinking this must have been pre-code, because the word "sex" is used quite a bit, and listen closely, and there is even a cute "flockin'" flaunting of the F word.
The premise really is not funny, and while this may have had some shock value in its day, because Hopkins certainly played it brazen, it is very hard to find cute.
It is hard having an "outlaw" relationship orientation, because most people who hear of it misunderstand it.
Apparently, only the plot of Coward's play is kept here, with all of the dialogue excised because it was too dirty for 1930s Hollywood.
Whereas Noel Coward's original play seemed scandalous because it was about two not-so-in-the-closet homosexual artistes living with a hot broad in a Paris walk-up tenement, Ben Hecht's adaptation seemed scandalous in an entirely different manner: he re-fashioned it into a story about two clearly heterosexual artistes taking turns hiding the salami with a hot broad in a Paris walk-up tenement.
I bought the Gary Cooper collection because of "Design for Living".
People in the know realized that Lunt was gay and (rumor had it) Fontane was a lesbian, but the marriage worked because of mutual artistic respect and partnership (oddly enough not so much in film - only one movie, THE GUARDSMAN - but in stage work and later television).
But besides all that this really wacky movie is a delight and I sure wish they'd re-release it because it's so good.
Flypaper is compared unfavorably with Pulp Fiction and various Cohen Brother films, perhaps because there is no warmth or adulation, no well-thought-out view from nowhere.
Sure, you're not supposed to like the 'bad guy' but in this case it went beyond 'dislike' to 'I despise this movie because the bad guy is so annoying.'
The specifics of the plot are not even worthy of discussion, because at best they were completely ripped from the original film, or taken straight from the journal of a screenwriter who has the same ability to tell stories as a veteran who can't get over a war.
I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like "well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then there's an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies" and so on.
Perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what I left.
But, for no valid reason, their liberty was taken from them because of the law instated to counter terrorist acts happening during "la crise d'octobre".
You cannot compare this movie to a war film because it isn't, neither can it be compared to a drama because it is not that either.
I give it a 9.5/10 (Only reason it's not 10/10 is because of Big and the fishing)
Those two seconds must have had all of the action because there was really nothing left in this movie that would qualify it as a nasty.
This one deserves a fatality because it is extremely out of focus!
Naturally the film caused a hystery due to its sadistic and graphic (but not gratuitous) violence and many producers and directors started to rip that film off in order to "satisfy" the audience that liked the violence in Deodato's film so much even though that is definitely not even the film's point, it is its theme, and everyone watching Holocaust because of its violence are closer to the film's message than they could have ever (dared to) thought.
because CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE comes across in so campy and implausible that it defies any kind of belief in reality, whatsoever.
You might add Jacopeti and Prosperi's "Mondo Documentaries" too, because I think they really opened this particular door.
Somehow--because the writers don't tell us how--the soldiers have become infected with a rabies-like virus that makes them cannibalistic.
I give it 4 because i love hammer films, if i didn't i'd be giving it a 2.
The film was banned in many countries because she was only 15 at the time.
It's a shame too, because the plot isn't a bad one.
The film takes ages to get anywhere, and by the time something does happen, you don't care because you're so bored.
If you stumble across it be sure to watch because in my opinion this is the greatest film ever made!
Second, the ending which would have been a lot better (having Lee getting impaled) was removed because they realized it was pretty much identical with one of the Dracula films that Lee had already made for Hammer Studios.
Why, right at the end, are we suddenly introduced to the mysterious properties of flint-stone, and why, when it's got the blood of one of Satan's acolytes on it, will flint automatically protect the hero from demonic attack (if this is a part of arcane lore, how on Earth were we supposed to know Â because the impression this movie gives is that we should be blown away by this revelation and say: "Wow, why didn't I see that coming?")?
Kinski herself doesn't add much, apart from the aforementioned risquÃ© moments, and this is a pity because the rest of the cast do a good job.
Dennis Wheatley, the author of the book, condemned it because there was little resemblance to his novel and what appears on screen, except for the title.
This film turns out to be the horror film equivalent of "Casablanca" because the movie as originally scripted was not filmable.
"To the Devil...a Daughter" followed the genre setting "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" and was the last Hammer film because it was too little and too late.
If one is steeped in the occult traditions, then this movie is not for you because of its glaring errors - all made up by the afore mentioned screen writer.
This may be a true story although there are critics out there who claim that the man made up the story because he wanted attention.
It was powerful to hear the reporter say that 40 percent of the world's oxygen supply is generated by the rain forests and watch Markham dismiss him because of his ignorance to the real issue.
This scene was powerful because it shows that the boy had actually become loyal to his kidnappers and what they stand for, not the white man plight for development and industrialization.
It's a great suspenseful, spooky movie without any gore because of the time period it was made in.
This is coincidentally also one of the last roles of Gene Tierney, one of the most luminous of actresses because of her classic beauty.
And this is one particular thing which brings beautiful harmony to The Enchanted Forest - it is not just down to earth because of it's setting, because of good actors and acting or because of a good story - but because it has not been afraid to remain true to another part of life, inherent in the films settings and culture.
Both Mani & Ilayaraja were at a great advantage, working in this movie because they were unencumbered by living up to the expectations of their native Tamil movie background.
I wont say they fall in love because the movie never considers the romantic side of their life.
I took it simply because I needed a natural science credit and all the other classes were full.
it's very realistic and sad movie which tell us about a short love but real one (because this love stand against all difficulties of those days).
The movie and its story is kept fairly simple and because of that the movie also feels very straight-forward, which definitely is a plus for these type of movies.
It's a cheesy silly B-movie, that because of that also at the same time becomes very entertaining to watch.
I gave it a 10 because I do not see anything to improve.
In fact because of that song (and other reasons), I thought that was the best scene in the movie.
This is one of my personal favorites not just because it has a truly awesome car,The Tubo Interseptor,but it also has a cool almost Western like plot.The story starts with a bizarre spirit forming in the middle of a vacant Arizona road,he apparantly comes from outter space,along with his super-flashy car.This spirit or Wraith as he is referred to in the title is actually the avenging spirit of a murdered local kid back to take on the gang who killed him and that has been terrorizing the roads of Arizona.Charlie Sheen plays the Wraith and Sheryle Fenn plays his girl-friend who is being practically held captive by the leader of the same motor gang that killed Sheen's characterfrom the beginning.Naturally,The Wraith,or Jake as he is called when in human form,takes on these motor thugs one-on-one in some very cool and dizzying death races.In my humble opinion,the best part of this film is the soundtrack.With awesome hard rock from Ozzy,Billy Idol,Robert Palmer,Lion,Honey-moon suite and my personal fav Motley Crue.
I love Charlie,as an actor,and i love this movie because it can touch my heart.
The adult zombies eat flesh because their minds have been corrupted by bigotry, greed, corruption and all the things we experience when we grow up.
Child zombies don't eat flesh because they have retained their innocence.
Good because it sounds like a load of tripe to me!
Somebody in the production crew was very fond of the Japanese cyber-punk subgenre because whenever someone turns into a zombie the camera is undercranked while they shake their heads violently back and forth.
Stay the hell away from anything that William Victor Shotten has done, not because it's cheesy, or because the stories are terrible, or because the cast's performance makes you physically ill, but because he makes even the worst YouTube directors look like Peter Jackson, hell, he even makes Uwe Boll look like Peter Jackson.
This isn't good though because it's more shameless than horrifying.
This was probably made because someone said "Dude, wouldn't it be cool if we made a zombie movie?"
I bought it because the cover looked scary.
Most of the time you can't see the actors expressions or faces because of the shadows.
It's movies like this -- cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy, but which get cherry spots on Blockbuster shelves because they're packaged with slick cover art -- that give horror movies in general (and zombie movies in particular) a bad name, and that make horror fans so wary.
Rehman..but its not fair to judge A r rehman with this movie because the music of a movie is to an extent influenced by the story and acting.......I wonder how someone like Ajith can ever be called an actor.....his dialogue delivery is pathetic and its better i don't mention his facial expressions......you'd do yourself a favour by not watching this movie...or rather watch it and educate others on how these kinda movies humiliate the once-enchanting Tamil film industry...Also....i beg the filmmakers not to cast people who are stone heads when it comes to dancing in roles that are supposed to highlight it.....For crying out loud, Ajith can't even dance to those funny dappankuthu songs...how can one tolerate him DANCING BHARATHANATYAM......the thought of him donning the role of a classical dancer would make good dancers of yesteryears turn in their graves.....And watch out for the scenes where Ajith is supposed to be projecting an effeminate side.....Its official ...he's the worst(or is there a worser term for that) thing that can happen to Tamil cinema.........
I saw this film in LA, and I have to say that I was practically transported to Cedar Sinai after the screening because I was laughing so hard...
I saw this film because it was a labor of love by Bill Hicks and his best buddy, Kevin Booth.
Obviously ganryu cannot read or comprehend because he would have realized my comparison with Kung Pow - which I never said I liked here - was only to point out how much more annoying the fake-dubbing effect is on a lower budget production.
I didn't just give it a ten because Bill Hicks is god-like, no sir.
The plot needn't detain us - the one about the babe magnet who either wagers himself or else his colleagues wager on his behalf that he can seduce (in the early 40s and The Fleet's In, the GI only had to KISS the girl to win the bet) a girl selected at random by a given date has been around since they were writing with papyrus - because it's Style not Content we've come to see and we don't go away frustrated.
Les Grandes manoevres can be compared to Rules of the Game, and if the Renoir classic is greater, it's because Renoir was dealing with more profound themes.
I say normally speaking because Ulmer missed this one completely.
Jiger is a monster who came back because some construction workers take away a statue that supposedly keeps JIger from escaping.
The film is delightful because of the light touch Mr. Green gave the story.
"Slightly Dangerous" will please everyone because of the magnificent cast in the movie.
If you refer to the woman telling the Malena about her experiences and the fact that one of her friends disappeared because he went to a "marcha" (protest-march), please refer to point NÂº1.
I wanted to see it first and foremost because it was filmed in Madrid, Spain (having lived there, some things were recognizable), and I am a fan of supernatural horror flicks.
I watched this because it was billed as a ghost story, but I enjoyed this film on so many other levels.
Strange this is so obscure, because it's well worth seeing and fits well into the Italian horror niche of the 80's.
The intrigue is generated towards the start mainly because of the fact that the film is so difficult to follow, but once the film enters it's more satisfying second half, these problems are somewhat resolved.
I liked John Rhys-Davies in it, as he is one of my favorite actors, but he must have still been in his Gimli stage when doing it because he came across with that sort of Scottish accent of the dwarf.
The only thing I wasn't totally convinced about was Gerard Depardieu's character - The Cardinal, it was at times difficult to understand what he was saying because of his accent.
Really enjoyed this but especially because of Susie Amy who plays the lead character, she really held her own against some big names, and is beautiful.
This is a great family film but I wouldn't recommend it that smaller children(10 and under) see it because like the ride there are some scenes that would scare them.
Even the couple of times he could have been funny, you felt as if he were afraid to let go because he was in a family movie.
I felt like I needed to continue watching it, however, because I had paid for it on Pay Per View, and that was definitely one I'd ask my money back for had it been at the theater.
I won't go into detail, mostly because it is too inane to repeat.
Or well, maybe it's just because this would be the type of movie that I would had liked to have seen when I was young(er).
And i thought she was the best character in the film, not just because i'm a Jennifer Tilly fan but because she is very funny and has a strong personality for just a head.
The one thing that sets this movie apart from other D.C.O.M.s is that you can relate to Will Browning, because you know how he feels and what he has gone through.
It's a shame, because having more fully rounded characters (as opposed to A Corner in Wheat's faceless crowds) it should have a greater impact.
I rated this film a 4/10, probably a point higher than it's worth because I lived on Long Island and could appreciate the accuracy of the local culture.
I'd never really seen Dishy before, but his performance made me go look up what he's done because he was really great.
I first thought the film was okay, but I enjoyed it only because of my curiosity stemming from the film's rarity.
The characters trying to sabotage the Jupiter Solarization Project are horribly annoying because their merely brats who want to be responsible for the deaths of 200 billion people.
This film has no genre because it is nothing.
because the commentary with the director, producers and Edie Falco is quite enlightening, in respect to both the film and the making of any low-budget film.
It would seem to me that the film is named so because Judy is the one character in the film who has any real desire to leave this community and, however misbegotten, acts upon that desire.
Judy Berlin is a unique independent film and stands out also because it was the final film of the late and great Madeline Kahn.
You don't actually see me, because Iam far off from the scene.
This is an overlooked and sadly neglected little gem of a film, primarily because of some wonderful performances, especially the sadly underused Barbara Barrie.
And it was nice to see a film of this nature done in black and white for once...and done so just because black and white can be as beautiful as color (though it's clearly not up to the standards of earlier Hollywood films), not because it's attempting to be some kind of pseudo-noir film.
Perhaps it could be because "pretentious" is a word most people throw around to sound smart without knowing what it means.
I say this because I missed the tears and drama about Sharpe's faked death (they thought he was dead)in Sharpe's Honour!
The only negative thing I can say about this movie series is the use of an electric guitar as the background music- I have to take points off for that, because the sometimes screeching guitar noises can become annoying at times.
The only reason it didn't get a 1 out of 10 is because you get to see Randy Travis do about a minute's worth of trick gun handling.
The climax is alone worth it for fans of camp because Gruner and Jones duke it out in what amounts to the world's most ridiculous climax.
Anyway,isn't it amazing that this DVD has been redone in 2006 shows,somehow,its popularity: trust me,in business they do not do it because they feel like it.
They did it because there is a demand...
These films are great because they present the subject without promoting it or criticizing it which draws you into the world and allows you to make your own judgments.
You buy into it because you feel as though they are carrying on this long legacy of artistic expression.
Films like these really bother me because they have such potential for greatness, but then take a left turn somewhere instead of staying on the right track.
Just because you know about Sane & Smith, and heard a couple chase stories from your NYU buddy, isn't enough to go out and make a significant Graffiti movie.
Victoria confronts Dyson, who does not react to her threats because he simply didn't do it.
Victoria did not enlist Miss Marple's help because she did not want the murderer brought to justice, she wanted money.
And if you watch the movie carefully, it becomes obvious that Palgrave is not just dug out because of a superfluous pill bottle but on behalf of the doctor who is Miss Marple's ally.
it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed racer, be it dubbed or subbed (i prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny...in a good way).
That's because I was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in Japan.
The real reason I liked Dynomutt was because of the Blue Falcon, who to me was nothing more than a Batman ripoff.
The next day Paula says they should go to the police & confess, an idea that Marcos is not keen on saying that the police will never believe them because he is poor & cannot afford an expensive lawyer.
I rarely heard anything from it and the reason I saw it was because I'm collecting VHS tapes released by Anchor Bay during the late 1990s and CANNIBAL MAN was part of those horror films.
The killings or the repetitive reasons for the man in question to kill are not always convincing but that's because the film is totally symbolic of the time it was made.
That is a shame because it's useless to try and lure in horror/gore hounds for a film that's basically a nice moody drama that will leave one with a saddened, downbeat mood rather than thrills.
The "Cannibal Man" title is silly particularly because there really isn't any cannibalism in the film.
*possible spoilers*  Kevin Smith debut film is brilliant because it works on so many different levels.
I think I like it so much because it isn't just slapstick, but a mix of intelligence with d*ck-n-fart jokes.
NOT one specific group, NOT geniuses, all types unified by the fact they're intelligent WITH passion & have a heart, because that's what Kevin Smith gets to, your heart.
The dialogue, given in moments of calm, sucks you in because of its surrealism, its ability to provoke thought, its reflection of your own experience, and then hits you with some of the most laugh out loud, wet your pants, surreal comedy moments that you just don't expect and have ever seen.
The judgement is left to YOU because Smith doesn't patronise you as Hollywood does, you're treated as if your intelligence is respected and present, which is as acutely as I can put it as to why you ARE a pricking moron if you don't get it.
If you are the elite of people who finds because of this film you are in the minority, you will then realise how many TRULY stupid people there are in the world.
Anyway, Mulder is called in to help talk to Duane because of his "special" background and instead Mulder ends up buying into Duane's "delusion" which we will later find out was true.
doesn't make it less impressive, and knowing the stuff they had to do (like the shudders being closed because they could only film at night, and it was supposed to be day) only makes it more funny.
Working a job that you keep because it's easy.
Kevin Smith is one of my favorite Directors, not only because he can direct, but he can create funny situations out of almost thin air.
First there is the acting, where nearly ever character has at least one take (that made the final cut) where they have a noticeable pause because they either (A)forgot their line (B)got tongue tied on the dialogue Kevin Smith wrote up.
Is it because no one wants to give him a role or is it that he has no interest in movies?
I don't know, I just wish he was around again because he is electric.
Everything occurs, or has occurred, off-screen, so all we get to do is have a good laugh, because no matter how crude it gets (the film is rated R for "Extensive Use Of Extremely Explicit Sex-Related Dialogue"), Smith's writing remains genuinely funny.
"Just because they serve you, doesn't me they like you" became an immortal tagline for one of the best independent comedies of all time, which also launched the career of its director.
The film features Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), two bored New Jersey convenience store employees who are both called in on a Saturday (Dante is especially upset because it's his day off) and the two break every rule in the book as they meander through the day and encounter all sorts of colorful characters.
Shot on a ridiculously low budget, using mostly friends and relatives as the cast and crew (see the line in the credits where "Boom" is credited as "whoever happened to be holding the pole"), "Clerks" is such a great film just because it doesn't try to be more than it is.
You get the sense that this movie is in black and white not to be pretentious, but just because it's a prosaic look at prosaic lives.
This self-indulgent trash was sickening and an insult to talented writers who can't get their films made because they don't have the ins with talented actors like Pantoliano.
You will be in shock and awe that such a heap could ever have been made, i cant spoil the plot because there was none discernible in the mess of the Last Rebel.
His dismal performance wasn't all that noticeable, however, because everybody else stunk like a week old corpse in a broken icebox during a Texas heat wave.
Unlikely because he resembles David Byrne from the Talking Heads and isn't exactly the type of guy you'd think Page and Sheridan would fight over.
It's funny, in an offbeat sort of way, there's not a lot of dialog... and i really must insist, if you do happen to find a copy of this film watch it in french with subtitles (i swear you lose so much from films when you watch it in the dubbed version) I'd give it 8 out of ten, because i came out of the cinema with a smile on my face thinking 'what the?'
I love European films because of keeping their nativity and don't looking forward to earn money.
And i loved those few and short dialogs, because actors were so expressive that words were dispensable, to understand, what they want to say.
I rented this movie because it had Adrian Paul in it, and yes, it did have Adrian Paul in it, but it just barely could be considered a speaking role, more likely hired for his body as he is featured in a couple of nude scenes.
The movie itself was slightly less painful than gouging your eyes out with a rusty spoon, but only because of the Butler, who resembled George Washington.
Perhaps not, but the truth is, you never know, because you weren't there at that time.
However, I don't think we have to praise what we feel is a mediocre presentation simply because it addresses a serious problem.
The acting was well played out because Amy looked so innocent and Coach Nash was just a loser who was only controlling her.
I would definitely recommend this film, if not for its cutely romantic outlook, or its refreshingly talented stars, I'd give it a thumbs-up just because it's English.
I would definitely recommend this film, if not for its cutely romantic outlook, or its refreshingly talented stars, I'd give it a thumbs-up just because it's English.
Well, anyway, for everyone else, if it's a rainy day, you're bored, you don't know what to do, or you're a bit lonely, then just go out and rent this movie, because I'm pretty sure that you'll love it.
But we know that it'll all come out right in the end, because it's that kind of film.
Furthermore it has Joseph Fiennes looking soulful, and Rufus Sewell in a part he wanted "because I got to smoke cigarettes and say 'f*ck!'
Martha does not reciprocate Daniel's advances but because she only has $35 to her name she accepts his hospitality.
I seen this at the video store but passed it by because I thought it was the typical Sarah Michelle-Melissa Joan-Freddie Prinze-Katie Holmes type of romantic comedy.
I know because I was there!
This movie is a real treat for Beatles fans mainly because it was filmed entirely in Liverpool.
I don't know about all you people saying, "oh this was so accurate", because i watched the first part of this movie.
I say supposed because I've never heard of any instance of John Lennon being toted as homophobic, but this movie seemed to have a lot of that.
Think 2001 because the primates resemble those from the Kubrick film.
I'm guessing that's what attracted him to the role of Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes, because though North Sea Hijack is a nice action, adventure film, it's nothing out of the ordinary.
ffolkes got there because the British government could think of no one else who had a chance of thwarting Kramer's plan.
Too bad, because it's a well-made film which generates tension, has an unusual setting in the cold, stormy waters of the North Sea, and has some fine actors.
Also, see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and I still am entertained after 20+ viewings.
10 of 10 mainly because of Roger Moore, but can still stand on its own.
Evidently, Roger Moore had a grand time playing Ffolkes because this qualifies as his most robust, forceful portrayal in years.
i say unfortunately in my summary line above because this could have been a brilliant story of loss of identity, & subsequent fall into insanity, & told in such a way as to not have any neat conclusions, but carried the viewer along for the ride.
It's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn't even show up in the IMDb listings when you put "Peter Pan" into the search engine!
Remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you know what's coming and because older films relied much more on acting as opposed to present day films which tend to rely on special effects, violence and sex.
I gave it 9 stars because they're some parts where the suspense could have been more so scary.
The end of the death scene proved forever and all time Shia's acting skill, because when he sees his dad's dead body his expression conveys the fact that he's dead with no need to show the body at all, that takes skill...  Short hand, Kale spies on people, one particularly hot chick is his focus for a while, but later he turns into a sleuth trying to catch a killer Kale is a nonconformist, that fact likely added to my liking the film...
Oh I know they are trying to come up with something just because so many of us wasted money on this pathetic piece of crap they call film.
The camera work is excellent because it shows only that much which would make you eager to peep beyond the camera frame to see what is there Â and that keeps you engaged.
But I walked out because a boom microphone drops down into view about 20 times in the first 35-40 minutes of this film.
Actually since every rom-com follows that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise, updates it, and makes it his own.
I was never bored and at times actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up.
I watched this flick because of the acclaimed critics.
Well, it was a big mistake, because this film lacks everything that makes a film "viewable".
Disturbia may seem like a send up of Rear Window, Fright Night, and a few others(that I forget at the moment) but if you can ignore that for once and see it with an open mind you'll enjoy it(can't guarantee that because we all have different tastes).
I'm not saying it's scary, I my point to be made was I was more nervous in his movie than in movies like 'Dead Silence' that were actually supposed to scare me ) I gave this a 9 out of 10 because it was entertaining; point blank.
That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window.
As the film went on, the tension got so high that I was literally on the edge of my seat rubbing my hands together because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next.
Overall, this was an amazing thriller, and I'm glad I went to see it because I really wasn't expecting that much.
The movie makes you laugh uncontrollably in parts where you KNOW something funny is going to happen yet still laugh because it's outrageous.
They were calling it a "Smart Porkys", because it had that snappy humor, but it had tits in it to attract teenage males.
This is because almost all references to that cut opening had to be cut, but it was too late to reshoot and in some instances, not possible to cut out of a scene.
I watched this movie because the idea was intriguing.
I don't know what the people who talk about it being "suspenseful" are thinking, because this movie moves like grass growing.
I recommend this movie to all fans of stupid comedy because it is not your average stupid comedy (like Dude, Where's My Car or Dumb and Dumber).
He must be an expert eavesdropper because he had to do some sort of research to hone his wordsmithing ability.
It doesn't matter if that thought is correct or not because the dialogue rules either way.
It is all right to keep your brain on here and it is also all right to turn your brain off as well because this is entertainment as it's finest.
Maybe it was because I saw this one after I had already seen Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but now I got some of those great "in-jokes" that were included in those movies.
Here, in the meantime, he cuts again his regrown mustache, and because this time the change was recognized by his wife, they, again, find each other.
But one can read about other interesting things in that letter Â And mainly I adore mustache because it is French, pure-blooded French wear.
Even the typical cheesy romance parts keep the viewer engaged because of the humour used throughout.
Ben Affleck also makes a great villain - partly because I hate his other movies so much.
I've given the film a high rating because I simply can't get enough of it.
But this commercially mainstream project isn't all a failure, because the film still does come up with an entertaining tale of laid-back characters with a muster of jokes set-up in a mall.
This is Shannen Doherty's best role (mainly because she's hardly ever on screen;), Jason Lee's best role, and Jeremy London's best role (not to be confused with twin brother Jason who was the awesome Randall Pink Floyd in Dazed and Confused...though Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams were both in Dazed as well...)  Look for an amusing role played by Ethan Suplee (Seth in American History X)  Overall: this film just plain rocks!
this is an incredible movie and if your a clerks fan (which I'm assuming is the only Kevin smith film you've seen because its blasphemous to watch them out of order) then this is even better.
mallrats is the kind of movie you watch once on DVD and don't take it out of the drawer, because you know you'll wanna watch it later.
I've read several reviews here that are very negative principally because the reviewer found Wild Man Fischer's music to be either annoying or talentless or some combination of the two.
Time after time his paranoia causes those close to him to have to distance themselves - sometimes for their own safety - because Larry really is a wild man who is subject to paranoid delusions as well as auditory hallucinations.
Sad also because here is a man who obviously craves attention and love and yet his paranoia constantly rears its ugly head and destroys important relationships needlessly.
A thriller about a man losing his mind because no one has noticed he shaved his moustache off?
Maybe it's a commentary on the dangers of being too wealthy (because had we had a struggling couple, something as banal as a moustache wouldn't even enter the picture).
We were told this was because the audio sources varied, but I still felt like this could've been corrected.
There is a minor flaw with the screenplay and that is it looks like it`s going to turn into poor old Aldrich only became a traitor because he wanted to give his family the best out of life , but it doesn`t really turn into an excuse , so why do we have to learn about his sick mother in law and his wife wanting to go to university and getting final demands left right and centre ?
This is one of the rare occasions that the idea of Hollywood remaking this film is actually interesting because hopefully the new writers will expand on the good concept and deliver whole lot more action, horror and drama.
Perhaps this time the move is not so jarring because he has done it before.
Or perhaps it is because his wife seems more approving this time while they are happy on vacation.
Or perhaps it is because he has learned to live in and accept "betweenness" after his experience on the ferry.
And, predictably enough, the dog is now afraid to eat cats because he thinks they are poisoned and most of the movie consists of the mice and cat doing terrible things to try to force them to be eaten!
I didn't know where this was filmed until the end and it's in Tennessee, I could tell it was somewhere in the south because of the obvious accents.
I like this movie because of its rare style similar to the lost skeleton of cadavra.
though I have read a few reviews that hated this DVD because of the   changes what not in the film or score, but I think the f.b.i had something to do with this, so its the politics of DVD they should be upset with.
But Korman is also aware of pressures on himself because he is the manager that are beginning to make him doubt his abilities or his courage.
We, as the audience, can't help feeling that she is playing him, using him because she knows that he will be helpful, and because she needs friends.
Perhaps director Lewis Milestone wasn't aware that he wasn't making a stage production, because although the style resembles many of the time, here he even has the actors exiting what looks like a theatrical set, all the times.
She wants to be the star of the film and she is because she has the talent in order to succeed and she does to legendary status.
The script is exactly the same story except that it is murkier because of all the rainy weather.
(Some spoilers) Getting stuck on the Somoan Island of Pago Pago because of an outbreak of cholera makes life a bit tenuous for the boat passenger stranded there but for fun loving and partying Sadie Tompson, Joan Crawford, it's the best thing that could have happened to her.
Anyway, I'm glad I did see her in this because she proved that she was indeed an excellent actress.
Therein lies the tragedy for Davidson: he pays the ultimate price for misjudging Sadie's power over him because he thinks he's more powerful than she.
These films have almost a European look - appropriate, because the novels are by European writers.
Kibbee says he left the USA because he saw that 'reformers' like the Davidsons were beginning to dominate the body politic in America and he wanted out.
The Evangelical Moral Majority types of the day were the ones that brought Prohibition about and America went on its biggest hypocrisy binge because of it.
If you've ever written Crawford off as "man-ish" or "bitchy" because of roles she did later in her life, check out this movie and take a look at the sexy, vivacious girl who was once described by F. Scott Fitzgerald as "the personification of the American flapper"!
(They put one in mind of English books such as E. Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods, not that the story is nearly as pleasant, but because the children are so good at looking after themselves independently.)
When they get enough votes they forward this to their distributors.You can even vote for films not owned by TCM because they work with the AFI.
I find that to be a travesty because if you don't stumble on a channel playing it somewhere, you'll never see it again, and for some of us that has become the case.
At the beginning of the sixties ,Jack Clayton made a fine adaptation of "the turn of the screw",called "the innocents" which featured P.Franklin too.This could be called "more innocents "but there's a strong difference between the two works.Although "our mother's house" verges on fantastic,there's nothing irrational,nothing supernatural here.THat's what we can call a miracle of a movie:because it sounds like a horror and fantasy movie without all the genre gimmicks .So people who're looking for gore,special effects and other paraphernalia,please pass by.If you enjoy strong screenplays,first-class performances and masterful direction,this is a must.
Dirk Bogarde is great in his role because he convincingly shows the two sides of his character: Loving at one part, but altogether selfish.
They bury the corpse in the back garden, and never tell anyone, because they are all under-age and fear the orphanage..
Somewhat puzzled Â because, only a few moments prior, Agnes had said how much she liked his moustache Â Marc says nothing but continues on to a dinner engagement to Serge and Nadia Schaeffer (Mathieu Amalric and Marcha Polikarpova) where they all say nothing about his new look.
I'm beginning to think they were trying to target people with low IQs, because they basically show you the beginning of the movie all over again at the end, SHOWING you what you didn't figure out... Stay away from it, it's trash.
Most people cannot do this because they are to slow to keep up with the Bachelor and Survivor reality shows.
I gave it a 7, so I think it's worth watching just because I didn't guess the end...but I'm no genius, just a girl that loves blood and guts.
They probably didn't even catch the mumbling Lovecraft references because they were too busy not reading books and mistakenly thinking they understood the plot and everything in it.
I challenge anyone that dislikes this film to ask "why" -- is it because you didn't understand the story or because it was cheaper than the mass produced films.
I don't mind calling this film cheap because it entertained me mentally, and I will go back to rewatch to see if a second viewing would un-muddle the questions looming in my mind.
I was first interested in this film because Seth Green was starring in it, but i got a lot more than i bargained for.
So learn the catch words people "Edgy, stylish, innovative, clever" = "Not released in theatres because people would riot"
The actors (and Ek and house) are imaginary because someone is manipulating the whole thing directly with noodles into the brain.
It is intelligent and requires that you pay attention, but it's not as if that's terribly hard to do, because it succeeds in being entertaining throughout.
!, it really just goes to show how we are all different as regards our love of the series because to me this entry is far from being weak.
And that's the interesting part, because when you are defining your nature, you have the choice by defining it against others.
This mystery is set apart from the rest of the series because of the fact that it is set in Washington DC, as opposed to Holmes' native London.
This movie is under-appreciated because of the seclusive nature of the genre it explores.
As for the actor "Danny Delapaz", he was perfect playing the part of "Chuco" because he wasn't acting, he really is one.
I gave this film a 2 only because it did have potential with Tim Conway and Don Knotts in it.
"Private Eyes" works because Knotts and Conway are, more or less, just being themselves.
I liked this movie a great deal, mostly because they were in it together.
", just before the station blew up because of Don's cigar.
From what I recall from an interview I saw with Don Knotts, he said this, and all others with Conway are personal favorites, because they were so "hard to produce."
As he put it, it took probably three or four times as long to film as it should have because he and Conway couldn't stop improvising the script, and laughing, and so on.
Please do not expect a satisfying explanation towards the very ending, because 'La Moustache' ain't going to give you one.
"Ultra Warrior" is particularly bad, though, because the plot and all the exposition exists simply to hold together bits of other movies.
If the name Armand Mastroianni rings a bell, it's because he directed "He Knows You're Alone", most famous as Tom Hanks's movie debut.
which is another reason i loved his part because Judd simply softened his heart and made him sweet.
In that regard, Laredo comes the closest anyone has come to honoring Peckinpah's greater works.The film, because it was produced for television is already mostly forotten by the minnions, but richly deserving of an audience.
Again contrast this with the treatment of the Crusades where it is referred to as the Christian army (not European/French/Italian) even though the majority were mercenaries and Christian only because they were born in Europe.
Yeah, that would be good, because then I could see every one of these dildoes fry and watch them float down to earth in a shower of bacon bits.
It's unfortunate that no feature length movies have been made because I, for one, would love to know what Sisko learned while moving among the prophets after falling into the fire cave (Final Episode).
Let's just say that this is just the pilot, and it seems a little time passed before the shot the second episode because it has a completely different feel that will become the norm for the rest of the series.
They kind of address this a tiny bit later on by Sisko threatening Quark to do his bidding because they let him operate for free, but he never says "free services for the crew" and there are times when they make payments on quark's thumbpad so money is being exchanged.
The reason why you rarely see Bajoran ships (Season 7 Episode 2 "Shadows and Symbols") is because they basically have none of their own.
Back on the station he meets new Star Fleet arrivals Dr. Julian Bashir and science officer and old friend Jadzia Dax, who Sisko calls Old Man despite her being a young woman, this is because she is a joined Trill and Sisko knew the symbiont's previous host.
Yeah OK, I'm giving this flick a 7 because I really dug it in the day (although of course not nearly as much as Star Wars which I saw at the Lowes theater in full surround sound, now that was an all time high!).
Evidently I'm not the only one who loved that quote because IMDb has it as a highlighted quote.
It's only because when I saw this flick I was a young teen who thought Jan Michael was cool (I had a haircut like him, and later I came darn close to buying a bar by Clark AB in the PI called the Airwolf Bar because the chicks there said I looked like him, oh my was I stoned cold drunk that time).
I think I'll avoid watching this again because I'd hate to spoil those classic 70's memories, of growing up and wanting to be as cool as Jan Michael Vincent.
Quite simply, this is among the worst films Ginger Rogers ever made--partly because of its terribly unfunny writing and partly because Ginger has never been more unlikable and irritating.
I was so excited when I saw that this movie was being made because I had enjoyed the short story so much and then to see how Hollywood butchered it.
I decided to watch this because I like sci-fi movies, but it stunk.
The one thing that was somewhat impressive were the dumb looking tank vehicles because I couldn't believe they actually spent the money to make what appeared to be a functioning vehicle.
They decide to undertake the dangerous coast-to-coast journey from California to Albany in their Landmaster truck, because they picked up vague radio signals hinting there may be other survivors.
It's too bad, though, because this is a terrific flick.
This is because if you are looking for fun movie that really does pull at the kid inside you, then this is definitely it.
(I like to watch this and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, back-to-back) Anyways, I watch this movie once a year because the message of the movie, and the reason people watch it, warrants that.
At the end of Barrie's play, Wendy cannot return to Neverland, even though she would like to, because Neverland is reserved for children.
Because Spielberg makes many great movies I understand that he has set a standard for himself, but just because this movie wasn't groundbreaking doesn't make it bad.
I'm at a loss to know why because I think it's an absolutely charming fantasy, using his own peculiar take on the Peter Pan story and extending it.
Maybe because this is a film that I truly enjoyed, even though its flaws stuck out a mile when I started writing the review.
The Disney movie of it was what led me to watch this one, and because I watched the Disney one, it made me love this one even more.
The point is, this is a children's film, and we didn't see those mistakes when we were children because it's designed that way.
It's clichÃ© because it happens all the time, and it's a truth!
One thing that confused me was how this movie was overlooked because it's such a terrific movie, the only thing I could assume is that during this time Batman Forever was also being released and this was animated so just disregarded sadly.
He discovers later in his mansion that he has a cave and in one scene of the film he's at the funeral of his dead parents and tells him that he doesn't want to fight crime; I felt Bruce's pain in this movie, unlike the other films because all he wanted to do was lead a normal life.
Speaking of timeless the music should get every award i could possibly get because this is THE best part of the movie and if i find the soundtrack I will buy it for sure.
I shall wrap this up by saying that this is a movie no ACTION fan should miss because of its brilliant cinematography, tempo and the excellent orchestral score by Shirley Walker.
So I am sure that you will not be disappointed with Batman Mask of The Phantasm because it is really good.
So make sure that you rent or buy Batman Mask of The Phantasm because it is a great movie.
When your a kid you don't really care about the story you go to see it just because it's Batman, but when your older you can really get involved and begin to sympathize for the character's.
I'm sure a lot of other fans would agree with in saying that Kevin Conroy IS Batman because he's been doing it for so long.
Meanwhile the love of Batman's alter ego comes back in his life and the two rekindle their broken romance so the dark knight has to balance his love life and also find out who's responsible for all the murders and clear his name, because when you walk around in a cape and mask you need all the good PR that you can get.
i bought this because it was cheap and i had read up on it and i realised it was a continuation of the 90s Batman cartoons i had grown with.
The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.
That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner, with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom, Syriana, The Siege and Body of Lies, to name but a few films dealing with the topic.
We get to see a number of "no-brainer" tactics that the cells employ which are effective if you think about it, which makes it all the more dangerous should they be used because they actually can be.
traitor has just been released in here..so i have just watched it..i found it on good intentions..especially surprised when i saw Steve martin's name as a writer..Don Cheadle was great..so Said was... but as a Muslim  being in mostly Muslim country(Turkey) i can easily understand there r many people are being used because of their faith..but most of Muslims have normal life..rare of them in those kind, though Islam; as every religion forbids to kill anyone even anything...the first important thing is being human...i know this, i can see this from here..but a European or a Japanese or an American person who has no knowledge or cultur about Islam what does he or she think?i accept as a Muslim we weren't able tell ourselves rightly to whole world but i think if Hollywood or the film makers want to seem pretty to Muslims or to understand and tell the world about real the Muslims, re-sit and re-think...when they r making films about Islam or Muslims; they should quit to write about agency, terrorism, bombs, poorness,weakness,revenge, sleeper agents.......etc..there r real Muslims never confirms because Ä±slam never confirms anything of these..normal lives r being lived...obey the rules..no "takÄ±yye"..its forbidden..its seem however u r..pls quit showing Muslim women ugly..as a good example look at Turkey..u can see really good looking but covered women...please read "Mevlana", "Said Nursi"..u will find great stories to take or adopt...please keep on taking films on this way so u can contribute the tolerate..understanding..
So, we have seen movies like In the Valley of Elah and Stop Loss, which offer discouraging visions of the soldiers who came back from war; movies like Lions for Lambs, Rendition and Syriana, which examine the ideology behind the conflicts; and finally, movies which could belong to the action genre if it was not because of their political message, like The Kingdom and Body of Lies.But we had never seen the conflict from the enemy's point of view, and because of that, Traitor is a refreshing and fascinating portrait of the causes which motivate the rebellion and disgust against the North American expansion.
But, besides of all the ideological background from this film, Traitor work perfectly as an ambiguous and incredibly tense thriller, which has perfectly developed characters who occupy their ambiguous positions without revealing their clear porpoises, provoking a delicious suspense on the spectator, at the same time it is difficult to know where the story will take us.Nachmanoff's direction is sober, something which works very well on the context from this movie.The performances are excellent, not only the one from the great Don Cheadle, but also the ones from the supporting cast, where the members who mostly stand out are SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui as a terrorist and Jeff Daniels as a security contractor, which is a role where this underrated actor shows his wide range, which goes more far away than the family films where we usually see him.The only fail I found on this movie is that the ending could have been a little more polished.But, in spite of that, I recommend Traitor with a lot of enthusiasm, because it is an excellent movie which does not only entertain very much, but which also leaves the spectator thinking.
Yet without these points, Traitor wouldn't be quite the experience it is, mainly because a lot of the movie's ability to draw you in through its central characters, their moral dilemmas involving what they feel they have to do, and the repercussions of such actions.
The ever-watchable Don Cheadle, who has turned in so many fine performances, here does it again, though he slightly overdoes the conscience-stricken angst (an emotion he has not yet learned to portray convincingly enough, perhaps because in real life he has not done anything bad enough to regret it sufficiently).
Even while playing this guessing game, I didn't feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues.
Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous isn't necessarily a good thing.
I think that this kind of movies is unreal, and why is that.... its because this kind of movies makes all the muslims terrorist but the truooth that the Islamic religion is peaceful religion, like any other religion and muslims people which they are 1.5 billion are good, in the most, yes there are some bad people like any other race or religion, the people who makes the films just want to deform the image of Islam, for there own purpose, the stupid who judge people or religions and he don't knew nothing about the truth, movies are made to tell you what you wanna hear not the truth (wake up and see the real news and not only what western says see what eastern says to be a judge).
Maybe because there isn't one mainstream church that would speak in support of any Klan activity while no Muslim leader that I've heard has condemned Islamic terrorism.
I do not advise anyone to view this movie, because the brainwashing techniques used, will probably scare the average viewer into submission.
I stuck with this movie because (1) I hoped to learn more about wine making (2) the photography was A+ and as a travelogue it was was enlightening.
But that is just because I am a huge fan of his.
While the rogue CIA operative must end up getting bumped off precisely because he is amoral and unprincipled, the FBI fares better here.
I can forgive him for one of the worst ever English accents in the Ocean's films because despite that he is normally very good at his trade.
I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything because that could easily be done while discussing this film.
Those who pick apart this movie are nit-picking because it's a very entertaining film while not overdoing the action or the stereotypical characters.
But it all comes down to a boring script that just drags along instead of someone editing half the movie out..and moving forward past the Paris contest.. which is sad because this story could have been so much more but as they always say.. it's the script, script, script... and this one sticks with no connection to the characters it is so flat.
I gave it a 1 because i had to buy my friend a glass of wine to revive him after falling asleep halfway thru the movie after yet another car breaks down to create some suspense..
Don't be fooled by the commercials that say that "Traitor is this year's Bourne Ultimatem", because this is clearly not true.
It's nitpicking, but some of the action was a little nauseating because of the camera.
This new film, because it is a black comedy, is wholly admirable despite its unremitting cynicism, and it provides many hysterically funny situations and lines of dialogue.
It almost defies explanation, because it is such a parade of idiocy from beginning to end, but we are rapt with attention and glued to the screen because it is all so amazing, and can people get any stupider than that?
I felt like I needed to review this movie because it has been largely misunderstood by many of the reviewers on this site.
(Children please leave now, this is an adult movie)  Part of the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is because it engages you as the viewer by forcing you to consider all the event that are happening.
As far as the acting goes each actor plays their role very well and I think that some viewers were disappointed because they were expecting a more developed Brad Pitt / George Clooney relationship as is the case with most of their movies.
Then because of his yeeaars of service as an air marshal his training kicks in and out of instinct he shoots before he thinks.
Modern day Voltaire's   "Burn After Reading", gives us a Dim Whit Personal Trainer played by BradPitt (note: If you're a fan of Brad Pitt because of his Character in Fight club--you're in for a rude awakening in this one!).
Essentially, this is a movie where the audience gets to drop in on the (unlikely) interconnected/intersected lives of nothing BUT Self Serving Idiots, all of whom meet their "demise" because of their own self serving interests.
I think some people may have been let down by "Burn" because they expected another Oscar film, but these people missed the point.
I especially liked Brad Pitt, probably because he's the only one showing some new colors here.
"Burn After Reading" passes the time, but don't build this up too much, because it's mostly just a whole lot of goofing around that just holds itself together because of the talents of the Coens.
Its not that the movie was bad, but there were several scenes that I had to go back and re-watch a number of times because they were just so damned funny.
Yet the Invisible Pigeon Holeing Society must assign these films a genre, and since their not weird enough to be labeled surrealist or experimental, they get the title comedies simply because a few people in the theater may giggle a few of the "Jokes" in the film.
I mean I always through his performance in Fight Club was good only because he really was playing the same character he usually does but this time in a quality film.
We only saw this turkey because there was a mix-up (oops!
Writing this is making me angry all over again, so for our collective health, I will end this by lighting into the cinematography, which was lazy and badly staged (my viewing mate spent the film counting technical mistakes because it was so poorly made), giving us little sense of the actual locations where the main action was taking place.
Forget the name Coen is on the box, because the Joel and Ethan Coen I've seen must have shut themselves off when they made this piece of work.
None of the characters are allowed to be given life because there is no detail to them.
I don't hate the Coen Brothers, on the contrary it is because of my great respect for them that I am so hard on this film.
The only thing I liked about this movie was Sledge Hammer star David Rasche, and only because it gave me a Sledge Hammer flashback.
Surprisingly, the Coens seem to have taken leave of their comic senses because their sophisticated humor falls flat on its face.
It was difficult to distinguish the actors who were supposed to be actors and the actors who were supposed to be "real gangstas", because all of the acting in this movie sucks.
The only reason I gave this three stars was because of the fight scenes, especially the Scarface-looking one where he was on the car screaming "AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA" like a nut... the one with all the gang members in the house facing that crew of Malibu people holding a f*****g whale harpoon and a rocket launcher was the only funny part of the movie IMO.
I think critics are taking this movie way to seriously ...its a movie a comedy made for laughter and ones personal enjoyment don't come on here bashing it and saying rude things just because you didn't like it...frankly, I really don't care if you liked it or not because it was a good silly laugh out loud movie...my friends and I still quote this movie and laugh about the crazy scenes If people just want a feel good movie that'll make you laugh and give you and your friends something to do this movie is perfect... Chyna*
Eventually we find out that this white boy was literally raised by his black governess because his parents -- who are important and busy people -- were never around.
And thankfully, Snoop Dogg has only a 3-minute voice cameo as a talking rat, because I stand by my word when I say that he should be banned from movies altogether.
It comes across as hilarious because everyone finds it amussing except him.
MBW is one of those movies that is humorous because the characters are kinda stupid but funny.
I give it a 10 because: 1.
Jim Howell from Michigan can't like it because it failed to be "an examination of the racial issues pervasive in our society".
This movie is not watchable because it has a good story; it doesn't.
It's not watchable because there's good acting; there is none.
It's watchable because of the cast.
The story is that there's this fat "athletic" loser with ugly spiked hair who never spends time with his friends (only two are shown the entire movie-what a social animal) so he can do everything a mom would normally do because she's dead and he doesn't want his dad to think that they need a mom.
Smart House is such a great movie, and I'm not just saying that because I'm in love with Disney Channel.
So this is more like Cinderella 1 1/2 than Cinderella 3, because it clearly ignores some things that happened in Cinderella 2.
An I got to say I didn't expect it to turn out so well from the beginning but now I must say it's because I was being a hard headed Disney purist with the whole thing of No Disney Sequels are Bad!
Cinderella, often perceived as weak because of her 50's heritage, becomes more pro-active and almost an action-hero in the film's closing moments.
That's a real shame, because when they get it right it's great.Also I know many people simply state that these DVD's are simply trying to ride the coat tails of there originals success and are made for "a quick buck"and obviously that's true.
However, I never liked the story of a helpless heroine getting all she wants just because she has a good heart and befriends rodents.
When I first found out that they were making another movie and what was going to happen in it I was a little upset because I didn't want the story to change and I didn't want it to be turned around in a 360 degree turn, but I'm really glad what happened and it was a really good movie.
I certainly didn't expect them to be married and having kids or anything because again, this is before they actually hooked up.
i say this because in the original Cinderella is all goody goody and has dreams of getting away from her step family and all she does is sit around just waiting for something to happen.
i would give this about an 8/10 because i wish that Disney would put Cinderella's dead mother and father figure in the clouds or something watching her live happily.
And because I still think like a kid, I say you should listen to me on this.
She dreams of a life of luxury, and because of her kind heart she has friends that do all the work for her, she gets her chance with a prince and after dancing she's in love and gets married.
Many employees are very upset with her because they do not want to loose their jobs.
It's enough to say it's the Karen Silkwood story, and then let the film speak for itself, because it speaks volumes.
I'm bringing attention to this film because movies get lost very quickly these days, and this is a great one with first rate performances all around, including Cher and Kurt Russell.
She subverts our initial impression that Karen is just a rowdy good-time girl, playing her as a woman who throws herself into union and workplace-safety concerns because she is losing everything else in her life.
It's not that the ending itself is not strong, because it is.
Silkwood was not as memorable to me as other Streep films or others by Nichols, but looking back on it, I see that it has a tight atmosphere within it, once again in an objective sense because it does not depict a desirable setting but it is nonetheless a real and absorbing one.
This is because there is always the possibility that the movie will suddenly get good, and I fall in love with it (which has happened before quite a few times).
Was it tampered with or was the radiation levels high because Karen was contaminated by a plutonium leak ?
Once again the audience is left to make up there own minds   Some people have criticized SILKWOOD because it feels very much like one of those cheap TVMs that even having a well known cast can't disguise .
I won't disagree too much but this is because films of the period lacked much gloss and you can probably use the opposite argument in that nowadays Hollywood movies feature too much gloss and visual superficiality .
Cher's acting skills really come out in the film, because Dolly seems to be the complete opposite to Cher's character.
Obviously, all three actors did a lot of research, because all three main characters were alive at one time, as the film is based on true events.
Not just because I'm blown away but the story, and the fact it is true, but the characters blow me away.
And the reactions worked for me, because when I think of how seriously people reacted to issues like nuclear or toxic contamination back in the late 70s/early 80s, there was a lot less info available.
I think at the time she probably received a lot more recognition for this role because it began to show her range.
Her daughter is dying of cancer, and she herself wears wigs most days, because her hair is falling out.
Metroid has always been fun because at the start you are real weak and then by the end of the game, you feel like you could take on any kind of bounty hunter prey in the universe.
Two stars because this is actually (unintentionally) quite funny at points.
I rated this at a 4/10 but had it not been for the unprofessional start and end it could have scrapped a 6/10 because there was enough reasonable content here to make this film enjoyable at least for a one off viewing.
If you see this film on TV and like ancient history and legends it's worth a watch, but whatever you do don't pay to see this in a movie theatre because this is a long way off being anything other then a TV movie.
Actually I only caught the ending that night because of being out late trick or treating..lol.
This version with Jeff Goldblum is pretty good.It is one of them films where nothing spectacular happens until the end but the end is worth waiting for!Some of the scenes are very similar like the cartoon.Goldblum was the perfect choice to play Ichabod Crane as he is tall and thin!That's all I'll say but if you like The Legend of Sleepy Hollow story and the new film and are able to check this out do so because it is a very rare film and it is a good watch for the mystery and horror fan!
All this because he took the time and effort to help a young girl named Red, Jan Chaney, from Nebraska get herself straightened out and go, with Mike handing her a twenty, back home to mama and the boy she left behind.
Forced to get to the bottom of the murder, not for money but because of his connection to the girl, he unravels the mystery in the typical Hammer fashion of payoffs and beatings.
There is one problem, this expert has become as obsessed with the instrument as it's past owners, but even more so because he has discovered a secret, shared only by the violin and it's creator.
We see umpteen examples of this ridiculous thinking that because something is computerised it must be connected to the internet in someway !
I could still use my computer as a word processor or play computer games etc the world wouldn't suddenly revert to the stone age because the internet failed   There's also several other blunders which led me to believe that the writers are nowhere near as being smart as their audience .
We're also told to believe that some real hot internet systems can't be traced because they don't use cookies !
I went to see this in the theatre simply because I had never heard of it and the starting time was right.
Personally I seriously disbelieve the internet holds the future of the world in it's hands, but that doesn't matter because even if it did, the people at Netforce couldn't protect it if they had to.
I say this because I find it hard to see this as an adaptation project that started well.
It's length is precisely what leads to it's failing because there isn't enough depth to sustain a person's interest or the holding of disbelief for such an amount of time.
With no real depth behind the characters and a long, boring and downright confusing story, it all becomes just scenes connected together because people that we're in the last scene are in the next.
Independent movies or Asian and European films (to make it easy, let's say all movies that haven't been produced by some big Hollywood studio), always seem to have a certain group of fans, not because they are good, but because they are "different".
Never tell them that sometimes the opposite can be true, because they can't and won't believe you.
But that's just because I'm a movie buff who is interested in all kinds of movies, not because I'm convinced that this kind of movies is automatically a lot better than the rest.
The music is excellent (although you better love violin music, because that's all you'll here), the acting is very nice and the story really is very beautiful.
The Locale's may have seemed just a teensy bit artificial(the most common critique), but downing the movie because Sam Jackson "stole" the violin, and on top of that attributing it to his color is downright UNCALLED FOR!
If not liking it because of it's closing immorality is not missing the point and the essence and the true exsistence of this film, then I don't know what is.
Therefore it is quite inconsequential, the morality of the people(and their actions) and events surrounding the violin, to say that it is the times we live in, or the race of the man stealing the violin, because the story encompasses a much higher enlightenment.
The Red Violin will be rewarding for those who pay attention, and a pain for those who don't, because the transaction of the violin from person to person isn't smooth, whoever is not willing to pay attention should steer clear.
I definitely recommend it to all big movie buffs, because those willing to see it, should.
My parents also have paper write ups about the movie.I wish that it could be played on TV again because it was such a great film.
Well I have one and for good reason, because I played a minor role in the making of this film and was given a copy by my late Uncle, Jack McCafferty, whose bus company which I worked for at the time, was featured in several cameo shots.
Well, "hero", you've actually magnified the problem, because if the "audience" didn't happen to catch it the first time, you went ahead and spelled it out for them immediately afterwards.
The only reason I call this film "kind of original" is because the concept was original, yet the humor that was employed, has kind of already been done.
He's broke, unemployed, and his girlfriend has just dumped him because she doesn't share his enthusiasm for film and is annoyed by his interaction with us.
But because he loves his audience and wants to please us, Blake refuses to be sad and prefers to be glad, and spends his days and nights walking around his Hollywood neighborhood, checking out the Walk Of Fame, taking advantage of bargain cinema, and putting together a cast for his new "movie", which includes a side-kick, a love-interest, and a suspicious character/villain.
While the people around him are convinced that he is crazy, we are not so sure, because after all, we are watching his movie, aren't we??
Richie Havens who had to play overtime because the other artists didn't arrive yet(watch his shirt).
But of course,the most remembered piece of work during the festival:Jimi Hendrix version of "Star Spangled Banner",the USA national anthem.Although a lot of people already left because his show was postponed till monday,everybody seems to know this "song".
The end-titles gave me a pleasant surprise,because the editor and assistant-director of Woodstock is the greatest director in my view: Martin Scorsese.This gives the directory an extra plus if it ever needed any.
I rate it 10 because it deserves a 10 artistically and creatively as a film.
I knew of this documentary because it is in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had heard of the concert itself, and I can see why it won an Oscar.
To be honest, I was really "watching" it, mainly just listening to it while working, because of the good music shows, but also because I did not realise the original cut was only 3 hours and four minutes, this director's cut version I saw was an extra 48 minutes of footage.
He took me to see it because we both played guitar and shared a love of music.
It didn't bother me, but it might bother others--originally this got an X rating because of it!
I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long.
Kudos to Jason Yee, hope he keeps going because he is a star!!
I was curious because I remember seeing Jason Yee fight on cable back in the 90's.
Definitely a good film to watch for aspiring filmmakers, the behind the scenes on the DVD are cool because you get an idea of how hard film-making is.
I found it much easier to get into the story because of the credibility that Jason Yee's martial arts portfolio adds to the mix.
I rented this movie because I was curious who is this, Jason Yee guy on the DVD cover.
I hope Hollwood producers are paying attention because he is the next action star, just look at him!
The "story" can't entertain a viewer for more than 30 minutes because of the boring acting by most of the cast.
I found myself sitting up in my seat and smiling every time she came on screen because each scene she was in was hilarious and bright.
The five-second appearance by one of my favourite actresses Rachel Gordon was a little more than a blink-and-you'd-miss-it scene which was disappointing because she deserves so much more than what she is given.
It was only because of my high alert mode, that I kept on reminding myself that this was not real....only FICTION!
It's hard not to compare this film to "Spinal Tap", "Mighty Wind" and the other great mockumentaries by Christopher Guest because the format is very similar.
I only give this movie a 9 because it was a bit slow to get started.
Many things seem random... the fingernails in the piano, the whole piano melody thing, the hole in the wall, the people around the main character dying off like flies just because they knocked at his door once (Why hector has to die makes no sense unless you aim for the bleak ending and don't care for logic).
So the really good casting and acting as well as choice of setting is just plain wasted because some idiot studio went for another Asian remake because everybody does it nowadays.
The cast is quite good but it's kinda hard to feel a great chemistry between them when they're all together but that's OK because most part of the time the story sets each one of them individually.
Lindsay Price is a lot unfamiliar to me because she's been in countless shows but I can't remember her in any of them, anyway, she surprises me a lot when I got myself laughing with some of her moments, but her character stills being quite weak to be placed as "one of the 50 most powerful women" in the show.
Kim Raver is by far the best choice because she's proving to be one of the best TV actresses of the time, she's always a lot convincing and her character is for sure the best edged of the show, her previous works with strong characters like Kathlyn Hale in "The Nine", or Audrey Raines in "24" and Kim Zambrano in "Third Watch" gave her great bases for the confidence and the dramatic lines that Nico needs and Lipstick Jungle is being all about her and she deserves this attention after so many supporting roles.
New York is being a lot secondary in the plot and that's a shame because this city is a living character for Bushnell's stories.
It's a nice show, and it's being hard to forget it because, as I said, looks like it's finally getting its right tone, and if it does and they kick it right, it promises to be not as fabulous as Sex And The City, but admirable.
I started to watch it just because of the spoiler, when one of girls writes something bad on a coat and the woman leaves and everyone see's it.
The story line is better than Sex in the City because the character are much more realistic.
I hope the network is not suited up and stupid were they cancel the show because that would be a waste.
THIS is the first time i think this has been portrayed by a man in a sitcom, i mean in this honest way - a man, in the position a woman usually is/or was, after her kids grew up and shes there suddenly having no plans in life, being angry that she didn't foresee this day coming - because she didn't take time to work or achieve her personal goals, in order to take care the rest of the family.
This show cannot replicate the success of Sex in the City because part of what made that series work was its originality, and you can't repeat originality.
I never intended to watch this show in the first place because I thought the name of the show was ridiculous and I don't particularly like Brooke Shields.
I was slightly disappointed with the pilot because Brooke Shields was over-acting and the casting choice for her husband seemed random to me.
It really is the best way to close down the week because we all know Friday doesn't count!
I hope the writers of this show keep them together because it is hot!
All three women are strong women who I can totally relate to because of my own career.
9 out of 10, because I don't think it's perfect.
However, I am apparently one of the few reviewers on IMDb that really disliked LA TERRA TREMA--because the acting was so incredibly amateurish as well as the lousy camera-work.
The film itself is also a little more exciting because it deals not just with a family of fishermen like the other film, but a family that illegally uses homemade dynamite to fish!!
The most derogatory remark I've ever heard an intelligent people make about this program is that it drags on a bit, but quite frankly that's only because ITV go and stick 25 minutes of adverts into a otherwise perfect fluid 95minute program.
I could go on for pages and pages about the acting, writing and attention to period detail but I won't bother because by the looks of it many before me have done so already.
Kitchen's characterisation of a fearless good man in hard times is magnificent; we know we can trust exactly what he says and even if some of his solutions are a bit deus ex machina we cannot resent it because his moral force absolutely justifies the end.
Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!
The plot of an escaped leopard terrifying a community certainly justifies calling this a horror film, but it succeeds as a minor masterpiece in the genre only because of the elegant direction and cinematography, which took advantage of the black and white medium.
This rare classic is a forgotten gem that should be seen by any fan of classic horror, not least because it reminds one that horror at one time was about more than just bloodsoaked ultra-violence.
It's the realization that these people are unknowingly in danger because of a chance meeting with Clo-Clo and they can do nothing about it that creates much of the suspense in The Leopard Man.
What horror there is comes more from a sense of dread than anything that actually happens; also from the eerie feeling that certain places are unlucky, that some people are bound to die simply because of where they are.
Getting to her house her mother doesn't let poor Teresa in because she didn't have the corn meal and thought that her story about her being chased by a big cat was just an excuse for her to let her in the house.
Whoopi is so funny, she must have been hurting for money because I think that would be the only reason someone like her would do this crappy show.
Shamrock is able to defeat Owen in the end, but I still applaud Owen because he was such a great wrestler.
If I were her mother,I would disown her because it's sick and wrong to just lie to her mother's face.
Did she do it to make a feminist statement, for the money, or because she simply enjoyed the act itself?
I watched this simply because I was intrigued by the write up in the TV Guide which mentioned that Annabel Chong is the porn star who was setting a record for having sex with 251 men in 10 hours .
Ms Chong gives a pretentious neo feminist explanation of why she's doing it , something along the lines of " I'm doing this because I'll be striking a blow against chauvanism and by being in control of the situation I'll be showing that it's the men who are sluts " .
This is a horrific film, made all the worse because it's all true.
After much deliberation I gave this film a 9/10 - not because of the film's actual quality (which only deserves a 5-6), but because it is a film that deserves to be seen and contemplated.
I'm afraid the present day Hollywood wouldn't dare to do films like this, but fortunately there are alternatives and people who want to make films not just because of money.
I kept wanting to turn it off because the whole "Rat Zombie" thing was really stupid, but I kept watching, not wanting to admit to myself I just wasted 15 bucks.
The gritty city, the typical way people tune out the warning signs because every day you hear a siren.
The rat-humans are shot quite the same way as the "rage-infected" human zombies of 28 Days Later(& 28 Weeks Later)..the camera doesn't really completely eyeball them, because they move so fast, in such a frenzied state like wild animals starving for supper, that we don't exactly identify with them.
The little furry pests are crawling all over the place and you better hope they don't bite a chunk out of you because, when that happens, you start growing hair out of strange places and want to eat human flesh!
Afterdark Horrorfest are the best B-Movies I've ever seen.It has it's crappers(The Hamiltons, Nightmare Man, Crazy Eights), but they make up for it with wonderful movies like Mulberry Street.This is yet another great movie in the Afterdark Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For series, and I would say probably my 4th favorite out of all of them.It was really well executed for a B-Movie, as are all the Afterdark Horrorfest films, and I couldn't help but be so sucked into the story plot and suspense.It may have been just a little retarded, funny even, and they left some things unexplained, but hey, I was expecting less, and got a lot.Overall, MOST of all the movies in the Afterdark Horrorfest films are great and VERY underrated, and I hope for these movies to be more recognized than what they already are, which is not recognized hardly at all, because they are some really spectacular movies, and I'm looking forward to the next set that comes out.
I'm not gonna get into specifics, because this movie especially, is one you where you shouldn't pay attention to details.
"Mulberry Street" is basically just another forgettable and mediocre creature-feature flick, but I'm rewarding it with at least two extra points because director Jim Mickle and his enthusiast cast & crew clearly went through several harsh ordeals before they could finish their ambitious project.
In a way it is still hard but it's starting to progress slowly because there still is a little racism out there somewhere.
This movie holds a special place in my heart, because it was partially filmed in my own town, Westmont, Illinois.
I was flipping channels on a boring Saturday afternoon and I came across it because there wasn't anything interesting to watch at the time.
It was very interesting surprisingly because there was so much silence and very little dialogue.
Let me repeat that last question again because this is very very important.... Do you really like Crosby Stills and Nash music?
My girlfriend and I had just finished watching John Hurt in Michael Radfordâs Nineteen Eighty-Four and I put this documentary on because I thought a nice short colorful coral reef film might be nice after such a grey depressing movie.
At first I wanted to see this film because Alessandro Nivola was in it.
But he is clever, probably more than Quinn because he destroys various stores of the town and steals a police car in the same night as he is in jail without anyone being able to blame him.
The screenplay by John Hughes is perfect, because there's a charm in the simplicity of the tale accompanied by Ryan's direction.
There's a perfect mix of the drama and the comedy; there's a silence in the images that we get to hear because of the little number of actors and their more than good performances.
Solondz' comedy works for me, because it is not forced, although his punchlines are more like social commentary.
not because of the characters, because of the storyteller.
And she's definitely evolving... because he's finally got something to say.
But, because of the ho-hum first hour (yes, ho-hum, even with "that scene" and all), all the pieces don't quite fall together.
The movie has one useful function: it will help you appreciate mediocre horror films more, because you'll know the difference between simple mediocrity and outright badness.
And because a skeptical view of man's alleged "inherent goodness" is the foundation of all Marxist/Leftist beliefs, eventually Solondz might actually connect the dots and realize finally that left-wing ideology has no scientific basis, no roots in logic whatsoever.
who ever saw it and did not think of the point of characters that are emotionally closed, I think should watch the movie again, because he might miss a spectacular work of cinema.
This is a rare film, because it's a film maker addressing his critiques, himself, and his audience all at once.
However, having only two stories (which are disproportionate in the amount of time spent on them) is completely distracting because you find yourself looking for the parallel between them.
When the filmmaker tells his subject he is sory for what happend to him, scooby tells him not to be sorry, because his film is a hit.
That is wath makes his films so wonderful painful, you see people doing stupid things, but you can't blame them, because you know you should do the same thing.
Most filmmakers, in order to make a more commercially acceptable film do not inject the kind of honesty that Solondz does, which naturally ends up creating criticism for him because it is "different".
Apparently he was told that the scene either needed to be cut or he would get a higher rating, (an absolutely ridiculous notion because the action itself was not overly graphic, it was the details of the scene that were disturbing) so in his refusal to cut it, he decided to throw it back in the MPAA's face and call it what it was: Censorship.
But is it fair to berate Solondz just because he dares to present what others systematically avoid?
It exposes ridiculous attitudes in the name of political correctness, whether it is the student with an awful essay who almost escapes criticism because he has cerebral palsy, or a black teacher who gets away with being a pervert because his victim doesn't want to entertain thoughts of racism.
Also everything seems a tad to convenient, one scene towards the end made me roll my eyes in annoyance because I could not believe nobody had turned a certain wheel for over 200 years.
It's very enjoyable and the movie ends like that because of the fast pace.
I honestly wanted the movie to be an hour longer because everything went by so fast.
Tim Robbins and Bill Murray seemed wasted here because they don't appear in the movie that much.
with a few plot changes, but that's understandable, I mean, they can't go exactly from the book, word for word, because there are some things in books that just can' be put on screen.
You can tell they used every cent of their 55 million dollar budget, because, jeez, the sets are fantastically real, the costumes look authentic!
;)  Love this title, go see it while it is on DVD, because (sadly) it did not do well at all in the box office, so probably no adaptation of "People of Sparks" :(
I think some of the critics were a little turned off, frankly, because the movie did so very poorly at the box-office.
The directing is at times questionable though, there is little sense of pacing and there are some parts that feel tacked on (the crazy flumride anybody)just because its supposed to be a summerfranchie.
My 11 year old son and I enjoyed this movie very much, perhaps because neither of us has read the book.
It hasn't had an easy launch either because it's been competing with High School Musical 3, when i went to see it the cinema was empty apart from me because everyone else had gone to see a certain other film.
It wasn't great and i am certain that if i had read the book i would have hated it because the characters were not brilliantly written and it was a messy mix of excellent fantasy sci-fi with the appropriate special effects and corny American generic children's movie.
Here's every kill in the film so you don't have to see it: gal at the pool gets blasted in the head with a shotgun at close range, which decapitates her and causes her cranium to sink to the bottom of the pool; guy boils to death in the pool and then later on the cook makes boiled lobster for dinner, which causes everyone to leave the dinner table in disgust (I take issue with this because it's lobster...who the hell turns down lobster for crissakes?!
Bugs is a famed pianist, the kind of fastidious virtuoso you still find today, but worshipped in the 40s because arrogant eccentricity somehow signalled class.
Her voice might be the best here for me because I am not a big fan of her high notes she used to hold in her early movies.
He had been studying dancing with Harris Rosedale, I know this to be a fact because I was there too, but his name was Harvey Honnacker.
I guess he changed his last name to Evans because he couldn't get his last name up in lights.
There were quite a few low budget musicals made during the '50s that were mostly insignificant but very watchable because they made no pretense at being "great."
Vincent Kartheiser was probably cast because of this eyes, but he really gives a chilling performance.
I saw the film because a friend has recommended it very much to me six weeks ago and since that time she convinced me to see it.
This film is brilliant, i loved it,everyone should see it, I only bought it because vincent kartheiser was in it.
The Unsaid is slow and predictable, barely even qualifying as a functional thriller as it seems more interested in piquing the interest of bored housewives who think they're experts on psychology because they watch Oprah and Dr Phil on a daily basis.
it is good because of the content, actors, script and pace.
beautiful because of the quite simple story without making it more dramatic than in needed, which i read in other comments as well and agreed with.
OK, i am not stupid and thought of it a couple of times, but i was looking-thinking-enjoying; the movie was to good to just saying that a movie sucks because you had a hunch how it ended....  sorry, no more comments on comments, but the construction of the movie was really good, and the ending fitted well.
I really liked this movie maybe because I have always been interested about psycology (and not working in that field though I have always wanted..).
I have watched this movie twice (and that's a lot because normally I watch movies only once).
I cried few times because world isn't fair....
And many overrated movies have that formula, which only works because you become so numb as you watch it, that you feel very surprised by the final outcome of the plot, and then believe that it was such a terrific film.
It has a dramatic starting point, a powerful and constant *thrilling* middle section and well, I won't refer the ending because, believe it, if you start watching this flick, you won't go away until you see the whole thing.
Maybe i'm a not a good person to comment this movie, because some of what happened there i lived and its hard to be equidistant, but it moved me so bad.
Tommy had developed a murderous hatred of women, or young girls, who try to be intimate with him because of what happened to his mom when he was a young boy; she was brutally murdered by his dad Joseph Caffey, Sam Bottoms, when he found that she was having an affair with another man.
Young Wong Chia Chi (the luminous Wei Tang in her first cinematic role) is asked to join the theatrical group and she consents primarily because of her attraction to the leader of the group, Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang, a commanding and handsome actor).
Further objections are raised by this group because of occupation.
Just because it didn't show lots of bad things by the Japanese, doesn't mean the film is a-historical.
Just because it doesn't show all the fighting doesn't mean its not historical.
The protagonist of the film is the very attractive Wong Chia Chi (Wei Tang) because of awkward circumstances up a resistances involved in dangerous espionage.
I have many nc-17 rated films which I buy because of the hype and controversy yet I did not focus solely on the sexual themes as I did on why the mistress/assassin reveled in the relationship and, secondly, why the mistress/assassin symptomatically betrayed the resistance at the slip of a lavish piece of ice.
I think that the agent provocateur stayed because she needed to.
She also continued because her involvement became pivotal to the success of the operation and I believe that she enjoyed her status within the "cell."
He stayed because she represented a simpler, bygone era of women who did not question but complied.
It is, I say, symptomatic because it seems that women become weak at the sight of jewelry.
All three's motivations are clearly laid out and during the almost three hour runtime, the audience cannot become lost because they are shown absolutely everything.
And I'm not implying you have to give it the thumbs-up because it won the Golden Lion.
Rex Reed of The New York Observer called Mrs Yee "silly" because he assumed she is oblivious to her husband's trysts with other women.
Again, I disagree with these complaints because I felt like these were the scenes that really brought out the lust in the characters.
He responded that he took her there because he knew much more about whoring oneself than she did, obviously referring to his political role as a traitor.
Just right before the task seems about going to end, Wang Jiazhi memorized, from an innocent college girl to a highly skilled actress and patriot, this extremely dangerous ambition kept circling around her mind and couldn't possibly go away may because of her ideal of doing something big and important, may because of proving that she's not only a puppet, or may because of a man that she can't get him out of her head.
I have no problem understanding what's going on with him without reading the subtitles because he communicates so much with his eyes.
But I'm not saying that because of the sex scenes.
This is too bad, because theses other films only come close to being as good as Beauty and the Beast.
Beauty and the Beast is the best not because it was nominated for best picture, or because it was listed third in Roger Ebert's top ten list, but because it is the best.
Not like in "Snow White" where Snow White and Prince Charming fall in love because they both think that the other is hot.
The 30th animated Disney "classic" is, without a doubt, one of the most famous Disney classics, which is a good and a bad thing either, because its success tends somewhat to overshadow other very good Disney classics (often better than this).
It's quite easy to understand that because all the characters have french names.
All of this makes her an interesting character and, above all, different from the rest of her village's population, who see her as a strange girl because she likes to read and also because she can't stand Gaston (unlike the rest of women) neither the idea of being his "little wife".
There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made: As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.
But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have.
Freya compares to Maggie because she finds herself falling in love with another.
I am giving this series a 10, not because of the plot(who's noticing?)
Not that it was such a great acting movie, it stars Albert Finney, but I give it a little extra because of the interesting story and eerie foretelling.
The out of tune notes, the messed up lyrics, and the arguments throughout the songs are great because that is how they were really written.
For proof of this checkout "suzy parker" , at no point in the film do you see Lennon sing this song because hogg either has no footage or cant find the footage so another songs performance of John's is dropped in to substitute.
Reading the book "The Beatles Get Back disaster" gives some insight, because it shows that they were running through stuff like 'Every Night' that later appeared on solo albums.
This film in NOT depressing because it documents the liberation John, Paul, and George from the stiffeling Beatles.
When you watch this movie, you have a sense of magic and a sense of sadness at the same time, because the Beatles were about to break up, and yet creating great new music at the same time.
I sat down tonight and watched this film, after a full week of re-watching the Beatles Anthology, I was really excited to see this film because it's suppose to be so hard to find, well let me tell you I was so disappointed I can't even begin.
If someone that really, and I mean really loves the Beatles said hey should I watch that film, I'd say have you seen the Anthology, if they say yes I'd say don't bother, because most of the good stuff is on that anyway and it's properly formatted.
The reason why this movie is sometimes panned is because of how ragged their (the Beatles) playing was at times.
because they sound horrible and as unlike the Beatles as you can get.
It is wonderful to watch, but very sad to see them act this way together, because I had such a nice picture of them in my mind before i saw this.
Every single one of them was having a blast, maybe Paul in particular because finally the others had caught up to him and were making the contributions to the effort for which he had been waiting.
I enjoyed it very much in spite of being 10 years old, because a friend of mine had the "Let it be" tape and we used to listen to it very often and we both knew all the songs pretty well.
Watch this movie if you got an open mind and are searching for a philosophical aspect of Anarchy, otherwise stay away because you'll just misinterpret it and think the movie makes no sense.
when double d starts to become crazy puck only thinks about himself he should of realized the problem before he passed and i was so happy when puck put all the bad neo-nazi's to sleep because he was standing up for himself.
Of course the film is going to tick off anarchists -- because, please, there are no real anarchists.
It's the type of movie that studios don't make (because of the title), that film festivals don't like (because it's not PC enough to be at Sundance).
Unsuspecting viewers who think they are oh-so-cool because they're watching the Anarchist Cookbook (oooh...scary...hide it from the parents), must be aghast to find out that the film is an indictment of their childish mischief.
Suddenly Nazis will be your best friends and you will loose your real friends, because those "anarchists" use drugs to control their followers.
On "archive.orgy" funny clips from long ago can be downloaded, like the one that warns you not to get aroused by your boyfriend, because you will be pregnant at once and loose every hope.
And while the movie gets progressively darker and darker, it takes a while for you to realize it because the journey is so fun.
You could tell they thought alot about the editing and the sound, because both stood out above 99.99% of other indie flicks.
While most characters as archetypes are joyfully over the top, Johnny Red: the hippie throw-back, Karla: the earnest slut, and Double D: the loveable doofus, you can identify with them because of the situations they find themselves in.
I guess I should warn of '*SPOILERS*' but this film is such a piece of crap you won't care, so don't bother not reading the following lines because the 'plot' they expose is thin and contrived at best.
At no point do any of them ever say anything ignorant or insulting about activists or anarchists, and they never show a single young male republican (my guess would be that this is because even this blatant propaganda film would have a hard time displaying well off young white republicans in a positive fashion).
I enjoy Olbermann because he just doesn't take himself seriously and her certainly has fun bursting the overly inflated egos of those who do not have America's interests at heart.
On one of the cable networks this show could possibly have survived, even thrived, because its thorny matters of plot and character could have been worked out.
When the film finishes you see the explanation of the film crew: " This film is real because we made it up".
And save a whole lot of money because nearly all the material is in the public domain.
The romance between the two is sweet, but in trouble because Gordon plays such a stubborn and overly opinionated "modern" man who doesn't believe in old fashioned conventions like marriage!
Maybe it turned out to be so good because in the time this movie was released he wasn't a big star yet.
People from other countries may not get it because this is SO mexican, that even non-mexican spanish-speakers may have a hard time getting all the jokes.
But there is a reason why the likes of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power are revered in the genre, it's because they had the swagger to go with the swash.
In fact, the wonderful movie "The Vikings" is so wonderful, in part, because it gets this point correct.
I am a big fan of the fifties, because it is the decade in which I started watching movies, but I am also aware that relatively low budgets and heavy handed censorship made even the best fifties films somewhat dubious -- e.g.
The girl in the mini sub marine is told to wait under water for some serious looking bearded dude to get her because "they can help each other to the surface".
The whole reason she had to wait was because of the fact she was with another mini sub which was attacked by the shark.
At one point in the movie one guy is going down with the elevator to get another guy who is in the mini sub, Yeah sure, better not use radio contact because you can better tap on a window (don't know what he was planning to do down there.)
We enjoyed the fact that on a bottle of wine this movie was HILARIOUS, simply because it was so bad.
I sat down to watch this expecting a b movie, not great but one that was still entertaining - I didn't get that, I watched it with a friend of mine and we didn't talk to each other for half an hour after it finished simply because we were in shock at how bad it was.
To be fair there are a couple of memorable lines, but the kind you remember because you can never understand how anyone ever thought they were good!
Her acting is strictly two-dimensional and straight-out throwaway (if her role had suddenly been erased at the last moment, no one would have noticed because her character wasn't made essential to the movie's plot).
Watching this movie is challengingÂ I mean it challenges your patience, even your ego, because the makers offend human intelligence with the so- predictable script.
I saw this movie just a few years ago, but I can't remember ANY of the stories within the movie because they just weren't compelling or memorable.
This film doesn't have quite the "spit and polish" we expect from films with major stars in the 1940s, probably because it wasn't produced by a major studio as far as I'm aware.
Joe is extraordinary because, perhaps because of his traumatic lost love, he seems to have abandoned normal social modes of behavior and the expectations and limitations imposed by them.
Some of the contrivances are only apparent because the play has been trimmed a bit to fit into theater showing times; the original romance between Tom and Kitty was apparently more developed in the play.
The story would be painfully predictable with no random elements if it wasn't for the presence of Joe Â the credits pretty much tell us everything about both the good and the bad (Blick for instance is a "stool pigeon and frame-up artist") and so perhaps I should have expected for things to turn out in a somewhat less than usual manner but I was still taken somewhat by surprise simply because the style of the film had lulled me into a state of acceptance.
Perhaps it's because its eccentric characters seem to ring true in more ways than one as they often seem like just the unexpected offbeat sort you just might have run into in a place like Nick's in said time and era.
Maybe it's because offbeat eccentrics certainly are not a rarity in today's world and it becomes easy to relate to events here, strange and bewildering as they often are.
I also watched this film because I'm fascinated with Jeanne Cagney and how much she looked like her brother.
Cronenberg is fantastic as a director because rather than being concerned with making the film accessible, he cares more for making a good film and projecting his vision.
That is the plot outline and all the movie has in common with the original, because Cronenberg took a whole different approach to the story.
I would have preferred to see Stathis the fly monster rather than Seth because for a man that sweet to change that badly, really gets me down.
A real shame because when you watch this movie it becomes obvious that the talent is definitely there.
True horror films, by their nature, should strive to get their audience to ask this question, because it means that they are transcending the illusion of moving pictures and becoming a film Â suspending disbelief and getting under your skin.
In this sense, the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do, because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting, lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be, and then Horror is unjustly, and irrevocably, forced upon them.
The final scene were Brundlefly emerges from the teleport after merging with metal and wants Veronica to end his suffering is a truly touching scene almost unheard of in the genre   Being an 1980s movie means we're devoid of CGI and count your blessings for that because the make up here deserved throughly deserved the Oscar it won .
I've not seen the original Fly because I'm not keen in really old films and I don't think it will turn out to be as good as this one.
It is really underrated because mostly people gave it an 8 instead of 10 out of 10 and it should be on the IMDb top 250.
He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend (Geena Davis) is seeing someone else (John Getz), even though his belief is wrong.
I admit this film in many aspects was quite hideous, but because Jeff Goldblums and Geena Davis' acting was so proper and convincing, this is what made the film into what it is.
I won't bother too much with the details because you'll get the idea pretty quickly.
This is because the film is too high-paced and the script too busy--often resulting in all the main actors talking loudly over each other (not a fun experience at all).
Now SOME films with these qualities work (such as MY GIRL Friday or BRINGING UP BABY), but this one does not because the script is poor plus Miss DeHavilland is cast in one of her worst roles ever.
The movie often implies a lot and the movie spend most of its time building up things, which in the long run might make this movie a bit unsatisfying for the average viewer (because not a lot is happening) but for those who are familiar and like these type of movies it's quite rewarding movie.
But even with a mysterious Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig) professing such belief, and others in the story buying into it, the production makes it pretty plain that the reason folks are in danger is because of a plague that has infected the island.
So not without problems it seems, but it doesn't show because Isle Of The Dead ended up as an atmospheric pot boiler dripping with the sense of unease so synonymous with the Lewton/Robson partnership.
The film is unbelievable because people from different countries appear to be able to converse -- without difficulty -- in one language.
This is one of the best films that Mark Robson ever directed and I think he graduated to A-list director largely because of it.
Picture starting to watch a movie have way in, because thats what it feels like when you start watching this, They don't explain a god dam thing.
I had never heard of it and thought I would check it out because I love Milla Jovovich and Sam Jackson.
I watched it because of Samuel L. Jackson.
It is on quite a bit because it is new, you should try it, you will be surprised how well it turned out!!
My baby sister was watching this movie, because she wants to be a "baller" like me.
And i liked it even more, because i had meet up with the same type of girls when i was in the basketball team, and i also got my ankle injured because of the same reason, trying so hard to be in the front, but thats what happens when you get that attitude.
I am so glad Zac was in 'The Suite life of Zack and Cody' because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor.
There are already lots of comments about this one on the website but I just wanted to weigh in on it because I enjoyed it so much.
In addition, the story really sucks, especially because they threw a bit of romance on top of it.
Alos, the ending is very bad, and it was just what I had expected because movies like this leave you with no surprises.
(He paid $30,000 for her funeral and took six weeks off filming with Myrna Loy in another picture because of his uncontrollable grief.)
Perhaps it is because they are plural.
That part of the story is heavily contrived, but it works very well regardless because after all it is a 1930s movie.
Loy is distressed because she loves them both.
If the film had different stars, such as Jimmy Cagney or John Garfield, you would have just assumed it was a Warner project because they made so many similar gangster films--ones where the mobster is glib and carefree but ultimately doomed to pay for his crimes.
I love watching these type films and could do so again and again because they are so entertaining.
Sure, they often tended to play the same type of character again and again, but you grew to love them and look forward to this because the films were so consistently good and exciting.
This predictability and consistency make this a very, very good film but also, unfortunately, keep it from getting a really high score because there isn't a whole lot new about the film as well.
who has made it to governor of New York because of a murder done by Blackie, unbeknownst to Jim.
As much as I adore Christian Bale, it was still hard to watch because it was pretty much, a boring movie.
I like Christian Bale a lot and - to be honest - bought this one just because he is in it.
I give it a 7 because of its unusual but fine approach and as it does fulfil its basic premise, which is to entertain kids between 5 and 10.
if you are tired of watching Hollywood movies which are pretty much always the same thing over and over then you should try this, it's a very unique story... maybe will be hard to understand because of the differences from the Asian culture, but I believe even for them this movie was unique...
I have seen this movie three times since its release, but if I'm to be honest the last two times were mostly because of miss Beckinsale.
No, it doesn't end up with everything working out happily, because life rarely does, so don't expect that either.
No, there is no fine, pat conclusion, because Kim knows better.
"Bad Guy" is a beautiful movie, but I only grant it 7 of 10 because Kim has apparently become obsessed with sexual violence (reference "The Isle," "Coast Guard" and "Address Unknown").
Quickly, as an aside, if anyone supposes, simply because of the similarity of titles, that "Bad Guy" is similar to "Old Boy" by Park Chan Wook, forget it.
It seems that laws "out there" function at a different level than in our country because she gets thrown into a brothel and is forced to become meat for the asking.
I would recommend watching this film because I know that at certain parts, you will laugh your ass off.
But I say "Don't ever say never... because the first rule you will break will be your own"...
An unconditional love that requires you to love not in spite of your faults and weakness but because of them.
Whether or not the viewer is willing to accept these illogical flights of fancy is purely a matter of taste, but personally i find his work fascinating solely because it is so stubbornly idiosyncratic and fueled by a remarkably pure sense of creative expression.
This is not the best of movies, but I rank it high because it did it for me.
It reminds me of an old Italian movie, I can't remember the name or actors because I've seen it when I was a kid, with a mafia boss that falls in love with a woman, kidnaps her but wants to charms her, rather that rape her.
The film explores some of the same territory as the work of Catherine Breillat, but the context seems uneasily different when I'm the only woman in the theater and the director is male, perhaps because the central woman is always an object, even as she pitifully adapts to her various degradations, and even resists being freed from them.
Egor Konchalovsky added nothing new to this genre because of inconsistency of style and lack of orientation in dramaturgy.
Worried about being unable to provide a decent meal because of his lackluster cooking skills, Charlie Brown receives some much-needed help from the precocious Linus, the ever-exuberant Snoopy, and Snoopy's jolly pal Woodstock to whip up the best possible food for the grand occasion.
Maybe it's because this was the first time I ever saw Kate Beckinsale, and I was just stunned.
Musa's character was an amazing performance and like someone on IMDb already mentioned about Korean films in relation to SS5, there are better quality films out there with better writing, acting, directing, and which come together to make quality films that have a lasting impression because they are so compelling.
Although my initial cause to sought this movie out was because of Asano and the variety of comments proclaiming how this film excels over other successful features, I ended up enjoying this film simple for the reason that it was nothing like I've ever seen before.
), is the main character because he connects the different story-lines and he is very interested in people's purpose in life.... see it and you know what I mean.
This is an enjoyable, multi-levelled film that will particularly appeal to a European and American audience - just because it is so different.
But because it's so scatterbrained, it can safely be filed in the "two-hour music video" drawer.
Really, there is no movie I can adequately compare with SURVIVE STYLE 5+ because it seems like the first film of an entirely new genre.
The wife is not able to please the man with her cooking at first because she is feeding him what she wants to feed him, not what he wants to eat.
At first, the man is repeatedly killing his wife because he is a killer and that's what he is supposed to do.
He can never succeed killing her because the more we want something, the harder it seems to obtain.
It is important because it is the reason for everything they do.
Didn't anyone care because, as Dink puts it, he's "colored"?
In the end, we forgive the Champ because he really tries, and he really does love that kid.
"), we're behind him all the same because of Beery.
The boxing scenes were hokey but I liked the ending because at least Beery won the fight, although he collapses afterward.
It's two completely absurd people who fall in love before ever meeting because they're both weirdos!!!
I really recommend this movie to everyone because I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!!
As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life.
And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'.
Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough.
"Midnight Blue" is a rare case of a soft core flick that is interesting not only because of the sex scenes, but for the plot.
With this movie unless it's a real good case of insomnia your problems will soon be over...because for an action movie its pretty boring and the acting isn't anything to write home about either.
It's one of those movies you watch and then you just kind of forget it eventually because it wasn't very memorable.
It really irritates me to see movies about a woman who falls in love with a completely irresponsible jerk because he's handsome and charming.
I really enjoyed this movie because I just sat back and listened.
The reason this silent film is still viewed today and enjoyed, is simply because the director of this film was Sidney Franklin who was a very famous director during the 20's 30's and 40's.
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
Those who've read my comments before know that I dislike traditional reviews because they invariably give too much away.
This is especially true when you consider the climax of the movie which is left a little wanting because of this lack of relationship.
I have read that the film turned out confusing because of problems on the set.
This whole line of reasoning bothers me, because it implies that an adventure movie can't be funny, that it has to take itself deadly serious.
As Mitchum's character becomes more involved with Langella's peasant village, giving them the sacrament because they haven't seen a priest in years, he begins to BECOME the priest of his con-game, but his actions keep his friends and Langella guessing as to the extent of his "conversion."
I know one of the actresses in this film but I don't think I'm biased because I've told her when she doesn't pick the greatest projects lol.I saw this at the DGA theater in NY and I'll be completely candid about what works and what doesn't work in this movie.
But, I shouldn't be going on too much because the film world is something I know very little about considering I'm a third grade teacher...
No one is a star vying for an academy award and the performances are all the more absorbing because of that.
Instead of a high body count the victims are people that the audience comes to care about partly because the script is smartly set into the normsville of everyday life.
The movie is special because it is taking this genre and doing something fresh with it.
Already bored of it, well too bad, because it's done to death in Little Erin Merryweather.
We saw this at one of the screenings in New York and I'll never forget it, because I hate horror movies and my boyfriend knows this.
It definitely builds because when it gets to the point where there's only the one boy left, and he's hiding from her in the library, I was literally hiding under my seat.
Even if you're not a horror freak like my boyfriend, you should still check it out because it is different and very creative.
I would give this one star, but it gains one more because the girls had HOTT breasts.
I rented it because I didn't know what other 'new' release comedies I could watch and enjoy.
I think she needs to improve her English because her accent makes it very difficult to understand what the heck she is saying.
One thing that's even more confusing is the fact that FOREST WHITAKER is listed as a producer, to me he's one of Hollywood's finest and hopefully his producer-spot just meant that he financed the movie and wasn't actually a part of making this movie because that would have been a shame.
!I don't know if this movie would have been better if a man directed this,his perspective.But because I enjoyed watching Sofi'a working off on the other Latina's,in all their sexiest,I could bare to watch this over again!!
There is a vaccum in space because of this movie.
Wish I hadn't, because the last time I had such fun time like this one, it's when I went through two endoscopias in a row (it's when a doctor puts in you a camera by the throat to check your stomach from the inside).
ItÂ´s just a bad cast of cute people speaking in english -or trying to- just because they are supposed to live in Miami, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles.
I donÂ´t think so, since almost every person of it speaks none other language but spanish (and I know it, because I've lived in California).
I guess not either, mainly because the actors (?)
I saw Sofia Vergara before in "Big Trouble," but she looks different in the movie and I might not have remembered from that previous film because well...I'm trying not to remember it period.
A word to finish with is that there were some goofs i this movie because the events occur in 1995 & the director mistakenly showed some wrong signs that weren't there at this time.
Special lines and scenes are added for Zaky el dessouki (Adel emam) only because he's a famous comedian and the audience would like him to throw a joke every now and then although it's totally unnecessary,Taha's (Mohamed emam) clothes are not of his social class in anyway!
Together they engage in "shooting fish", or fleecing rich people of their extra cash, in order to buy themselves the lavish house they've each coveted because of their simple upbringing.
I didn't like Slumdog Millionaire because it told me everything about India that I already knew: it feels like a package tour where you are shown the sites you expect to see, and are whisked from one location to another.
Omaret Yakobean is my new favorite movie because well everything about it is done perfectly, as in acting, music, storyline, characters... Also, it tackles so many issues and problems in the Egyptian society from corruption, to prostitution to homosexuality to many other things, things that the Egyptian cinema has been too conservative, or "shy" to handle because they are all taboo.
Hopefully, more movies of that genre will be made in the future because every second of that movie was entertaining in every aspect and i was enjoying it until the very last second, and i even didn't want it to finish.this movie is just BEAUTIFUL!!
Maybe because Hamed had to fit the script, so that the bigger stars get the bigger parts, all the secondary characters (Soaad, Dawlat, Malaak, etc...) ended up with almost no screen time.
He likes dark Nubian men because they remind him an early experience with a family servant.
The film has little details any Cairo downtown resident will know -- like Zaki yelling angrily because another resident has left the door of the antique elevator open on their floor so no one else can use it.
Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet, because if you do, chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge.
Just about every song is a winner because her voice fits her blues- rock material extremely well and her band is outstanding.
There is so much music here I often break this up into a couple of viewings, but no matter where I pick this back up in the concert, it's a good starting point because it's simply one good song after another.
I used to own this on VHS but acquired the DVD because of the better sound.
If this deserves to be classed as a film noir, it is because of a relentless pressure from the forces of fate on a hapless protagonist.
This was presumably a follow-up to "White Heat" and was not as popular--again, because it is dour and violent, or perhaps for the general audience of 1950, this type of gangster film had seen its day.
I love this genre of film because it shows many facets of life during the time in which it is depicted.
Everyone is suited to the part they played because they were believable.
Cotter, in the end, is his own downfall as he goes too far and his romance with a high society girl with a very wealthy and powerful father, leads to his downfall because one thing you don't do is double-cross your moll!
If you do an image internet search on this car a very similar one comes up albeit with a spare wheel attached to the door but it wouldn't be unknown for this to be removed by the production company because it got in the way.
I wouldn't say underrated, because it seems that everyone who has watched it agrees with me.
This film immediately followed Cagney's best film (WHITE HEAT) and is a slight letdown because of this.
Mostly I like the movie because the plot, for a Noir film, takes so many odd and difficult to predict turns--it certainly is NOT like most of the other gangster films you've seen.
BUT, because of his intense narcissism (i.e., self love), he cannot imagine his complex schemes and double-dealing NOT succeeding.
Maybe that's because Cagney IS the entire show.
It's a somewhat neglected film, maybe because it's basically a gangster picture rather than a noir, and rather late in the day for such things.
I picked up, pretty much because of reviews I read here, this movie KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE.
Thank goodness he decided to do it anyway, because this movie... out and out floored me!
I got this movie because I wanted to see Shannen Doherty in a different element from 90210 and Charmed to determine if she could really act.
If you're looking for genuinely scary, suspenseful horror, look elsewhere, because it won't be found here.
I admire Night of the Living Dead for its innovative approaches, but I have always found the zombies to be very boring because in moral and intellectual terms they are complete ciphers.
They must not enjoy the surroundings any more than the audience does because they're soon amusing themselves with exhibitionism, nudity and sexual encounters with the manager and each other.
I know 95% of the world's population wouldn't agree with me, but I always had a thing for old sleaze/horror movies which seem to be made just because the director had nothing to do, had had a funny dream he wanted to realize, or that he just needed money.
despite only catching the film halfway through, the time when shannons already been conned, I was luckily able to catch up quickly and thankfully did because this turned out to be a better than average TV movie.
Regardless because I think I might decide to watch another one of her films if they turn up on TV in the near future.
I know this because at the end of 1941 I was stationed at 61 (Spitfire) Operational Training Unit at Heston (now part of Heathrow airport) and was billeted in Meadow Way Heston.
I won't describe the plot, because you can easily find that elsewhere.
(the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact)  Great one...  Is it for my peculiar interest for the dystopias and utopias?
He is killed in a messy, disfiguring way and yet because he is the ship's puppet/mascot he comes back again and again.
When saying that because FSL, GSL, and ASL appear the same so they must be similar, is like saying because you can speak French, German, or English it is all similar, as you know isn't the case.
I felt cheated in some respects because the music and jobs seemed more window-dressing that life choices.
It is true that American Sign Language and French Sign Language are quite similar; this is because one of the first teachers of the deaf in the United States was a Frenchman, Laurent Clerc.
The world of a normal young girl, who has to go through an unusual dilemma, because both of her parents are deaf, and at the same time face the difficulties of life, experiencing her own true self.
Finding herself turns out to be one of the real challenges in her life, because she has to separate herself from her parents and walk down her own path, without turning her back on them.
It's too damn bad a show like this didn't get picked up by Comedy Central or Adult Swim, because those channels were better at dealing with more out of the box shows.
3) The WTC towers collapsed because they were rigged with explosives, and it was a planned implosion.
5) The attacks had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden because, get this, he said so!
Not ONCE do they even attempt to actually contact a real expert, because that would disprove their theories right away.
Without going into how emotionally charged these young men are (which is a funny thing for me to say because I'm only 25 myself), I was constantly annoyed by how they liked to repeat 'it just doesn't add up'.
In my opinion, conspiracy theorist start off with an advantage, because while the adherents to the official version of events must PROVE their claims, the conspiracy theorists don't - they succeed when they manage to create enough doubt about the official version of events.
Sure it is strange that the 'building 7' collapsed, but just because you do not fully understand something, it doesn't mean it cannot happen.
...as MOST of the very very unjustified and critical reviews about Loose Change SE are from people who only wrote ONE comment on IMDb; to tell us that this movie is rubbish because it's facts are wrong.
I liked this movie because someone has to dare to produce such stuff.
Which is very important because most people are eating what the American Media is giving them to eat: Bu**Sh**  And no matter what the truth is, it is not the official report and that is a fact for sakes.
now i give him credit, because he actually made a decent screenplay, if only he got more of his facts right.
2 out of 10, because i liked some of the music
The evidence in one sequence of pictures is forgotten when discussing another so that the evidence of the planes that hit the towers being commercial airlines from some shots is dismissed because its not clear in others.
Tell me who "They" are It really annoys me because as long as you don't think about what the film is saying or the inconsistent stories its spinning this is a really well done piece of film making.
Worth a look, with a large grain of salt, simply because it lays out the alleged conspiracy many people feel is real.
Fortunately or unfortunately it fails to make its case because its evidence is severely lacking.
It's almost uncomfortable to watch because most of the points covered leave you with a reasonable doubt with regards to the official version of the events of 911.
And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts).
While the comments from people that hate sound like this: "This movie is flawed, because of these facts etc.".
As an idiot i believed it blindly: because it is was on TV.
This poorly made documentary tries to convince people that CIA somehow planned 9/11, because they wanted a war on terror.
If the CIA was so powerful as the conspiracy theorists claim, then they would made Iraqies and Afghans go into those planes, because then they would have a greater argument to attack the Arab-countries in the so-called war on terror, especially Iraq.
I liked the film, because it obviously took a long time to put together, and there is an element of mystery.
Just look here: 911myths.com But I know that 9/11-Conspiracy theorists will never look at the site, only because they want to keep their prejudges that Americans or Jews are behind every evil act in the history of the world, including 9/11.
This movie made me very very angry, and not because of what it implies.
But because so many people are actually swallowing this hogwash hook line and sinker.
Because the government should have a recording of the voice to make a "live"-morph of it, so they must have tailed them for months, because they could not have relied on recording enough of their voice in the airport.
So, I have to say it is very respectable of them to dedicate this film in memory of those perished in 9-11 because, the victims out of everyone has the right to know what really happened and to be honest the gov't haven't shown us everything.
Those of you that say you wouldn't because you never had that kind of power.
Last but not least for those of you who is dissing this film I bet you don't know anyone that has died because of 9-11 and you don't have a son fighting in Iraq.
And more importantly the idea never even went into planning because the government wasn't prepared to carry it out!
And this is because of lack of try on writers and director's side
I use quotations marks because the supposedly super hot sorority chicks aren't particularly attractive.
Look on a map of the many islands and rocks in that part of the globe and imagine how rough the sea is because it has only limited space.
I bought this DVD because of its low price and the beautiful cover, but without any reference.
No, that's because they're better left unsaid.
However, "Decoys" shines among the rest of b-grade films because of the simple fact that it is quite funny and entertaining despite its clichÃ©d storyline.
Hush is a film that lacks credibility because the plot is more or less unbelieveable.
Those expecting a "Shakespeare" like performance won't get one because the credibility of the plot takes away from all of the performances.
The cinematography is average mainly because of the natural beauty of Virginia in the (early?)
Unusual because the pirates depicted in this movie are all too real.
But I still enjoyed it, simply because I enjoy this type of movie.
I went to see 'Shakespeare In Love' because it won the Oscar for Best Picture.
It is not the best movie ever made, but I was really sucked into it, especially because of Lange's perfect portrayal of an utter bitch.
There were times when it seemed like scenes had been cut because things didn't make sense, but it wasn't too hard to ignore that and fill in the blanks ourselves.
The technical adviser on this film was either asleep or inept, because a scene does not pass without a glowing inaccuracy.
The only reason I would hesitate to call this a masterpiece is because there is no Hitchcock cameo.
Actually they could of used anyone including a dead Orson Welles for the part because the hubby really has nothing to do but just be a plot device.
She eventually lets her know that the son didn't kill the dad and he wasn't leaving the mom because of a affair.
Someone must have told Gwyneth Paltrow and Jonathon Schaech they're starring in a serious drama because they're no fun at all in this try-hard attempt at camp.
On the plus side, Jessica Lange gets it right because she's as camp as a row of pink tents playing the MIL from Hell with a weird fixation on her cute-but-dim offspring.
An absolutely awful movie I watched only because of Gwyneth Paltrow who I had previously admired greatly.
Durante definitely steals the show because he is the ONLY vaguely likable character in this whole movie!
The film just doesn't make sense and becomes tiresome because of all this.
Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he's a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform.
A serial killer is loose and the audience is agonising, and not because the film is terrifying.
Emil attempts to murder Pat, and because he cries over it, and confesses the Nazis kept him in a dark cell for what his father did, the family forgives all.
Every clichÃ© you can name features here, but I personally couldn't care less because this is a fun and unpretentious thrill-ride and nothing more.
Last year, I watched those movies on ch 55, avoiding DJG at all costs, because one of my friends told me,"So ancient...don't watch!"
Jang Geum then trained to be a Medical Lady, because it was the only way a slave-servant can enter the palace.
i haven't finished the entire series but because the TV show is ending here in the Philippines, i already know what's going to happen.
I am writing it not because there is not enough comments already for this wonderful series, but to additionally help you decide if you should invest a whopping 54 hours of your life on watching one drama!
So I ended up spending yet another 54 hours re-watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as "cultural differences."
This is a movie that has a dated look, but still makes an impression because of the strength of the treatment it received from the writers and the director.
Maybe because it is horrific.
Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day.
It kept me watching right up to the dumb ending because I had to see where it was going.
And what is really great is that as this book was written, your interest doesn't have to be maintained by the titular character because there are supporting folks heavy-laden with their own fascinating tales Â and that's the way this movie was cast; the most interesting actors are playing the most interesting characters.
I would recommend this to anybody because it's full of romance and adventure.
I didn't like the ending though, only because Sam Neill's character didn't end up with Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), which was really sad.
Between Rebecca and Rowena, I think Rebecca stole the movie because of her courage and will to help Ivanhoe even though they have different backgrounds.
Now I don't want to sound like I'm totally praising the film because it's not THAT good but it's not bad either.
That's all I should say, because the only interesting part was watching the credits to laugh at the fact that this movie actually had people to credit.
I gave it a "1" because I don't think that if you follow the textbook example of movies, this doesn't really work out.
They should have the scale be a zero on this movie, because I would rather put that instead of a one (because it doesn't even amount to a one).
Small pictures should be encouraged, not made fun of just because they are not of the highest quality.
I give this one a 3/10 because there was a passable plot, and some half-decent acting.
The MST3K was great, and it was fun to watch the movie because it was filmed in Rutland, Vermont.
This is a really dumb movie, with a very low budget, and because of that, this is a very entertaining film.
It's too bad, because as I indicated, there are some good ideas to be found in Time Chasers.
1 star because of the JFK Dollar from 2041.
