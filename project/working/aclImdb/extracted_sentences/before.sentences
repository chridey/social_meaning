I admit, the great majority of films released before say 1933 are just not for me.
So, I'm suggesting people cut "Time Chasers" some slack before they cut in the jugular.
It plays with the facts as usual,Ruth Etting was well into her thirties before she went Hollywood.
Let us hope this award will be made before this gracious and lovely lady is unable to make an appearance there.
One thing is certain though, and that's the sentiment expressed to Marty Snyder just before the curtain falls - "You gotta give her credit, the girl can sing..."
This is one of the first movies they ever made me stare at the screen speechless, before bursting out into laughter.
This film was made about five years before Ross Hunter glamorized Doris and made her the #1 box office star in a series of comedies, three of which were with Rock Hudson.
I stopped watching after hearing the Lord's name being spoken three times in vain, how much do you have to go through before you say 'enough is enough' ?
Bruce Willis stretches his comedic muscles like never before or after this.
My two laughs: 1) Uwe Boll came on before the movie started and said "this movie sucks" and "don't watch it".
As I said before, there might be people who don't like it because it has the humor of "Torrente", but the film is exceptional, especially because of the visual effects.
When it's discovered that there are four others in another room of the chamber where he was found, their lives are thrown into a crisis..those who threatened to imprison Kravaal for his frozen therapy, endangering a patient he had under cryogenic sleep, are awakened and despite the obvious success before them threaten to ruin all the potential benefits which could reach the world.
For example, the protagonist, Dr. Tim Mason (Roger Pryor of "Belle of the Nineties"), impresses to the press how the use of cryogenics can help mankind before his procedure has been checked by others and the head of the hospital reprimands him for behaving in a presumptuous manner and advises him to take a sabbatical until his experiments can be checked.
Let's get around to RTW main failings before getting to the good bits.
The Transformers movie was nowhere near as violent as this movie was and even then at least the writers of the Transformers movie waited until somewhere near the middle before they even started killing off characters.
A marvelous movie, from start to (just before the) finish.
I have a pet peeve and before I begin I want to say a few words about it.
The "finger shadow" scene before the rape was a touch of cinematic genius that I almost missed the first time around.
Figure the action to be taking place slightly before that.
It makes you think twice before you might think: I would like to have lived then!
Brian Moore grew up in Northern Ireland and considered joining the priesthood before he moved to Canada and abandoned his Catholic religion later in life.
And yet, Moore has so successfully replicated the brutish world of the Native American that the viewer who can overcome modern Political Correctness will indeed find himself wishing not for their destruction but that they and their enemies could, in one sense, cease to be Huron, cease to be Iroquois, for their own sake and for each other's, before it is too late!
If you are not American, watch this film either before or after a trip to the wilds of North America.
If you're a prof, show this film to students but lead a discussion before and after with care.
Rather than the stomach churning for a second before expressing amazement, I found myself asking if the depiction of bodily functions is really necessary.
Black Robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images Malick's films possess but the director in this case is Bruce Bereford, the man who directed Driving Miss Daisy a couple of years before doing this film.
I was shocked at a few scenes in here, not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens.
The tone is radically altered, Blackadder's sarcasm remains but it's not funny now, well at least not in the same way as it was before.
I can watch it over and over again and even quote the lines before the actors do.
Blackadder Goes Forth is far more intelligent than a lot of sitcoms; the writing and acting is exceptionally good, and also underpins the true human sacrifice the millions of soldiers gave to their King & country while the smug & arrogant Generals went home to more medals, honours and riches than ever before.
The plot has been done many times before and many of the characteristics of previous films find their way into this one.
It tells the tale of a woman named Laura, who as a child lived in an orphanage for a number of years before being adopted.
Her son's innocent games with imaginary friends soon develop into something more serious and disturbing and everything starts going a bit strangeÂ Have you heard this one before?
I'm sure you have, as you probably guessed the story involves strange paranormal happenings, ghosts, creeks in the floorboards and numerous other elements seen before.
Like in a comedy where the joke is built up to the punch line, the scare is given enough support before scream moment and even though a lot of them have been done before, these ones actually genuinely scare.
It isn't long before she begins to see the children who she used to play with as a seven-year-old.
By the end, when the truth is revealed, it's satisfying but it has been done before in other films.
It's a very nice return to form, and it's probably something you should see before the grubby Hollywood execs put their dirty paws on it and turn it into a CUTITSACAT!
There are entire sequences that are reminiscent of classic fright films: of course the boy with imaginary friends, as mentioned above; but also a psychic and her entourage right out of "Poltergeist"; there's a death I've seen before as well, I think out of one of the "Final Destination" films; and of course, the general outline--a ghost story set in an orphanage--is vaguely reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's own "The Devil's Backbone".
What more can I say, lately is a common practice for me to consult some IMDb users's reviews before paying any serious attention to some foreign flick I don't know much about, but the truth is...
One must believe that the game can happen before he/she can truly take part.
Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true; Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game; and young Roger PrÃ­ncep plays the child SimÃ³n with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.
I've never before seen a movie constructed of a montage of separate scenes that came together so well as a whole.
After the high of the robbery wears off, the 4 teenagers find themselves right where they were before the robbery, bored.
An adrenalized, ultra-stylized, comic-book-violent black comedy about a group of well-scrubbed but very alienated youth who rob a gas station out of boredom, before then deciding to return and run the place for a night, pocketing all of the sales, and then taking off.
(played by a very Emilio-looking Martin Sheen) In 2000, I bought a dear friend's Honda Shadow V-twin 1100 cc (Sportster wannabe) and had some very memorable rides before parting with it in 2003.
Maybe it was that I'd never seen that kind of delicacy and sweetness in performance before--and rarely since--nothing "thrilling," nothing forced, nothing fey, nothing indulgent--just careful observations and filled moments.
The story follows Noel Holcroft (Michael Caine) - A New York real estate business man who has just found out he is going to inherit a huge amount of money that his Nazi father had stolen from Nazi Germany at the end of WW2 just before he died.
When the series were on TV, I had never been to Australia before.
I used to sit at home in my room every Sunday evening just before 7.
A great picture of the sleazy side of life in the thirties before the Hays commission took over.
Trying to get the two girls help, and away from Dr. Ranger, Lora is threatened with bodily harm or worse from the brutish Nick who's, from judging his gangster-like manner, killed before and, with little provocation, will kill again!
There's Stanwyck (before her teeth were fixed) and Blondell (gum-popping her way through the Nurse's Oath), both trying to survive grabby interns, unscrupulous doctors, murderous families, and no money.
Endgame portray him as a husband married to an "organic", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before Endgame, to disobey Captain's order and make "human" mistakes.
The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end.
and how ozon cuts it before she ever reaches.
It seems that she can feel more comfortable and isolated when speaking in English, and perhaps she was able to use the same technique before Jean's disappearance to exert her own individuality within her marriage.
One of my favorite scenes is about the reason for taking off shoes before going into the house - it's basically so you leave the world and it's chaos outside your sanctuary and not to avoid getting dirt that can be vacuumed up later.
The Devil's Child lacks any new ideas and whichever way the story moves, you know you've seen it before.
In this move he plays a straight arrow guy, generally normal, likes to research before making a move.
There is no before and no after.
Well done to be sure but still material we have all seen before.
But quickly changes to the classic Arnie like war flick (anything before 1987), and even resembles aspects of the second Rambo film.
Everyone else has a great part and the characters are developed well in the opening scenes, before they're mercilessly butchered.
Like James Cameron's "Aliens" that came out the year before, "Predator" is shaped by it's excellent characters, Dutch is the great, silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote "If it bleeds, we can kill it" is among the greatest.
And last, but not the least, the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan, who directed this right before he made "Die Hard".
Can the first season if its before this summer, be downloaded or purchased on DVD?
I like it that the bad guys won, they just were not clear enough about it, probably because they wanted to have some room for a third season, fir me just another 20-30 minutes to end it properly would do.. maybe just showing a scene of angels and demons battling each other in front of the burning school and Leon and Thelma hiding in the forest where we left them, crying of fear and failure over Ellas dead body.. and then suddenly meeting old friends (Cassie, Amy, Max, Roxanne, Tom, etc) and everybody then slowly goes away to heaven(or maybe hell) together (a semi happy ending, at least for our main characters getting the chance to meet and be together in the afterlife at least) A scene where Azazel, Raphael and Mephistopheles having a last drink together sitting quiet together seemingly contemplating their bitter and unhappy fates, of course with a close up on a tear falling from Azazels check before everything erupts into light/chaos, could be a kind of fitting/funny final scene   anyway I really enjoyed this show.
How many documentaries are over before you know it and leave you wanting more?
watch it because it would be like nothing you've ever seen before.
You wonder how much of it is based on Buscemi's life in New York, before he made it in the business.
If you are interested in Lars Von Trier visual and poetic art, try to consider before the more recent (and in some way, more "accessible") works like "Breaking the Waves", "Dancer in the Dark", and "Dogville".
Then, to have the original band member, plus the entire Zappanele audience, blow before them in praise (literally bowing!)
It is unfortunate that Savior was not made before 1995, while the Bosnian War was still being fought, it would have definitely helped to open viewers' eyes to the reality of the war.
She was a teenager at the time, and she once told me that no one believed that the war would actually escalate so far, until before they realized it, a battle was being fought in the neighboring town a few miles away.
It will be a long time before I am able to forget the nightmarish imagery featured in this film.
This completes the new series, and takes the consequence of the ones before it, similar to how Warrior Within(the saving method of which this retains) built on the first.
It's a way to take out opponents, typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity, and all you truly need is to get the timing right, albeit the first time you try the specific ones, before you know what's coming, you will have to react split-second, as well as not get trigger-happy.
The camera is a little limited, compared to the ones before this, and the panoramic view is less available, and once or twice, even kinda phoned in.
So before you write it off simply because it's an adult cartoon, watch just ONE episode.
Emlyn Williams is top-billed and co-star Anna Konstam appeared in only a handful of films including Waterloo Road before falling off the radar for some 30 years but the film is unbalanced in the last third by a tour de force from Ernest Thesiger in what is clearly a prototype Waldo Lydecker - there is even a facial resemblance especially in the mouth between Thesiger and Clifton Webb; both are aesthetes and both killers.
The movie is at least 2/3rds over before one of the main characters appears, the former schoolmaster Walter Hoover, played by the unbelievably urbane, stick-figure-thin Ernest Thesiger.
Unfortunately the end credits came before I found anything like this.
The film appeals to various known historical facts such as personal Stalin involvement in criminal acts of bank robberies before Bolsheviks had noticed him.
He is just able to touch her drink before time begins to reverse and it goes back to her giving him the money.
before?
As one guy said before me, I too would like to travel back to before I watched this movie.
It's all been said before.
Slow motion is used to signal the slowing down of time before a backwards trip, but it's also just used any old time to signify nothing other than the total running time needed to be longer to qualify as a feature-length film.
I've never, before watching Slipstream, felt it my duty to so harshly trash a film on the internet.
Like I said before, not a bad movie, at all.
Kevin Van Hentenryck is still as horrible as ever before in his acting but they cleverly resolved this by putting in way more characters this time, so the entire focus of the movie this time isn't just upon Duane and Belial.
Watch for yourself before believing any negative reviews of this series.
Being raised in a family of people who flew Argentina before I was born, I was used, kind of, to the heavy Argentinian accent that the actors have, Federico Luppi especially.
I see my own evolution with this movie, my opinion growing, I notice concepts I hadn't before.
We've seen this type of thriller before.
That said, the story is told as one we've seen Way too many times before.
And better before too!
As I mentioned before, the storyline is weak and too predictable, leaving you the feeling that Coppola left the screenwriting aside in order to focus almost exclusively on the mindbending technical details of the flick.
Ten years of waiting turned into ten frustrating minutes of watching before I ejected and junked the disc.
It's based on what Vegas used to look like, before they tore it all down and put up that oversized Disneyland.
It's impossible - for me at least - to know whether or not Ann Fontaine was familiar with Joe Orton's sixties play Entertaining Mister Sloane (subsequently filmed)before writing and directing Nettoyage a sec some thirty years later but it is reasonable to assume that the central premise - bi-sexual catalyst male enters and ultimately disrupts household via sexual encounters with both male and female - is very similar with, in the case of the latter, a Gallic twist.
He is the assistant manager of this big megaplex, which means he has a lot of responsibility and duties to bring about before his shift is over.
A series of stories, or various ways taboos can be tap-danced on with relish, alternate how characters do immoral things to each other..such as these sweaty men paying for a prostitute's method of defecation over a pot, how a group of hipsters fondle a school girl before murdering her with a stick in an act of indecency, a movie producer giving an actress seeking work the "casting couch" treatment whacking off as his pal rapes her, an act of adultery where the cheating woman alternates between pleasure and guilt over what she's doing as the grinning male has his way with her, a wealthy wife looks on as her black butler gives her daughter oral sex, etc.
Her death 18 years before Peterson's trial was found by investigation at the time to be by natural causes.
was put out on the internet, before the case started.
This has been done hundreds of times before and this movie adds nothing to the old formula.
I wonder if the talent in "Camp" have ever acted before or if this is their first attempt.
I never been on the line of drama before, but i don't know what was happened, i finished this movie with a succession on my mind.
Second, it was totally clichÃ©d and you could figure out where it was going looooong before it got there.
There was almost nothing in it that was original...we have seen it all before and much better done.
Neither has had major success before or since (Warner had a lengthy run in Family Law) and, to be perfectly frank, this movie gives a good idea why - they have little charisma, and no chemistry despite the fact that they supposedly fall in love during the film The story demands lead players who don't come across as insipid, but it doesn't get them.
Most of these kids have never done anything before.
While the program covers the war on the Russian Front in-depth, it also contains significant portions that describe the years before and after the war.
I am only giving this movie a one out of ten because it actually finished before I ended up a drooling mess in the corner of the room .We found this 'comedy' on TV and thought we would give it a chance cos it had Dana Carvey in it and it might have been entertaining , how wrong we were .
But before you chalk this up to being just the ramblings of a madman, a child or both, I would like to assure you that I am a 24 year old male with a broad sense of humor.
The child, now seemingly fully grown into a teenager, brings his mom the thumb cocoon, which she lovingly turns into soup, before helping the boy's father to perform some kind of Frankensteinesque experiment.
I only watched the first half hour before giving up.
For instance, one of the throwaway sorority girls in the opening sequence is revealed to be a virgin; this seemingly unnecessary plot thread is brought to fruition after she is raped by the werewolf before her throat is ripped out during the rape.
The werewolf too is somewhat different than we've seen before.
This is ingenious indeed, I never saw it before, and I saw a lot of werewolf movies.
It has a nice start to the film but when we get to the story you will have figured out the werewolf way before the middle act and your left with a lot of stupid decision making by some of the characters to pad the running time (ex.
Derek, Sam, and Derek's uncle Charle (the solid Christopher Shyer) all join forces to try to figure out a way to stop Toblat before he kills again.
Present day, Scott's wife (Sarah Aldrich of Port Charles) is in a new, unhappy marriage with Scott's friend Mitchell (the under-appreciated Richard Tyson of Two Moon Junction and Hardball), who was also along on the hunting trip years before.
It doesn't take long before animal passions are running wild and I don't just mean the sex crazed teenagers.
I especially like the early scenes before they actually get to the camp site.
Director Robert C. Hughes doesn't rush proceedings, taking time to carefully develop his characters before the killing begins.
I like a challenge, but for example I was trapped in one (big) level for a entire week before I found out that to progress in the game, I had to shoot a small electro-tube somewhere on the wall... What kind of game-logic is that?!
Because before long the three are sucked up by an alien space ship.
The voice acting is almost uniformly great (with the exception of Jen sometimes), and the story is mostly original, save the overall plot, which we've seen a zillion times before.
Now before I go on to talk about Prey's game play etc,.
Never have I played a game before that has had me standing in the middle of a wide-open area admiring my surroundings.
Never before have I played an FPS quite like this.
If you've seen this Film before, no doubt, you'll have your own views on it, and so don't need me to tell you how good/bad it is!
Seeking help from The Paragon Institute, she soon finds out 2 things: Robin was there before her and that she has a connection to him.
This was never hinted at before the attack, which makes it odd that the action was even staged.
I thought the film dragged a little in places, too many elements just came & went too quickly & it ignores various aspects of it's story for long periods before going back to them which gave me the impression that it was was very inconsistent & at times a bit incoherent & confusing.
The Fury reminds heavily of Carrie (1976) with it's troubled teenage psychics which, by co-incidence or not, was the film De Palma made directly before The Fury.
And there's a memorable bit from a younger and thinner Dennis Franz before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective Andrew Sipowicz.
But before you run away, stay and watch just one episode and you'll see what a genius Matt Holness is and what a find this comedy is.
If, like me, you had not heard of this before coming across it somewhere online then do catch up with it now.
Yet, what is significant for him is the fact that few Generals die in the war front and what the soldiers were given to drink before they clashed with the enemy at the front and met their death.
Still, it took about five and a half weeks before I could see the movie on which the musical was based.
Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad.
Being a Rosario Dawson fan it was only a matter of time before I would get around to seeing this film.
I mentioned before that Burns fantastically takes the viewer away from you typical New York scenery and plants you IN New York (if that makes sense).
The only performances I enjoyed was Britany Murphy whose wonderful guttural voice is always a joy to hear.The movie has the typical Ed Burns slobby vulgarity(lots of talk about applying cologne to ones balls and not showering before dates.. Brothers McMullen had similar talk about defecating in front of other guys.)
I must admit, I have never seen an Ed Burns film before, nor have I seen him act much before, except for Saving Private Ryan.
Look-a-like brothers has been a favorite theme for novelists and filmmakers long before "Twin Dragons" appeared.
Dennis Potter, who passes before these works, "Karaoke and Cold Lazarus" could be produced, asked in his last interview with Melvyn Bragg, "Where will the writers who want to tell stories about life as it truly is, beneath the hype and glitter, get their opportunity as I did in the 60's, in our current world of Rupert Murdoch sensibilities?"
His 1st Sergeant, a bully and a brute whom he despises, had just fallen in before him, and is unconscious.
This is a newly discovered sexual companionship, and a very deep emotional connection that neither one has ever experienced before.
In spite of this, it is a tale never before told on film.
I had heard about it before from a few friends who had seen it and had read about it in TIME magazine, not knowing much about the movie.
The movie was too fast paced,not much in the way of a plot that hasn't been done before & the actors could not act to save their lives for an exception of Kelsey & even he couldn't save this picture.
What an unexpected treat.Long before Pricilla and all the others, there was Craig Russell.
Part is due to the actress, Kelly Rowan, whom I've never seen before.
It's interesting to see the direction the show took immediately after the original movies and before Episodes 1-3 were thought of.
However, if only we overlook the clichÃ©d situation, that Rajesh was the one, to whom Asha was supposed to be getting married, and elopes for the love of Prem Chopra, who is a bad man in the story, as well as the train accident, The father-in -law, who hasn't seen the girl to whom his son was married before, and Asha entrapped in a situation, to abide by the oath that she would take care of that orphaned baby etc.
But they should have gone back to the drawing board on this one before they ever released it.
The money drop off goes OK until the kidnapper figures out the police are watching him, Foster has no choice but to arrest him without the knowledge of where Frances is & once in custody he refuses to say anything, will Frances be found in time before she runs out of air & why does her young kidnapper seem so clam, almost as if he is enjoying himself or maybe there are other less clear motives behind the events of the previous day...
Never before have I gotten so much into a character such as Madeline Foster, that I nearly forgot that Maura Tierney wasn't doing "bad girl" things behind Billy Morrissette's back...
I remember Fox Movie Channel used to run some kind of promo trailer/short documentary before showing it, so I'd love to see that as well.
It's definitely worth seeing, and another one of those films that seemingly came out of nowhere, as I never heard of it before.
and naturally turns against its creators before it's even properly finished.
On top of that, they only last 24 hours before incubating their own successors.
Does this TV-series, which is over before one knows it and doesn't seem to take the 12x 30 minutes it says on the DVD jewelbox, draw a true picture of political USA ?
I saw the sickle behind many of them and felt this was their last chance to say something about the industry that they worked in on film before Charon came for them to take them down the river Styx.
The cast is filled with "I've seen him/her before somewhere" - faces but I couldn't put a name to those faces.
Sadly the actress herself has become rather unappealing as an adult, both appearance and personality wise (just another shallow Hollywood party girl...) but here's a look at how sweet she was before things went wrong.
Some parents, for some strange reason, think that their happiness comes before their children.
I felt as tho we weren't given enough details of the "story", before joining in on the movie.
I think if there was flashback or two, or if the movie began about a year or two before the actions took place, the current situation would have meant more.
Madame La (Juliette Binoche) is such a gentle soul living there who believes the man is good and useful to the community but also hidden under the surface is innocently sexually obsessed with the man before she even really meets him which is what much of the community thinks she is leaning toward, especially some bored debutantes which are like counterparts to Juliette's character.
This was before the computer FX revolution, so they look 'real'.
Blending an eye for detail in production design, Sivan brings the long-dead civilization back to life like no other Hindi film has done before.
Susima, whom becomes extremely jealous of Asoka quick rising fame and power, try's many indirect attempts to have Asoka killed before he reaches the throne but sadly for susima, he fails at all attempts to have asoka killed.
I had never seen a Bollywood film before this, and given that I love to sing and dance and watch romance, this film filled my needs and desires.
A story of a traveller's travels, his education that is the journey, the loves and losses and wars and redemption all encompass this 173 minute epic that grips the viewer from the moment the camera pans down onto Asoka, as if indicating it is descending onto a mountain full of riches within, up until the deeply disturbing ending, which leaves the viewer with a ray of hope before the credits flash to announce not the end of the story but the beginning.
King Ashoka was a vicious warrior before he was shown the 8-fold path but his conversion did not occur until much blood was spilled in his land.
Throw your taste out the window, and prepare to witness things you have never seen before when watching this truly outrageous action-comedy directed by Wong Jing.
As the girls head to Brighton to take cover, Derek and his cohort Chum (Nathan Constance), forced to take action against the girls before they have to pay the price themselves, are determined to track them down.
As mentioned before, anyone who's been to London would know that Kelly's relative's flat was clearly in London, and couldn't have been anywhere else!
Well, these two things are explained rather quickly for us before details are revealed that start to make the whole thing more intriguing, complex and a little bit different from the gamut of British crime movies that we've seen since the turn of the century.
I don't want to, even accidentally, reveal any more about the plot or details that add to the well-paced story so I will just compliment the acting, look of the movie and soundtrack before leaving you with some random thoughts on the essence of the film.
Okay, let's face it, we've all seen this before.
In any case, you can only admire the airplanes for so long before the story line and dialog begin to intrude into your consciousness.
Never before have I witnessed such a dramatic piece with intricate plot lines developed so well.
The other thing that you see written often about the Flying Tigers is that they were fighting the Japanese "years before" Pearl Harbor.
**SPOILERS** WWII war movie about the fabled "Flying Tigers" who battled the Japanese over the skies of China as early as 1937, four years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and amassed a record of air-to-air combat kills against the Japanese air force of something like 40 to 1.
We never really get to know how Scott's last mission turned out since the movie ends before it even begins.
was a real strange one, that was because of the director Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen died just two days before the premiere.
And the fact that its Director died just one day before its release is very sad.
That was formed only after the Germans overran Holland; but this movie is set before they'd captured Amsterdam.
The story of the British secret service agents who are sent to Amsterdam to recover industrial diamonds before the German invasion is a familiar one, and their eventual safe escape is predictable enough.
It is about a one day expedition to Amsterdam in May 1940, shortly before the arrival of the invading German troops.
In a race against time exiled Dutch jewelers try to get all the industrial diamonds out of the country and bring them to Britain before the Germans can take them.
Let me explain my view before some of you decide that I'm mad.
Unfortunately they each die before you can really associate with their characters (unlike the first movie).
Even with all of the above against it, the movie is still several times better from the theatrical Dungeons & Dragons movie that came before it.
This combination between the Action Thriller and Comedy was done so many times before but not with a personality like Eugene Levy!
For Viki, it's change that she, and her fellow student leaders, want to initiate, no matter how small their actions are, but soon enough, it became a hydra that went out of control, giving them a little victory, before the big sledgehammer of a retaliation when any typical authoritarian regime respond with their military might.
IvÃ¡n FenyÃ¶; is no surprise, he's been in the Jake Gyllenhal movie Jarhead before (which I didn't like though), and he can act.
Few days before the 50th anniversary of 23rd October this is the best time to remember and meditate on.
You don't need to trawl Wikipedia for info on the events before sitting down to watch the movie.
Nor was Amundsen reluctant to return to the Arctic: shortly before the opportunity arose, he said that he wanted to go back and die there "in the fulfilment of a high mission, quickly, without suffering."
There is a fusion of European expressionism with Hollywood realism in this film unlike anything I have ever seen before.
He can be blamed for allowing Lundborg to bring him out before his men but under the circumstances it was a sensible decision if not a politically correct one.
Lovely Lilyan Tashman, in one of her final roles before her early death, plays the scheming Russian courtesan who hopes to use Fairbanks as her ticket to the good life in Paris.
There are too many non sequitur cuts to allow Eastwood to rush off alone and the subplot that someone may be trying to frame him for the murders that he's investigating is abandoned before it even gets going.
The absolute ruthlessness of this killer who enjoys raping his victims before they die by strangulation and then even eating a cookie and having a cup of coffee.
They should have examined more the relationship between Block and the killer who he arrested years before for 2 rapes as stated in the later part of the movie.
Once he was out of jail why didn't he start with killing Eastwood instead of those prostitutes (after all, it turned out that Eastwood had arrested him years before)?
It sounds like we've been down this road before, with the cop getting closer to the killer, who's stalking and playing around with the detective.
-- I wanted to leave before it was finished.
And even if you are not interested in Religion or Monasteries, the photographic value of this movie is more than anything I have ever seen before.
I saw this film a few days before.
We are presented with snapshots of odd moments: monks frolicking in the snow; preparing a vegetable garden for spring seeding; a summer Sunday outing when monks are free to socialize and, on this day, they discuss the appropriateness of washing one's hands before meals (a contrarian monk has a simple solution: don't get your hands dirty).
The filmmaker waited 16 years before he got permission to shoot in the monastery and it was well worth waiting.
We've seen it many times before.
The cursing, swearing, tough-as-nails cop paired with a dental supply salesman who really just wants to get the job over with and go on with his life: preferably before Jackson shoots him in the keyster (again!).
Even in 1980 (4 years before I was born) it probably looked like garbage.
Also good animation, different to anything I've seen before, and really refreshing.
Normally I love cartoons, both anime and western, and therefore gave this one a long line before it broke...  PDD
Made right before the buzz-crushing ultra-conservative religious right backlash against the gloriously loose'n'libertine permissiveness of the 70's took hold, this wonderfully wild'n'raucous animated sci-fi/horror/fantasy anthology film gleefully wallows in excessive graphic violence, crass leering objectification of the amply proportioned female form (buxom ladies only, please), and a wickedly funny line in cheery low-brow humor.
Unfortunately, it came out before the viewing public started wanting something different from the usual detective TV show fare...that was so dull and predictable that you not only recognized the plot but could usually anticipate the dialogue.
Sadly, it was just a show that debuted before its time.
The pilot gives reasonable insight into the characters of the show before they set off "sliding" into parallel worlds.
And, as usual, reality takes a back seat to low down comedy as the boys fall into one impossible situation after another before we reach a happy ending with everyone confidently marching off to take care of World War II.
Still and all, Bowman must first lose his privileged arrogance before being accepted into the great American melting pot.
My uncle who later served in France during the second World War was one of those whose lives was interrupted by the peace time draft before the USA entered World War II.
And though there's no Frankie and Annette here, this one DOES have Ruth Buzzi, Lyle Waggoner (as "Chief Boyardie" - excuse me, just got up off the floor from laughing so hard), Terry Kiser (years before dying on the beach in "Weekend at Bernie's") and Carol Wayne, Johnny Carson's Tea Time Movie Lady (ROWWWRRR!).
My favorite part is the Buzz Cola advertising jingle, which you hear at the very beginning before the film actually starts.
Well, let's break it down: If you were born before 1950 and remember who MacCarthy (ventriloquist dummy included) was, no!
I had read DEATH ON THE NILE (probably Christie's best novel, superior to the overrated MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS) before I saw the movie, so I was sure there would be no real suspense.
There are no characters introduced in the last minute and there are not vital clues that the detective discovers just before revealing the murderer.
The unstoppable Poirot has lots of sleuthing to do, taxing his little grey cells, before the unraveling of this particular whodunit with all the various plot twists expected of Agatha Christie in her murder mysteries.
Many of our friends who never saw it before have really enjoyed it.
In an era before DNA sampling, Poirot uses the narratively more interesting approach of involving suspects in conversation, and reading between the lines.
Assisted by David Niven, he must sleuth out the instigator of this interruption before all the ship's passengers end up dead.
Set in Egypt of the 70's, you can see the Sphinx before it was blasted by 30 more years of sand, bombs and fighting.
I was a Bette Davis fan before the film and when I saw it upon release I was introduced to so many other performers that I have this film to thank for that.
I don't like movies that take place long ago before the twentieth century.
before getting into the talk show circuit, you'll be pleasantly surprised to catch his performance in this late 80's jewel of a movie.
A fever dream of foul things this was started by one director, Patrick Yau, who shot five scenes before hitting a creative brick wall and then was finished by the producers Wai Ka-fai and Johnnie To who stumbled around trying to stitch it together.
It turns out that The Duke embezzled a few million dollars from the Mob, and now that Eddie has bailed him out of jail he needs to get his money before the Mob can locate and eliminate the Duke.
The Massacre was Griffith's last two-reeler before he moved onto features (which Judith of Bethulia could be counted as), and there are some good examples of how he is now adept at balancing out a longer story.
Perhaps most significant of all are the couple of brief family shots from the Indian village shortly before the first massacre, neatly echoing the scenes with the settler family.
Another shot, not as effective but nevertheless remarkable, is of a wolf being frightened off by a bear, just before the Indians attack.
Well, I already knew about the shameless advertising this movie is guilty of before going into it.
And even more funny was the fact that Mr. Parker had to give no less than 3 hints to John Brascoe before he could guess who placed the hit-contract on his head.
I had just gotten together with my friends from high school a few days before watching the film and so the themes hit me and resonated.
I have never written up a review before, but after seeing this movie I feel like I have to.
Thus our adventure begins, with director Cole cleverly echoing Hal Ashby's 'The Last Detail' in which Quaid takes on the Nicholson role of guiding his young charge in the last moments before an inevitable fate is to befall him.
Because this film basically tells us that the world is going to end before then.
In this film, however, power from solar, Hydrogen, and wind sources are all dismissed out of hand as impracticable alternatives and cannot, or will not, be developed before we all suddenly starve, freeze, run amok, or whatever they suggest is going to happen in twenty years when oil reserves are suddenly depleted.
Addictions of any kind can result in catastrophe when the supply falls short or the costs rise beyond reach before curing the addiction.
Never before have I been afraid that I am too young, and might live to experience the crisis outlined in this film.
The fact remains that long before it happens the market will force a new solution by necessity and until then its no use stressing out about it.
Those whom the documentary "A Crude Awakening" fails to awaken now, to the fast approaching consequences of peaked oil depletion, at a time of unprecedented, and ever growing demand, just may not be awakeable, or won't likely wake up before it's too late.
The thin thread that "A Crude Awakening" seems to hang its optimism on is the assumption that if enough people become fully aware of this totally unavoidable event sooner, rather than later, then human ingenuity, combined with a level of human cooperation the world has never before seen, might possibly attenuate the consequences for at least some of those who awaken.
This is a stunning film that covers the oil question in a way never viewed before.
And these are the reasons why.... And we've ignored all the symptoms...... And all the indicators...... And now with the best will in the world we will probably still have a huge decline, before things can get better, if they ever will......
Since this movie was barely released in the U.S., you may want to track down a copy of it before it disappears completely.
Gelpke has a background in anthropology, economics before working as a news/war reporter and then becoming involved in scientific film-making.
And divorce they do, but before their divorce is finalized, they have to wait-out a 90-day grace period, and therein lies the magic of the story.
He is faced with what is truly important to him and must stand his ground now like he never could before.
Dunne, following this romance in the social columns, shows up at the home of Lamont's parents as Grant's drunken younger sister - and proceeds to demolish his engagement before his shocked fiancÃ© and her parents.
An older friend introduced me to "The Awful Truth" in the days before VCRs.
I'd never seen it before.
What one has to remember, I guess, is that none of this nonsense had ever been attempted, seen or done on a screen before and it must have seemed terribly daring and innovative, thanks to the complicity and high spirits of a perfect cast, including Gee-shucks cowboy Ralph Bellamy, irrepressible faux-French charmer Alexander D'Arcy and worldly aunt Patsy (Cecil Cunningham).
See this version before the US cranks out the 3rd generation wannabe.
This is a movie about some german music person that I had never heard of before.
It was also the time before a VCR would be found in every home.
I actually owned this on video for three years before watching it.
I have nothing against 'Cosmopolitan', but before starting work on a project like this you must decide if you wants to create a "How Compatible Are You?"
Both are mature and confident, but they're leery of jumping into a relationship, but it never lingers on past baggage, and nobody needs to "get free" of some obstacle before they can continue.
While the plot twists were good (again, that's the screenplay, not him), and the action was very well done, I couldn't help and think that I had seen it all before in other films.
another part i didn't like was the subtle clue to who was involved in the plot(quaids partner or whoever.dude from party of 5) because it made me automatically point out that he was involved nearly an hour and a half before he was actually implicated.
I've never heard the sound of a cinema audience's collective eyes rolling before.
If you've seen any movie like this before (and don't let the concept of the film throw you, it is just another political thriller like the Bourne movies) you can pretty much figure out what's going to happen before it does or won't be surprised at anything that happens.
The fact that the film conveniently decides to start over right before a plot twist is revealed just tells me that it didn't have much of a plot to begin with, along with the fact that a rather large twist regarding the president is revealed IN EVERY SINGLE TRAILER FOR THE FILM.
Little is shown of the country, stressing the fact that people who come there to adopt a child have neither the time Â nor the inclination Â to see any of it Â the aim is to finish the incredible amount of bureaucracy Â and get out before someone else demands some "service charge" Both the acting as well as the direction is excellent.
We are teased with answers and made to sit through a new character's account that holds 75% old information with only 25% new before we are actually given what we should have received twenty minutes ago.
Just another clichÃ© that has been done before.
I don't think I've even seen him run before so this was a little different for him.
The film stops and rewinds back to 20 minutes before the event for each character.
This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.
This is one of those movies in which I would have LOVED to have sat with a paying audience as they watched this thing unfold before them when it first came out.
When the mad scientist abruptly dies, Shanks carries out his work, using the dead doctor's own body... and before long, more bodies begin stacking up.
I had never seen (or heard of) this flick before last night, when it aired on TCM.
It isn't long before he feels confident enough to take his new puppet on a stroll into the streets outside, and this is the start of an escalation of events that you really need to watch to get the full enjoyment out of.
If I have any criticism, it would be that Castle - as he has often done before - stays shy of making the film as truly horrific as it could have been.
William Castle is an oddity among horror directors in that he always puts on the brakes before his subject matter goes to deep into unpleasant territory, whereas others would gleefully revel in the more gruesome aspects of a story like this, Castle seems to prefer to keep things suitable for family viewing!
Plus, the movie even ends with a tacked on "it's only make-believe" epilogue that completely squashes the very dark ending of the real story...it's something he has done before, and it seems a shame that the films of William Castle are often sabotaged from being truly horror by the directors very own sensibilities.
In fact, call me crazy, but I will bet that Burton has seen this film before and was possibly inspired by it while making his own film.
This short can be found on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Volume 1 before the film "The Skydivers" (episode 125)   Normal short grade: D   MST grade: A+
Oh my god what rubbish some people say about some crap films  The film is a remake of ANGELS WITH A DIRTY FACES and is so bad it makes you cringe  Srk plays a Bachchan type of goon role and tries hard but his weird voice and his utterances at every sentence gets to the nerves  The goons to even the cop are cartoons  The film shows RAM JAANE as a big hero praised by Bhasti Vale Like Bachchan in AGNEEPATH, SARKAR  Rajiv Verma direction is bad Music is okay  SRK as said before tries hard but his weird voice and also expressions at places are a give away Juhi is okay Vivek Mushran is okay the rest ham even the talented Pankuj Kapoor
The women that I know would not respond to a "kidnapped at the last second before earth was destroyed" situation by doing it as much as they did.
Courageous legendary sailor Sinbad (a solid and likable performance by Patrick Wayne) embarks on a dangerous journey to the chilly Artic in order to reverse the spell before it's too late.
It was one of those movies local channels threw on Sunday afternoon before or after a televised ball game..or when a ball game was rained out.
), the pre-teen tingles of watching a handsome Wayne, young Seymour and/or Power (...ya know...before having breast implants and weighing 95 pounds was mandatory in Hollywood for women to do this kind of film work?!?)
The entire expedition, along with Young-ju's family had a party that night before returning.
A depressed Young-ju skipped classes, and her English teacher had to look for her before the second last day of class, prompting her to return to class.
Victoria gave one last glance at her family, before leaving for the car.
This review may contain slight spoilers, but if you've seen a romantic comedy before, you'll know the outset.
Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...  You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.
It was quite awhile before I realized the same actor who played Major Mitchell in 'ID4' is the same actor who played Jayne in 'Serenity'.
He is supposed to be cutting firewood to make money, but he can't seem to cut more than 1 or 2 pieces daily before succumbing to an all-afternoon nap.
And, sometimes, it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.
I would advise you to take some kind of Prozac before not to be too much overwhelmed by the silly situations this film develops with gusto and vicious pleasure.
But someone or something on the ship is killing them, but still they find enough time to "procreate" before facing the problems at hand, and figuring out just what is happening.
Basically college professor Miranda Hollander (Helena Mattsson) lives her life like any other normal woman, before suffering a mysterious blackout, and without her knowledge, transforming into a hideous alien creature.
But this movie reminded me of the good old days, when I used to read "Dragonball" the Manga - before the same manga became overly stupid and boring and went too far with the whole "there's always a stronger enemy" thing.
I think that this great movie would have found a much bigger audience if Miramax, the US distributor of Chow's previous film, "Shaolin Soccer," hadn't so utterly botched that film's US release, showing it heavily cut in only a couple of theatres before dumping it unceremoniously onto video.
But at the ending part, he looks the same age with before, trying to sell some "more powerful" kung fu manuals.
my friendly neighbourhood video store manager recommended this film to me and so i rented it, since he's never steered me wrong before.
if you've never seen a Chinese action film before, and are used to Jackie Chan films, you may not know what to make of this film.
Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different, the overall result is hilarious.
We see in this film that Watkins personally reads fan mail and signs copies of every album sent to him (before sending them back), and that he's not above meeting new faces and friends on the street.
Like I said before it doesn't leave you breathless a.k.a Satya.
It was also sort of fun to see a young Bruce Davison, before he received real fame in the late '90's/00's.
He was recalled to the US and was due to go home imminently and had already been stripped of his executive powers but Patton's enemies could well have thought that they needed to get their pay-back time in quickly before he did get back to the US and start to interfere with their plans against post-war Germany because of his high-status in the US despite their incessant campaigns to undermine his credibility.
While almost impossible to believe, the first man then realizes that the election is being held and he forgot to vote--and runs to the polls before they close.
But it is intelligently done and contains enough twists to help you forget that (yes) it's been done before.
Strange that they don't flesh out the other racers before the start though.
Hidalgo has also given me a love for horses more than I had before.
You won't find him standing on his hind legs and doing the hokey-pokey, but his talents are very evident and he becomes a hero that we all love before the end of the movie.
This is not a fast-paced film; rather, think of it as story unfolding before your eyes, so sit back and enjoy the ride.
Reno boasts about his foresight in having found the cave a month before the robbery.
Four weeks or thereabouts elapse before Jay recuperates sufficiently to hit the trail after Max, and it takes our determined protagonist around a year to locate the double-crossing dastard.
Frost then led the parachute drop on Sicily and a further raid in Italy before his wartime career finished at Arnhem.
It contains all the old cliches like dying soldiers making a speech just before they draw their last breath and as soon as someone is tasked to do something dangerous they`ll do it in a completely blase manner then die in a blackly comical famous last words scene .There`s some corny dialogue from the American characters like " Holy cow , check out those crazy beefeaters " while the Brits are all stiff upper lipped .
You will notice a very young and green Matt Leblanc in a roll years before "Friends".
Brooke's fellow dealer and lover George Bynum, Josef Sommer, was found murdered the night before and he was a patient of Dr. Sam Rice, Roy Scheider, his psychiatrist who she went to see to give him a watch that George left in her apartment.
At first, being only 22, I was weary about renting it because it was released before I was even born, and thought that the movie could possibly be out-dated.
It was around the beginning of Meryl as Goddess - this was her 10th film and before "Sophie's Choice."
Remember, this is years before China became the more easily penetrable capitalist machine it is today.
His epitome of bliss is drinking a cold cup of coffee left from the night before, without finding a cockroach in it.
I'm sure I will see it a dozen or more times before I die.
I think I've had that conversation before.
The dynamics between Wallace and Andre have existed before between myself and friends with whom I have argued.
I've finally found the DVD and I'm really glad to see M.McDowell in a so different role before the legendary performance in Clockwork Orange.
Worse, while he dumped the woman's body back on the train before it left, Mike Bennett (Dale Belding), a kid who likes to get away from his mother and have adventures, saw him Even worse, after Dunlap gets picked up while hitchhiking and realizes he can't leave the area because of the flooding, the friendly driver lets him off at the only place to stay in town, a boarding house.
It's not long before Mike starts to figure things out.
It came after his breakthrough film IF, and before the films most people recall he starred in: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and O LUCKY MAN.
we decided to read some reviews before posting our own and by the looks of things most people feel the same way as we do!
I never read about it before, but after watching it yesterday night with a friend, i couldn't stop thinking about the whole plot, the ending, the dialogs, all the words and actions in the movie.
This movie was the first German movie that i had ever seen but i must say, that it was worth the $8.50 i paid for my ticket.I have only studied German for 3 years and i thought that i should try and see at least 1 German movie before i travel to Germany in December.The German wasn't very difficult to understand it was just some of the slang that tripped me up a bit.Some of my friends said that it was definitely the best German movie that they had ever seen.the educators was well worth going to and praise must go to the wonderful actors/actresses especially Daniel bruhl.after seeing this movie i cant wait to see any new movies with Daniel bruhl.this movie is definitely worth seeing and i now know how good German movies really are.
Having read all the comments before I would just like to reinforce that the film is about innocence and idealism.
As I watch Charles Russell in the lead role, I get the nagging feeling that I've seen him before, but I know I haven't.
For me, the best part of the film was watching the relationships build between all 4 of the main characters, both before and after the kidnapping.
I can also assure you that in real life, the attempt to take the child out of the home by social services would have occurred long before the child ever reached her fifth birthday.
And it gets worse before it gets better.
The story is sort of a clichÃ©'d one and has been done before, though not as well.
I would suggest the authors of this 'documentary' to get into some books (or Wikipedia at the very least) and have some read about Thai culture and history before putting 'farangs' anywhere near the center of the issue.
Like others have pointed out here the director obviously had nothing together before shooting this poor film except average camera and editing skills and his prejudice and stereotypical view of the issue and what he would get together.
I had never heard of it before and as there were no big names in it I was tempted to watch Seinfeld reruns instead.
It was great to watch in a lot of ways .. the music was great and, as a longtime admirer of the music, I heard a lot of songs in the film that I would like to own if I could figure out their names, the scenery was kind of cool and made me wonder if the German director (who had never met Cale before he made the film) had also never been through the American southwest.
You move your Heroes around, collecting, engaging in combat and gaining XP for themselves, experience points, to improve their skills, most literally represented in the four main ones, Attack, Defend, Power and Knowledge, the latter 2 translating into how strong the spells(which you of course have to find, learn or trade between them) you cast are, and how many of them you can use before recharging them, respectively.
Heroes is probably the first game which contains a system in strategy you might not have seen before.
This is the Old (not the New) Testament as it might be imagined by impoverished black children in the Mississippi Delta before their world had electricity, running water, radio, or the opportunity of anything beyond the most elementary education.
I have seen this film many times over the years,each time there seems a new message or sight I had missed, before.
The acting is delightful--- it is set in the country, and the actors (who may never have been out of the city, before!)
This especially goes for Granny, who I used to admire before this show.
As a Brit, I find it tiring, even insulting, to see and hear notions of the UK, England in particular, reduced to the level of Dick van Dyke's pseudo-cockney, with the action running in upper-class environments that may have flourished before P G Wodehouse moved to the USA in the 1920s or in Agatha Christie's 1930s heyday, but which had virtually disappeared by the 1950s, not to mention the 1970s.
Honor Blackman is a bonus as she is a great performer and she was already known as Pussy Galore before this.
More common sense was apparently needed before the airing of the show.
I think what did it for me in this movie was the fact that before this movie, Freddy could only come to you in your dreams and that was it.
Its only too long before Freddy begins yet another reign of terror.
And before Jesse had gone to a leather bar and had been literally kidnapped by the gay sports teacher and it is then later in the showers that Freddy again will kill this openly gay character from within the body of Jesse.
Plot = 5 years after the events of the first movie, a new teen and his family move into the same house where the events occurred and before long Jesse starts getting haunted by Freddy but this time Freddy wants something else other than blood.
I've rated this movie before and gave it a five and a pretty bad review but after viewing this movie a few more times I actually quite enjoyed it, OK it's not the best in the franchise, but it's still good and that's why I deleted my old review and started afresh.
At first I got the feeling that I had seen all of this before and I hate that.
This movie that played before me was the best movie of this genre made by an indian in india.
Somehow Nimitz is taken back to 1941, just before Pearl Harbour battle.
Once it started it must occur as before.
Sorry if this has been discussed before, I did look.
But it all paled in comparison to the story and the history of those days just before the attack.
The moral, and ethical dilemmas facing a captain of the most powerful destructive force in 1941 just hours before the sneak attack.
An aircraft carrier, (in an unconvincingly contrived way), goes back in time to the day just before the Pearl Harbour attack and does.... Er very little really?
The story begins with a freak storm transporting a modern American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier back to 1941, just before the Japanese fleet bombed Pearl Harbour.
What if a modern day aircraft carrier was somehow transported back in time to the day before the Pearl Harbor attack?
I saw this film before I joined the Navy and again before I served on Nimitz (CVN 68).
Modern aircraft carrier encounters bizarre storm and finds itself between the Japanese fleet and Pearl Harbor a day before the infamous attack.
I saw the film when it came out in wide-screen format and saw it several times before it left town.
This was a highly entertaining sleeper about a naval ship that happens to go through a time warp and end up at Pearl Harbor just hours before the attack in 1941.
The story (if you really want to know it before you watch it, read it here somewhere on the IMDb page) has been done before, so you might be used to see better movies, than this one on this particular topic ...
There were some scenes that I could have done without, particularly in the last 30 minutes of the movie, but overall I could watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon, before Goonies and after The Toy.
Look at her career before this movie, and you will see like 6 jobs in 5 years in movies.
For the longest time, the characters just develop before our eyes.
(Hollywood either glamorizes it, uses it as an opportunity to add gratuitous sex before switching to the gratuitous violence.)
It's nothing we haven't really seen before, and nothing we haven't seen done better (e.g., Leaving Las Vegas).
First off i'd like to clarify that this is in no way a horror film, but purely a comedy for sick puerile freaks... hehehe :D  It only took me about 10 minutes to realize it was a stupid ass movie, and I have a rule where if its revealed to be total worthless trash before its a quarter done, then i just stop it and move on to something else, but in this case, it actually WAS somewhat amusing and at a running time of only 80 minutes i figured "why not" It may be low budget, but it shines through as your typical drunken party movie.
John Waters used to make movies like this, before he succumbed to the Hollywood dollar(s), but it's few and far between since then.
It's like they have been through it all before.
Singer James Taylor, Beach Boys-Drummer Dennis Wilson and the wonderful Warren Oates (who was Tommy Lee Jones before Tommy Lee Jones) race and pine through the American vastness in search of, well, that's anybody's guess.
Which is all the same, since Hellman has already made it, and with the Criterion release the road-dreamers of this and the last century can cherish it, before they get into their 55 Chevy to head out again.
Its nothing we haven't seen before and its told rather blandly.
Hey, Quikstraw ... done u thin u better find ol Snagglepuss before u go kabonggin all over dee place?
Also they could have added what I thought was a key point from the book, when her Grandpa Will is mad when he is watching the news before the dinner.
We've seen it all before.
Korean martial arts fantasy about a vagabond demon killer, who is actually a wanted royal demon killer, who is drugged by a village and flees before he can get caught and turned over to soldiers for the reward.
There are some nice CGI filled fight scenes but as I said before there is not as much as action as in Shadowless Sword.
Not so; it is a hopeful story which Kristen Bell, (as Gracie) must care for her half- brothers and sisters (they are all illegitimate) before she even graduates high school.
I really disliked her as an actress before I saw this and I thought she was only capable of repeating her Veronica Mars persona (a show I utterly despise).
When a movie like this comes out and does something that hasn't been done before (in this case, mixing live-action and animation to tell a story with talking and ninja-fighting animals), it makes a big splash.
This movie foretold the downside of the "reality TV" craze twenty years before it happened.
Marnie Cromwell had to save her family before it was too late and she did.
If they could travel through time, why not stop Kalabar before all of this every happened?
"Oh, on the RIGHT," says a resigned Flynn, who has heard this hundreds of times before.
Viveca Lindfors plays a generous Queen who fights for peace and works for the welfare of her people... She is brave enough before an impertinent traitor who dreams to be a future king... She is a passionate young woman before Don Juan, her eventual true love...  Robert Douglas played a stupendous villain in many adventure films, crossing swords with great stars (Burt Lancaster, Cornel Wilde and Robert Taylor).
Please, I'm not completely disregarding his acting ability, because he did in fact make some pretty good movies before this one.
at a door seconds before he dives over a hedge onto the "grass".
I'm so glad that Sharon got the opportunity to do both this and "12 + 1" before her life was taken.
Revealing a naturally funny comic ability, Sharon is an adorable doll, clad in unbecoming clothes and non-flattering eye glasses, before revealing the legendary Tate beauty in the memorable final scene.
It's incredibly sad to think that this would be Tate's last role before her brutal murder.
The film opens with four women waking up in a room, they have no memory of their lives before nor do they know where they are.
Earth spirits defending themselves by literally reaching out and attacking humans has been a left wing wet dream for a long time and it was only a matter of time before it hit the movie screen.
Should the Jews not be begrudged their past simply because its been "done before"?
The drilling team headed by man in charge Ed Pollack, Ron Perlman, expects to finish its job before the spring thaw sets in but things don't go exactly as they expected.
It's then that Pollack, and what's left of his crew, tries to make his way back to Anchorage, or civilization, before he and everyone else with him ends up dead!
Firstly it was about an hour into the movie before anything happened and when it did it wasn't scary.
Just before you'd walk out of the cinema or fall asleep in your chair somebody finally gets killed (couldn't tell you who, despite all that build up), then they go mad/off themselves/get killed/whatever in quick succession.
We have seen that kind of setting before, in "The Thing" and a dozen other movies where a crew is isolated in a strange place where weird things start to happen.
You just get some themes thrown in that never were mentioned before (so what are the childhood pictures supposed to mean and why was the strange box introduced into the plot heavily in the beginning to be dropped off in the end) plus a totally open and disappointing ending that I had the impression to have seen more than once before.
Princess Flavia's memories of Rudolph's dreadful behavior toward her years before vanish.
One man must swim the moat, scale the castle to Antoinette's room, and reach the dungeon before the guards can murder the king.
You also don't get scripts better than this, the Granger version essentially used the same script so that as it ran I was quoting dialog and making my dad go "I thought you never saw this before".
Someone told before that during WW2 6 million Jews died.
I was not far from turning my computer off before the end of the film.
Hope was born a poor preachers son who worked his way up to being an unsuccessful lawyer before he failed at writing.
The story is simple, and has been done many times before, but never with such elan; drugged monarch-to-be must be impersonated by look-alike for coronation, lest kingdom fall into hands of evil half-brother.
If anyone wants to see an excellent movie made before the banner cinematic year of 1939, this would be a film to watch.
It shows us the creative work that could be done at the time, by hugely talented artists, long before the advent of zoom lenses and computer graphics.
In fact, they're to awful, perhaps they do deserve each other before they ruin their families any more than they would.
Story is about a couple that have been dating for a few years but decide that they should break up and after spending some time apart it doesn't take long before they start calling each other and getting together for great sex.
Personally, I rented this movie because Russell Crowe starred in it before he got huge.
Let me recap what you are likely to see on most any episode you watch (please, don't eat before viewing)...
My younger sons were swept into it, although it is quite unlike any film they had seen before.
the whole movie is populated with people you've seen before and will probably see again.
people whose names you don't know but are sure you have seen their faces before.
I do understand that this also is an important part of Madonna's life, but some of the footage you get to see is so hard and depressing that it leaves more impact then the 100 minutes before.
Those who were expecting something more playful like her other documentary projects, they will be disappointed, but shouldn't be surprised because it is nothing like anything you have seen from Madonna before.
This was like nothing i've ever seen before.
When they get to the house, or even before that with the watermelon salesman, there's some inklings of trouble.
It occurred to me a day after I watched this movie that I had seen a film by Nobuhiko Obayashi before, the campy kaleidoscopic "Sada"(a true story about a woman who castrated her lover and became an overnight celebrity in WW2), and though that is a mere hint of the full on onslaught of this movie, it makes me want to see more.
Having read no reviews of the film before seeing it, I expected a pure Horror film, but it turned out to be an incomparably bizarre and experimental Horror-parody, with a delightfully macabre and grotesque humor rather than scares.
I had never heard of Nobuhiko Obayashi before (the director) and in looking at his list of films I've never heard of any of them either...I confess that after seeing "Hausu" I'm interested in finding more by him & hope it's as entertaining as this.
Suffice it to say you have never seen a film like this before -- part satire, part camp, part coming-of-age story, merged with horror that is truly disturbing.
Hal Needham's picture was the first to use the outtakes in the end credits but sometimes its difficult to distinguish a blooper from the craziness that had gone before.
So everyone one is at the hotel having a party the night before the race starts.
JJ tells Victor that they need a doctor to ride in the ambulance so right before the race starts Victor finds Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing but JJ doesn't want to know where in found this doctor.
Jackie Chan in his early days before many knew who or even what he was....talented.
Secondly the movies do give u a much better understanding of the characters and scenario and are worth checking out before you watch the series.
I just love the scene where he puts his lathi (staff) into the bullet wound of one of the villain's son and then twists it before taking it out.
Presumably there was a learning curve before the company attained its peak of vulgarity.
I've never seen any of the cast before so wasn't sure what to expect but they were all so good.
Parker Stevenson is his young protÃ©gÃ© who is in the film JUST enough, Anne Archer his perfect lady, and Kathleen Quinlin is a young girl, supposedly a teenager, who represents the last of Elliot's 'conquests' before settling down with Anne, who is his age.
If it wasn't haunted before it sure gets haunted after Blondell is murdered by mistake because the killer is after Landis.
He sees dead people all the time, way before it became quite so fashionable in The Sixth Sense.
However, as he's dying, he tries to change this provision, but dies before he can do it.
During the actual book (and the drama as still presented in Branson today) the unknown "specter" character appears throughout, is shot, and dies, but before passing, is discovered to be the Shepherd's lost son, and there is a heartfelt resolution of matters towards the end.
But, Eklavya manufactures irrelevant events before this question is placed to be answered in one swift action (stunt, if you like).
Eklavaya character, in absence of any development, emerges as puerile- an immature guard who acts only on instinct and remains oblivious to the truth before it is thrown at his face.. Saif remains wooden and leaves the audiences to wake up in between and decide what his character is up to.
The story revolves around a family,that is hiding secrets that once revealed,might have deadly consequences upon them.It is inspired by some of Shakespeare's works and it echoes throughout the film.It's about one aging guard(Bachchan),named Eklavya; who has served for the family all his life.Many generations of his family has served before him and he must continue to do so,carry on their legacy.The family of the Kindom of Devigarh itself has mysteries that keeps echoing throughout the film.Eklavya has sworn to protect the family no matter what.He also protects some of the secrets that can never be spread throughout the Kindom.Until,one night,the Queen of the Kindom dies,besides her is her mourning husband.This starts the doubts and accusations within the family.The Queen's Son,Prince Harshwardhan(Khan) arrives to take responsibility of the family.But there are other things going on in the palace.Slowly,one mystery after another pops up and secrets are revealed,and as the story progresses we see more and more people dying because of the secrets.Putting Eklavya into a painful position and come to terms with the happenings and the truths about this family's dark history.
John Wayne is Matt Matthews whose father left his mother before she was born and she died leaving him to be raised by his aunt Beulah Bondi.
I am quite mixed in my reaction to this movie - mainly because of the baggage that the director's name carries when it comes up on screen before the feature starts.
After all, this is the man who gave us Kareeb , and before that 1942: A Love Story, and before that Parinda , and before that Khamosh!
Like those other films he still has his cutting knife as sharp as it was before.
The best scene of the whole film was when Eklavya was blindfolded and threw his knife at a flying dove with a bell tied to its foot and managed to cut off the bell without hurting the dove, later he caught the bell before it fell into the water.
before, they act completely different.
Undeterred, Eklavya builds a clay effigy of Dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it.
Some of the scenes are exceptional; when Daniel Howitt is cashing a never seen before cheque, when Granny Becky has her eyes uncovered after an operation, when Young Matt talks about how love is so complicated, when Daniel Howitt takes possession of the old house in Moaning Meadow, when Aunt Mollie cremates her dead son and herself, when Pete the mute brother is discovered in a stream of light pouring through a window trying to catch dust motes.
I rated this movie on the portion I watched--I turned this off before it was over.
I menioned my income level before, and don't think that I am high or whatever and what I say don't make sense.
I could not believe the bad luck they were having trying to get this party going, and I guessed the gag long before it was revealed.
Although I practically live on IMDb, I've never written a review before.
I'm wondering if some of these reviewers stopped watching before the end.
Miss Field is lovely in a non-conventional way; she shines as never before or since.
The relationships before she met Bo were as heartbreaking in the movie as in the book.
The idea of a killer coming when you call him is very interesting because it is different from what we have seen before.
Indeed, the "Candyman" and "Bloody Mary" legends do share some common ground, in that if you chant their names before a mirror "x" number of times, they'll appear behind you and hack you to pieces.
If you're looking for a serious horror (before Scream's imitators made a mockery of the slasher sub-genre), I highly recommend this provocative slasher that doesn't cop out the audience.
Heston passed away the day before I sat watching this film for the first time for 25 years.
There was a period in the early 70's where producers could show blood and breasts, and enjoyed the heck out of it for a few years before the MPAA clamped down.
Both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on TV -- a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local TV station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old Dark Age before CABLE TV and the videocassette revolution, its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer.
HEAR: Chuck crack wise as a prisoner of the Luddite zombies, just before he's burnt at the stake!
Yes, the survival film in a confined space has been done before.
The standout may be Dennis Quaid as Gabe, an assured performance from an actor who has not shown this much introspection on screen before.
The film studies all of the possible interrelationships: the men, the women, the opposite gender spouses and the couples, before and during the breakup, and hints at the probable situation afterward.
The positive reviews all came before the movie opened.
You never realize that many years have passed before Abel and Zaphia are divorced, but it only takes one scene for the movie to do it.
Here, he hoped, he would demonstrate his abilities as a straight actor as never before.
He is a totally unlikeable Victorian pompous ass who happens to have no sense of humor (which is Soames' character, before his marriage problems) who likes to collect things.
But, this little film, made about 10 years before his demise shows he was indeed, an actor and not merely a star.
As has been mentioned before, Maury Chaykin fits the description  of the part but is less than commanding even as Timothy Hutton is  fine.
Perhaps Thayer David was the best Nero but he did only one  installment before his untimely death (Perhaps a result of the  previously mentioned physical requirements for the part.).
I was about a third of the way in before it started to click with me.
Archie seems very much to enjoy manipulating the hapless participants in the mystery, as though escorting guests out the door before they are ready is wicked fun.
"Chinese Monkeys can ride clouds" White states at the beginning of the film, referencing certain aspects of China's mythic "Journey To The West", before they begin their matrix leaps/gliding across the city.
Bernard Cornwell, realizing he was sitting on a gold mine, has milked Sharpe's adventures, adding battles before, after, and in between those of the original set of books.
where have i heard that before!!!!
Someone here coined before me: this is like a superhero movie for objects.
The whole question about how and why the room came to be and who the Occupant was before whatever happened happened was just left to float away as though no one would really care anyway.
People, especially detectives, are curious and I'm sure that if confronted with something this bizarre, they'd be asking questions for hours (and not get up and leave before the omelets even arrive).
When you think you have caught all the clues watch it again because you will see many more that you didn't see before.
This plot has been playing out for many years before his involvement and has a "culture" of its own.
When this comes out of DVD, rent it, or, if you're lucky, run to the theater and catch this before it disappears.
In real life, Dakota has her own horse named Goldie, so she was already used to being around horses before she started filming this movie.
Nursing the horse back to health had actually brought the family closer together, and that in itself makes this film quite clichÃ© in its many "been-there-done-that" before moments to touch.
It's a movie for all ages, and if it comes out on DVD before Christmas, it'll make a wonderful gift.
If you have any ability to follow how these types of movies go, then you will know the outcome long before it happens... it doesn't matter because you'll be wanting that outcome and you'll embrace it when it happens!!!
Veronica Hamel(before hitting it big as "Hill Street Blues" character, Joyce Davenport) as parole officer, Linda Maxwell.
CANNONBALL (2 outta 5 stars) Pretty dreary low budget car chase movie starring David Carradine and directed by Paul Bartel who teamed up for the classic "Death Race 2000" the year before.
Personally I haven't seen that movie yet, but I liked "Hombres complicados", the movie that he made before "Everybody Famous", a lot.
When it exploded onto screens in the mid 1980's, OscarÂ® nominated director  Dominique Deruddere's film CRAZY LOVE divided critics and audiences as few  films before or since.
If you willingly watch one, and don't get it, before firing up low votes and negative comments, please consider the possibility that, well, yes, maybe something was "lost in translation".. and it might not just be the lines, but also the tone, accents, gestures, dressing codes, cultural, social and historical background... For example, the attitude of the two girls, hanging around with two guys and hoping they will get food for free, might sound unlikely in a "Sex and the city" episode, but looks perfectly natural in the Rome of the seventies.
On a special note don't listen to these hard to please reviewers waiting on something to hate, they already have dislike on their mind before they even watch the film.........................For Shame.
In a lot of ways, this film reminds me of "El Topo" -- a movie that is disguised as a genre effort (El Topo being a Western, this being a samurai swordfighting film) that uses the basic genre outlines but explores topics deeper than have ever been covered in the genre before...
But before you start thinking Izo is just filmed literature, Miike ties all this together with an insane bloody body count.
Hwa Young had asked her son to return home before she did, in order to stage a comeback into the royal family where she was banished from 14 years ago after the death of her husband.
Sick and dying Jesse want's to finally get to the bottom of what happened back then and make it public before he dies and tries to get as much information from the soldiers airmen and civilians who were there and knows what happened but have been too afraid to talk about it all these years.
Jesse was made out to look like a fool and incompetent with him having to stand before newsmen and news photographers looking like a jerk holding pieces of a weather balloon and making it look like he didn't know the difference between that and an alien spaceship.
If you are LDS have at this movie, otherwise seriously consider yourself before being taken in by a propoganda film such as this.
According to his church elders he must first finish his missionary role before he can marry his true love.
I usually read the reviews of the users here on IMDb before I watch a movie.I have come to rely on this site for renting and watching films.When I saw the title of this film "The other side of heaven" I felt that the title was somewhat inspiring.After 5 minutes from the actual beginning, I kind of knew what direction it was heading.I still wanted to watch it though.I'm Christian Orthodox, but this has nothing to do with this film or with me thinking to better watch a sample from a movie after reading a review next time.
In this respect, Epstein and Friedman should be largely commended for bringing this subject to the attention of the world, and telling these powerful personal stories before the last survivors die.
We ARE interested in the experiences and emotions of these particular people, to see them and hear them, before they are swallowed by the inexorable march of time.
As was mentioned before, several scenes in this film were just re-enactments of scenes from previous cannibal films.
When I first found this film at my local video store I thought it must have been a retitled version of one of the Lenzi or Deodato cannibal films as I had never heard of it before.
Another great scene is when the mermaid identifies her sea name before choosing Madison.
Here's your chance to see Tom Hanks at the beginning of his career before he became a favourite with the Oscar crowd.
From 1984, this is Ron Howard's romantic comedy inspired by the beloved children's fairy tale The Little Mermaid, even before the beloved Disney film took hold of everyone's notion of mermaid-and-male romance.
It stars a young Tom Hanks, before his success as an actor, at a time when he was doing mostly comedy.
You notice something about the movie that you never noticed before every time you watch it.
I have been vocal before about not trying to take IMDb ratings to heart, but 6.2 is too low for this movie.
Naturally, she has waited until he is adult before taking her pursuit onto dry land, but the implication is self-evident.
Joan was a ditsy, goofy character long before she made it to television.
Sad that Joan Davis was never able to develop another television show to show her talent before she died.
Comedy-drama from talented if erratic director Martha Coolidge concerns a modern Italian-American working woman in Brooklyn, pregnant and unmarried, finding herself curious about the mother who abandoned her and her father years before.
Long before Tony Hawk reached the pinnacle of skateboarding prominence to become synonymous with the sport, there was Mark "Gator" Rogowski.
They, and others like them, were at work in an era before the Gravity and X-Games were established, eventually becoming permanent TV offerings.
I was out of skating and SoCal before Gator's downfall and never heard about it.
The cartoon, in only 8 minutes, makes the viewer think about his/her own life and suggests that you think about big decisions in your life before making them.
I have seen other Weir movies before, and understand that his pacing is really slow and doesn't follow conventional plots, but this movie was very unappealing.
Well, it's best perhaps if you know as little about it before as possible, but on the other hand, it's a bit cryptic, and Peter Weir isn't exactly forthcoming with explanatory exposition--the film remains very open to interpretation to the end--so maybe a vague description won't hurt.
As our lead characters go out of control, they present you with the uncontrollable dynamics of post-Yugoslav reality, that were beyond the point of no return before most realized.
We see a large, black balloon, with tether ropes hanging down, descend on a beach where Mateo, his wife and children are playing years before.
It is completely unique - like nothing I have ever seen before.
I had seen this movie announced on my cable a couple of times before.
I know I'd not be happy if I had to drag someone around knowing she'd die before I.
The critics of this film need to stop and think before they make cruel comments.
So take this advice (although it might already be too late if you're reading this) and go see it for yourself, before exposing yourself to anything that could disenchant you!
All released before 1948, they give one a true sense of old-time cinema (especially with Bugs Bunny at the Oscars).
In keeping with the documentary, they all contained cartoons released before or during 1948 (e.g., "Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid", "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery", "Baby Bottleneck" and "Good Night, Elmer").
He goes before the "council" of SanFrancisco to be declared human.
He goes before the "world council", and on his and Portia's deathbeds, sees via TV that he is finally "human", then he dies, and Portia asks the nurse to "pull the plug."
Shelley Hack was a model before the show and added a scholarly feel to her character.
Ummm...haven't I seen this before?
They were called this because during a period before 1935 or so, the Hollywood Production Code either didn't exist or was pretty much ignored.
In this rather frank film before The Code, Menjou hasn't been getting any kanoodling from wife Dorothy Peterson who was injured in an automobile accident.
As this movie went along, I was observing his performance carefully because it appeared similar to something I've seen before; but I couldn't discover it.
But before you can crab the DVD-cassette to find out, something that seems like a social realistic story starts; or does it?
I generally don't give much regard to what others may say about a film before I've seen it.
It isn't long before hubby gets a phone call from Audrey's TWIN SISTER, and then a visit from her, and then a roll in the hay too.
Kevin Kline was also incredible with his portrayal of someone with a schizophrenic disorder before the time when that sort of thing was recognized.
Where she, as I said, neither invents or denies, intimates an authentic facet of human nature's intricacies, more normal and sexy in the early scenes before showing us who Sophie really is.
A word of warning, make sure you have your crying towel before you watch this excellent movie.
I already knew that Meryl Streep was a phenomenal actress even before watching what many consider her greatest performance as Sophie.
As much as I have studied and pondered the Holocaust, this film has connected me to those events more emotionally than I have ever been before.
It's like a before and after snapshot; Leon's pretty much 'compartmentalized' his life - Nikita's struggling to get a grip on hers...  Perhaps "Leon" represents the evolution of Besson's 'paternal' instinct; as he watches his own children grow.
I would also hold this film up as another example, along with John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy, of a film which depicted Native Americans as a noble race, victimized by the march of western civilization, long before the advent of films such as "Little Big Man" or "Dances With Wolves" The White Man is clearly the villain in this and the Ford films.
What caused the transformation from her being desperate and suicidal before to suddenly optimistic and strong in action after?
As others mentioned before in most parts of the movie the pacing is slow as it can get.
By contrast, she more than once breaks Howard's heart before anyone has a chance to break hers.
A surviving b/w reel-to-reel videotape of a 1958 (or 1959) BBC broadcast shows Ms. Holiday- beautiful, regal, but somewhat melancholy (with hair severely pulled back and in a glittering dress)- stylishly reciting with piano accompaniment for 3 minutes of what must be the earliest surviving videotape ever recorded-- and just a scant 5 months before her death.
Furlong sits in this room, watching monitors placed throughout the mansion and it's grounds, his voice barking orders and teases to the contestants, before and after they discover what happens once you are a loser.
The film's goal is obvious..a black comic parody on reality programming, and using the slasher template as a means to kill off these greedy partyers who enjoy the lavish location before terror descends upon them.
Having not heard anything about it before, I was surprised by how cool it was.
If you didn't think much about Chow Yun Fat before this movie, I can almost guarantee you will after seeing it.
Dabney Coleman plays a cop getting into his "short time" just before retirement.
Let me start out by repeating what has been stated before, it is very much Dabney Coleman who single handedly saves this film from mediocrity.
Deftly mixing action, humor, drama and a serious message about taking stock in one's life before it's to late, Short Time delivers.
First, he is soon to retire from police work, and understandably doesn't want to risk his neck and lose it just before he retires.
This would account for the bad acting and careless execution of a story that had been seen so many times before even when the film was began in 1967.
A fine "B" movie cast is wasted by using awful production values in a project that likely ran out of money before it was finished.
It's not like the Chinese actually present a list of demands, or anything, before they blow up the world...it takes a super secret "Mission Impossible" spy mission to discover that the machine exists.Chairman Mao was never about blowing Red China up...it was always his intent to simply steam roll over the West with numbers and the power of Marxism, and allow China (and Communism) to achieve its glorious (and inevitable, in Commie eyes) destiny.
The movie recovers some of its sanity for fifteen minutes or so when the crew's more admirable members show their willingness to sacrifice themselves to save the others, by leaving the craft in a spacewalk to fix a jammed device, seconds before the segment the two heroes were on was jettisoned.
Since we know the ending before the film starts, the pleasures lie in the quirky characters and situations that screenwriter Bo Goldman and a terrific cast have created.
And poor Robert Walker died before its release.
It's almost a perfect portrait of American families in the 50's, better (and before) than Nicholas Ray's "Rebel without a cause" and the consequences of generation affairs between father and sons, between the America coming out of a war and the new country that looks upon the future.
It's such a distinguished cast and crew, and they look as though they felt they were part of something important--the dark, somber lighting, slow pacing, and portentous music suggest Paramount's "A Place in the Sun" from the year before.
Long before she gained fame on Mary Tyle Moore and her own shows, she sang and danced in "Lil Abner"!
Lil Abner ran as a comic strip for over 20 years before being converted into a long running Broadway musical.
Any film that features Valerie Harper, Beth Howland, and Julie Newmar before they were stars ... plus Leslie Parrish (author Richard Bach's wife!)
I remember that before Snagglepuss got his own show he first guest starred on some other Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Quick Draw McGraw and Snooper and Blabber.
It was our last opportunity to see her act before her passing in Oct 1989.
The male leads are the incomparable William Powell (one year after "My Man Godfrey"), and Robert Montgomery (one year before "Night Must Fall").
It explains what happens between after Bambi's mother's death and before he grows up, and focuses on Bambi and his father, The Great Prince Of The Forest.
Overall, the rest of the cast make a very good work, considering they had to try to emulate the work done almost more than 60 years before.
What happened after Bambi met his father in that heavy snowfall and before the spring he shook owls tree scratching his antlers?
I am still a little confused by how many springs go by before the birth of the twin fawns.
I hope that you give Bambi 2 the chance to prove its quality before discarding it as another disappointing sequel.
You had The Affair From Hell in Fatal Attraction, The Cop From Hell in Unlawful Entry, and years before those two you had the dude who unstops your toilet from Hades terrorizing ya.
Hear the bell ring before each salvo.
As I have said before, a very underrated movie, that is well worth watching.
Discovering the Graf Spee's position, Commodore Harwood consults with Captains Bell of the Exeter, Woodhouse of Ajax and Parry of the New Zealand ship Achilles, gambling that the Germans will head for the River Plate before returning home.
Harwood makes an educated guess that Captain Hans Langsdorff (Peter Finch) will head toward South America for one last series of kills before returning home.
Under the laws of the sea, Langsdorff has two days to make the Graf Spee seaworthy before he must return to sea.
Having the characters come together gradually was also clever, I like it when films do this, because it shows that all the characters had a life before the event, and not just the main character.
From beginning to end, Hong lures you into the film by showing provocative sexual scenes and events, and really laying before us just how chaotic and disturbing sex can be, as well as how fulfilling it is.
I give this film 3/10, because, God help us, there actually have been worse movies made before.
There are some weak points to the film, particularly in the early going, where belief is stretched too thin before you are drawn down into another world.
I have never had a favourite movie before but now this has become it.
I knew I had heard the tune before, (but not the lyrics) but just couldn't place it!
Long before Eddie Murphy, Dan Akroyd and co. hit the screen in TRADING PLACES (Cinema Group Ventures/Paramount, 1983), the 3 Stooges had already used the premise in at least 3 films.
Our family lived in Fuller Park at 4402 S. Shields Ave. for about a dozen years before the folks bought a house at 65th & Damen in the West Englewood Neighborhood in 1952.
LITTLE CAESAR too deals with the rise of a criminal to being the head of the criminal organization (or a leading figure in it) before he too falls.
As for the performances, Edward Wood was famously intended to play the lead before the roles were switched, with Cagney taking the role of Tom.
The film, made before the arrival of the infamous Hays Code, gets away with showing the morality of the gangster on the scene and the women they went after.
Closer investigations, however, points out that the girl has been murdered elsewhere before dragged into the attic.
The 2008 DVD contains several extras - a 14-minute retrospective featurette called "Tough Baby: Torch Song", a PSA for the Jimmy Fund featuring Crawford at home with her subservient children, an audio clip of her recording session (apparently done before the decision was made to dub her voice), a vintage MGM cartoon and short, and the original theatrical trailer.
She's bothered because she's in love with a man who doesn't know what she looks like, but her mother recalls a connection that Jenny and Tye had before the injury that left him blind.
We're asked to believe that because Tye saw Jenny in a musical right before he left for the war (which even she admits she wasn't that good in) and reviewed it for a newspaper, that, somehow, seven years later, she will find it in her big charcoal black heart to "love" him.
Misunderstandings, jealousy, a rogue Frenchman, and a close encounter with divorce are in store before their European trip is over.
The couple thanks the hospitality of their eerie host, but they don't know that they are now pawns in a death game between Werdegast and Poelzig, a death game between two rivals that started many years before.
I saw the movie first before reading the book which encouraged me on to read the the original Jones book as well as the sequel, The Fall of Colossus which is just a little more out there.
It's up to Forbin and his crack team of scientists to concoct a way of stopping Colossus before it's too late.
This movie reflects a major fear in the era before PCs (or microcomputers as they then were called).
Even before it begins to speak with the chilling Cylonesque voice it has ordered designed for itself (the great Paul Frees like you've never heard him before), you'll find yourself glued to the screen watching Colossus "talk" to its supposed masters over its huge monitors.
The Forbin Project has just come out on DVD, anybody who has not already seen it has 24 hours to do so before they must hang their head in shame.
As I kept trying to figure out where I heard the score from before.
Among MÃ©liÃ¨s' many fantasy films, "Le Chaudron infernal" is definitely one of the most impressive of all despite its short runtime, as the addition of color takes the film to a whole new level, making MÃ©liÃ¨s' many tricks look even more amazing than before.
Directed by Tom Savini this is absolutely brilliant remake of the George A. Romero classic Night of the Living Dead (1968) who actually turns in the screenplay for this, made years before the recent Hollywood fascination with horror remakes, The Hills Have Eyes (2006), The Omen (2006), The Ring (2002), Dawn of the Dead (2004), The Wicker Man (2006) & Black Christmas (2006) to name just six of the top of my head this '90 version of Night of the Living Dead is how it should be done & I thought it was a great film on many levels.
Even though we in the audience already knew who the killer is well before he was discovered by both Maj. Grau and Insp.
It takes up the last half hour of the film and is  anti-climactic considering what has occurred before.
This is a  serial killer film before the term "serial killer" was coined.
This is her final test before being allowed to leave the facility and make a life for herself.
And (although the audience does know who did it long before the conclusion) the end of the film shows that the sometimes a sense of disgrace can be brought about by the type of killing one gets tangled with.
There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street," which had been made about 20 years before, featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation, a fresh-faced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business, who saves the show when the star fails--"You're going out there a kid from the chorus, but you've got to come back a STAR!!"
I knew who the spy was long before the end of the film!
I had not read Akunin before, and went right out and bought the book - and am now reading Statskii Sovetnik to prepare for May.
So, I see this movie as a modern admission of what had been done before - and of course paying salute to the tremendous people, who have been fighting for ideas.
The most important thing about this movie that it was AR Rehman's dÃ©butant music score, before which he was just doing just music for advertisements.
Karloff, credited as simply that in the movie, is perfect as Poelzig, and this was one of Lugosi's highlights before he sunk deeper and deeper into drugs and alcohol and eventually died before Edward D. Wood, Jr.'s tragic film "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was released, which didn't stop Wood from using old footage of Lugosi filmed prior to the scriptwriting process for the film (often considered the worst ever made).
Still The Baron Of Arizona is a fine second film by director Samuel Fuller topped with an impressive performance by Vincent Price before he settled into the horror film genre.
It's not long before she finds herself in the same room as a corpse of one of his previous patients, and before she realises it; she's the main subject of a murder investigation - and she's not even sure if she did it!
We learn more about Korvo from one of Bill Sutton's patients, Theresa Randolph, who tries to warn Ann that Korvo is a blackmailer and up to no good but Ann believes that Theresa is merely jealous of her relationship with this extremely crafty Svengali (apparently Bill adheres to a strict code of doctor-patient confidentiality as Ann has never met Theresa Randolph before).
This was before I began thinking about it and determined that noir is more a type of film making rather than film content.
All in all, this was interesting to watch, but it could have been much better given the talent behind and before the camera.
Ann's relief is initially tempered by the suspicion that Korvo intends to blackmail her but when he disabuses her of that idea and gains her trust, she becomes a patient of his and he successfully treats her insomnia by using hypnotism before promising to give her treatment for her kleptomania.
This was shortly before his academy award win in CYRANNO, and quite possibly, this incredibly complex performance contributed to that win, he is simply excellent.
It would be almost 10 years before this was a much more common thread, in such movies as the Kim Novak/Kirk Douglas "STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET," and then films with James Dean, who became the poster boy of idyllic family life with a dysfunctional core.
Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions .
Saw it on TV yesterday or the day before.
With the action came more non-sequiteurs or simply incongruous scenes - in this one take Tommy Chan being beaten to a pulp before his respected father's calm eyes!
Also along for the ride, for only the second time, is cab driver Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland)...The noticeable changes from Fox to Monogram, besides more comic relief with both Fong and Moreland, is some more time for the music score to go along with some more action sequences near the end before we hear Charlie's assessment of the case.
Everything that happens along the way has been done before and done better.
OK I think we all will agree the visual effects where outstanding, but this story has been done before (Land Before Time).
The effects were great, but the story was the same old stuff that Disney hasn't done before.
A variety of scaly scavengers fight over this egg like the proverbial hot potato until a Pterodactyl snags it and flies across oceans and continents before it loses the egg on Lemur Island, too.
Although CGI has already brought to life dinosaurs before in JURASSIC PARK and its sequel THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, sometimes DINOSAUR has certainly improved from which it started from.
It's just a pity I'm not nine years old because I've certainly heard all this before many, many times over.
With a weak script, the visuals no longer arrest like they did before and would have done had nobody talked.
When he happens upon the gas station, he soon notices the tragic 'desert rat', Gabrielle Maple, and it's not long before she's infatuated with his clever observations and mysterious personality.
The two share a tangible link, before he decides to leave.
But it's not long before he runs into the aforementioned gangster, and the tensions are revved up when they all end up back at the gas station.
While it was another payday for Howard and Davis, both very charming here, this was Bogart's big break (albeit it would be a while before he could shake his bad-guy act in his roles) and he takes it on for all its worth.
So the play, written in 1935 by multiple-Pulitzer winner Robert Sherwood, was a timely success before being adapted for film, with Leslie Howard producing for Warner Brothers.
Yeah, Leslie Howard seems to be a nice choice... And what if we take this pretty and young Bette Davis (before she becomes the best villain in the story of cinema) and make her play a rebel girl that's longing for a new life far away from that dusty Arizona hole she lives in?
Bogey had made several forgettable films between 1930-34 before returning discouraged to the New York stage.
As a result, this is noteworthy also as Bogart's big breakout movie, and it would only be a few more years before he would hit super-stardom all on his own.
Dick Foran, playing a strapping and comical football star who pumps gas while always trying to woo Gabby, was very good in this film and it's probably the best work I've seen him do in movies, before he wound up as a "B" player for Universal.
The actors did okay with the material before them and I could look at Miranda Bailey anytime.
Engines can fail, weather is unpredictable, gas may be exhausted before landing, but a pilot's judgment must be constant to meet the various challenges.
For example: Voldemar have not seen the Zinaida before her dead.
Not having seen the film before, we decided to take a chance on it.
That said, the two stories are intertwined and offers us a view of how things were done in the period before the Russian revolution.
You get hooked and the movie is finished before you know it.
Just before he sneaks his way laughing like a mad man Scarlett comes in and they sword fight to the death.
But never before have I witnessed so subtle a touch by a director.
The only director I can say who has anything similar in his prowess (that I am aware of) is Scorsese, with whom it turns out Cassavetes developed the idea for the story of the movie some time before making it.
With deliberately rough camera work (containing lots of lens flares) and editing (not trimming out movements of the photographer's hands before and after actions), along with the crafted acting of Ben Gazzara, Cassavetes presents the obscure-hence-realistic underground gang world as no one else has.
One of the signatures of Cassavetes' films is that they reach the climax, and then go on about another hour before ending.
It's not a conventional audience pleaser by any means, but if you've watched other Cassavetes pictures and like his candid stream-of-consciousness style, give the 1978 edited version of "Bookie" a watch before you see the original.
I'm certainly going to go back and watch it again, probably several times -- because I'm going to have to live with this movie for a while before I can say I've come to terms with it.
In a nutshell, if you've seen five average, gory suspense movies before, you've seen this one.
I have no idea why none of the Hollywood studios have yet given this film a theatrical release, but like the equally brilliant Japanese horror film RING, I'm guessing it's because they are first planning an American remake...so before that dark day comes, experience for yourself the film that I consider the Best Movie of 1999 (besting even The Matrix), and one of the Top 5 Horror/Thrillers of the decade!
The acting is also remarkable, just as the sublime black humor that surfaces once in a while and the outrageously gory moments that will leave You gasping for breath even if You've seen many gorefests before.
Please folks, if you really want this series, ask a friend to record it for you before you even think of spending money on it.
This upsets the family and causes rifts between the surviving members, and before Miss Marple can solve the mystery, another murder occurs.
In Bertram's Hotel (shown just before this one), she looked very poor indeed.
While the major subplot has been done a hundred times before (frequently better), the music and dance are superb.
In Ms. Williams case, the movies over before you realize it was her; this movie gave me a reason to remember Alex Rocco.
The acting isn't stale, it is decomposing, very slowly before our very eyes.
and I still remember going to school after watching it the night before and all the girls in my class were buzzing about it.
I didn't expect to rate this movie more than a 4 before I saw it.
When I saw the movie in 1979, before they gave television shows or movies parental ratings, I am thinking now that this movie is actually pretty risk taking for its time.
The movie opens up with a joke and proceeds to have many before it takes a somber note.
Each year that it was on,I understood a little more about the storyline than the last time before.
A farewell party is held and Snoopy receives a fond farewell and a ton of gifts before he leaves a emotionally distraught Charlie Brown and crying little Woodstock behind.
Just about every adult born before 1970 will know who "Peanuts" are.
But in spite of this and other performances which are less than stellar, this work provides a glimpse of Vietnam and Southeast Asia, presented a decade before the onset of the Vietnam conflict of the 1960's, and is part of the post-war McCarthy era, where our government took paths which history has shown to be less than wise.
This movie was made by men who have never before or since made another film.
The scenes of Saigon are the film's best part, it is quite incredible to see how advanced and almost elegant Saigon was before the American involvement and Communist takeover.
Not, as some claim, Graham Greene's best work, but still a fine meditation on Southeast Asian events before they actually occurred by someone who understood.
Consequently, we get to see what Saigon was like in a more innocent time, before large scale US intervention.
It turns out that Kathleen's brother was also kidnapped and killed by the crazy family years before.
Then she tells Sam & Dean to get out of town before the police show up and start asking questions.
Three young movie theater employees are given the task of re-opening a long closed old-time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place.
Harry Reems (who starred in the legendary "Deep Throat" the year before) is also good as the man who offers her an escape from the street life.
Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.
This may be the best softcore erotic movie ever made, and its a shame that more people didn't see it in America when initially released in 1975 at the height of the Sexual Revolution, before AIDS came along and took all the fun out of swinging.
Although Remy is a returning character (she had a very minor role in the first film), there's no reason that you need to watch the original before this one, unless you just want more background on the superbugs.
and then writes the name of the date-gone-wrong beneath the image before adding them to her wall of shame.
Excellent use of him brining in a big secret though, and then dying before revealing it.
oh before i go, i loved the whole dean having a vision thing, and his whole 'bring me some pie' routine in the beginning.
I got home at about midnight that night, but insisted that i watch it before i was able to sleep.
The only quarrel i had was the fact that i knew the ending before it happened, thanks to an all too detailed description in TV week the week before.
this movie has never been done before!
Then there's a twist in the tale just before the interval and the story changes.
But the movie goes deeper and makes one think about the power of love and our utter helplessness before it... how it shapes one's life and choices.
Kajol and Aamirs chemistry leave you wondering WHY they never acted together before.
This is where I realized that the times, they are a-changing: sweet, blind (in more ways than one), sheltered Zooni is so consumed by love that she permits Rehan to bed her before he weds her, a phenomenon that is exceedingly rare (or used to be) in Hindi films.
After witnessing the combustible chemistry between Kajol and Aamir (why were they never paired together before?
In a new town with a new job and new apartment, Melanie Proschle(Eva Loebau) assumes that it'll just be a matter of time before she makes new friends.
While her professional life lays in shambles, Melanie counts too heavily on Tina for companionship, who might of been a model before she opened up her own boutique.
It's a good thing too, because her husband took that "please secure your own mask before helping others" too an extreme.
Keep in mind before watching it though, that it's going to suck.
Now i know what your thinking, that you have seen many of these shark movies before and that they all look the same.
Unfortunately, I didn't connect to the IMDb to check on this before we went to the video store, these sharks (and their lousy producers and cast) chew away $4.00 from me.
Star Wars: film opens with alien space ship passing before camera   The Abyss: incidental appearance of nuclear attack submarine unfriendly commando(s) underwater research station aliens at the bottom of the ocean Operatic music when aliens appear husband and wife together in underwater base   Deep Blue Sea: smart sharks that are team players   Jaws: the beach scene, including water-level camera angle   Jaws2: aircraft gets attacked by shark   Alien: blue collar crewmen, sassing the female boss   Aliens Pvt Hudson & the unwilling tech guy ("Game over man", vs. "I'm not going out there")   The Black Hole cowardly dude gets what's coming after stealing the escape pod  Leviathan: sunken cargo ship with dangerous cargo symbolical breaking to helpless support ship  and lots, lots more.
the telepath knew it long before him.
Being "properly dressed" ie blazer and all, was not reserved just for "going out" but could be felt to be an obligation once breakfast had been cleared away indeed perhaps before breakfast (part of "keeping up standards").
The haunting song "September Affair," played in the film, was recorded shortly before Walter Huston's death and released posthumously; the poignancy of this fact, and the skillful usage in the film, made both a huge sensation.
I'm going to do vidcaps of Yvette in the jail scene and toss this thing before it festers and affects others.
There was western literature before The Virginian, popularized by writers like Ned Buntline.
They meet on a plane flight, he as an untiring industrialist who has placed business and projects before his wife and son, and she as a concert pianist performing in various engagements on tour.
I think Waters' early films are by far his best, the movies he made before he learned "how to make movies."
But, I'll stop before I go into a rant.
He doesn't say it, but it is implied unlike before.
My favourite of the lot was the title track sung by Sonu Nigam, which instantly became my all time favourite song before I even saw the film, just listen to its lyrics...Again PERFECT!
And they have done these roles before.
She had given better performances than this one before, but she comes with a very credible performance all through, especially toward the end.
Over an hour before anything happened that was remotely exciting.
Why did I leave the cinema feeling that if Shah Rukh was given a dialogue full of hope before then end of the film, I'd have felt better...coz surely that was the point of the film: hope.
Enjoy today before it's too late.
Never before have i seen SUCH Perfect placement of SONGS and background scores....Shankhar-Eshan-Loy have just created some of the best tunes ever.....every time the background theme started playing my heart started to melt....
It has been said before, but I came to the same conclusion so it must be said again: if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.
To really disprove the claims of the Mormons, you would need to test every tribe's blood since before the time of Christ, with a sufficient number of random samples to generate reliable statistical measures.
This was followed by a wave of disbelief, a hope that this was a spoof, then the fits of embarrassed laughter took over and I can honestly say that every film-making mistake and cliche that I could think of at the time was being paraded on screen before my very eyes.
Jake is not as happy as he would have liked to be either, and before too long, the feelings he harbors for Rebecka ultimately drive his wife away.
Even the scenes in the movie that Rebecca is staring in come across more convincing and realistic, then those that are supposed to be not before the camera, with Rebbecca and Jake having their affair rekindled after three years.In fact the love scenes that take place in the movie with Rebecca and Jake, playing their roles of Belle and her lover Ray, are far more hotter and convincing then the ones where their in bed and getting it on as Rebecca and Jake.
I watched the rest of the first series and became even more bored with the show than I had been before.
It doesn't matter if the Aussies like it cos it will get a bad time slot and probably already be canceled before it gets over here.
If you've even seen one thriller in the past 74 years, you'll know what's going to happen waaay before it does.
Then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before.
But as I have mentioned before, with a characters a strong as these, how can any actor fail?
Season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was).
Melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self-deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, say, with Tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with Phil's "wave bye-bye" line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode (not to get into Chase's dark humour).
It should be a subject in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay waked until the episode ends, so now I bought the all Episodes in DVD format and I am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and I am getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break.
The dialogue and story line was so predictable that my wife and I started saying the lines even before the characters said them.
As a Vietnam era veteran, I object, as I am sure do all those men and women before and since who have left a child to serve; for someone "called" to do relief work, if anything it's a bigger gesture, as they don't have someone telling them they have to go!
I am amazed by this movie - I have never ever seen anything before that touched me this much.
Perhaps that was due to "behind the scene" budget constraints (maybe some transition scenes were cut before they could shoot them) or perhaps some studio executive was pushing the film out to theaters before the cut was ready because the investors were crying out for their ROI.
For starters, the fact that she is so moved by one incident is more indicative of her obliviousness before the pivotal event than any admirable quality attributed to her reactionary social conscience.
It's inevitable, I suppose, that the two beautiful do-gooders exchange a few clichÃ©d remarks about the state of the world before tumbling into bed.
Like "The Crow" before it, "Dark City" is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been.
We're on to the next set piece before we've had time to absorb the one we just saw, and the characters get buried underneath all the furious editing.
With exception to the fact that it came out before The Matrix ever graced it's previews, there are similarities.
The thing is I've only felt this way about a movie once before, and unfortunately, I can't remember the title of that movie, only that it ended with a picture of an ocean, and an alone man on the beach, leaving us never knowing if he would ever meet his girl again or not.
You've seen it before.
I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been eight years), which shows a city literally re-shape itself each night with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc.
Something which is needed in our society of marionettes and idiotic consumers who know more than anyone else before in history but who lack the ability to truly think.
This movie is an underrated brilliant sci-fi film and it bares a resemblance to 'The Matrix', but was made before it, so there is no denying that Dark City must have been an inspiration for The Matrix.
Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.
Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry.
Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game.
We've seen it a million times before, and a hundred times better.
We all know who exactly they are and who exactly they were before becoming an US enemies.
I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it.
The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax.
Like I said, I don't mind an action movie, sometimes I love the most clichÃ©'d one's, but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism, but I think I'm speaking from a post 9/11 view, so maybe if I saw this movie a before then, I wouldn't have mind it that much, but even then, there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me, it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall, please, I wish.
Meanwhile, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is hiding after an attack on the ship where he must reunite with his family before they end up victims to Ivan's plan if the president doesn't release a Russian prisoner who happens to be a general and a terrorist.
What this documentary does through interviews with leading experts in government, the military, and the intelligence communities, juxtaposed before, between and following the many dire pronouncements from the administration, is demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that what they said was propaganda, disinformation--the Big Lie--dished out to the Congress,the Press and the American people.
The best thing about this film is that it documents the subtle changes over time by showing our leaders speaking at various times before and after our invasion of Iraq.
--- [2] They're rescued just one day before Maggie's clothes are scheduled to fall apart.
There isn't a single instant that doesn't make a viewer feel that, somewhere, some time, he's seen this before.
If you've never seen a movie before -- if you've never HEARD of movies -- you'll probably find this one engaging.
The movie is well-paced with plenty of action--the viewer is not required to wait 45 minutes before anything at all happens.
It then becomes a race to repair the helicopter before the dinosaurs eat the entire party.
Yes its been done before but there is something about the way its done here that lifts it up from the rest of the pack.
However, I do suggest that the viewers acquaint themselves with Dasgupta's films before going to see KALPURUSH.
Perhaps HunterDu should proof his own work before criticizing the work of others.
It feels like it takes too long before the real fun begins and when it does, it gets a tad better (well, maybe more like tweeny weeny bit).
You can probably guess the killer just before the revelation with all the hints that crop up, but it's quite unsatisfying and doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it.
They say those who live in glass houses should not throw stones, but the villains in "The Glass House" do, and it's only a matter of time before everything shatters and breaks apart.
This movie was probably greenlighted by Mr. Walt himself before he passed in 1966, but even if I'm wrong, this is such a great classic, one that I'm sure he would have been proud to have his name on.
I had seen it before, except I just didn't remember much about it, and my friend loved it a lot, so I knew it was going to be good when I was in for a re-watch.It turned out to be very cute and humorous at times, and Herbie was so sweet and cool as well.They also did a good job at building their characters, for all of them were really likable and nice.
Brion Jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack,axe swinging madman Steve Dixon.Having seen him before in Tango&Cash I can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved.
And while I'm on the subject of the plot, I felt it was fairly obvious from the start who was behind it all and yet, our heroes have to go through Hell and back (and a utterly pointless sex scene) before finally putting the pieces of the puzzle together.
Borrow the DVD (for God's sake, don't buy or rent it) and skip to the naughty bits before running your car keys over the disc so it won't play again.
Continuing to enjoy mixing pleasure with business R.J. returns to his hotel with Alyssa, but before they can continue their newfound romance in the hotel room the police ambush R.J. in his room, beating him up and leaving him tied to a chair with a time bomb at his feet.
It is only interesting to see Sandra in the film before she became a big star in Speed.
They perform a scientific autopsy on the guy who "hanged himself", thus proving he was dead before the hanging.
The result means there are some contrived plot turns and certainly variations in the graininess of the film stock (since 1982 was still well before the enhanced computer graphics we see today), but the film is still quite a kick after a quarter-century.
Just before she broke out big in "The Thorn Birds", the stunning Rachel Ward lends a hint of welcome sarcasm to the sexy, Bacall-like languor she provides as Juliet, tapping into a genuine comedy talent rarely used since.
It's ironic that the question should have been raised because before the war, Steinbeck, the author of such modestly leftist works as "To a God Unknown" and "The Grapes of Wrath", was accused of being a Commie.
The director's full frame profile is used for the before and after comparison, prompting numerous viewers of the time to inquire where they could buy the product, but of course it was all made up.
Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.
And will Harold put the pieces together before the noose around his neck gets too tight?
This is a self-evidently absurd statement that Shand takes totally seriously, immediately before slashing his most trusted lieutenant's jugular with a broken bottle, as Hoskins's incandescent performance charts the erosion of the character's veneer of sophistication.
Admit it , you've watched this movie over the years and thought to yourself " Now where have I seen that actor before ? "
Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid does admittedly run out of steam about 10 minutes before the end.
The music/film score, Francis Monkmon (Sky) fame: Manic orchestral dizzy strings,coupled with the heavy saxophone solo's,puts this film tune theme, up there with the greats of Barry & Roy Budd inclusive: Super-stellar performances from Hoskins & Mirren, make this a must see No 3 of the Bulldog switchblade movies, before your soul, starts feeling the heat or touching the sides of your wooden crate: Helen Mirren (Probably the greatest British female treader of the boards, in our history).
With the exception of a brief view of Tower Bridge near the beginning,director MacKenzie does not fall into the trap of familiar tourist views but less known London back streets and perhaps the last real view of the UK capital's somewhat neglected docklands in the pre-Thatcherite/Yuppie era in the late 70's/early 80's before it's redevelopment,Canary Wharf and all.
Also, look out for the actor who played 'Denzel' in Only fools and Horses, and a mute role for Pierce Brosnan before he went to the States to play Remington Steele.
She was completely different from Smartie but Ho Nam was not the same Ho Nam before Smartie died.
Not to much on his arrest or marital life; Chuck nipped that in the bud before it got off the ground.
This was before the King, Elvis, signed with RCA and popularized the rock 'n' roll sound for us all.
When Chuck recorded this in 1956, it represented, to my knowledge, the first rock 'n' roll protest song, several years before Bob Dylan would turn the rock world around with his protest-oriented music.
I have to wonder if Robbie Robertson knew much about Chuck Berry before sitting down with him.
For example, Bruce Springsteen tells about Chuck Berry's concern with money and no rehearsal with the unknown local pick up bands before his gigs without any respect to the audiences and fans.
The cinematographer is Oliver Stapleton who had only photographed some Indy films before Haill Haill Rock & Roll but would go on to do such films as Earth Girls Are Easy, The Grifters, The Cider House Rules, Buffalo Soldiers and Pay it Forward.
No thought for character, thematic premise, continuity (we actually have the guy walk into an empty bookstore and pick up his own book with interest - as if he's never read it before!
I think it's an extraordinary question of cinematographic life how movies like Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, The (2002) received an 8.7 and stands just below The Godfather, while such jewels like "Pearls before Swine" got an 3.1 (last time i checked).
"Pearls before Swine" doesn't stand out on quality of acting, plot or any other conventional measure of rating a movie, but, as the title suggests, places itself above the average viewer in its magnificent value of INTEGRITY.
I do believe they thought they were casting pearls before swine in the making of this film.
The sets look like they were put up an hour before filming and could collapse at any moment.
"DH" had to be categorized as a soap opera before the networks would pick it up.
Never before I saw an actor "breathing" fear and determination so intensely during the whole length of a movie as Crowe did here.
Its chairman (Michael Gambon) has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routines-but not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls.
However, before its over, he evokes the "integrity of Edward R. Murrow," a line that gave me chills and made me pray for an Oscar Nomination.
Out of all of the televisions shows that were canceled well before their time, the cancellation of this show makes me the angriest (firefly is high on that list as well).
Before Judd Apatow was famous for directing great films such as "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" and before producing "superbad" and other comedy films, he made the TV series "Freaks and Geeks".I used to watch this show back when it was on during 1999 and 2000 but I was young so I didn't understand all the references and jokes.Watching it now I understand all the jokes and find the show to be an interesting and accurate portrayal of high school life.The show has all the high school cliques such as Geeks,Jocks etc.There is also a good mix of comedy and drama.The show also jump started the careers for many of the cast members such as James Franco(spiderman) and Seth Rogen(knocked up).If you can find this show anywhere like in syndication or something, watch it!.
NBC gave shows with initially low ratings like Seinfeld and Friends a chance, why couldn't they have given Freaks and Geeks a chance before cancelling it.
The moment in the pilot when Sam leads Cindy on the dance floor and then the music changes from slow to fast is initially funny, but the pained look on Sam's face like he's about to cry before he awkwardly starts to dance and cheers up brought tears to my eyes.
We linger briefly on this generic moment before moving underneath the bleachers to real life and a conversation about Molly Hatchet and Led Zeppelin.
In fact, there are times when he comes off as manipulative and creepy and yet there is a sadness in his character that I haven't quite seen before.
The original working title was "Small Towns are Murder" (before the Gene Wilder film was made, I think), BTW.
Now, only a few weeks remain, and the boys have a lot to do before they enlist.
One of the group's organizers connives with river pirates to hijack the riverboat and rob the party before they can reach their destination.
Season #2  The Two Faces of Grey Holden: 3 October 1960When a pretty Cajun girl (Suzanne Pleshette) catches Captain Holden's eye, he's naturally interested in a bit of romance, until he learns that the young lady thinks he is her fiancÃ©e, who was killed in a riverboat explosion over a year before.
I have never seen anything like this before.
But this is so bad you'd probably be more likely to become a serial killer before likening this movie.
Its a film of its time - just made in time to catch the costume and musical talent of the past before they departed from the scene but made before the sort of hi-tech morphing and cgi which would have ruined its feel.
Special mention has to go to Victoria Abril, who has played opposite Banderas before so many years ago.
What's even worse is that there is no allusion to the "city of the dead" in the entire movie until the scene before our heroes bumble into it.
From the idea of evil reviving itself by consuming a victim (Barker's "Hellraiser", but cinematic ally dating at least back to Hammer's "Dracula, Prince of Darkness" from 1965), thru the rain of maggots (Argento's magisterial "Suspiria"), to the disembodied hand reaching out of the darkness to torment the dead man's lover (Bava's masterpiece, "Whip and the Body"), there really is nothing here that we haven't seen before and better.
Even though this happens Snoop Dogg gives a great performance as Jimmy Bones but the writing of the character and the movie itself could have been handled better, both had potential that was dropped and ended before the full potential was ever reached.
This film not only carefully and faithfully covers the life and times of Darwin, one of the greatest scientists of all time, but it lays before the viewer a very precise overview of Darwin's theories of species orgins and the principles of evolution.
But before he can work out all of the "bugs", tragedy occurs but that doesn't stop the old B-Queen from using it.
Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick.
This is the worst thing i have watched since, and probably before, Gigli.
From the bits and pieces I had seen before, I thought the series is rather shallow and very light hearted but I was surprised.
I saw the show before I read the book so for me this show IS Lucy Sullivan.
Sheryl Lee is a pleasant surprise - I think I've only seen her before as Laura Palmer on Twin Peaks and had no idea she was so talented.
There are only six episodes, each an hour long, but it took me only 'til about the second before I was hooked.
The acting is excellent, and I'm left wondering why I haven't heard of or seen these actors before.
Artists have been prime suspects before.
Worth checking out as a depiction of late '40s Louisiana as well as the final film of Mr. Flaherty before his death in 1951.
They figured he was perfect for the part but, since he was born out of wedlock and under-aged, there were significant difficulties under Louisiana law to be worked out before he could be signed on.
Turns into a high moderate buy if you want something for people to say they've never seen before - and you may not get it back.
If I see it again and change my mind, I'll be sure to change my vote, but not before then.
I saw this film first soon after it came to cable and before I knew much about Jennifer Jason-Leigh or had come to appreciate the power this amazing young actress can exude in the careful and often understated nuances she brings to her craft.
This movie is not formulaic overall, when you consider that it's almost impossible to make a scary movie of any kind that hasn't been done before.
I'm glad someone did this before it was too late.
He died long before this film was made.
I recommend this short film for all and especially for youth groups, but suggest it be previewed by leaders before group showings in order to develop responses to questions that your audiences will have.
The old man sets out to the competition but not before instructing his sons that should this be a trap, and they will need to seek revenge, to unite with other schools in their plot, and most importantly to seek out Fang Gang's help.
It takes a great actor to lift up a role from the muck, and I'm sorry to see that this was Brett's only chance to do a modern-day storyline from his usual historic epics before he passed away.
I don't know of any other Wayne film before the forgettable '47 "Tycoon" that was filmed in color.
It's notable for featuring a very young John Cusack, before anyone knew who he was.
Perhaps I need to watch a couple more Wheeler and Woolsey films before I cast them aside, but I can almost bet the other offerings would be simply more of the same.
This movie just reeks of farce, from the accountant mowing down people with a shotgun with the nerdy grin symbolizing his transformation from mild mannered nerd to empowered bad-ass to the completely arbitrary scene of Robert DeNiro hitting a guy with a baseball bat (no back story,no plot movement, seemingly no reason for it to be in the movie whatsoever)to Sean Connery getting blasted with seemingly dozens of machine gun bullets, bleeding enough to have died three times over, and yet still having the power to gasp a few more words just as Elliot Ness gets there before finally dying.
As I noted before the film is brilliantly directed, with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat, or the one with the baby in the train station, having become classic.
HOW bout play it on TV and give it a shot before u take it off.
Like said before this show has the potential to be as good as smallville if not better.
Luckily you can see the Aquaman pilot on iTunes and judge for yourself their decision to kill the show before it aired.
I've been hurt by movies before.
But all this pales before Radioactive Dreams.
Director/co-writer Massi's background as a cinematographer is evident in the film's stylish look (even if there's an over-abundance of zoom shots), and equally notable is the inventive editing technique adopted throughout (which shows a definite influence from modern American films - the overlapping of shots from successive scenes before a full transition being borrowed from EASY RIDER [1969], the juxtaposition in slo-mo of Moschin's death with that of Milian's wife at the climax from the work of Sam Peckinpah).
The only two scenes of Raft and Bogart in prison are in the shower (thank you) and in the warden's office before leaving.
At Warner Brothers, it's all been done before, the players slip comfortably into roles that are very familiar to them.
He's playing the callow youth parts he specialized in before Sunset Boulevard.
Bogart's done it all before at Warner Brothers.
Its one of the large scale serials that Republic did in the late 30's and early 40's before budgets got tighter thanks to wartime austerity.
In this one John Carroll (before going on to bigger and better things) plays the hero and his mild-mannered alter ego James Vega.
It lasted for three seasons before McQueen decided to devote full time to the big screen.
I had not realized that William Powell was there before me, but then I must not reveal too much about what he is cooing about, as it might not make it past the Hays Office.
Standing in contrast to the film's madcap goings-on, it takes place when George escorts Kay, who thinks he's Larry, to the spot where years before he proposed to her as Larry.
Another occurs when, as a boy scout troop leader, he is asked to continue with the deer-tracking techniques he was teaching before leaving town.
For the sake of anyone who might take the time to go ever these lines before deciding whether or not to see it.
This is the first time I review a movie on IMDb and I am taking the time, as I said before, to spare someone the torture.
I'd rather be hogtied in a room with the roadcrew from Queen and a jar of KY jelly mixed with sand before ever being exposed to something this wicked and satanic again.
Its quite ironic that this film and others before it echoed the fears of the whole planet but not long after its release the political climate started to change and it seemed the threat of nuclear war would finally be gone.
She makes her phone call and bails on her rescuers having seen something that scared her but not before robbing Marlowe and dropping the keys in their car.
We have mutant sewer monsters and more Disco Mutants which get Phillip and Marlowe separated (for no real good reason other than to allow Marlowe a brief moment of glory as he rescues Phillip from the Disco Mutants before they meet back up with Miles who takes them back to her place.
The effect was so intriguing I'm grateful De Oliveira left me time to think Babel before Malkovich cued it.
John Malkovich and Catherine Deneuve have also worked with the director before, but this is not their film, they just happen to be there at the end.
I never saw a De Oliveira movie before this, although he is considered by Italian critics one of the most important directors alive.
Rosa Maria, who has lectured about the sites but never visited them before, explains the various sites to her attentive and inquisitive daughter who is constantly asking questions.
Filmed at Universal, the story goes that the company balked when Hatton's disfiguring disease killed him before the film could be released and they sold it to PRC.
The classification was in place for well over a decade before this film was released.
because never seen any movie like this before and i really liked it.
I've seen the The-white guy-trying-to-act-black routine before but the filmmakers somehow was able to make this particular character more original and on top of that he's carrying an umbrella in his own store!!
Strange, I don't remember any "Old Enough" before I wrote "Old Enough" which you can find under /Artists/TerryJames/Lyrics/OldEnough/OldEnough.html which John Hughes used in "Home Alone."
Didn't anyone on the original production review the work before issuing it?
I had seen it before, but the second time around made the picture better.
(sorry, i need ten lines before i could post a comment)
I highly request reading the book first, before seeing the movie!
It will allow you to make your own assumptions about the characters before the movie reveals all!
I was thrilled when I saw that the book had been made into a movie, for the first time since it was written, over 50 years before.
Interesting that when this show was made, it was two years before the Supreme Court Ruling June, 1963 Madyln Murray vs. whichever school district that eliminated prayer in public schools.
As would be expected of a drama set in England in the 1930s before the hideousness of war returned are the inevitable class clashes, both economic and trans-Atlantic.
Negotiating with the police officials involved in the case and with her former lover for the inside story before judgment had even been passed.
In my 1001 movies you must see before you die book, this documentary was actually recommended.
So I rented this movie curious on her interviews and what she was like before her execution, man, this woman was disturbed, very badly.
How long must child abuse and neglect go on before people start to realize that all of societies worst monsters arise from the aforementioned factors?
This documentary shows that United States has a long way to go before it is a humane civilised society.
Caco does steal their newly acquired fortune, but not before he deals with the slippery as a rattlesnake Harold, one of the three men who set him afoot after a bank robbery.
To get back at three men who double-crossed him 15 years before, letting him get caught and sent to prison.
Btw, this is their second appearance together, the first being GOD FORGIVES, I DON'T from the year before.
yeah hate to tell you but its been done before and much better.
So, only watch this movie if you want to laugh like you've never laughed before!
Also that house they filmed it in, i've seen it before and it was my dream house, but now i'd be too scared to step into it so i guess the movie was somewhat effective.
Meredith, as I've said before, is a great actor.
Virginia is often visited by the maniac before and after he kills his victims.
The next day Virginia sees a report in a local newspaper which tells of the murder of an actress & one of Virginia's friends named Colette Berkowitz (Michelle Jordan), after this event & a face to face meeting with Kessler before he kills & slices the ears off a pianist (Bruce Wagner) who lives near her, Virginia is convinced that the character of Dr. Kessler is responsible & comes to life when she reads I, Madman.
On the downside, the film runs out of steam after the first two thirds, delivering a disappointing final act that does not live up to everything that came before it.
Other variations are either just as heartfelt or they complement what the rest now see themselves has having been before they realized what being a Christian truly means.
All the families went through it very differently, but they all had the same common preconception: that homosexuality is a sin and abomination before the eyes of god.
It's up to a couple of bumbling and portly homicide detectives played by ubiquitous B-movie bit player/screenwriter John Goff and fellow perennial schlock film regular Jake Barnes to catch the crazy kook before he kills again.
Will the two cops be able to unmask the killer in time, before more innocent lives are lost?
and "this plots been done before", you will know exactly how he feels, I also wondered if his dialogue was included by the filmmakers as a little self referring joke, it sums up the film well.
', that's true enough, you'll pray to get out alright, just way before this thing finishes.
Parents should be aware of this before allowing the munchkins to watch DRIVE-IN MASSACRE--though with a title like this, I guess you aren't expecting a Disney film!
She was a feminist before there was feminist--a liberated woman before women's lib.
I prepared myself to be shatteringly disappointed by reading the reviews here before I started.
Horror Business follows Mark as he gets started writing and filming the movie and it's a great glimpse into the world of independent film, as Mark tells his mother that because she's given him money, she's a defacto executive producer on his film, and the behind the scenes footage of the filming is informative too, when the person who was supposed to run the camera doesn't show up, Mark calls on an extra who's run a camera before to do the filming for the night, explaining that the more experience you have in the film industry the more likely it is that you'll get to work if you find yourself on a movie set, which seems to be true!
I've heard this before from close friends of mine and I just so happen to agree one hundred percent.
Not to mention that we've seen it all before.
Thankfully he plays his angry man who practically shouts all the time in this..and shout he does; obscenities and racist remarks a given (sexist,racist,homophobic{before most knew the meaning of the word} and practically ever other you can imagine).
Things aren't a lot different in 2006,it's just that Hollywood likes to make us think they are.I'm not saying for a minute that it's right that things have barely changed in 30 years,but no amount of wishing will make it so.Professional criminals still hide their activities behind the poor and disenfranchised of their own communities,ferment trouble for their own advantage and cops like Eddie Ryan still hate them bitterly for doing it.Laws meant to protect the weak and vulnerable still shelter the cruel and ruthless.If Eddie Ryan,like Harry Callaghan before him,feels like chucking in his badge then he cannot altogether be blamed.Not that he gets a chance as his bosses pre-empt him.
I just rented it and I'll be watching it again before I send it back.
Although I'd heard of Crumb (mainly through American Splendour I wasn't that aware of his work although some of his cartoons were images that I'd seen before.
Crumbs passion for mostly blues music from 1936 and before and his premier collection is fascinating.
After reading the couple of negative reviews of "Crumb" on IMDB I re - viewed the movie one more time just to make sure that the many times when I had seen this movie before, on the silver screen and on video, I have not been in a state of delusion.
The scene where they take the dauphin away.....and then they come for her son, Shearer goes from sheer disbelief that they could be so inhuman, to fighting them off like a tigress, her hair and arms flying around, before they call in more guards.
This was the film about deep Southern attitudes vs Northern attitudes that came out before "Gone With the Wind" and left Davis out of the running for the role of Scarlet O'Hara.
The first half -- before the entre act, that is -- is a kind of late 18th-century soap opera.
The second half turns a little darker, but then, as they say, it's always darkest just before it turns completely black.
Her great romantic love before she settled down into domesticity was Count Axel Fersen, the Swedish Ambassador and his screen time is probably not even 40 minutes.
As for Power... remember the anecdote about the reporter asking romance-writer Barbara Cartland (Lady Di's stepmother) how she could possibly have written so many romance novels before she was even married and while she was still a virgin?
Zweig's book created and popularized the view of Marie Antoinette's sex life that remained current for decades--that Louis XVI was unable to consummate his marriage with her for more than 7 years, and had to have minor surgery before he could seal the deal.
Louis was a lousy lover, true, and it did take some years before he got down to serious boudoir athletics, but Zweig's thesis has been thoroughly wrecked.
It's interesting that Irving Thalberg died before production began on the film.
The casting of Norma Shearer in the title role -- one of the perks of being married to Irving Thalberg who had had this movie in production for more than a year before its release in 1938 and was in many ways the person above Louie B. Mayer -- is a bit of an irony since she at the time was considered the Queen of MGM, now its Widow, at the height and end of her acting career.
Bronson and his wife Lange come home from an idyllic Hawaiian vacation to their home in New York City (the contrast is more than obvious, with a practically hellish depiction of The Big Apple here) and have barely unpacked before a trio of thugs assaults Lange and her daughter Tolan.
Most directors make the viewer wait at least twenty minutes before hitting them with their first jolt of adrenalin-rushing excitement, but Winner can't wait that long, so within the first ten minutes we see Kersey's wife and daughter attacked and raped in their own apartment by three drugged-out hooligans.
In the early scenes, before and after the attack, we see a crime-infested New York where violence is casual, everyday, all over - and a police force that is powerless.
It does get a bit more disturbing as it goes along, and we see Kersey acting first, deliberately getting himself into situations where he might be in danger, and then blowing people away before they even have a chance to go at him.
Bronson makes a bon mot by stating the obvious -- get out of town before sundown.
And I say "sure" he cried about his wife before he went on to kill a great many scum bags on the streets of New York.
The wife is beaten into unconsciousness before later dying in hospital, and the daughter is sexually assaulted and goes into a catatonic state as a result of the shock.
The sense of humour really helps the film (I still laugh at the scene where some construction-workers kick the hell out of a crook, and one workman nonchalantly states to the TV reporters: "Erm, we roughed him up a bit before the cops arrived!")
This is not a specially violent movie as IÂ´ve said before.
It isn't long before the police are hot on his heels.
Indeed, he narrowly eludes capture on at least two occasions, and there is the certainty that it is only a matter of time before the law will catch up with him.
The film does wonders with its historical setting, New Orleans a short while before the Civil War.
A year before Gone with the Wind cooed over the fancy lives and manners of the Ante Bellum South, Jezebel was exploring them in more detail, and with a more intelligent eye.
Bronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in "Death Wish" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after.
I can say that having been used to watching generally Hindi films, february14 is a romance that stands out from the typical Hollywood love story -- paying attention to detail and character development in a way in which I've rarely seen before.
He should have gotten maybe a few more nods from other academies, I'd never seen anything so intriguing and elaborate before.
The film just doesn't stop attempting to prepare us for tension and excitement and building up these encounters and situations before resulting in a huge anti-climax and more stretched out, aimless roads to nowhere.
If you weren't paranoid before, seeing this film will convince you go straight home after work, lock the doors, lock the windows, don't answer the phone, and just stay there with your teeth chattering until morning.
15 years pass and it was shown again on UK TV this weekend and again the same thing: "seen it before, go to bed.." No, watched it all.
Scorsese has surveyed the mean streets of New York numerous times before, but here he creates a uniquely surreal atmosphere in exploring the setting from the dark side.
It's easy to catch the Scorsese style of shooting and editing, really starting to roll here (before taking off in "The Color of Money" and "Goodfellas"), as the engine of the movie.
"Jezebel" is another great movie of Bette Davis and William Wyler based on the southern lifestyle a couple of years before the American Civil War.
As many who have left comments before me have observed, this film echos the detective stories of the 1930s and 1940s.
Never in all my years of viewing cinema has such a tremendous film been brought before me.
There is no plot, aside from the lead character trying to score the hot girl, which I can safely say has been done before.
The movie was cut together in a very unorganised way (and I'm not talking Pulp Fiction style) and seemed to just stop before the story was over (and I'm not talking Lock Stock style).
My guess was, after the American destruction of Godzilla a couple of years ago, the boys over in Japan would take up the reigns and crank out a Godzilla movie unlike any other seen before.
The only thing they had in common is the fact that both take place in the period before the War between the States, but that's as far as the similarities end.
Then, there's Takao Ookawara directing his last Godzilla film before quitting the series.
Robinson actually rearranges Ifukube music with two tracks, the best in the scene where Orga makes his appearance, the worst being the scene in the end (after which, said token stock Ifukube track is repeated before cuing the complete original ending credits track).
Let's face it - these buildings very nearly dwarf Godzilla; although technically larger than ever before in the series, he looks smaller because of the urban growth he has to wade through.
"Jezebel" is essentially "Gone with the Wind" without the budget or the color, and was made the year before that film was released.
Make your theater logistical arrangements carefully before setting out on this train.
No-one has ever robbed a moving train before but suave criminal Edward Pierce (Sean Connery) & his partner Miriam (Lesley-Anne Downe) comes up with an elaborate & daring plan to do just that.
But there had never been a robbery from a moving train before.
The film follows the elaborate and interesting lengths that the gang must go to before they can even board the train.
It isn't clear whether `Jezebel' was offered to her before or after the negotiations for GWTW.
With Mission Impossible like precision, Sean Connery, Lesley Anne Down, and Donald Sutherland pull off The First Great Train Robbery, years before Jesse James did it in the American West.
Beware that it takes quite awhile before the actual holdup takes place.
Brian Harding is a city guy, who works in a bank and before Xmas holidays he has to go and repossess Julia's home because she was unable to pay the loan back.
Although I'm not a gay person, I can easily picture the enjoyment of this share of the audience before such a sequence.
After Maciste fights the giant and tries to save the girl from the altar, he's back to wearing the same thing he wore before.
A few things to take in mind if you've never seen this film before: the alien is supposed to be scary and undoubtedly some teens will survive.
Before Lacey can do anything his guest dies, he rings his parole officer looking for help, but before he can do the right thing, the belligerent toothpick chewing Sims arrives at his door determined to pin the crime on him, the dead body only compounds Lacey's fate.
Just before Dr. Hessler arrives Morgan dies.
Beautiful Phyllis Kirk never looked better, as did LOS ANGELES; 50 years ago before 90% of their population arrived.
It opens well,but it rapidly descends into the worst Candyman film of the series.The first and foremost problem is that it is just not scary at all,ever.It's pretty gory here and there (much like it's predecessors) but at no point does it ever jolt you or put any sense of dread into you.Another thing is that the performances are absolutely rubbish.D,Errico is okay in the lead role,even though she kept reminding me of Midlands glamour model Jakki Degg (she looks about ten years younger than she actually is,too),but Todd,as the Candyman,is here unable to liven up the proceedings,just robotically churns out his lines much less effectively than in his last two outings as the titular monster and even appears slightly bored,like he popped a valium or two before filming began.The supporting cast are what really weigh the film down,the most witless,inept bunch of hopeless nobodies who'd probably have trouble getting work in a daytime TV show (except maybe the one who played Caroline's mum!)
Overall,this is,well,as I've said,the worst of the lot.It lacks the impending,desolate,isolated sense of dread of the original and the well orchestrated shocks of the sequel.It is,in fact,a sorry,pandering mess to these far superior two films that have gone before it and a definite video work all round.Avoid.
Definitely read the novel of the same title before seeing the film!
I finished reading the novel two days before seeing the movie, and although it had it's differences to the novel, I was gripped.
I do admit, however, before the films having a doubt about the casting of Rhys Ifans as Jed, however, i am glad to have been proved wrong and was impressed with his performance of a Jesus-freak psychopath.
The tension begins right there, before the balloon has even appeared, as you can see a proposal is about to take place, and it never leaves the screen.
Daniel Craig made this 2 years before he became James Bond.
I tried to see this film before because I remember the very beginning, but I guess I was interrupted.
Although he was apparently about the propose to his partner, Clare, before the accident in the opening scene, there is some unspecified strain in their relationship which prevents her being at all supportive when his problems begin, but what this is remains completely obscure.
Also, I've read the original comic, that the film is based on, months before seeing the movie, so I was actually surprised how much I liked the movie.
She finally gets the courage to enact her wish about leaving in exactly the way she had talked of before.
Ghost World came at a time just before Scarlett Johansson's career took off.
In one great shot, Rebecca stands before an ironing board, her transformation into womanhood complete.
We get to know these people so well, we know exactly what they're thinking before they say it.
Anyway, he's never been this good before.
Also, in this episode, we witness Locke in a mood which we have never seen before.
I had never heard of this film before the recent DVD release.
I don't recall seeing this Everett guy before, but I think they could have done better.
The reality is that new stories can also have value of fleshing out and perhaps exploring situations we have not seen Holmes in before.
My favorite Holmes remains Jeremy Brett, who showed actual modulation in Holmes' personality (irritation and boredom before the case presented itself; excitement, sometimes to a bizarre extent, during a case; rapture at listening to a classical concert etc.)
Developed as The City is Dark and shot as Don't Cry, Baby before being released as Crime Wave, Andre de Toth's still surprisingly tough police procedural is a film that wears its economy as a badge of pride.
The Grey Zone is a poetic and masterful Holocaust drama based on the true story of Jews who did the seemingly unthinkable by working for the Nazis inside concentration camps for a chance to receive better living conditions and the possibility of staying alive for a few extra months before being exterminated themselves.
this is the most impressive holocaust movie ever, If you have ever seen Shoa you'll agree .....  may you not be familiar with the ongoing events back in the 1940's in the death-camps maybe you should read into it before seeing this film  it's not like Uprising or Schindler's list (I haven't seen the Pianist yet but I very much doubt it'll come close)  this is the real stuff .....  MUST SEE 5 out of 5  
This movie shows a part of Auschwitz/Birkenau never seen before on film (the Sondercommando-Jewish work detail in the gas chambers and crematorium)and it is riveting.
This remains until the 3 minutes before the end of the movie.
When I visited Auschwitz in 1990, I remember that my companion and I sat down outside the gates, once we were done, and cried for about an hour before catching the train back to Krakow.
I watched the 'Grey Zone' some months before I left, and yes to echo some I found the acting somewhat overdone in places and the first bit of the movie rather confusing.
I've never seen a film quite like this before.
That was the scant, not to mention inaccurate synopsis that I read before viewing.
In this film, they only encountered briefly in the 1940's before Cap was frozen in ice.
Cap must stop him before it is too late, and at the same time, he must come to grips with the fact that he is in a strange new world and everything he has ever known in gone forever, and that if it hadn't been for him failing to defeat Skull the first time, many people would still be alive.
While they did some things right (they did manage to make Matt Salinger look scrawny before the experiment), overall it was another attempt to take a character with a long history in the comics and put the filmmakers' own spin on it to poor effect.
It takes a while before we understand what the hell this has to do with anything - no, it's not a scene from "The Godfather" which was accidentally spliced into the film during production - because we quickly cut to:  SEVEN YEARS LATER   (as an afterthought) 1943  World War II is running full throttle and dazed-looking Steve is mugging his way through a tearful farewell to his family and girlfriend, Bernie (and here I was thinking this was a guy's name!).
He must have been playing around with a lot of women before Captain America came back to life.
Captain America doesn't even finish one mission before he's frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 50 years later.
Keaton did other solid work before and after ''The General.''
It didn't take long before both my folks were totally into the film.
DOUG: We watched Keaton's The General before in Film Expression class, and it is thanks to this that we have so many Keaton films on the agenda.
I only new Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, before i turned into a comic titles searcher.
The chase is now reversed as he tries to get back to Confederate lines before the Yankees catch him.
Having never seen a silent film before, I wasn't sure what to expect going into it.
Its sequences of sight gags, each topping the one before, is an incredible joy to behold.
He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down, until just before the train enters a tunnel.
Then, in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping, Johnnie grabs her and half-throttles her before kissing her instead.
I hope every parent forces their child to watch at least one of his amazing films before his legacy slips away and kids begin to think that Jackie Chan is the greatest "stunt actor" in the history of film.
This means that the movie, if looked at as a whole, seems to bounce around a bit because it is made up of several story arcs that begin and end in under 30 minutes before jumping into the next one.
This is where the talent went before getting on and who do you think was walking up at that time... TINA TURNER!
Remember this is in an era before the internet, mobile phones, when even sending and receiving an international fax was hit and miss.
There's no need to emphasize that LIVE AID (and everything else connected to it) is the singular event of the rock'n'roll history, greater then anything seen before or after.
What's the point of lighting the metal point of a spear before you stab someone?
It seems junior (Edmund Purdom) got the hots for the high priestess of Astati (Lana Turner) while incurring the wrath of the high priest of Baal and tyrant of Damascus (Louis Calhern) and frittered away his fortune before coming to his senses and leading the people in rebellion against their pagan oppressors.
Like I said before "Pusher" was engaging, and you were sucked into that world.
Actually, this came out before her stint in the Wonder Woman television show.
Written and directed by the ingenious Robert Ethan Gunnerson, ARC takes place in the town of Los Angeles, and focuses in on it's more sordid side as a former police officer turned drug addict searches for a missing boy in hopes to redeem his character before his 30th birthday.
For the reasons that the aliens don't come into until 30 minutes before the movie ends, and the rest of the film is the dramatic adventures of three best friends going through life and making discoveries, guiding themselves by their friendship which will last for ever.
The unfortunate thing about Explorers is that the studio rushed opening this film before letting Joe Dante properly finish it.
Up until 20 minutes or so before the end I thought the movie was 'perfect'.
The realistic approach makes this movie feel fresh and not like something you've seen before.
They then do test runs like any good scientists would before they decide it's ready for a much bigger journey.
Once you finally get to the ending and see what's responsible for all the killings, you realize that it's like no movie you've ever seen before and that's what makes it great.
Nell starts investigating the building and discovers parts of it that she didn't know existed, and before long, she's terrorized by the killer.
The Ambassador Hotel was torn down two years before the movie was shot.)
The film contains an interested use of backlighting, as the ghosts of all his recent victims point accusingly, in unison and determination, at Richard just before he goes out to join them in the back-lit-hereafter.
With Tarzan (Johnny Weismuller) and Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) nicely settled into their treetop des-res (complete with all mod cons), it was only going to be a matter of time before we heard the pitter patter of little footsteps (other than Cheetah's, of course).
The crying baby was rescued by some chimps not long before the plane is discovered by unfriendly tribesmen.
He is later picked up by chimpanzee's before Cheetah takes the infant, offers it to Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller), who in turn vine swings himself back to the tree house where he presents the child to Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan).
But when Betty says they should wait until they graduate before they marry (two whole years!
But to underline the heinous nature of his crime, we see the captain and some crew members chatting just before theirs is blown to bits.
None of us had seen it before - and as we gathered courage, refilled glasses, had some coffee and lit a few cigars and candles - we finally sat down to watch it towards midnight.
The movie did include the scene at the Dakota, apparently set in 1979 or so (shortly before Paul's pot bust in Japan) which depicted that John and Paul had made up most of their differences.
In interviews just before his death, Lennon said he "couldn't even talk about" things like the band's breakup "because it is still in court."
Phantom Raiders was the second (the first being 1939 Nick Carter - Master Detective) and the last film directed by Jacques Tourneur about the adventures of a popular detective Nick Carter whose character was created still in the end of the 19th century and who served as a protagonist of several films before this one during the silent era.
As I said before they're not awful but Julia Roberts deserves more than this.
You know it's only a matter of time before she forgives him, but you enjoy her insistence that this is a serious breach of trust in their marriage, not to be ignored lightly, or forgotten.
This plot has been done many times before and there are no real surprises--but it has a good pro-female script.
As I said before this film will open your mind and will be enjoyed that is why I recommend it.
The cinematography by Checco Varese takes us from Mexico into the United States along the routes traveled by Carlitos and Enrique before landing in Los Angeles.
There is a character named Enrique that you first think what has he got to do with anything but before long you realize he is so important to the overall feel of the film and reminds us that we are all tied to each other in some way.
I hadn't seen Kate del Castillo before and will now look for more of her films.
I knew of Derbez only as a comic before and was impressed with his dramatic performance.
I found this accidentally on cable -- never heard of it before, somehow.
A mother gets up before the sun rises on Los Angeles to take the first of many buses to get to the first of her two housecleaning jobs.
I watched it with a friend and half way through felt compelled to stop it and apologise, which I've never done before.
Woody Allen had only directed a few pictures before, but it's curious he decided to let Mr. Ross direct this one, at all.
I recommend watching a Bogart film before (or with) this comedy to appreciate Lacy's portrayal of Bogart.
There is so much it the movie should have been called "What woman can bare it all the most before she get killed?
":{ If you are a guy and love nudity where it shows the top and the bottom for at least a half of a minute in each scene (which to Me it seemed to be days before a scene ended) then hurry up and find and buy this movie IMMEDIATELY!
Kevin Costner makes an early film appearance as the prime suspect (long before the days of Dawson's Creek this was obviously one of those pioneer movies that cast actors about ten years too old to be playing college students in their roles.
However, John knows her, and they become intertwined again when their son Drew decides to enlist in the RAF years before the U.S. enters WWII.
I've never heard about this cartoon before because Nickelodeon shows it at hours I don't watch TV (i.e.
Simply put, Futurama had it's charm and I think it should have lasted one or two more seasons before it got cancelled.
Futurama starts off on New Year's Eve 1999 where a pizza delivery boy, Phillip J. Fry, AKA Fry, is working the last hours before the New Year.
I base this review upon the five or so seasons that aired before this was cancelled, not on anything that may have come later, including the feature-length releases, which I have no intention of watching.
Look, before you ask me what the hell I am talking about, let me just get things straight.
So, before I sat down and started to watch this show, I told myself 'this better be good' and my God was it GOOD.
This questioned is answered somewhat through testimonies but also quite literally by showing viewers photographs before they were cropped, such as the infamous leach photograph.
A year before she let her inner screwball comedienne emerge in "Theodora Goes Wild", a severe-looking Dunne is saddled with a stiff, uninteresting part as Stephanie, and she is not aided much by a bumptious Randolph Scott, who has to play the somewhat ignorant and judgmental Jack on a relative one note.
He introduces fake basement-tape video reenactments (a device he has used before) to augment the visuals of the Abu Ghraib abuses--close-ups of "prisoners'" bodies, blood dripping on a uniform, keys going into a lock--so that after a while you aren't sure what is real and what is fake.
She weds Dr. Jan Stockman (Otto Kruger, playing a nice guy for a change) the night before the Japanese air attack that presaged the invasion.
In any event, history takes its course and Corregidor falls but not before some of the women, including Royce are flown out (in reality, American army nurses were captured by the Japanese and while they were spared the horrors of the Bataan Death March, they didn't exactly have a nice time for the next three years either).
He's never shot anyone before and pleads with them not to pick up their guns.
By the end you are stupider than you were before.
Having said that, then, there is the dancing of Astaire and Rogers, unmatched by anyone before or since.
This was an expensive production and the last film Hitchcock directed in England before leaving for America.
Just before leaving England for Hollywood to shoot "Rebecca", Hitchcock squeezed into his schedule this windswept adventure for Charles Laughton's Mayflower Films.
Jamaica Inn was the last film Alfred Hitchcock made in England before going to Hollywood before the war and from the sloppy look of it he must have been in an awful hurry.
Alfred Hitchcock directed this old English costume drama, before taking his work to Hollywood.
Hitchcock, making his last movie in England before leaving for the United States, supposedly became so bored during filming that he didn't care what the actors did.
In the days before social welfare became a responsibility of government, these bosses while they enriched themselves also fed a lot of hungry people, giving them food and fuel for a winter.
It would go something like this...."'I never knew the old Vienna before the war with its - 'what?"
We saw it on every available occasion and it was not long before I had chalked up ten viewings.
I could go on at great length about those tremendous set-pieces, Harry Lime's appearance in the doorway, Holly Martin's disastrous performance at the literary meeting, the ride on the Ferris wheel and the sewer chase, but it has all been said before.
Carol Reed was at the height of his powers when he made "The Third Man", but he still had something almost as great to give before his slow decline.
That in essence is the very nature of film-noir, where it began before demanding the appearance of a sexy blonde with evil intentions.
Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here.
Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short.
"I never knew the Old Vienna, before the war, with its Strauss Music," opens Carol Reed's The Third Man, and we catch a glimpse of the New Vienna, with its Black Market and its Shady Deals.
Firstly, I must say that I saw Some Kind Of Monster before I saw this Classic Album doco, so my attachment to the inner workings of this band was already well established.
This doco it seems was made right before the implosion that was Some Kind Of Monster, and really works to capture the tension between the band, and the egotistical traits that they would try to rub out in the future.
I never thought much of these guys before, but I now have a much better appreciation of their work since seeing this video.
The only faulty thing I didn't like about it was that it lacked good popular music like the other four before pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker.
Douglas has played this part before, but he does it well, and Mortenson is good as well.
I had not seen Dial M for Murder before I watched this film, so I had very few expectations about this film.
With all the hoopla I'd heard about this movie before its release, I was expecting a lot more.
I've seen that done 100 times before and 1,000 times better.
Gwyneth Paltrow as Emily Bradford Taylor is also a great character, because although she is having an affair with another man, she's prepared to come clean with her husband before he tries to have her murdered.
What makes a mystery really good is when the audience is asking - literally minutes before the end - how are they going to do it?
I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better.
But if you had read the packet before you watched it you would already know this.
This is easily arranged by recruiting as many ladies as possible to seek confession of their sins before the Cardinal.
The replacements are a really mixed bag, a sergeant who Lancaster has served with before and respects highly in Jonathan Goldsmith, a very green and eager second lieutenant in Joe Unger, a demolitions man who is a draftee and at that time Vietnam service was a strictly volunteer thing in Craig Wasson, and a medic who is also a junkie in Dennis Howard.
I said before this could be a prequel to Platoon.
He is closest to a real character because the general in charge their before Johnson raised the troop levels and put in William Westmoreland was Paul Harkins.
For some reason, I hadn't seen this film before.
With the handful of men, both US GI's and local RVN troops, at his disposable Maj. Barker knows that it's only a matter of time before the determined and tenacious Vietcong will achieve their objective.
This film came out the year before 'Apocalypse Now', and possibly that's one reason why it's not so well known today, having been pushed out of the limelight by Coppola's monstrosity which set a disappointing trend for later Vietnam films.
"Spartans" superbly demonstrates the problems American advisors encountered in Vietnam before the United States escalated its involvement.
Wendell Mayes' sterling script -- it's profane, dryly perceptive and often sardonically funny, with a laudably obdurate refusal to resort to either cheap macho heroics or mushy patriotic sentiment which goes a long way in explaining exactly why it spent seven years languishing on a shelf before third-tier studio Avco Embassy finally decided to make it into a movie -- spells out the savage, upsetting reality of war in very stark, bleak and no uncertain terms: It's nothing more than a horrendous, chaotic, futile ordeal in which the participants do their utmost to stay alive and intact under circumstances of ever-increasing severity.
GO TELL THE SPARTANS looks at Vietnam in 1964, before the conflict there was thoroughly Americanized.
There has been criticism of this movie as being dull and unrealistic (probably from someone who wasn't even born before the events depicted in the movie).
Remaining still existing pictures of Lon Chaney in full make-up effect added to the hype of this movie and also the fact that this Tod Browning movie features vampires, 4 years before he made the horror-classic "Dracula", starring Bela Lugosi.
Like mentioned before, the make-up effects also looked really convincing and are now part of the movie its legacy and status among movie lovers.
The people of that era weren't used to those kinds of images on the screen, so I imagine that they were probably petrified by Chaney and his ghastly makeup, which, for its day, was superb, as I stated before.
He was captured before he could do this - possibly one of the most unexpected blessings in American history, for Bonaparte would not have stopped being Bonaparte if he had landed here.
Sure there are some moments that excite and Woo crafts some decent suspense among the action sequences but generally you get the feeling you have seen it before and basically it is all half hearted.
Hale manages to eject from the Stealth before Deakins kills him, Deakins then drops the unarmed bombs & ejects himself leaving the plane to crash.
I don't think so, the truck itself had at least a 10 second head start before we even discuss how slow it would have to have been going for Hale to physically run after it & catch it up.
Okay, so I've seen a lot of rated R movies before this and well before I turned 18.
John Woo during the early to mid 90's had a range of good films in Hollywood before he went stupid during the 2000's.
In sum: a thoughtfully   rewarding film about two very different German brothers lost in  Japan and discovering a fine gray line dividing the point of no  return from the point just before it and overcoming that dualism.
Though I wasn't even born yet to watch the original series when it was on, I did watch it in reruns on sci-fi a few years ago before they took it off the air.
Yes this theme has been done before but there were many surprising twists and shocks that usually are taboo in films like this.
Eberhardt also underplays the gore as he never shows any of the torture the hunter inflicts on Diana before letting her loose in the wild.
Also, the actions of the local townspeople from Dwight to Diana's flatmate Rita (Lisa Hill) never seem unrealistic (though the ending did seem a little out of place after everything which had gone before it).
In the late 1970's Hansen kidnapped female dancers and prostitutes before stripping them naked and hunting them down in Alaska.
He killed 15 women before he was caught.
A group of relatives and business associates gather at the home of an elderly gentlemen who has decided to give away his fortune before an inheritance tax takes effect that night at midnight (Oh, for the good old days!).
The movie then quickly gets down to familiar but nonetheless pleasing business as the camera focuses on Charley Grapewin, who quickly and cleverly explains to his assembled relatives what nice round figures each will realize from his $6 million will, provided of course that his long-lost grand-daughter doesn't turn up before the clock strikes twelve.
Jasper Whyte calls all of his associates and friends (few in number) to his house (on a night with plenty of rain, thunder, and lightning) to give away all of his estate before an inheritance tax would lessen the amount.
The three little film bits he did for Disney during the 1980s was the BEST thing that came out of the Disney studio for that entire decade (AND the decade before), but Disney otherwise rejected his pitches for a feature film entirely.
(As legend has it, the film's co-producer, Richard Kaye, allegedly made off with the film's completion money before the film was done.)
Later, during a rapid-fire telephone exchange, Grant responds to another actor's line with "The last person to say that to me was Archibald Leach just before he cut his throat!"
The film is also perhaps the perfect example of Hawks' trademarked rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, which has never been as fast nor as furious anywhere else before or since.
Completely ahead of its times, this is an interesting view on feminism thirty years before the term became public knowledge, and if one listens closely, a study in verbal sexual interplay.
But anyone who believes in magic, who wants to see wonders unfold before their eyes and who can be silly for the duration of the film will find it an absolute treat.
Rumors are that Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell actually asked Mike Jittlov to visit them to preview a little film they'd thrown together called "Evil Dead" because they wanted someone who they respected to give the thumbs up to their movie before it debuted!
I can safely confess now that I hadn't ever seen it before, but that's no reason for you to make the same mistake: Go buy/rent it NOW!
Well keep on remembering, because you'll get NONE of that in this, the third installment of sequels that should've stopped before they began.
He discovers who the bad guys are, bonds with a living person and enlists the aid of some he can trust that had been involved with the case before he was executed.
And for those of you totally hateful towards that film, read the screenplay that comes on the Special Edition DVD for a look at what that film was supposed to be before producer Jeff Most got his hands in it.
I do believe that he had a very bright future ahead of him in Hollywood if his life hadn't been cut short, but it's the fact that he died at such a young age and before his career could've taken off that has given him such a legendary status among fans.
The way he talks is delicious, ****SPOILER**** and he has tons of heart and rage when he addresses his friends (Dunst when she claimed she wanted to die) and adversaries (every villain he toyed with before killing them) and strangers (the drug-using stripper at the club whose age he asked before freeing her).
Her best scene was when she had informed Mabius that it was her information that had led the bad cops to his figurative door before his arrest/execution.
The first time was because Mabius' friend distracted her before losing his own life, and the second time was because her gun only had one bullet in it.
Not only the acting of the player is perfect but also it is almost unbelievable that none had every acted before.
Her younger sister Guler, on the other hand, likes Recep, but the feeling is not mutual in that case.Towards the end of the movie we see the watermelon vendor selling all of his product by telling a one-liner: If you build up your ship out of watermelon you will sink down fast.Recept cannot be together with Nihal either because they turns out to have moved before he opens his feelings.
I live in Ankara capital city of the Turkey and I also went to Kutahya before.
(see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off.
Like I said before there is nothing wrong with the looks of this movie.
Which before watching this anime I was afraid of.
Also, the cameraman/director could benefit from understanding the Five C's of Cinematography (Camera Angles, Continuity, Close-Ups, Cutting, Composition) before calling for the poorly framed close-ups and two shots I was seeing.
They were then blindfolded for 'security reasons' and, ammunition being scarce, hit on the back of the neck with metal bars before being cast into a pit.
Richner worked in Kampuchea before, during and after Pol Pot, and his coal-face assessment agrees with most historians.
With no real plot, it gives us nothing more than an inside look at a 1960s graduating high school class's last night cruising the town before officially becoming adults.
The film also features a young Harrison Ford (before he proved himself to be a good actor).
Its locale appears before the Federal and state highway systems eliminated isolated rural areas with two-lane blacktops.
Richard Dreyfuss provides the intelligence, Ron Howard the aloof personality, Paul LeMat the muscle, and Charles Martin Smith the comic relief as the four main players in director George Lucas' first major breakthrough in movies before his adventure with the 'Star Wars' films began in 1977.
It took place well before I was born and I had never been to California.
On one level, it appeals to Americans (and Canadians) ideal of a simple time: it takes place just shortly before JFK was assassinated and American pop culture went out the window in a mayhem of drugs, acid-rock, and bizarre envelope-ripping behaviours and lifestyles.
I watched this the day before going to University.
Every student must watch this film before going to University because it highlights those qualities of youth so well and so elegantly that one cannot help feel tinges of remorse and sentiment at the sight of the plane soaring into the sky carrying the boy to University and away from his childhood.
The editing is particularly good, depicting the experiences of all main characters as they go through the last night of celebration before going off to college.
Time is a speeding train.We must embrace the good times of our life,particularly those of our youth,while we have them,because they are gone before we know it.This is the lesson I get while watching American Graffiti.This is not just a classic film with featuring a heavyweight Hollywood line up in their youth,it is one of the ultimate lessons of life.Times change,people change,and those changes take place with a lightning fast speed that we never seem to see coming.We owe George Lucas and everyone involved in the making of this film a great deal of gratitude for teaching us this.Also,who doesn't fall in love with Suzanne Somers while watching this.We see her only for a moment,but that's all it takes.WOW!
In "American Graffiti", director George Lucas follows the misadventures of four Californian teenagers one late summer night in 1962 as the focal point for an audience trip back to the last innocent year of the 60's, before the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam and revolting students.
It wasn't long, however, before the general mood of nostalgia became more widespread with an increasing number of people becoming interested in other pop culture commodities of the era such as movies,TV shows, cars and clothes.
These kids were still dealing with the all important activities of cruising, muscle cars, going steady, street racing, the choice between beach music and rock & roll, and whether or not they should wait a year before going off to college.
I remember watching this movie on May 31, 2002, the night before my high school graduation and when I watch this film, it reminded me of the things that happened with me throughout my senior year: from a guy I knew, who cheated on his girlfriend with a cheerleader, to the terrorist attack that tore America apart; causing Americans to go against one another, from the crushes, the heartbreaks, prom night, to Spider-Man being the movie of the year, graduation rehearsal, and technology becoming the new aspect in my life and when I watched American Graffiti, it reminded me of when the good times meant something with those around me.
This movie superbly exemplifies the phrase "The calm before the storm" It gives the entire movie audience a crystal ball concept analysis report that sparks a bittersweet realization and empathy for everyone who plays a significant role in this George Lucas masterpiece!!
After cruising with Milner all night, teenage Carol hates to say goodbye but does, waving from her porch with the light on; Toad survives one bad accident after another, but his real moment is in hearing praise from his date (fantastic, husky-voiced Candy Clark, dolled up like a speeding Sandra Dee) just before she says good night; after chasing his dream date all night, Kurt (Richard Dreyfuss, green and anxious, and appealingly bemused) finally gets to talk to the stunning blonde wonder on the telephone, where she whispers a wrenching goodbye.
Although "Red Nights of the Gestapo" is extremely boring, poorly made and totally unmemorable, I somewhat feel obliged to reward it with a *slightly* higher rating than the majority of Nazisploitation flicks I've seen before.
Of course, this story has been shown before but, the talent of the actors make you feel as though you are watching a true life documentary such as, Investigative Reports(Bill Kurtis).
So we've seen films about the inner city before (Boyz N'the Hood, Menace II Society) this one.
I saw this movie at a film festival before it was released to the general public and poor Nicole Kidman got boo-ed by a lot of the people who had come to see the movie.
I'm glad I saw most of his works and some DVD Extras before I saw this one.
I have seen 'coming of age' movies before but none can come close to this one.
i saw this movie back before i even heard of the sixth sense.
i saw it because i saw a trailer for it before another movie i had rented.
Made in 1998 it was just before his big stuff hit the screens.
Buying the Cow had some comedy flow but it was not what I expected before purchasing.
So before you praise the overall romance of the film, consider what implications are being accepted.
Look at the postmistress in the moments before she gives the German sergeant his comeuppance, watch her facial expression and wonder whether the Nazi was getting what she'd have liked to have given her late husband, all very edgy for 1942.
Years before Jack Higgins would turn the concept into his bestseller (and later still a fine film) called The Eagle Has Landed writers John Dighton, Angus MacPhail and Diana Morgan would take a short story by famed writer Graham Greene (The Third Man, Our Man In Hanvana etc.)
Sure it was great for the first few remakes but in every movie you lead the audience to believe someone will actually survive and you kill them off like 10 seconds before the credits?
If not before long, hit movies like Grease, Jaws, The Godfather and Scarface will be remade.
There is nothing too brainy about the storyline, given that it's a prequel trying to explain how things came about, and because it's something that chronologically had happened before, there's no prize in guessing who survives, or not, which makes the finale a bit of a bore.
And to think I watched this before my week long hiatus too :P  Welcome to the slaughterhouse.
Film Review: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning Starring: R. Lee Emery and Jordana Brewster Directed By: Jonathan Liebesman Okay, before I go into reviewing this film I should let you all know where I stand on the 2003 remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.
This is before he starts wearing human skin so he dons a real black leather mask to hide his deformity.
Not for the faint hearted and far superior then any of the Texas Chainsaw's before it.
Only draw might be to see some hot chicks before they get offed.
Not only that, you can predict what's going to happen at the end before you even hit the 30-minute mark.
Hooper's 1974 original is, as others before me have said, brilliant for what it doesn't show; it created a terrifying atmosphere and utilized locations and techniques that made the events seem very real.
"The Beginning" then dives into a story we've all seen too many times before.
This story is in 1963, right before the events of the 2003 film which took place in the early seventies.
Had this film been release before Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes, or the Saw Franchise, more of the film would have ended up on the cutting room floor.
Disney was busy trying to lift the art of animation to new heights by having his artists do an "under the sea" type of thing, long before anyone would be seeing films like PINOCCHIO or THE LITTLE MERMAID.
Easy to see that Disney was doing experimental procedures for PINOCCHIO before its release two years later.
Both were playing characters of a type that they had played before -- so perhaps not too original.
We are introduced to a character, Frank Keller, that just achieved 20 years in service, that can't see really something after the retirement (that is what he hears of a lot, about the retirement) and that not long before he had a divorce (one the guys from his job is now with his ex-wife.
Little Sean says that before Clara even explains a word about her identity.
As I've said before, therefore this movie earns his credits.
I have seen nothing like it, before or since.
Do it soon before an American studio buys up the rights to re-make and ruin it.
As a fan of Asian horror, I had bought this movie before the American re-make.
Also, I've never seen any sort of Asian horror before, but I like the few horror classics I've seen (Halloween, Scream, etc.).
I had seen the American re-make before this film, and i'm kind of glad I did, because I got to save the best for last.
Her line, "Can't you just leave town before you blow up?"
It begins with Dean finally revealing the "secret" of what his father said about Sam before dying.
Dean finally tells Sam the last words of John Winchester before dying, and opens his heart about his dilemma and feelings.
The biggest disappointment is reserved for fans of La Collins - she makes a tiny cameo appearance moments before the end, for no good reason, then the film finishes.
Despite ninja mania in full swing at the time, the show curiously lasted for only one season before disappearing as quickly as......um.......well, a ninja in fact.
i wouldn't recommend you see this before Ichi the killer as it may not want you to watch Ichi the killer as much, SO watch it as a prequel and not before.
The primary setting for 1-ichi is a school, so this is presumably supposed to have taken place before Ichi the Killer.
Rivalry flares up and it isn't long before their is a showdown between Ichi and Onizame.
This movie was a chance to make film history by featuring Murphy in his own exciting story, something that's never been done before or since.
The fact is that he held that ground alone for well over an hour before the germans finally gave up.
He was an equal opportunity soldier, doing everything the front line combatant is required to do in order to take and hold ground through Sicily, Italy, France, and into Germany...  All of the events recounted in the film take place before Murphy was 19 years old...
My favorite scenes are the drugged up nymphet delinquent girls and Mastroianni sliding down a huge slide as his sexual history flashes before his eyes.
You will laugh harder than you ever have before at a Fellini movie.
This movie worms its way into your own psyche in time - as with other Fellini movies, it seems to reveal scenes that are totally new and surprising, yet strangely familiar to me even though I've never seen them before.
But the movie, though flawed and a rehash of some other familiar Fellini themes treated more successfully elsewhere, is also delightful in parts, with a power in the use of visual symbols that I have rarely seen before, even in his own, more overall successful movies.
you have to kill about half of them before they budge.
Bitista and his cronies in the government army and Cuban police seeing that the end is near, with them facing long prison terms or the firing squad, flee the country just before New Year's Eve 1959.
Standing at the podium of the UN that just hours before was almost hit by a bazooka shell, that landed harmlessly in the East River, fired by anti-Castro Cubans Che laid out the principles behind the Cuban Revolution that he was so proud to be part of.
I haven't seen many films since 2009 came, three visits to the movie theater before the one to see Che Part One (The Argentine) and of that three visits I had not really entirely pleasant experiences since Bedtime Stories is simply a bad movie, RocknRolla is just OK and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was not bad at all yet was not my cup of tea (certainly to read my entire opinion of those movies you can check my comments!).
"I was trying to find the scenes that would happen before or after the scene you would typically see in a movie like this," says Soderbergh.
Here, his campaign to recruit local peasant farmers fails, and before he and his small band of revolutionaries are able to launch any sort of major anti government attack, they are hunted down and killed with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency.
So like most of those that have come before it, Che is a movie that is best appreciated under no pretence; this is a history lesson disguised as film, and while it does tell a good story, those looking for entertainment best look away.
Yet it doesn't matter how or why you know of Guevara before you view Che because Peter Buchman does a fine job of introducing you to him here.
Maybe the most refreshing thing about Che, both parts, is that its director, Steven Soderbergh, didn't know anything about Ernesto "Che" Guevara before taking on the project.
Naturally, it's not long before Paco is attracting attention from the Government; and the pair's different objectives soon lead to fights amongst themselves.
Like Bullet for the General and Big Gundown before, it's another political western in which the hero has to make a choice between material gain and revolutionary commitment.
Phew, lucky I decided to check it before erasing it.
Last week, I came across a sale of Italian DVDs of several Spaghetti Westerns; I managed to purchase 4 of them and, being one of 2 I hadn't watched before, this ended up as the first I checked out.
It has an interesting structure, since the bulk of the film is told in flashback before returning to the beginning and then reaching the grand finale.
But sadly I was once again disappointed, as I have been many times before when that line has been used to describe a horror/gore/splatter film.
I had never seen it before, and knew it was going to be sad.
I had never even heard of this film before Mondo Macabro announced their upcoming DVD release of it, so I was surprised to find - after I had already ordered it online - that Leonard Maltin had in fact reviewed it in his Guide and gave it his proverbial *1/2 rating usually allotted to such sensationalist fare.
The first real film from a director who went on to do a lot of interesting work in the 1970's and 80's before his tragic death by drowning in 1986.
The film was sold as a mixture of sex and horror and the sex is provided by a bevy of stunning Euro babes including Valerie Boisgel and Michele Perello who went on to feature in Morgane et ses Nymphes before disappearing into the hinterlands of porn.
Vic Morrow, as Coach Turner, gave some of the greatest lines..  Morrow to his young little league team in the dugout before the championship game, I don't want to talk to you about winning.
Though his open defiance and teen-cool stance masquerades a need to be liked and wanted, he still provides a mean spark before coming into his own.
Set smack dab in small-town, flag-waving America, director Michael Ritchie, who scored critical points the year before in the little-seen but dead-on satire "Smile," hits a box-office home run this time, always keeping things popping and managing to toss in a few interesting curve balls in the plot to keep it from falling into a typical "root for the underdog" comedy.
In my opinion, as I have stated before, it depends on how it is handeld.
We had a "second run" theater nearby where you could see films for a dollar or 50 cents before 2 o'clock, so I know I saw it at least a dozen times (it played at the theater for about 3 months).
A comedy about an area rarely touched until then in films (a scene in the James Garner - Kim Novak comedy BOYS NIGHT OUT was one of the few that dealt with Little League before this full study of it), THE BAD NEWS BEARS is a nice reaffirmation on what sports is supposed to be about: fun.
I obviously heard about this movie from the show I love the 70's on VH1, way before the remake with Billy Bob Thorton.
He would have known he was a hot commodity before Big Jim Murray (Wheeler Oakman) and Belle Harris (Florence Dudley) ever put the finger on him.
Final Fantasy VIII gave me something I had never seen before in a video game...a challenge.
The movie moves swiftly from Kansas City where Payne's character Joe Rolfe is before Miranda thoroughly grilled to where he takes over the identity of gangster Phil Harris who was one of the robbers.
The noir is a huge umbrella, encompassing, covering many and various things ,from the bleak, grizzly fatalism to the adventurous, suspenseful thriller to comic books approaches and to the mere police procedural; it refers to a historical cultural phenomenon that began before it is generally acknowledged that it did, and ended later than it is generally admitted.
Also, down in Mexico, the good guy in the film, "Joe Rolfe" (John Payne) is an impostor, pretending he's "Peter Harris," one of the crooks who got caught by the cops and knocked off just before heading south.
Precisely how he would do this we never learn (presumably he would have somehow killed them before they could identify him by his voice).
He gets the third degree from the police, before they find out his alibi is checking out.
Subsequently I think that if this film is intended for people to show to their parents or mates to illustrate metal in general, then it scores highly (although the old story about Satanism and Black Metal is a little over done - we've heard all that before).
Personally I watched this film mainly just to make sure that metal was not being defaced on screen as has happened many times before - I have no complaints.
So, no, this documentary doesn't tell you things you hadn't already known before, but it helps you to relume your passion about Metal.
Opening with the age-old question of what was the first heavy metal song before launching into a metal head's history of the genre this fascinating documentary is a must.
Given the small number of people who have rated this movie, I must conclude that this "mini"-series is not well known at all, but the people who have seen it may be interested in what I am going to point out: I saw it in December 2004, that is to say 6 months before "Lost" was aired on TV in western Europe.
At this point it's kind of hard to not wonder how important the box is, but unfortunately, the box is already in the NSA's hands before they find out about Janek, and so they drive away with no money and no little black box.
In fact, he is really Martin Brice, a 1960's college radical who, with his colleague Cosmo, used to hack into computer databases with the intention of moving money toward left-wing political causes--25 years before the launch of the World Wide Web.
I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next.
Overall an enjoyable film which incorporates computer hacking before it was mainstream.
Now we come full circle so to speak , we've made Baattle Galactica again , Star Trek in Dec , and more are coming out , Land of the Lost and V: The Second Coming , so why is Hollywood afraid of remaking Space:1999 , with today's technology and the use of more nuclear devices , doesn't it seem more real to remake Space:1999 with a possible return flight to the Moon , call it Space:2020 or Space:2112 the future is now people , it's here before us .
Haven't we seen this sort of thing before?
As for those that say it was boring, like all first seasons the show was developing a direction and was positioned for a killer second season (before they butchered it without giving it a chance to grow that is).
What stands in my mind is how, eight to ten minutes before the end of nearly every episode, the society on a new planet encountered by the Alphans ends up being destroyed, usually at the hand of Commander John Koenig, because what it seeks does not meet with the life Alphans are used to.
At the time the series was spawned, it was very conceivable (and we all wanted to believe) the man would be stationed in space and upon the moon before the dawn of the new century.
The production and writing staff seemed to keep the Alphan basics as: "that is possible before the new millennium."
If you are a fan of (as these things go) smart, complicated, visually striking vintage SF TV & you haven't seen Space 1999--go and buy it & watch it--you're in for a treat--and there are enough episodes you can spend pretty much 48 hours straight with it before you run out of content...
The idiotic and constantly angry chief of police, the wise-cracking cop who learned his trade 'on the street', the portrayal of a strong female character as 'that big bitch over there' and the solving of the case after finding a match book (surely that has been used in Scooby Doo before!).
I'd never heard of this film before TCM started screening it as a late night filler - and initially woke up in the middle of it when Holloway and co were singing the poignant and totally unexpected The World is for the Young.
This movie could very well be the swan song of a cooler time before we got caught up in Viet Nam, Norhern Ireland, campus demonstrations, drugs, race riots and the rest.
Those who hope to see a lot of Errol Flynn in this movie will be disappointed ... it is a good hour before he makes his appearance as Miles Hendon.
The question is, once Hendon is convinced that he's in the presence of the true King, can he get him to the coronation before the beggar is crowned?
Norfolk was on the outs with Henry in 1547 (he was facing execution - his son the Earl of Surrey was executed the year before - but Henry's own death saved Norfolk).
Twain knew his characters well and it he had any trouble with getting the idiom just right he need only have looked to Charles Dickens who was writing about just such people a generation before.
Flynn was the biggest name in the cast, but the film is half over before he makes his appearance.
I hope the actors in this film kept their day jobs before going into acting because they put forth the worst effort I've ever seen.
Notice that in a series of death scenes in the same room all take place in a curiously clean space, even though someone died brutally in the same spot not five minutes before.
We had been here before, joking about all these cheesy movies, but one movie we had always mentioned was Jackhammer Massacre.
It turnsout in the end, after all of Duke Togo's near misses and narrow escapes, "a brain" housed in a control center is responsible for stealing the Cassandra-G virus, and you must destroy the sensors guarding the brain, and destroy the brain itself, before it is too late...
It should be known before I start that I'm not a fan of anime at all whatsoever.
I think it may come off a tame when compared to the later excesses in Japanese animation, such as post-apocalyptic slug-fest filled with showering viscera, city- leveling psychic children and titanic robots, female ninjas with poisonous naughty bits, and the ever-popular spectacle of sailor-suited schoolgirls having their every orifice explored by the tentacles and other bits of demonic rapists just before they explode in a torrent of offal and demonic DNA, but Golgo 13 has all of them beat for sheer quality entertainment that even your parents might dig.
With out ruining all the films twists and turns (I recommend reading as few reviews as possible before seeing the film), this is a great little thriller.
This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist.
But before he goes to Beverly Hills he has a good old fashioned ass chewing by inspector Todd.
While slowly killing each one of them off as they're stuck in an isolated setting is a traditional "10 Little Indians" horror film motif that writer Michael Cooney employs, the Twilight Zone aspects allow him to trump the sense of horror and despair, as the surviving characters come to realize that they are not in charge of their own lives, they can't call the shots, and their illusions about their realities crumble before their eyes.
I've never before seen a film that made me sit on the edge of my seat practically from the opening credits.
I'd never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before (except for a film called "Max", but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was).
I was invited to the Dragonblade Charity Premiere (in Hong Kong) and I watched the movie before it was released in the cinemas.
After all, the law, at least as we proclaim it, reflects an egalitarian standard (everyone is equal before the law), and on that basis Power is guilty in some sense of a crime since he has valued some lives over that of others.
Here he certainly had his chance to prove his acting skills and he does a splendid job in a grim role, one of his last parts before his premature death from a heart attack at age 45.
This was practically Tyrone Power's last hurrah; in his early forties when the movie was filmed, he died of a heart attack on a project shortly thereafter (as his actor-father Tyrone Power Sr. had before him).
It should keep fans of the cartoon amused as well as thrill young kids who may not have ever heard of Dennis before now.
The only recollection I have of Wilson even speaking civilly to Dennis before he 'ran away' was when he briefly explained why he kept his coins in a safe.
As I had never heard of the film before, and taking into consideration that this was a British, (And therefore shot on a shoestring budget!
As a mystery, it works very fine as well although I think most people might be able to pick out the murderer well before either Withers or Piper.
A first rate comedy and who-done-it, that led to MURDER AT THE BLACKBOARD and MURDER ON THE HONEYMOON before the two stars went their separate ways.
In 1932, a year after Dashiel Hammett had introduced the "hard boiled" detective to novels and films with his Sam Spade in THE MALTESE FALCON (a decade before the Oscar winning remake we all know today!
), while Philo Vance was still at his peak, Charlie Chan had just started his marathon run, and two years before Dashiel Hammett would backtrack to seemingly invent the "comedy mystery" in the first of the THIN MAN series, Stuart Palmer's "Hildegarde Withers" stories were pointing the way to that perfect bantering comedy.
Connoisseurs of period mystery should especially treasure THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER for its location shots of some now vanished (or at least radically transformed) Manhattan landmarks - most notably the then New York City Aquarium (long before the institution decamped to Brooklyn).
From 1855 to 1890, it was the United States' immigration depot before Ellis Island was built, and as such, the first ground in America millions of immigrants set foot on.
On the plus side, it does have some good action sequences (this was in the days before horses learned to gallop in slow motion), and uses the Indians as enemy only for dramatic effect and not as a source of derision.
It also gives us a look at a young Charlton Heston, before he became a staple of the large, big budget biblical epics.
He was hot off "Top Gun" the year before, but he's not a comedy director.
It is so well observed you can see aspects of dog behaviour not noticed before.
The boy who played Nat was pretty good, and he gave me the odd feeling I had seen him before, though I have no idea where.
I can't believe I missed renting this film before.
But if you know that this movie sucks before going in, and you're down with that, you should be just fine.
As mentioned before, the premise of this film contains no logic at all.
The idea of writing an action-adventure story featuring realistically rendered human characters in fantastic, albeit serious short subjects hadn't been done before, unless it would be highly obscure.
But the robots are easily defeated and the whole thing is over before you can become too bored.
Jeff Daniels has never portrayed an oaf as likable as Harry Dunne before--all his character's were quite respectable and normal prior to Dumb & Dumber.
Made eleven years before his impressive feature length debut "Fando y Lis" (1968), Jodorowsky's first film "La Cravate" (aka.
And to think I had never heard of it before I rented it.
Vitus, who of course, is just as talented and intelligent as before, devices a plan to rescue his grandfather from almost poverty, as well as his own father.
Small wonder he's an arrogant, precocious little brat long before he's reached puberty (he's already planning on attending college at age 13).
I have NEVER been bothered before to even look at the cast in a movie, not to talk of looking a movie up online.
And, in a good nod to realism, one soldier eats canned meat that clearly has an American label on it (something Stalin NEVER would have allowed in a film--since he ALONE is why the Russians prevailed, or so it would have been portrayed if the film had been made before his death in 1953).
Now 14, he played in person before the screening and proved that, in fact, all the musicianship on display is real.
Going in to plot details is unnecessary because chances are you've heard all of this before and seen all of this before done in about half the action movies released in the last 20 years.
When Czechoslovakia was loosening up ten years later, a number of quality movies were produced before the Soviet crackdown, and now that China is, if not being internally liberated, at least sliding sideways into the global village, we're beginning to see some admirably done Chinese films.
And apparently Muharrem failed to accomplish last stage before achieving "perfection".
To make matters worse, the story was not even presented in a very coherent manner - maybe that's a bit harsh as i did fall asleep once or twice - ok maybe that's when the 'horror bit' happened before anyone tells me!
Hidden behind the sexploitation is actually a little gem of a movie, with a good story and a great central performance from Brad Dourif, who I haven't encountered before.
Otherwise I would have heard of it before.
The film will focus on Alyosha's travels in a minute and careful manner, observing one such instance in which the failure to identify the moment when it is apparently necessary to bribe someone, almost getting caught out and rectifying the situation before applying the said learning later on under different conditions.
The initial thrill, at least for the audience, in these two coming together is part-cruelly, part-wonderfully interrupted by the train's large, wooden door being torn open by a guard on the outside who then engages in talk with Alyosha, before he himself is able to renew acquaintances with Shura.
The two bond as the train steams on ahead, before stopping at a number of stations, before slowly turning over and heading on out of them again.
The director, in his introduction before the film, stated that his intent was to make something of a "moving graphic novel set to music" (I'm paraphrasing).
but before all this you have to watch thousands useless plots... Bad cinema!
Or when Apollo's brother is shot down and killed just seconds before reaching the safe haven Galactica.
The thing about this episode that didn't make sense is the locals not recognizing Red Eye as a Cylon before Apollo arrived, considering that these people originated from the Colonies as well, and the husband of one of the women was a Colonial Warrior.
When I first watched this show back a couple of years ago, it just caught me like no other had ever done before.
Now, like Star Trek before it, the much-maligned series looks set for a possible revival, with ongoing fan interest stirring rival camps to vie for production rights for a new series or cinema version.
And with it, I think Chukrai deserves a place alongside the early masters of Soviet film, that is, before the Stalinist tyranny descended.
This is the story of a young girl growing up in a brothel in Storyville, New Orleans when the brothels were very popular and just before they were all shut down.
He manages to hug and kiss his mother before he heads back to the front.
I was begging for the credits to roll an hour before they did.
Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
The film had only been available in Germany and Russia before now.
The atmosphere created by this movie is quite unique, rarely before or after achieved on the film.
There was other games that appeared that used video to tell their story, but no game before did to the extent of Wing Commander 3.
They did something that had never been done before.
In conclusion, even though it can also be seen on Nick at Nite now, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.
This the kind of movie, popular at the time, in which a protagonist who is possibly a murderer is befriended by a girl/woman who's never met him before - for example Alad Ladd and Veronica Lake in The Blue Dahlia and/or in which a street-wise gal like Guild here, has to have the expressions 'private eye' and 'shamus' explained to her.
I swear I had never heard of her before this.
He enjoyed a few years in the Hollywood limelight (Lifeboat, Marriage Is A Private Affair, Desert Fury, Command Decision) before his untimely death in 1955.
My own son, Greg, was reading and doing math beyond a second grade level well before he began kindergarten.
Really, he's NEVER seen a music staff before?
My father was killed in a car accident three days before I would have celebrated my third birthday.
The Comedy Network has lucked out, and putting Comedy Inc. right before The Daily Show is good news too, and will surely increase increase the audience.
Some movies are like olives or wine; you need to have developed a taste before you can fully enjoy them.
Pregnant and alone, she relies on her employer (Brent) and his aunt (Watson) and before long agrees to wed Brent, who is very much in love with her.
They reluctantly did so but praised him for putting their welfare before his pride.
this is kill bill 30 years ago before that douche bag milked it....the out fit Lucy lui wears in the snow garden and the music is from lady snowblood.
Yuki's mother was able to kill Tokuichi, but before getting her retribution towards the others was imprisoned.
What I Did Not Like: I was nearly half-way through the film, starting to get concerned where it was going, before all the character/story sub-plots were connected.
Though made before the WTC crashed, this is still a good reflection on highjacking and "sub-jacking".
Never before had such a hot cartoon leading lady been released by a major film studio and audiences of the day were both incensed and excited at the prospect!
The wolf makes sure he gets there before Red does.
I had read the book many times before and was really amused at the faithfulness of the performances, especially those of Mr Collins, Mr Darcy, Miss Bennet and Mrs Bennet.
I have seen this movie countless times and each time I enjoy it as much as the time before.
The whole cast has a class I had never seen before.
I tried to read P&P before but couldn't finish the first a couple of pages, under a false impression coming from reading the first quarter of sense and sensibility that the heroine in P&P was also full of vanity and conceit.
When I finished the series, I had such a feeling of satisfaction as no entertainment has ever before granted me.
I've not seen its like on television before; nor do I expect to see its like again.
However, unlike many of the films made during that time period Lady Snowblood remains popular because while its plot had been done many times before, including Suzuki Norifumi's Sex and Fury which was filmed the same year and whose background plot is almost identical to Lady Snowblood, it possesses a certain style that differentiates it from many other films from this time period namely that the heroine seems to be able to keep her clothes on throughout the entire film and that while it has lots of blood and gore, another influence evident in Kill Bill, it is not too overdone.
Trained by a stern priest in martial arts and swordplay the "child of the netherworld" Yuki begins her search for those who destroyed her family and her own life before she was even born.
I had to try it on many people before I lost my nerve, with some rather hilarious results.
I had never heard of this before until I saw this on Encore late at night when I was hoping for something to fall to sleep to.
While Mrs. Hamilton lost her husband on another continent, the Nazis murdered Margaret's parents right before her eyes.
The film's eponymous heroine is played by the wonderful Meiko Kaji, THE Nr 1. goddess of Japanese Exploitation cinema (even before fellow beauties Miki Sugimoto and Reiko Ike).
I love debate shows, the original Crossfire remains the best, this one is like crossfire on crack, before they put Crossfire on crack and killed the show.
Luckily for me, I still managed to see 'Lady Snowblood' before 'Kill Bill'.
I don't want to sound smug, but I'm probably one of the few people my age who can say that, and seeing 'Lady Snowblood' before 'Kill Bill' is a lot better than seeing 'Kill Bill' and then expecting 'Lady Snowblood' to be exactly like 'Kill Bill'.
Twenty years and an endless series of devastating fighting lessons later, she's ready to violently slay the three remaining bastards that ruined her life before it even started.
We have Robert Aldrich who made some very intelligent , cynical movies like ATTACK , THE DIRTY DOZEN , TOO LATE THE HERO and ULZANA'S RAID directing a novel by acclaimed author Joseph Wambaugh and featuring amongst others notable actors like Louis Gosset Jnr and James Woods before they became well known .
She also has to navigate the subways, sewers, and office buildings...all this before she even gets to Silent Hill!
It's about as long as the first one(in general, it takes a bit of inspiration from it... including in a way that I'd have preferred it didn't, but I understand that others did want that; you should definitely try to play the original one before this, you will appreciate it on another level), but the well-done puzzles seem simpler(that, or I'm getting better... and I tend to think it's the former, not the latter; meanwhile, this has the greatest riddle-solving system yet), if there may be about the same amount of them.
It takes a while before you realize what exactly is going on, without this losing any of its gripping tension.
One thing I suppose one could say is that the enemies can be frustrating, to an extent not seen before this entry.
You can run a nice and fitting distance before tiring, for example.
I hope these "actors" didn't give up their day job and they really should go back to whatever they were doing before they thought they could act.
At times it was very apparent they were "thinking" about what they had to say next, before finally spitting out their uninspired dialogue.
We see Friar Tuck, Porky Pig, laughing hysterically as Daffy gets out, and he decides to teach Porky a lesson with his (buck and a quarter) quarter staff, but he hits his beak twice before the Friar comes to stop him, get him in the lake again, and Daffy joins laughing for a bit.
Like many of you, Id never heard the title Lady Snowblood before Kill Bill came out, so when I watched Kill Bill and saw Tarantino mention this film as one of his biggest influences, well I knew I would have to check it out sooner or later.
When the child is born the mother dies, but not before whispering into the childs ear that her only purpose in life will be to kill those who were responsible for the death of her family.
She gets to see the pathetic results of Mengele's genetic experiments before being beaten and thrown in a cage.
It's also obvious that Warner's wasn't afraid to spend more on their productions in 1934 than just a year or two before.
I could not touch them, or talk to them, yet they seemed to welcome me with open arms as I silently watched their lives unfold before me.
And of course, i'm a big fan of Italian cinema, but 'La meglio gioventu' is better than anything I saw before.
Like all the masterpiece I mentioned above, this film come with some memorable scene   (Warning - Spoiler)   Matteo jumps from window - its so abrupt but still make sense, its so realistic -his face are painful before and such a quiet pain he shows that night without any big speech.
Or, as Myshkin, I grab one or another misplaced acquaintance, long gone well before my mountaineering days, and march her way above the timberline to some icy col only to play at not knowing the way back down while sweet panic and thunderheads well.
Thus before being a policeman, Matteo is convincingly portrayed as a cultured and fiercely intelligent man whose emotional repression and desperate need for rules are a tragic consequence of an ancient wound.
In fact, Rwanda has seen bursts of violence with mass killings and forced exiles twice before in 1964 and 1974.
As both women share a love-hate relationship with this man, it is not long before the current wife is pulling the ex-wife into a plot to murder the man.
Like Shakespeare in Love before it, this movie is definitely not historically accurate.
While I had certainly known there was a time in theater when men played women's parts, I had never before thought about what might have happened to them when women were finally allowed on the stage.
During the Restoration of England under the reign of King Charles II, women were finally given the freedom and right to perform on the stage whereas before the decree it was illegal and obscene for a woman to perform on stage.
She watches from the wings and longs to act and she does so behind Kynaston's back and in low pubs before a royal official, the Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin).
Complacency, haughtiness, sardonic amusement, appalled shock, tenderness -- but most of all, a crushing verdict on his own abilities, delivered before Charles and his mistress in a setting that only adds to his humiliation.
Her suffering in the wings of several theaters -- down to Ned being abased before drunks -- shows many depths of love, for acting as such, for brilliance of technique, for Ned himself.
Having never seen a picture by this particular director before, but having enjoyed Miranda Otto's performance in LoTR, I gave this movie a chance when I saw in on the Sundance Channel a year or so ago.
When Julie returns to Canada, she finds that her father's bride has left him alone, though not before leading her son to a complete recovery.
It could be treated as a character trait if you've never seen Billy Crudup before but that tic belongs to the actor not to the character.
Not because of her son, but perhaps even unknownst to him, because healing her is going to require more from him than he's ever given before.
She let's him go, and doesn't beg him to stay for her sake like she did before.
The new interface is essentially that of other RTS titles(don't get me wrong, the engine is all-new), and this, unfortunately, puts some focus on aspects of these games that others(with this other interface) did better which still haven't been attended to, basically all falling into the category of overview... compared to the excellent overview of StarCraft and the Age of Empires games... titles released several years before this.
I recommend this to any fan of RTS titles who is interested in the concept and the promise of better graphics, but faithful fans of C&C may want to be sure before they try it.
I loved the film so I bought the DVD from Hallmark...minus commercials...what a treat...the film doesn't play like usual TV movies...with a 'hanger' right before the commercial to hold your interest and get one to return to the film after the commercial.
As the father of young man who died of AIDS before we really knew much about this disease, I was deeply moved by this touching story of a young man and his sister and their relationship to their mother and grandmother.
I grew up in Ireland and I was completely convinced that she was an Irish actress for the first half hour before I realized that this was the amazing Ms. Landsbury.
If you haven't watched it yet, please do so before reading anything else.
With movies like this, I wonder how no one thought to stop the  thing long before shooting wraps.
Yor, having never seen a pulse rifle before, proceeds to pick off half a dozen Vaderbots from a hundred yards... or a coupla feet.
A small part for sure and he gets bumped off before the middle of the film, but you know what they say; "There are no small parts"!
I recall pulling into the movie theater parking lot with scant seconds to spare before YOR was to begin.
Yor dramatically enters, and proceeds to skip across the desert, arm flailing about, and generally he is looking like he has never ran across rough terrain before.
But unfortunately, as I have said before, REB BROWN RUNS LIKE A GIRL.
Not only does it fly past at just the right time, but this creature conveniently goes into instant rigour Mortis, even before it hits the ground.
The directors on hand are in their A-game forms, and it has an appeal that might reach the more hard-bitten veterans of Asian cult films due to the ingenuity of key moments as well as newcomers to Asian horror that might draw them in ever more than before.
If you have seen anything by Miike Takishi before then this is quite tame in comparison to much of his other work (if you haven't then don't ask as you'll either love it or hate it and it's a conversation for another day).
It's been done before, many times, most famously in TRILOGY OF TERROR and the CREEPSHOW movies.
But before I get carried away, I had better check whether THREE EXTREMES made money at the box office.
Its funny cause at a glance the story appears to be a "light" and somewhat comedic little story, yet before you know it, the story ventures into dark dark territory.
Dumpling - 7 out of 10 - Id never heard of Fruit Chan before I saw this film and now I'm interested to see what else he has done and I'm excited to see what he'll do next.
Mr. Fruit Chan, I have never heard of you before last night.
This was a very fun watch, and I am glad I got to see it before it left the theater.
My recommendation....don't eat a big meal before you start!!
Luckily this transfer doesn't last too long, after the arms robbery he is back in Homicide with a new partner, the recently promoted Inspector Kate Moore, played by Tyne Daly before she found fame in "Cagney and Lacey".
Everything from the opening credits listing the make-up and stunt people before the writer and not the director, to the final shot when Richard Nixon and Allan Ginsberg form an unlikely duo in a last-ditch attempt to completely ruin sense.
Interesting and sad too, to see the very talented child actor Scotty Beckett long before his untimely descent into crime and early death.
With such 'naked' truths scratching the surface, it's not long before Grant's trouble's really start as with two Mrs Ardens out and about, living, breathing, walking and talking, the authorities are starting to sit up and take notice.
Nick (Cary Grant) was married to Ellen (Irene Dunne) for 4 years before she was shipwrecked, and presumed to be dead.
He however got involved in an automobile accident shortly before the filming of this movie and he had to pass on the directing honers to less experienced Garson Kanin.
It came relatively late in the cycle of original prime-time animation for television - before video eliminated the market.
It's not long before Andrew's fragile world is broken down even further by the death of his father, leaving him with no surviving family.
Probably the most grotesque thing that happened during this bloodbath was the voice of Frank Ifield singing I remember you-a hit song from 1962 which topped the charts and went onto score in the States on the same label which issued the Beatles before Capitol Records came to their senses.
It delivers just what it says on the box-but you need to have some experience before you delve into it.
And to all of you that haven't seen it but is checking out some reviews before you decide to buy it or download it - You're in for a hell of a ride.
If anything, you have never seen anything like this before.  
Legend dictates that before his disappearance, Frederick Bartholomew became a murderous psychopath and began killing off the people that he worked with.
Oh and before I forget, Dr. Mabuser seems to believe that his brain is being munched by maggots Â need I say more?!?
To tell you, I have never, ever seen anything on the big screen quite like this before.
He has created a horror masterpiece that may become a historical landmark in film history such as others have done before.
This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion's Gate released it theatrically.
This truly is a film that requires multiple viewing before one can properly judge it.
Just as you think the limits of weirdness are approaching, Zombie takes the film a step farther, and before long you surrender yourself to the mercy of the film and just accept things for what they are.
Rob Zombie has created a film that is both a homage and derivative at the same time; most things in the film have been done before, in one shape or another, and the level of gore is a fraction of what was intended, due to its shameful R-rating.
He's definitely no Sean Connery, but handles himself well before the image of the secret agent was created in the film series.
We've seen it all before, though fortunately rarely in such a mindblowingly slooow pace and without virtually any story or message behind it.
As I said before I am not one who would commit adultery but realize that people are different and suffer issues and can see clearly how such a transgression could have happen.
And for a Montana gal who had to brush the sagebrush pollen out of her hair before joining polite company, stow her lasso, and pretend to be civilised, how did she manage to master the accent and rhythms and patterns of speech, dress, and mannerisms of those real savages, the gals in those short tart's skirts who live in tower blocks in East London and are married to men who support Arsenal Football Club?
You have a gold fish and turtle hit by a beam of light from the crystal, turning into grotesque monsters before exploding all over the place.
I saw it way before it came out because my friend Geoff has a small role in the film.
Plus it's a vintage one for the fact that it featured Robert Redford well before he became a big movie star or household name.
Okay, before I begin I should point out that this episode co-stars a very young and attractive Robert Redford--before he was a star.
The climax to the tale will probably be guessed way before the ending; but The Twilight Zone is never completely predictable, and it still manages to pull something out of the bag at the end!
The classic series "Julia" was groundbreaking for its time in 1968,some three years earlier before Bill Cosby broke color barriers for his work(and won the Emmy for Best Actor) on the series "I Spy".
Mr. Selznick liked to lure legends back before the camera, and succeeds with Ms. Costello; certainly, film-goers in 1936 couldn't help but be impressed with her billing - "Dolores" (a star on her own) "Costello" (as in Maurice) "Barrymore" (as in John) - the latter was used despite the fact that Dolores had recently divorced John Barrymore.
Convicted thief and murderer Joe Brezzi (Joe Dallesandro) escapes from prison, murders a man with a pitchfork, steals his car and then heads off to find 300 million lira he'd stolen and hid in a secluded vacation home right before he was arrested.
Macchia, who worked with Di Leo at least twice before, and de Selle, who clearly enjoys her constant nudity as well, are pros at this and their unlikeable characters are nevertheless compelling thanks to their thoughtful performances.
Also, you should watch this before Hollywood remakes it, which no doubt it will at some point.
Will the mystery be solved and will our love birds tie the knot before the bloody finale?
Maybe it was made before its time?
Plus, I was really impressed by Peter Cushing's performance as a surgeon on a crusade--his speech before the graduating class and impassioned argument with old established "surgeons" was very impressive--some great oration indeed!
It wasn't long before Mary (Whitelaw) had a spat with Chris (Cairney) and fell into the clutches of the murderers.
Never before has John Waters given his characters so much room in an environment so nice and cosy.
Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before.
Who else but Waters could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death with a slab of pork chop (because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns it to the video store) while watching a videotape of "Annie"?
The pace starts fast, stays that way, and this director is not afraid to give us a taste of anti-climax before sending us over the edge to the finale.
For what I remember the etruscan civilization was many years before Rome itself was founded and was conquered by Romans before the coming of Christ.
Similarly wasted was so much potential with the rest of the film, where often things set up to happen ended up fizzling before they got there.
The storyline is essentially a standard 'evil cultists wish to summon Satan to Earth' type thing, something which has, to be honest, been done many times before.
Abe knew that he unleashed a psycho on society who raped before he raped Jennifer and will more then likely rape again, which he did, and one of his intended victims being his, Abe's, pretty young 17 year-old daughter Emma, Gina Philips.
Joe had found out that these women would not be believed in a court of law, if they chose to press charges against him, because they were already proved to be lairs before so why would not a jury feel that there lying now.
Joe in a mad effort to get even with Abe charms his young daughter Emma, who's totally Ga-Ga about him, and takes her to a hotel room to do to her what he did to Jennifer and Lisa and ,as far as we know, dozens of other young ladies before them.
All of the cast principles and minor players as well were at the top of their forms when they stood before the cameras.
But the subject never really came up before in film.
I don't know if directors, screen players or others in the team ever go to analyze the culture of one nation before recording a movie, which has to do with the part of new world history.
My tip for directors is: before you shoot a movie, analyze the culture of the people first... On the other hand, KFOR soldiers were not positioned in mountains and rural areas of Kosovo, they were positioned in towns, villages and populated areas.
Billy is the lovable doofus always getting into a load of junk that is really stupid, such as eating an endless supply of magical bubble gum and then flactuating huge bubbles, just before belching all of the gum up and into the atmosphere, covering the whole world in gum.
I watched the 1985 film Krush Groove yesterday, I must say I really enjoyed it.Now here's the thing about this movie.If you do not like rap, you will probably not enjoy this movie.If you hate very old-school rap(any rap song that came out before 1988), you probably will not like this movie.However, if you like the genre of music, you will probably enjoy this film.I really like this kind of rap.I also like old gangsta rap from the late 80's to late 90's.I also like other types of music such as rock, metal etc.Therefore, I liked Krush Groove.The plot of the film involves a man who is trying to start his own record label, his brother's a member of rap group Run DMC.He starts it after a loan, and it does work, however there is another big record producer who is stealing his artists.He also owes money to the man who originally gave it to him.Meanwhile, a rap group called "The Disco Three"(The Fat Boys), are trying to make it big in the rap game.The movie features music from artists such as Shiela E, Run DMC, The Beastie Boys, Fat Boys, LL Cool J etc.If you like old-school hip hop/rap, then Krush Groove is the movie you should see.
We're talking The Fat Boys, Kurtis Blow, The Beastie Boys, New Edition, Sheila E., Full Force, and even Donnie Simpson before he hosted BET.
When i watched this film, i found it unlike anything i had ever seen before, it shows you how one teacher can inspire and the change the life for A student, giving the confidence to find their path.
In the end, Keating is used as a scapegoat to appease the anguished father, but the film leaves one more lesson to be taught before Keating leaves Weldon forever.
It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion.
A few hours ago I felt lonely and depressed.I decided to watch it without the scenes that evoke sadness.And even though I watched it so many times before I found it restorative and heart lifting.
Like his father a generation before, a young Californian caballero must fight against treachery & evil in high places.
He retrieves his sword from where it had stuck thirty years before, digs out his mask and cape and travels to Spain to help rescue his son.
His praise followed the lines of the review appearing at the head of this IMDb comments section: this was innovative in 1978 (I saw it first in its test market run, before it got national distribution).
So, in and effort to see as many of these "targeted for deletion" movies before they were gone, I started renting them A through Z.
I've seen movies that try to scare by cranking up the wind machine and having the cast yell before.
One slight criticism: how could it be that Ferguson and his men have never heard the terms "contract" and "hit" before?
He had been down the path too many times before, and his boredom was showing.
The movie offers a lot of clichÃ©d lines that were probably fresh at the time, take Ferguson's command to the paranoid Rico (Ted De Corsia) the day before he's set to testify against mob boss Mendoza (Everett Sloane) - "He'll die, he's got to die, and you're going to kill him."
The real life character that Rico appears based on, Abe "Kid Twist" Reles, ended up dead in police custody, somehow falling from a fifth story window before testifying against Murder Inc. How convenient.
The film begins with the only witness against the head of this organized crime ring practically crawling out of his skin because he's so worried about being killed before he can testify in court.
In the period immediately before the release of "The Enforcer", Senate Committee hearings on organised crime were chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver.
Ferguson and Nelson's review eventually brings to light the name of another person who would be a perfect witness but unfortunately Mendoza becomes aware of this person's identity at the same and this leads to a desperate race against time for the police to find the potential witness before Mendoza's men do.
After DeCorsia's demise the night before the trial was to commence, Bogart and Sloane start listening to hours of tape from several witnesses to see if they can salvage the case.
However, I never read those articles before discovering this film, and so my expectations were quite different.
Push quickly came to shove, the security Gestapo got irate and before we knew it, it was war!
I've borrowed this DVD from the library twice before, but never had the chance to watch it, until now.
The appeal is actually to see some of Thai director Wisit Sasanatieng's past works, before his up and coming made-in-Singapore flick called Armful.
It all fits together and makes so much sense you think perhaps the idea was obvious all along, but I'm pretty sure that it was in exactly one persons head ever before he put it on film.
And it's a corker, with a great premise that reminds you that before he moved on to guilt, infidelity and Catholicism, Greene wrote cracking pulp thrillers like A Gun for Sale.
Rod Steiger is powerful and shady financier Carl Schaffner, on the run from the British police in America and trying to cross the border into Mexico before he can be extradited.
wow.this depiction of the Spanish-American war,and one particular American regiment,took my breath away.there may be some historical liberties taken,but who cares.this TV mini series was outstanding.the battle scenes were something to behold.John Milius directed and co-wrote this movie.he also wrote several episodes of the TV series Rome.the acting her is first rate.Tom Berenger plays Theodore Roosevelt(before he became President)who led the regiment.Sam Elliot plays Capt.Bucky O'Neil,Gary Busey plays Gen.Joseph' Fighting Joe' Wheeler.also in the cast are Illeana Douglas as Edith Roosevelt,and Chris Noth.there are many others in the cast and all are superb.this movie is about 3 hours long,but it doesn't feel like that at all.this is one of the best war movies i have seen.9/10
He was the only actor worthy of appraise in this film but as it is I don't think I have ever disliked him in any film before.
Bucky O'Neil, properly spelled "Buckey O'Neill", was a real and important person both in, and before the battle.
The shark looked totally fake, especially right before it crashed into the glass window under water.
The first thing I always tell myself before I watch a low-budget Sci-Fi film is: "be prepared: it's bound to be bad to at least some noticeable degree."
In any event I would think that the Confederacy would try for a mass escape like in The Great Escape before using an agent to affect the escape of one man and some of his selected companions.
Roper, Holden's part, takes a small troop of men out from the fort in pursuit, he hoping to catch up with them before the Apaches do.
Obviously, these were the days before schlock like Crash, Brokeback Mountain, Monster, and Titanic were considered 'great films,' worthy of such awards.
I first attempted to watch the film mid-way through last year, but, being terribly ill at the time, and having to wake up relatively early the following morning, I barely got half-way through the Tramp's antics before I had to turn off the DVD and go to sleep.
Needless to say, it doesn't take long before both the Tramp and the pickpocket find themselves frantically fleeing the authorities, and Chaplin takes refuge in a maze of mirrors, where the policemen can certainly see their quarry, but can't decide which of the dozen reflections is real.
I've been spending a lot of time lately going through and watching all of Chaplin's oldest short comedies that he made for Keystone and Essanay, and with only a few left before I get into the 1920s I decided to jump ahead and watch this one, which is reportedly the last true silent film that Chaplin made, since there were elements of City Lights and especially Modern Times that were clearly moving toward the sound era.
By now, Chaplin had reached a point in his career where he was a major film star, so of course this movie is much bigger, much more ambitious than the 10 or 20 minute films he was churning out a decade before.
Maybe this is just me, but I really think that the parts of Chaplin's films where we see the tramp before the story has started going are generally some of the best parts, because we get quick looks at the tramp's personality Â what he does with himself when nothing's going on.
There is a very clever opening to the movie, as Chaplin twice finds himself the victim of pick-pocketing, once when another man's wallet is slipped into his pocket, and another time when that wallet is stolen from him before he realizes he has it.
As The Circus left, The Little Tramp just sit on some box and pondering for a little bit before pick up piece of paper with star on it and crumple it then throw it away.
This turns dark and perhaps the darkness is implicit in the persona of the tramp and the venue of the circus, but it also has some breathtaking and very funny sequences before that final third.
Charlie Chaplin plays a guy who joins the circus and before too long gets his own act.
The final shot has the little tramp walking away from the woman he loves, alone: never before (or since) have we so sensed Chaplin's true gloominess.
She has kept her identity a secret to her lover, but discovers that her affair is no secret to her husband just before he shoots her in the head.
I read one review by a man who said he had figured out the ultimate mystery before the climax of the film.
Remember, they each laid them aside before talking?
Obvious ones, Clever ones, and ones that try to be clever but have too many plot holes, red herrings, and omitted bits of information for anyone to see the ending before it happens.
Her lover, in the scene just before, had just told her pretty much the same thing, and her response had been equally cold.
Hopkins is using the story to warn Gosling that his near perfect conviction record is about to be tested like never before.
Gosling plays a young, hotshot prosecuting attorney on his way to bigger and better things with a change of scenery to corporate law but gets stuck with this open-and-shut case right before he switches firms.
When the police arrive, he confesses and hands in his weapon, and the case is passed on to hotshot DDA Willy Beachum (Gosling), who sees this, his final public service trial before he moves onwards and upwards, to be a slam-dunk case; but alas, thanks to Crawford's mind games, things are not what they seem and the case undergoes a series of twists and turns as Crawford and Beachum engage in a tense battle of wits.
I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this film as I heard many positive critical reviews before going into it so I had high expectations to begin with.
He didn't add anything new to his character that we haven't seen him do before, yet I still loved watching him whenever he was on the screen.
Any doubts of him I had before are now officially thrown out the window.
Gosling is Willy Beachum, a cocky, up-and-coming public prosecutor who takes the case believing it will be one last slam-dunk victory for him before he moves on to bigger and better things at a prestigious private law firm downtown.
"The Hunter" appeared in theaters in the summer of 1980, just a few months before Steve McQueen's premature passing.
You know those 'blank' cuts which are shown before any of the story occur, and serve to set the setting?
The only attempts the series makes to have viewers 'care' about characters is to have them viciously beaten, have their bodies ripped to bloody shreds, or, best of all, have their one and only canine companion pummeled before their eyes by plot devic-- I mean bullies.
I mean, come on..  Then there's the moronic Kohta who does little more than act as bland as he can before the onset of his next little flashback to yet another oh-so-cleverly concocted plot device - Lucy killing his father and sister when he was a child.
The plot, the characters, "Lilium" song (i discovered it before the anime itself ^O^ I suggest you to pick it up==>Konishi Kayo & Kondoo Yukio "Lilium" ), the emotions all along the episodes... Only the ending song is a bit irritating and has nothing to do with all the rest.
As I have spoked before the anime is full of strong emotions.
And at the end that beautiful smile at Lucy's face, it truly looked like she has always waited for that day to come, but that day is much more sad maybe, than any other days before.
The only bad and sad thing about it is that it's, like I said before, only 13 episodes.
And be prepared to watch all the episodes together, it might be hard to stop before the last one!
i'd watch my mother the car reruns before this film, hehe.
My satalite provided the description 'Various nuclear mutants want to be with the last woman alive in a land before time'.
Actually, this is more of a G version of what the Troma studio usually produces, so people have to know Troma before the judge harshly the Troma film Nymphoid Barbarian.
It plays before the films as opposed to when you select 'trailer' on the menu.
He had probably been inspired by 'Ten From Your Show Of Shows' which had been released the year before to great success.
As mentioned by many people here before me, it's a pity that Raven (and sledge hammer too) had such a short lifespan.
I recommend this movie to any Ross Thomas fan, especially given that it was probably the last thing he wrote before he died.
Gruner seems to fall prey to the Van Damme syndrome of getting beaten to a pulp before rising to the occasion with brief flurries of energy.
It's not a total disaster Â there's the odd good line (a conductor announcing "Hollywood, home of the stars and several featured players"), a nicely natural performance from Carol Kane before she became a mess of mannerisms to rival Wilder and it does offer a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see James Hong playing a Norwegian (or is it Svedish?)
It is embarrassing to admit, but I bought a month's subscription for Disney Channel on Demand just so I could see High School Musical 2 before anyone else, and it definitely didn't disappoint.
But before they lost all radio transmission to Dr Vogel, radio contact between the base and Dr Vogel grew increasingly sporadic and irrational, the doctor rantings about conversations with Napoleon and Alexander The Great have become a great concern naturally.
So like i said before all in all nothing to complain about.
As a person who hadn't been watching Disney Channel incessantly before the film's premiere to familiarize myself with the songs, I felt that they were coming at me so fast (sometimes) that I couldn't fully enjoy them.
Only this time, she is even more funny than before.
I love the fact that the movie begins with them in school right before summer vacation.
I stayed true to my word and sat through the whole thing, but not before my soul was permanently tainted.
Oh, and before I forget, who in the world has a portrait photograph of themselves in their basketball gear in their own room?
High School Musical 2 review This movie is a mash of random dance moves that look like something a back up dancer to Britney Spears would do and dialogue that only succeeds to prolong the plot that was probably written a week before production by somebody who didn't want to change a thing from the original film.
The film starts out seconds before the familiar school atmosphere will come to an end for the summer.
The main cast is together in what appears to be drama class (I guess it would be nitpicking for me to point out that the entire main cast is in the same classroom) counting down the seconds before summer break.
TskÂ they must have been drastically understaffed before these people came along.
And to those who would decide to spend $8.50+ on a movie, based exclusively on its trailers, some advice: read a few reviews before you make that decision.
At first it's not well received but then apparently folks decide that they like it, too bad he's put a hit out on himself to end it all though and the guy that arranged all that has a heart attack before he can call off the hit.
I can't recall ever stating that a "serious comedy," is one of the years best films before.
Senator who before mouthed the political platitudes and nostrums we get from our elected officials at voting time, now starts telling some uncomfortable truths.
His comments about the media and how it is controlled by corporate America is more apt now (during the Bush administration) than ever before.
However, to the surprise of everyone (including himself), his new attitude makes him more popular than ever before.
Alas, soon after a slow and sluggish start, we are forced to sit through at least twenty minutes of crudely interpolated, ancient stock footage before we get back to the main story.
I'm amazed I put up with all this rubbish before reaching for the STOP button, but I kept hoping that Barry Norton would do something to justify his star billing.
How can it be 2:45 NOW when it was 2:45 back before Marcus ever went upstairs to Lily's apartment to fetch Alex.
I read the comments about this movie before I saw it and was afraid I might not like it.
The story of a jewel thief who may or may not have retired and who is lured out of that "retirement" has been done before and done better by most other versions of the tale.
Burdett and Lloyd go through separate crises themselves and must share beds and rub suntan lotion on one another before the film gives us a final weak and incomprehensible twist.
Pierce Brosnan sleepwalks to the role that he has essayed many times before ---a smooth, slick operator who has thought of everything and for whom things fall into place as if my magic.
Nassau never looked this good before!
I knew absolutely nothing about this film before I saw it and I don't think I had any an preconceptions.
I saw this movie just before I got sick of seeing Sam Neil everywhere and I remember thinking he was neat.
Even in the 1970's when American films were some of the best ever, Film critics then were also not appreciative of what they had before them.
We go back in the early fifties at where we find an Australian communist Joan Fraser (Judy davis) who really would give her life for the red star, it goes so far that she can arrange to meet the man Stalin himself (all of course before the public knew of his slaughters) and what Joan never expected...she ends up in bed with Stalin but as the man is walking on his last feet, he dies...
Betty loves Rodney Harrington, son of the most prominent family in town, and the two manage to marry before he goes off to battle in WWII.
She begs Dr. Swain not to come to her defense by testifying that she had miscarried Cross's child years before.
The setting is 1940s before and after World War II, but it's most definitely 1957, via the costumes and hairstyles.
I had to look up her age three times before I could believe what I was seeing.
I'm glad I finally found a place to rent a copy rather than buying one, and it's obvious that the rental houses agree with my assessment, as I had to check on Netflix, two Blockbusters, and one Hollywood video before I could find a lone copy at a third Blockbuster.
Two scientists are at frozen Arctic research station: one goes about his daily work routine, the other slowly goes off the deep end trying to figure out how the two men there before them died.
Then some generic actors who clearly look uncomfortable and not even very significant before such a gigantic ego.
The only reason I didn't leave before the 3 hours of torture were over was because I was expecting it to get good (oscar nominations) and I paid full price to go.
Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now... Half my theatre left after the 2 hour mark, some before, and that was on opening night.
Liam Neeson, who croaks before the end of the first reel, is one lucky bastard.
Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).
You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you don't need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.
There are two reason for that: 1- It took pressure from government in turkey before it began to play.
Why did they (the police) stop recording before they beat and torture Kaya and made him confess the crime and sign ?
"The film offers a critique not just of State fascism but fascism in daily life - in the lives of ordinary people..." suggests Umit Unal,the writer-director of 9 and his well-knitted script(which is a masterpiece of the Turkish script expert) tells us all murderers used to be ordinary people before.
To make matters worse, what transpires during and after the climax can be accurately guessed about twenty minutes before the film's conclusion.
Michael Rooker plays Father Vassey, a troubled priest who seeks personal redemption by hunting down and destroying a demon before it can unleash Hell on Earth.
When Joe confesses his infatuation to Drew just before Thanksgiving break, Drew advises him to `just go for it' and Joe resolves to follow that advice and ask Shayna out as soon as he returns.
Not having seen this film before, it came as a total surprise the other night when it was shown on cable.
The story of Kansas before the Civil War, usually with John Brown as the protagonist has supplied the cinema with a whole range of films.
Then, by the end, during the shooting, it all resolves itself in a cathartic moment: El Cuervo becomes tolerant and even sort of nice, and both lovers make peace shortly before dying.
People read the film from the ending backwards and dismiss all that came from before due to its "trick ending".
The other two who I have never seen before are quite wooden and contrived.
Sex and relationships, at least make up your mind what your movie is about before you shoot it, because whoever wrote this obviously wasn't talented enough to include both.
Judy Garland admiring Fred Astaire's Easter bonnet in EASTER PARADE, Garland and Astaire sailing up the avenue as 'A Couple Of Swells' in the same film, Gene Kelly and Garland dueting on FOR ME AND MY GAL, Ann Miller and Bob Fosse in KISS ME KATE, a montage of musicals before colour, a Garland tribute, a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn love-fest... this film unabashedly brings them all (and much much more) together.
It has worked before (Waiting For Guffman, Best In Show) but not here.
They have loved the film before they saw it.
It is not even hard to say where he has gone wrong: the characters he created before were quirky, offbeat, but ultimately lovable.
The movie was over before it stated with a running time of slightly over an hour and it appeared as though Guest just plain gave up and quit so the studio called in a editor to finish the project.
I don't think I laughed once during the last half hour, and precious few times before that.
If you are a fan of "Best in Show", Waiting for Guffman etc, or you just want to get to know these gifted actors, DO go see this film, nap before you go so you can be happy and rested and hear the inside jokes that spark the guffaws heard throughout the theater.
I wasn't excepting anything special before I started to watch "Plata quemada".
This starts an Oscar buzz that engulfs the two other nominal principals of the movie, hot-dog pitchman Victor Allen Miller and "serious" actress Callie Webb, and the tidal wave of publicity drastically changes the direction and marketing campaign of the movie even before it's completed.
Then Larson E. makes his most famous quote when refusing their refund, "Count your change before leaving the window!"
Lana has second- make that fourth or fifth- thoughts about marrying Lex, and in a huge revelation is finally convinced to back out before another menacing figure comes into play.
This scene alone will need to be answered before the season concludes.
One wonders why it had never seen the light of day before.
An era has passed before our eyes as the rose-colored glow of the 60s counterculture is smudged by the inevitable rise of the mass-consumer pop marketplace.
Saw it on HBO, and it came out of nowhere; never heard of it before.
I heard Tom Six is planning a sequel (this time with lesbians), but after seeing his first, getting the feeling of crawling back into the closet, I hope he reconsiders before he damages gay acceptation even more.
In James Bond, for example, I know he is a vain, brainless army officer with a line in feeble sexist jokes, but I know he is going to get involved in some spectacular antics fighting a mad villain before he's off.
Also, this film gave me a hard time, because never before had I consider rating a movie below 5.
Unfortunately for her, she fails to walk through customs with 150g of heroin her employers have planted on her and it's not long before she's walking down the endless pristine and very white corridors of a prison that looks like it was designed by Louis Vitton for a Gap ad.
Naturally things go wrong, ulterior motives are revealed, everyone becomes expendable, Monica gets her tits out and the tone becomes completely schizoid as if the script finally arrived a few days before filming finished and they rushed to fit it all in.
My opinion hasn't changed: action isn't unforgettable, the story is boring, and the characters dull: even before the troubles come, the spies are depressive, mournful!
Done several times before !
How many times has this not been seen before ?
Viewers need to realize that fact at the beginning before reading this or indeed any review.
The fact that none of the characters are particularly memorable, the fact that the news stories are not particularly surreal and the fact that each "channel" starts to feel repetitive even before the end of the episode are all deliberate.
Some say this movie rip off "The Replacements", while some say this script wrote before it.
I believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event ("OH yeah, this happen before!
I recommend to see this movie before the first ( "Terms of Endearment, if you haven't seen it jet),because it isn't much related to the first.
This sequel was really not meant to be an exact copy of what the original was 13 years before this, which is why i think people looked at it differently.
Eduardo Noriega, is also a Spanish actor that has done excellent work before and he shows his range in a magnificent performance as Angel.
The stop-motion process is complex: fragile puppets ranging from 6.3 to 11 inches high are shot on a miniature set one frame at a time, with animators adjusting each puppet slightly before the next shot.
Jenny is sexually molested and slapped around a bit while Robert watched helplessly with a knife to his throat before being knocked unconscious.
Rudy Valee's dialog would seem to set us up for a BLAIR WITCH ADVENTURE situation almost a quarter of a century before that film was made.
It's not a horror movie and there are only two brief scenes that could conceivably land it in the genre; the first is a somewhat botched gang rape around a campfire and the other is the "revenge" scene with two guys fighting with hatchets and knives that is cut short before any blood could be spilled when one of the characters decides to do the "sensible" thing...
The ceremony felt like one big whole this year and was more personal and natural, with presenter Ellen DeGeneres actually walking between- and talking to the stars and taking part of the show elements, without feeling the constant obligation to constantly talk after, between and before the handing out of every single award.
Just like Scorsese, he should already had won an Oscar years ago for at least 3 of his works but nevertheless it was great to see that he finally got the recognition he deserved from the Academy before his death.
Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
- IMDb has a silly rule about having to have 10 lines of text before they'll allow you to post a comment, so now I have to ramble on although I've already made my point.
There was a book before that.
They spent way too long in the bar scene, who walks around a bar with a wet t-shirt before the contest?
Even before the avalanche, who dresses like that at a ski area in the winter?
It must be said in the son's favor, however, that he managed to get his hair stylishly cut (just a whisper of mousse)and deliver a moving anti-war speech to his slack jawed mom before biting the dust (dust he wouldn't have bit if he had the sense to come in out of the flack).
FOR THE BOYS might just be a "Better Midler" film today, in a period of another middle east war and albeit a more tragic and unpopular one with a far more critical and on going media focus than the first 1991 war.....This exceptionally well made musical drama, made for about $70 million in 1991 and really a protest musical parable, did not reach the intended at the time and the first Iraq war was over before this film had a chance to make an impact.
It also gives us glances at the high water mark of radio programing in the late 1940s (before television began to impact upon it).
Polish Vampire in Burbank is the story of a reluctant vampire Dupah (Mark Pirro) who has never sucked blood from a victim before.
Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
But it was one of the last good Nicktoons before Nickoldeon ruined there self's.
I didn't understand the part right before the ultimate gift.
Now THE ULTIMATE GIFT comes to the screen/DVD and before making the groaning judgment that here is yet another insipid little tale about learning life's lessons and gaining some spirituality in the process, try watching this two hour traversal of well acted and well scripted (Cheryl McKay) and well directed (Michael O. Sajbel) input.
He returns to the beach, stronger than before and definitely in command.
There's also a chance to scope out Ebbetts Field and the Brooklyn Dodgers before both were torn down and shipped to LA.
This  movie is unlike anything I've ever seen before.
I was privileged to watch this film days before its final run in Singapore at The Picturehouse.
the film starts with him burning himself with a candle just before shooting fire out of his penis (most likely his fantasy as he ejaculates, believe me this guy does not make the appearance of having any magical powers) the middle aged soldier spends most of his days pleasuring himself (while looking at fairy tale books, cleaning bath tubs, or spying on the daughters of his lieutenant.)
Bottom line: this is like a documentary about the rise of hip-hop or boogie before it, only it's about some other form of spontaneous urban expression.
It is "Amazing Grace" acted out before our eyes as this is self-help, bootstraps up through specifically African-American Christian culture that grew out of birthday party celebrations, going from clown dancing to crumping.
I was thinking of "A Chorus Line"'s refrain of "Everything was beautiful at the ballet" of girls escaping dysfunctional families even before these hyper-articulate entertainers point out that there are no ballet classes available to them, or any after-school activities for kids not interested in football or basketball so they made the choice to dance with organized groups, first in informal than structured competitions.
For example, L'il C says such dancing is "in our blood" -- but is that after LaChapelle showed them the footage of African ritual dancing that they had never seen before -- and it is a bit disconcerting that of all the footage he could have selected he uses material from the Leni Riefenstahl archives.
LaChappelle carefully introduces us to the participants as dancers and individuals before we know more about their difficult pasts and home lives, as these are young people who had to grow up too fast and are lucky to have survived, even as they can't avoid the neighborhood's random violence.
The rawness of the energy and the stories of everyone involved reminded me about Hip Hop, west coast style, in the days before Ice-T and NWA made gangsta rap popular.
One could argue with the African cutting but th editing and cross cutting was brilliant-yes, the insight may be not the greatest but we've never seen it before I loved that the director was able to get away with putting the dancing to different kinds of music-even the hymn-and it still worked.
It starts with a man who calls himself Tommy the Clown, who entertains at children's parties much like most other types of clowns, except that he specializes in an amazing dance performance rather than magic tricks and balloon animals, and before long other dancing clown groups are popping up all over the place, mostly staffed by kids and teenagers who otherwise would more than likely get involved in a life of crime.
Lloyd's physical stunts are stunning, and "Girl Shy" builds to a tremendously fun and exciting climax as Lloyd rushes to claim the girl before she's wed to another, braving every manner of transportation imaginable in ever-increasing outrageous set pieces.
The chase scene at the end of the movie as Lloyd attempts to "get the girl" before her marriage was quite well filmed, and the humour throughout, while not outrageous, was amusing.
About the only negatives, and they are minor, are that the chase at the end has been done before (though rarely as well) and the whole stuttering thing seems like a cheap way to get a laugh.
Throughout, Harold displays the remarkable athleticism for which he was celebrated, made even more astonishing when one remembers that he had lost half of his right hand a few years before in a freak studio accident, a disfigurement he disguised with a prosthetic glove.
I never thought that this problem was a worldwide problem before.
Every time one of the ninjas died they would pull the stupidest face ever before keeling over at a ludicrous speed which had me in fits of laughter.
(You'd think Billy would have thought of that before going off to spend 10 years at Ninja School.)
I recall seeing Store (in the late 60's/early 70's I deliberately saw any Marx movie whether on TV or in a revival in a theatre until I had seen them all) years before and being bored out of my skull.
Just to say to all those who think it's not funny: My 16 year old daughter, who had not seen it before, thought it was hilarious from beginning to end.
Their father has developed a high-tech GPS technology just before his death.
While I disagree with the conventional wisdom about the Marx Brothers' film made before The Big Store, Go West (1940), believing it to be yet another one of their many masterpieces, I have to agree with the conventional wisdom about The Big Store.
Most other films before and since (until the late 70's early 80's) stereotyped Asian characters as clownish and comical to an absolutely racist degree.
Pre-Code means that the film was released before the strict Production Code was adopted in 1934.
But for some reason, as I was alluding to before, I bet that's just fine with him.
Then, before I knew it, I'd been sitting there in my recliner for about 45 minutes or so, absolutely still.
You have to see the 49-episode series before you watch this excellent movie.
But before the Gundams are to be destroyed a new presence threatens to shatter the peace by kidnapping Relena and waging war on earth.
You'll know what I mean, it's the part just before Liv and Emma forget about their months of hatred toward each other as they lay amidst the ruins of both of their weddings surrounded by the surely disgusted families.
Let me just say that I have been excited to see this movie since before it was even announced.
The consequences of this would have created a deliciously dramatic situation, as it would leave a vengeful, fiancÃ©-less woman, who would crash the other girl's wedding drunk, and right before the vows, telling everyone "You know what, she killed my fiancÃ©?
Why anyone would want to submit himself to an over-clichÃ©d chick flick that looks and acts like something we've all seen a million times before - only worse - is beyond me.
A week of passive aggressive hostility passes before the two women make it clear that neither will compromise, especially after Liv tries to take advantage of Emma's passive nature and outrages Emma in the process.
For instance it introduces the Columbo character first into the movie before the murder has even occurred and he starts to investigate before they have even found a body.
He is in great form, in one of his very last screen roles before his death in 1973.
Harvey, number one at the game only because of the illness of the Russian champion (Jack Kruschen) the year before, panics when he plays a practice match with Kruschen and realizes that this year, he will lose his title.
When the two meet on the evening before the match and Clayton suffers defeats in both a spontaneous game at a restaurant and a pre-arranged game at the hotel, he decides to take matters into his own hands...
Emmett Clayton (Laurence Harvey, with echoes of his tormented character in "The Manchurian Candidate") has a nightmare before an important chess match, a nightmare the director helpfully visualizes for us as a giant fog-filled chess board, on which Clayton and his opponent are chess pieces.
Meanwhile, Columbo appears before there's even a murder: Dudek's coach had panicked and called the police when the champion didn't show up in his hotel room on time.
So Columbo is aware of this man even before something serious happens.
Clayton decides he must murder Dudek before the match.
Dunn, getting fed up with Buono's sinister airs, lectures him before leaving that if he is going to wear white, he should not eat dishes with tomato sauce.
Let's throw in a car chase, let's throw in some kissing, let's throw in some celebs ,oh yeah, some unrealistic football action before we forget, and ready is our SOCCER movie.
And of course with hard nosed coach Rudi Van Der Merwe (Rutger Hauer) at the helm, our new recruit has to prove his worth before being handed some first team duties.
The movie too seemed to like David Beckham, given plenty of scenes, befitting probably of his real last hurrah at the club before leaving them this summer.
However goal 2 had me bored far before the end.
If you haven't seen Goal yet, you should catch that before seeing part 2.
Kay's life long love(..and to whom she has been engaged for some time before traveling to Budapest where she actually met Alucard)is Frank Stanley(Robert Paige)and he has to stand uncomfortably idle as his woman marries Alucard trying to figure out what is going on.
Count nearly kills him before Stanley hits for paydirt luckily making it to Brewster's home.
What can be said that hasn't been said before?
People get shot for no reason (and I'm talking NO REASON, here ... not even within the context of the four thugs who are the centerpieces of the film), the stereotypical drag queens were -well- kinda offensive (rather than funny), the pacing seemed sporadic, the dialogue -while peppered with realistic jargon and cutesy internally-referential life-comments that made you think these characters were real people- was superficial, and the "monster" of the movie was never given any real build-up before it started messing with people's minds.
Watching tonight, I realized I was enjoying it even more now than ever before.
No one ever thought of that before.
Quincy ME brought us the fascinating world of Forensic Pathology and yes, even crime scene investigation 30 years before we would be flooded with analogous programs.
I've been watching this as it's rerun here on ITV3 and am really getting into it.It's CSI before CSI and in my opinion better because it's a very human series not all about hi tech equipment and explosions.Plus every episode is about something important like cancer treatment,abuse,alcoholism etc and tackles the subjects head on.The autopsy scenes are good as well because you don't see the bodies you just see the top half of Quincy and Sam and get Quincys description of what's happening.I think that's great because what you imagine can be ten times worse than what your shown in graphic detail.
If you have never been entertained by Naziploitation before, let me clue you in--this movie is all about the JEWS.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Getting the introductions out of the way, it is 2054 in Washington D.C. and Tom Cruise plays, John Anderton, a Precrime enforcement detective who heads up a crack team specializing in preventing murders before they occur, also arresting criminals before they kill.
Estranged from his wife and a father struggling to cope with the disappearance of his son, Anderton seeks a temporary high in the dark world of illegal street drugs but when his murderous number comes down the pipe, both the law and Precrime chart a course for his apprehension before he kills.
We've run into this problem before with movies such as Terminator 2 and Back to the Future.
It's the year 2054, and the United States government has set up a department called PreCrime, which utilises these Pre-Cogs to predict murders before they even happen, hence their name.
The names, victims and times of the murders are provided by the Pre-Cogs to the PreCrime agents, and they intervene and prevent these murders before they actually occur.
Naturally, as it's part of PreCrime's duty to apprehend murderers before they even murder, Anderton is immediately made a fugitive, and he goes on the run.
In the future, they can predict murders before they happen (who will be the murderer and who the victim) but as the film proves it doesn't matter how perfect the system looks, it still has flaws and can be used unscrupulously by someone with a bad agenda which happens in the case of John Cruise's character John Anderton.
I won't go into a lengthy synopsis as have so many before me but yes, it's an old 1940s Universal vampire movie with someone other than Lugosi as the antagonist.
For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problemÂJohn's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow Âa man he has never once before met.
Set in a future where the future can be seen by three "pre-cogs" murder is a thing of the past as the would be killers are arrested before they can commit their crimes.
From then on the hunter becomes the hunted as Chief John Anderton must run from his own officers to determine why he is destined to kill a stranger before they can incarcerate him.
This movie taps those resources with ingenuity and vision, and takes the viewer to a futuristic world where a crime is punished before it's committed.
Recap: John Anderton is the chief officer at Pre Cog DC, a department that with the aid of three clairvoyant humans stop and arrest murderers before they have their crime.
Three special people, known as the PreCogs, are about to predict murders before they happen.
But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.
It was for instance suggested under President Nixon to preventively take away into reform schools all the kids, aged six or seven, that had the Â« typical criminal Â» psychology before they realized their destiny which was considered as inescapable and necessarily criminal.
Then the criminals are arrested before they commit their crime and put away.
Little by little it appears that the founder of this technology manipulated it in order to prove his theory by arresting someone who was supposed to kill a woman just before he did.
The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?
In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill.
Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen.
The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell.
In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen.
This unit stops murders before they happen, with the help of the "Pre-Cogs."
The "Pre-Cogs" are three psychics who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts their visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of the future crime.
He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen.
You always see it well before anybody dies, and the only horror is based off of cheesy and overblown gore which is more disgusting than scary.
They manage to make some silver arrows in a cheesy forge montage, and the hero says some one-liner before shooting the wolf.
When it dies, it becomes some ugly guy we've never seen before, except when they show it from the side.
The premise is this: A know-it-all Ranger (Robert Pralgo) and his much smarter partner (Dione J. Updike) are trying to kill a predator before he gets a passel of hotties and hunks going up the mountain.
Naturally, the girl shooting the arrow has to fire off a one-liner before she can release the arrow.
Sanders, a cunning adversary, initiates a retaliatory strike against Stanwyck which, before long lands her in a mental asylum.
I was surprised to come upon this film "Witness to Murder" tonight on TV as I hadn't heard of it before - always nice to discover an old movie with excellent, familiar actors.
But that is about ten minutes before the end of the film.
David even brags about his objective to marry Carol and spend the family fortune just before Louise shoots and kills him.
Crawford had won an Oscar just the year before for "Mildred Pierce" so she was red-hot when she made this film.
In that regard, it may very well be a film well before its time.
He is engaged to marry Kay Caldwell (Louise Allbritton), only to find out she has fallen under Dracula's spell even before the Count arrives on the scene.
I've never been clear, for example, on how Kay becomes a vampire; it appears to me that she's shot dead before Dracula ever bites her on the neck.
Most convincingly she deteriorates from a congenial heroine to dangerous psychotic before our very eyes.
This movie takes the smoldering talents of Joan Crawford and lets them burn the screen down, right before your eyes...she's utterly convincing as a fairly demented "possessed" lover, torn to pieces by hideous dysfunction.
She goes through a range of emotions right before our eyes.
Crawford gives one of her great wide-eyed antagonistic performances with fine support from Van Heflin, Raymond Massey (in one of his more amiable roles), the ill-fated Geraldine Brookes (whose previous film for Warners just before this was as Errol Flynn's younger sister in "Cry Wolf") and Stanley Ridges as Crawford's psychiatrist.
The guy who directed The English Patient made this many years before, and he's obviously become a much better film maker.
For all we know, the blast could be so strong that it effects its immediate surroundings seconds before it actually combusts.
Those of you "critics" out there should really think about experiencing these things before you actually go out and condemn this movie for its faults.
If anyone is reading this post before actually seeing this film, run away from "The Vault."
Watch reruns of UFC and PRIDE and see Bas before he became involved in embarrassing films such as this one.
She jumps in pain about two full seconds before the bomb actually goes off.
Persuaded by Honigmann to sing before the camera, the man provides a tune based on the poetry of Hafez and the mournful melody seems to embody all the sadness in the history of PÃ©re-Lachaise.
The character actors like Mischa Auer (frantically trying to retrieve his top hat before he gets challenged to a duel), or Melville Cooper (cornered by his loveless marriage wife, and ending up being unexpectedly blunt), or even Shemp Howard (who has the freshest wine cellar in New Orleans) have excellent moments to shine in this film's comedy.
This movie ranks dead-even with "Wolf" as the closest I've come to being driven to the exits before the closing credits.
As for the climax...well, without giving anything away, it comes out of NOWHERE and (as I've said before) Pfeiffer gives a speech that will have you bolting for the exits.
I'd never seen her in a movie before and now I know why.
I won't go into specifics about the plot, as many others before me have already done that.
Director of many B-Movies before this job, Robert Siodmak would become Universal's most important exponent of the noir style and "Son of Dracula" definitely forecasts his brilliant future in the genre.
In fact it was the first time Bogart ever appeared on the wrong side of the law and his depiction of a violent, shiftless man with no moral centre shows that he had this kind of role down pat five years before his breakthrough in 'The Petrified Forest'.
It would be five more years before he gets his hands on a real meaty role as the villain Duke Mantee in "The Petrified Forest".
I wound up with a copy of this film by accident--and figured I'd watch it before sending it back to the collector who made me a copy of this instead of the film I'd actually requested, so I had little or no expectations...just wanted to see what it was.
A went with a small group of friends, (both gay and straight) and we left before it ended.
As I said before, it's kind of forced like When Boys Fly, but without the heavy-handedness.
Same old stuff we've seen before.
There is nothing I could say more than please just stay away from this film, I know I said this before, but this is just a painful and unfunny movie.
I only had to watch the first fifteen minutes ONCE before I was ready to walk out.
But most of all, you want to be able to somehow turn back time to before you gave the ticket counter your money, walk back out the door, and figure out another way to spend 90 minutes.
Sure enough, it's not long before the mice are poking at and prodding Sylvester with sharp objects or launching the poor kitty through windows.
Milla Jovovich was beautiful, more so than I have seen her before.
Evidently this film was released overseas before it was seen locally.
Over at Warners perhaps a shootout ending with George killing Curley before collapsing dead with Lenny and Mae free to fall in love.
The story is nothing we haven't seen before, but it still comes off fresh and stable with its interesting idea, which silly overtones can feature and convoluted actions creep up.
The characters are grotesque versions of real people, which seems a good idea for comedy but after a while the level of comedy is so basic that i forget to laugh because you've seen it all before.
And how about the fact the the young man she injures in the present-day part of the story just happens to be an "adopted" childhood playmate from whom she was separated dozens of years before, hundreds of miles away?
before this film i usually used to say 'no' to his films, i saw solely this one because of Nicholson, i was not too sure this film amusing me as im a guy whom films normally dont impress but also i do not have a critic's eye, i'm like a normal film viewer.
Fans of Sandler will be laughing at this film like they never had before.
Let me just say one thing, before I comment on this film: Jack Nicholson is a star.
As mentioned before, the cast is great except for the character of  Gutierrez.
Pet Detective (Jim Carrey) ventures out to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot after it is kidnapped from team headquarters just a week before the Super Bowl, to worsen matters dolphin quarterback Dan Marino is abducted.
If you wanted to see Jim Carrey before he was the Grinch then this is the movie to see!
The best has to the last scene where he battles Sean Young before unmasking her "little" secret.
Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor.
His job is to find the dolphin and return it before The Miami Dolphins' crucial game.
The weird twist is the CRazy idea of running the pier as a ship, and takes a while to get your head round this idea, But once you do you can appreciate the film even more, If you don't well you will think the films a load of old tosh... Love it or loath it... i personally love it.. Incidentally the pier used was the Old pier at Hunstanton that was there before the eyesore they have there now, Not too far from me some lovely shots of Hunstanton as well in the film real nostalgia.
How much pain and suffering can a man take before he kills himself?
You'll get to know a little better who Sadako really was before she died, how the curse was born and what makes this whole story so sad and scary at the same time.
And worst of all, the characters seem alien, like I've never known them before!
Meanwhile, Al is led to execution by decapitation, and finds that "Jasmine" is actually Jafar in disguise before they cover his head with a bag before the sword (kind of like modern times in Iraq-Iran).
It depicts prayers before murder (Godfather Trilogy, Pulp Fiction).
right before his arterial spray covered his big screen television.
Why do they say a prayer before whacking the bad guys?
How did Billy Connelly become such a feared hitman when his method of whacking a guy involves standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight with a bunch of guns under his trench coat and waiting to be seen before firing.
it tries so hard to be all stylish and cool (with the irish brothers always reciting a prayer before they pump rounds into the back of someone's head, amongst other things), but fails miserably... well, okay, i suppose i have seen worse movies, but this one was pretty bad.
Meanwhile, entire scenes are lifted from Pulp Fiction: the cat accidentally being killed (paralleling Marvin's unfortunate fate in Pulp Fiction), the bible quotes before executions, and the constant oh-so-cleverly random conversations that don't come close to stuff Tarantino probably wrote in Grade school.
Freeman hasn't played a role like this before or since, and his best known roles to come after this (including Oscar nominated roles) have consisted of more positive characters with effective leadership skills.
John falls down before him in revelation as a dead man.
No one could possibly do the same before Bruce Marchiano's portrayal.
Thankfully, not too much time is given to Him suffering before and at Calvary.
No one has ever played Jesus so well before!!!
Again before someone attacks me, I would like to state that a movie DOESN'T have to contain gore to be good.
I notice that five of the six people who commented before me on "I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now" spoke of the lasting impression it made on them.
I see that others before me had the same hope, only to be blighted.
Basically it involves an incredibly annoying child who somehow tracks down a crazy serial killer before the FBI's finest, including his father, have gotten anywhere with the case.
Okay, before I start, I will be the first to admit that there are a couple of plot holes, an unforgivable contrivance, and that belief does have to be suspended here and there for Jessie the wonder-kid's feats.
Until now, I reviewed it before writing this review and I have to say I hate IMDb.com, and I hate you all for making me re-watch this movie again for the purpose of this review.
The uncut version shows a mafia soldier getting dumped naked into a tub of acid after the villains have cut off his genitals--yes, you see a super hairy cock & balls slashed off and then shoved in his mouth before they tumble him into the acid bath.
Tony fights three of the Don's goons before getting his privates sliced off with a knife..he then gets his penis and testicles shoved down his throat before being tossed in Vito's acid vat!
The sexual violence is on a level you haven't seen before if you haven't seen any Japanese Violent Pink films, the production values are high, the performances are amazing and the jazz score is exceptional.
After the initial shock, Ms. Vitti decides to kill both herself and her now ex-boyfriend, but before doing so she gives herself a week to live it up, so she sells all of her jewels, checks into a reasonably swank hotel, though probably below her usual standards, and parades around Paris in some very eye-catching outfits.
Additionally, I don't know why no one has picked up on this before, but songs in cartoons suck.
They ran great late afternoon movies and reruns I watched for years before cable.
The fact Yolanda was attacked by a maniac years before was one of many surprises and revealed half-way through the novel (as it is in the Argento).
But before long a series of brutal murders begin to occur and poor Yolanda appears to be the prime suspect.
The director, Gerd Oswald, was one of the lesser expatriates from Germany, a pedestrian workman who the year before helmed Crime of Passion, a jejune noir starring Barbara Stanwyck, Sterling Hayden and Raymond Burr; it's hard to extinguish the sizzle in that kind of cast, but Oswald did a pretty fair job of it.
Interesting and sad too, to see the very talented child actor Scotty Beckett long before his untimely descent into crime and early death.
With such 'naked' truths scratching the surface, it's not long before Grant's trouble's really start as with two Mrs Ardens out and about, living, breathing, walking and talking, the authorities are starting to sit up and take notice.
Nick (Cary Grant) was married to Ellen (Irene Dunne) for 4 years before she was shipwrecked, and presumed to be dead.
He however got involved in an automobile accident shortly before the filming of this movie and he had to pass on the directing honers to less experienced Garson Kanin.
But like I said before, I recommend this to any aspiring filmmaker.
These guys discovered that the Black Hills and the Badlands were good movie ground before Hollywood did.
Rarely have I seen animation of this quality before.
The group gets back on its feet before opening and decide to do "Cavalleria Rusticana" and "Pagliacci" instead!
You'd think he'd never seen a beautiful woman before!"
I have never had an animated movie take me on a breathtaking ride like that before.
That never has happened to me before.
Unfortunately, the Queen Bee was once a love interest of Ireland and right before the wedding, she tells this to Carol (Palmer) causing her to commit suicide.
I don't think she ever played such a cruel character before or after this one.
You'd think he'd never seen a beautiful woman before".
This was one of Joan Crawford's last Glamour Queen movie roles, before she started doing horror films and TV, and this part itself is transitional, as she plays a legendary beauty, pathological in her manipulations of the people around her.
They show way too much of the plot in the trailer, so don't watch the trailer before watching the movie.
I suspect that I wasn't really bothered by the others only because I hadn't seen a cast list before seeing the film.
Spain 1965, two young boys dare each other to go and check out a deserted town, before its flooded into a man-made lake.
Although I must say that just before I had watched 'Beneath Still Waters' I'd just finished watching 'The Darkness' (which he produced).
I hoped that they just had to have taken some action and made a difference sooner or later before the movie ended!
Something had to come up, that would make this movie worth watching before the end credits started!
The events take place in a remote Spanish village, days before the great 40th anniversary celebration of the dam that prevented the area from flooding and the subsequent foundation of a brand new town called Desbaria.
Two ruthless boys accidentally saved Salas from a watery death right before the town sunk entirely, and he has been waiting forty years now to seek revenge on the descendants of the previous mayor.
Most of the players appear to be dead long before their characters drown in the lake or become "consumed" by the living mucus & seaweed.
Someone or other has hatched a plan involving building a dam to flood the town and it's inhabitants; but the plan fails when a couple of no good kids end up freeing the cult leader before the town is engulfed in water.
This however is slightly tarnished by his admission - in the "Bonus Features" interviews - that he has never performed a screen kiss before.
why does Salas wait for forty years under the lake before emerging?).
I really hope the Pang brothers put an end to this series of movies before its too late.
I read some of these reviews last night before I watched this film, and now I find it hard to believe that some people were actually unsure as to whether this is a comedy or a horror.
The Pang Brothers should have developed a decent script before churning out yet another disappointing sequel.
I guess the producers were just trying to ride on their success of the first film and trying to produce as many films as possible so as to cash in on them before the steam runs off.
But maybe that was because I watched "Ghost Delivery" before it.
Also, you should see the first two before watching this one, if you haven't already.
This is the best of the Kay Francis vehicles, and I had never heard of it before a couple days ago.
With the rampant infidelity theme this story was probably written with pre-code Hollywood in mind but with the code going into effect the year before it's release it was filmed as a little less salacious.
This is quite true, and that was one of the fears I had before watching this film.
Hollywood used to do this kind of movie regularly, before each one had to become a roller-coaster ride for the $100 million payoff.
I mean, the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker (specially before grandpa dies), but then it picks up the teenager situations.
James Van Der Beek plays the classic quarterback that everyone has met before and just loves to hate.
Early in the film, Grampa wished that Angus could talk to Melissa just once before he died.
It lacks the pace of the original (in the case of the 7 days before you die) but for me I found the story more intriguing, gripping and unpredictable.
It took psychological horror to a whole new level, held a genuine sense of mystique and ambiguity, and made the Deus Ex Machina more frightening than ever before.
RING 2 was followed by the Korean/Japanese co-production RING (1999) and another Japanese entry, RING O: BIRTHDAY (2000), before the series relocated to America for Gore Verbinski's THE RING (2002), bringing the mythos to a wider audience than ever before.
The director has explored this topic previously in films such as The Unfaithful Wife and Wedding in Blood (among others), but Pleasure Party stands out because it's an overall much darker tale than what went before, and may well be a contender for Chabrol's all time darkest film.
It's not long before this plan backfires in spectacular fashion as Ester meets Habib and Phillipe becomes very jealous of their relationship...
Apparently she's some kind of pop star in real life but I was unaware of that before being impressed with her performance.
But before you watch it, purge yourself of all scary expectations.
I'd still watch Gore's before this or the others in this particular series, but hey, I am a Westerner.
Wisely, Takashi chooses to go off in a new direction with the story instead of merely rehashing what has come before.
Series note: As should be apparent from the above description, it's imperative that you watch Ringu before seeing Ringu 2.
You may also wish to watch Ringu 0: Basudei (2000) before Ringu, and for fun, the original "Ring 2", Rasen/Spiral (1998) before or after this "replacement sequel" (this one was produced when audiences were dissatisfied with the very differently toned Rasen/Spiral).
It is now back in those two cities before, hopefully, opening wider across the country.
It begins with a bang literally, where a homeless man (Geoffrey Rush) with a gun in hand, asks Jim Peck (Anthony LaPaglia) for a cigarette and a light, before launching into some really clever moments about manipulation.
In fact, it was so good that I began watching it after 1am and had planned on only seeing the first 10-15 minutes before bed.
But what Joan film role *didn't* become Joan herself Â either before or *after* filming?
YUCK   It`s hardly Ferrara`s best work and it`s probably recommended that potential audience members should familarise themselves with the director`s work before watching it   Four out of ten
Some people when they hear about this probably relate it to the Godfather before even seeing it, and they are wrong for doing this.
It's another gangster movie, but one with a story I've never seen before and really enjoyed.
With the bad guys hot on their trail and time running out before the pilot suffocates, the clerk must gain the trust and help of the pilot's unhappy girlfriend (Ryan, Quaid's real life ex-wife now).
Now Pendelton, his beautiful ex-girlfriend, Lydia, (Meg Ryan) and Putter, have to work together to get the other chip back, and re-enlarge the pod before Tuck runs out of oxygen.
Pendleton manages to make audio contact with Jack from inside of him, and together they try and save Pendleton before his air supply runs out.
I'm a big fan of 1980's blockbusters, especially irreverent, imaginative fare like GhostBusters, Back to the Future, etc, not to mention masterworks such as Spielberg's early classics; in today's era of bigger, bigger and not quite better spectacle, the 1980's equivalent of the big summer movies look more and more like a Second Golden Age of Entertainment than ever before, with lots of films that haven't dated thanks to an abundance of great ideas, freshness, with, great genre performances and a healthy blend of natural, human character and fantastic special and visual effects.
Meg Ryan is also very charming and engaging as Lydia (very cute too, in the days before she milked said cuteness to disagreeable levels in her 90's films), who tags along for the ride but doesn't get let in on the whole truth of the story for the most part.
The film is so bursting with invention that often things are touched upon and then dropped before they've really been explored.
With Tuck and Jack now having to depend on each other for survival, they team up with Tuck's ex girlfriend Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan) to recover the stolen chip before Tuck's air supply runs out.
Also Robert Picardo camping it up superbly as The Cowboy, one of his most memorable creations, plus the great pairing of Fiona Lewis and Kevin McCarthy, who memorably says to his dog before feeding it: 'Never beg, never beg!'
It was an eye-opening experience to hear him say this, something I had honestly never thought about before.
The paths of the gang and the tyrant passed before, and sweet revenge or brutal death is imminent as they meet again.
I mean, some guys come up with the brilliant plan of walking straight into a bank loaded with treasure yet with no guards whatsoever, flash a gun, take the money before some guy chasing them magically appears outside from nowhere and we have a final shootout.
You know it's only a matter of time before the obligatory cat fights and wet blouse tussles take center stage.
William only made a few more films after this before he died of cancer in 1948, which makes Blore's hopeless look at the camera at the end with "Here we go again!"
This movie is the adaptation of Stefan Zweig's story "Letter from an unknown woman" to China settling in a time period before the cultural revolution (1930-1948).
To sum everything up: the inexplicably popular Hulk Hogan, washed-up can't-believe-it's-not-porno star Shannon Tweed, Apollo Creed, the cop from "Last House" (who was cool before I saw this) and some other guy who is cleaning up vomit at Wal-Mart while you read this shoot for hours and hours and hours from open spaces without getting a scratch.
Unless of course there's a fight scene needed, then the baddies get hit over and over again before they finally get knocked out.
Way before Woody Allen laid claim to the same people and the same territory, this 1967 film based on a 1964 play by Murray Schisgal, directed on Broadway by the young Mike Nichols (who had been Elaine May's partner in Chicago) may be the first Hollywood film ever to feature a group of highly neurotic, overly articulate, and Â-although never named as such Âapparently middle-class Jewish urban characters.
But it's not before Ellen and Harry discover they have common interests (flamenco) that two hearts beat like one.
It parodies the love-life in a hedonistic but insecure society ten years before ANNIE HALL.  
It's designed to tell us the tragic story of Sadako's life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations.
Either George goes back to pot before his next stand-up or I shall have to take it up to tolerate his new very dark attempts at humor.
Surely these can't be the same George Carlin fans who loved his work before.
He's forcing more Americans to look (and laugh if they have the courage) at themselves than he ever has before.
The loss of the age before white settlement is lamented.
A few Hollywood movies that paint the indigenous people of America before westward expansion as noble savages - also a pleasant fiction, incidentally - does not make up for a century of bias, misinformation, and outright lies taught to American schoolchildren.
The project was begun less than a year before Ms. Richard's sole defeat in life--to emphysema at the age of 80.
And only days before she died, Ms. Richards received her 3rd Emmy award for a role in the TV series "The Practice."

Otherwise the seamen will get stinking drunk before signing on for another long voyage.
His drunk shipmates pulled him off the ship before it left, but again one man was left out of their crew after he was knocked unconscious.
The members are killed off one by one - each one receiving a little poem before hand.
While A Study in Scarlet was the first Holmes mystery Conan Doyle wrote, it had been filmed only twice before, with an English feature and an American short both appearing in 1914.
I watched this show once in mid 90s on Discovery because I saw Connections before this and liked Burke as the narrator.
The first part is based on history before 1990.
A bad cop ends up being the real guilty party and the two stars eventually team up to bring him down but not before many deaths.
She was big box office fodder and drew in the punters even before Michelle Yeoh became the number one bad ass beaatch!
Rothrock moved away from those movies in the early 90's and had a brief slew of theatrical films in the US before dropping into the DTV market where she remains a popular draw.
I just got that new Dragon Dynasty version of the film, though I'd never seen it before last night.
Every other scene in the film, mandatory orgy included, fades from the memory long before that particular episode dims.
Meanwhile, Kirk races desperately against the clock to find them before he is forced to abandon the search to pursue a priority mission.
So, it's up to the the town sheriff to convince everybody that they will have to leave before the bees attacked.
But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as "commond").
This was Tom Selleck's big break, he was a soap opera star before "Magnum" and even a contestant on "The Dating Game" ... "Magnum" is what put Tom Selleck on the superstar map, and since "Magnum" he has been tremendously successful as a big box office movie star!!
She is gravely ill and is only awaiting the arrival of her granddaughter Luisa before dying.
Nor would I even try.As a few more extras get stung and die-the only way to get out of this bad movie before the drawn out ending-the sheriff tries to warn the townspeople.But don't pluck your tulips just yet,folks.The sheriff saves the day and the plants are pollinated just in time for crop season.As for the herd of dead stung cattle-we assume 'Killer Bees 11' will start with the town having a big old barbecue.
It certainly made me laugh, as well as cry, especially the end after Shane arrives at the Pow-Wow in Alberqueque & sees in the people there, some of the elements of the people in the stories that he was told by his grandfather before he died on the way, then watching him beat the drum to start the storytelling and remembering what he was like at the beginning rebelling against everyone & everything.
Next thing you know, our hero has been framed for the murder of a prostitute and he now needs to find out who the real killer is before he's locked away.
We've all heard that phrase before, and if ever that tried and true proverb needs uttering it's when discussing Gareth Rhys Jones' 1999 directorial debut, Bodywork.
it has no relation to lock stock,its far more left field than that watch this film its great.also the acting is superb charlot Coleman's last film before she tragically died saw a performance second to none.
Never before have I ever been put on such a roller-coaster of emotion from mind-blowingly intense scenes to scenes which make me feel sick.
Luke Ford was excellent with portraying Charlie and Rhys Wakefield's exceptional representation of having to live with a disabled sibling will hopeful make the public think about the family life of a disabled child/adult before they stop and stare and whisper.
I read a short commentary about the Darjeeling Limited before it was finished.
Anderson may not have used a straight, constantly progressing story structure before either, but he clearly knows it, because the humor and poignancy come in the way he meddles with non-sequiturs and inconvenient interruptions of rambling.
Especially impressive is the scene showing the brothers before the trip to India (I liked how the scene throws the audience off).
They also went to India and took a trip before the writing, living the experience before they made it into a screenplay.
But before we get to that, there's a kind of pendant, called 'Hotel Chevalier,' which sometimes will be shown with 'Darjeeling,' sometimes not.
I have never seen any Wes Anderson film before, in fact I hoped to see a film which makes a clever and funny statement about civilization torn lifestyle .
There is a huge turn into a more somber mood about halfway through that brings up memories of Luke Wilson's big scene in The Royal Tenenbaums (nobody tries to commit suicide, mind you) and the film picks up on the dramatic sentiment before jolting right back into the uniquely brilliant world that always keeps my sides in stitches.
Extremely recommended viewing (other than Anderson's previous efforts) before watching this amazing film is Hotel Chevalier, a 13 minute short film directed by Anderson and starring Jason Schwartzman, available for free download online through Itunes.
He must try to warn the people of his town before a Honey Festival (a really lame excuse to attract the bees) takes place.
The classic screwball comedy of a type never seen before in French cinema (and, possibly, never after).
The new interface is essentially that of other RTS titles(don't get me wrong, the engine is all-new), and this, unfortunately, puts some focus on aspects of these games that others(with this other interface) did better which still haven't been attended to, basically all falling into the category of overview... compared to the excellent overview of StarCraft and the Age of Empires games... titles released several years before this.
I recommend this to any fan of RTS titles who is interested in the concept and the promise of better graphics, but faithful fans of C&C may want to be sure before they try it.
sounds we're similar to everything you have seen before.
Never before have I seen promiscuity, gambling, deceit, drug use, and gun play so eloquently infused with the likes of philosophical banter.
I believe this would be the shortest review I've ever given and I've never been so sure of myself quite like this before.
The story line has been replicated, to much better standards, at least a thousand times before the directors of this film were even born.
Personally I knew very little about it before I bought it today and watched it, and I was pleasantly surprised.
Toback manages to cut against any intuitive rhythm, just a millisecond before you'd expect him to.
I found out about this film long before I was able to rent it and I know I'll own it soon.
And finally, when the aunts become possessed, they are suddenly filled with a sense of perception they were missing before.
What is most bothersome of this film, like the one before it, is that continuity is thrown completely out the window.
I really don't believe there will be a Dracula 4.. but if there is I can only hope it will be better than before.
I've just sat through all three movies and I have to say that the Dracula 2000-series' best before date was... well the year 2000.
I recommend this to those who liked the two Dracula movies before it.
I first saw the film in NYC as a sneak preview before 2001 Space Odyssey.
i do not know why i have not posted a comment on this film before now.
We also get to discover some of Sadako's back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape.
I'm not writing any more plaudits for this movie, for most everything has been said about it before.
Between the surreal dystopia of Eraserhead and the artistic immobility of Dune, and before critics labeled him as the auteur of Weird America with permanent marker, David Lynch directed this strange but true story set in London, England during the late 1800's.
The year before this film was released Bernard Pomerance's play opened on Broadway.
I just watched this movie last night and i must say... it touched me in a way no other movie has... some of the scenes even brought me to tears, which has never happened to me before.... John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....  but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time "I pray to god that he's an idiot", sadly, he is everything but that...  10/10, no question
I would definitely rent this one before I seriously considered buying it.
There aretimes, such as this one, when I think that those who edit films should be test-run before a small audience, if only to see how far deletions can be unsatisfactory.
Valdez responds, "No, Apache...before I knew better."
Valdez tried to smooth things over by consulting with the black man, but hothead RL Davis(Richard Jordan..a bucketful of energy and spunk)open fires before the constable to get the honest proof of the victim's innocence.
Then why does each ignore the warnings when they arise before hand?
The son suddenly discovers that he is talking to his dad 2 days before he dies!
I have never got so wrapped up in a film before that has caused me to react in such a way.
Plus, they managed to weave this one into a suspense/thriller, and threw in another one of my favorite fictional concepts for good measure: time travel, in this film represented by the parallel dimension through which a son speaks to his father before his death 30 years ago.
They must now race against time 30 years apart to stop this killer before he can kill John's mother/Frank's wife, and several other women.
Considering the limited budget, the juicy effects on display are pretty damn good, and the film sure doesn't hold back with the nastiness: one man has his limbs hacked off, before being impaled (between the legs) on a pike; a fat guy gets stuck trying to escape, and has his ass eaten; and even a little girl gets reduced to spare parts by the demonic old dears!
While the filmmakers do succeed in convincingly constructing "Frequency," most audiences might have to leave logic at the theater entrance before viewing it.
Gregory Hoblit produces the right amount of action and suspense, combined with gentle emotions, to generate a film we have not seen before.
The idea of this film is pretty original; I don't think I've ever heard of a story so well-thought out about time-travel/alternate time-lines before.
On October 10th 1969 sun spots rise up the day before the fatal day in the warehouse.
Just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been aired before "High School Musical" it probably would not have seemed as bad.
A wonderful movie, made before its time.
Favorite moments: 1. the ENTIRE road trip down the East Coast as the Honeymoon starts to end before it even begins.
Very much worth seeing before one sees any remaking of it.
It's funny; it could have been funnier, but for something I never heard of before a street vendor offered it to me, it ain't bad.
Has something similar been done before?
His character Priestly is very different from any other character I've seen him play before and is, in a way, a visual representation of many of the film's themes - that people are often not who and what they appear, that they are more than what we assume them to be, and that we need to look beyond the immediate.
Shot like a TV rom com, acted like it was shot before a live audience by inexperienced actors (ie they stick with entirely average performances rather than work them into something decent), lit for TV, scripted with a "try to please everyone" dumbed-down - syrup coated - hollow - interconnection of not really connected stories.
Yes it had it moments when the wheels where spinning in my head and I was able to call it before it happened but it also keep my guessing and took a few turns I never would have guessed.
He the kind of guy you might just have to look at twice for before you judge him.
I'm surprised that this wasn't snatched up by a distributor (note to distributors - snatch this up before the bidding war begins).
I wasn't sure what to expect because I had never seen an independent film before.
Robert Altman made industrial films before his first, undistinguished feature, which starred future "Billy Jack," Tom McLoughlin.
Neither knows that the other is walking death row, either figuratively or literally, but love intercedes on their behalf: just as a star is brightest before its extinction, so too is love at its most passionate when the lovers' time is limited.
'One Way Passage' was produced by Warner Brothers before he moved to M-G-M in 1934.
Even before 'The Thin Man (1934),' however, Powell was one of the classiest stars in Hollywood, here delivering his dialogue with unsurpassed aplomb.
Both fall in love and spend all their time together--even though their love is fated to end before its time.
And now, almost 75 years later, One Way Passage can still hold a viewer's attention with its story of some passengers on a last voyage before everything changes.
By chance, they meet before sailing on a ship set-sailing for San Francisco, and fall in love.
The team of Powell and Francis had appeared together in four films at Paramount before being signed by Warner Brothers in 1932 when they made this film along with another classic, "Jewel Robbery".
Others have plots that are there, but one has to watch the movie five times before understanding it all.
Read Petronius' surviving fragments before watching the film, and do not focus on the well known passages everyone has studied in Latin 101, instead consider the disjointed rhythms of the randomly fragmented narrative.
Others have plots that are there, but one has to watch the movie five times before understanding it all.
The images metamorphose from monochrome to color, from abstraction to realism, from seeming to be in a studio to being outdoors before your amazed eyes.
I'd been meaning to see this movie for about a year, before I was finally able to order it off the internet.
The few scary moments before the final scenes are pretty good, employing 'should i look behind me'?
techniques much like the previous films, but before i get to the final scenes, i'll explain everything else.
The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds Sadako just before opening night.
The night before he was leaving to go back to LA was almost the last straw.
The story telling devices used in this flick have been used before in more memorable movies.
A diary that neither she nor her daughter have apparently ever looked at before.
Layer that with the oh so obvious feeling that this was done before (and better) with Forrest Gump and you feel like this is a rehash of the same idea.
This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before.
I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of this film before seeing it but there was nothing else good on, so I gave it a try.
The episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to remember whether Tilda Swinton's character showed up before or after Benjamin went to war, but it doesn't even matter.
And why do we have to watch the two characters go back and forth before they land up together?
It's a frustrating glimpse of what might have been, had the filmmakers chosen to put the character before the gimmick, instead of the other way around.
It's a pity that Fincher, who has used him to such great effect twice before, didn't let him cut loose.
What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go.
I had not checked the IMDB rating before we watched it so I was surprised that it had a 7.0 avg.
The hospital sequence, which lasts nearly an hour, is simply an amazing piece of action choreography, which tops anything done before or since.
The action is so insane that you'll probably see this over a hundred times before you die.
Those that don't die often come perilously close to dying, before getting up and moving on as if nothing had happened.
Instead, '0' takes us back 30 years before the original Ring, to where Sadako is an apprentice for a theatre company.
But the older Sadako does not initiate any of the terror unleashed, and it is only a matter of time before the troupe accuses her of being a killer, whereas in reality she possesses the power to heal.
were made before the two English audio versions were made, but the American cast seemed above par for computer voice acting.
It is a triumph of style over substance, though the substance comes damn near close to the style of Scorsese's direction that is later seen in his other triumphs (you get the feeling you've seen every type of shot before in this film if you've seen other Scorsese pictures).
This is one of those movies taking a rather gritty look at the world of Italian-Americans, before it became a clichÃ©.
It wouldn't be long before Scorsese could spin a plot that was up to the par of his technical skills; Mean Streets (1973) is in the same league as later efforts like Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, and it's a great showcase for a much younger De Niro (who was on point right from the start of his relationship with ol' Marty).
Speaking to Sheriff Tod Shaw (Sterling Hayden) about the momentous nature of his intent, Johnny declares - "...the first man they shoot to the moon in a rocket will take pains too, it's just never been done before".
She was portrayed here as sad lonely woman, missing what these young men already have : the friendship, who dies with the beauty of that era and the end of those guys' minority too; as if this time was the adolescence's climax of America itself before Vietnam, the series of assassinations, the hippie revelation.. etc.
Instead of smoothly starting a line after someone is done the actors just stand there and wait for about 3 seconds before speaking.
I've never been to a strip club before *cough* but if the girls there are as bleh as the ones in this BS movie then I'll just stick to watching my neighbors strip down thanks to the hidden camera I installed in her bathroom.
The movie came along during a low point of Sinatra's career before his 1954 Oscar reversed the slump.
He had done that type of film before, with independent man John Singleton, among others in that film I regret not seeing yet, "Boyz N' the Hood".
I may well be wrong in this, but I thought the show came before the toys.
The ending is not the most satisfying for my taste, seeming to negate what has gone before, but logic is not of the essence here.
Even Jed's fractured memories are conveyed with flashes of light, incoherent background noise and a pair of clattering spurs seemingly dancing before the terrified childs face.
The big "secret" that is revealed at the end was easily guessed a long time before the big revelation.
Reportedly this movie was viewed by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before he assassinated President Kennedy.
He never quite made it, but Harry Carey, Jr. in only his second film before he was 'introduced' in Three Godfathers, certainly has had one long and successful career.
Then ended up laughing at the scene before he could complete the call to his lawyer and becoming a fan of the show.
Another oddity about the film "Sudddenly" is that it was actually broadcast on the CBS network's "The Early Show" weeks before the assassination of JFK took place in November 1963.
Only the psycho and insecure Barnon thinks that he can pull this off, even after Benny is shot dead by the Suddenly police, as he cased out the train station less then an hour before the president's train was to arrive.
Give it some time, at least until the awesome episode DNA, before you disregard it out of hand.
If you haven't seen it before, quickly rush out and buy series 1 through 8.
For me, Star Wars pulled it off most of the time (although my wife would probably argue), Star Trek never quite did it for me ["Captain, we've never seen anything like this life force before" -"Oh, well I have, last episode"] Red Dwarf doesn't pull it off, it's neither funny, nor new in its sci-fi ways, but it takes the price as the only blend of Space Balls, Eastenders, herbal tea, and James Brown.
You could relate to all characters (all the actors deserve the highest praise), and although there were plenty of plot holes, and continuity problems, there was a classic blend of good story lines, mixed with classic British-style humour.............it was unlike anything else before or since.
This 1995 script has Katie telling her classmates how "civilization as we know it" will collapse by the year 2000 (The same drivel that teachers back in 1980 told children would happen before 1990; the same claptrap that's vomited in classrooms across America today).
The action is well cut, though i would have liked it to be a bit less "shaky" but it seems this trend will have to develop to its extreme before it starts to vanish again (hopefully soon i wanna see the effort the actors and stuntman put into their swordplay more clearly!).
:D The background story to the beast and its motivation close before the final and the portrait of it really gave the whole thing more depth to it and i liked it very much, because that way you can just be all "alienhating" over the course of the whole movie and get this slight "oh noes i feel bad for them" feeling right before it ends :D I like that the viking cast does not only consist of 2 meter man with 1 meter broad shoulders grunting and shouting, but that they are more displayed as humans, normal men (unlike Pathfinder / King Arthur), which i honestly had expected to happen, because of the "B-movieish" kind of nature of the main idea for the movie.
All of the above having been said, there are some things to keep in mind before viewing Outlander.
I rented this one and it languished on my Apple TV for two weeks before I decided to see if I would be very disappointed for a half-hearted Beowulf knockoff.
I call the story Groundbreaking in that NO ONE ever before has truly combined Sci-fi and Vikings, and pull it off so well.
Maybe is something that we all have seen before, but never with this kind of achievement.
"Outlander" is a great surprise by director Howard McCain - honestly never heard of him before, but I'll be keeping an eye on his work from now on!
In the supporting cast we have John Hurt and Ron Perlman (they've collaborated before on the Hellboy movies).
The production design, the sets and the costumes were also very good, but what really impressed me were the flashback sequences of Kainan's life before falling down to Earth.
I was very skeptical before watching this film.
I personally would love to see the Americas (North and South) before the full arrival of Europeans.
Not because Europeans were "bad" but simply to see something before it's changed dramatically.
Among the omissions: Gleason's film work (all the way back to the '40s and on to the year before his death), his first TV sitcom ("The Life Of Riley" was a 1949-50 Emmy winner!)
There follows a string of crummy gags (broken up by a rather lovely aerial view sequence) before the main storyline kicks in, with Porky taking part in a race with a more powerful train.
so sad.=-{ by the way, the 10 star rating, that's me just being sarcastic, before you all get all pissy at me.
In some episode, this girl was SO UPSET because her mommy gave her as a gift, a FABULOUS car, three days before the girl's birthday.
Another standard character is the oily aspiring Governor who, all of a sudden, decides to hunt the monster by himself in his helicopter in what emerges as the film's undeniable highlight of absurdity Â he throws huge chunks of meat into the sea to entice it, but we're never sure just what he'll do once the shark turns up (needless to say, we're not allowed to find out as both the man and his vehicle tumble to the sea before long).
i was also surprised when i read that it was released as Jaws 3 in some countries when it hit the theaters, well it is better than Jaws pt 3 and 4. one thing that i like with this movie (spoiler warning) is the ending - right about after the sharks death - when they all get safety on land just before the end text is coming and the sad music is appears - it reflects sorrow, evil and even madness, and the survivors gets into the car - it is a great scene probably the best in the entire movie (according to me).
Just don't eat anything before you watch it.
As one of the reviewers has mentioned before, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously.
It is ending from the very beginning -- but it takes a long, increasingly loaded ordeal before it finally hits us with the tragic conclusion.
But before we write it off as art-house exploitation, let me add that the plot machinations and breakthrough acting devices alone (that blend character, voice-over, narrating to the camera and rehearsing to the camera) put it in an exceptional class of movie.
I am not kidding Â they tie him up, give him electric shocks, and use him for sex before urinating on his face.
I believe the stories that this was pulled from circulation simply because I had never heard of it before.
Although there's much nastiness and depravity on show (from Thanassoulis being tied down and given electro-shock treatments before Herold urinates on his face, to Valley raping him and then vomiting on his face, to the denouement where Thanassoulis kills Valley with a knife he has strapped on like a dildo), the film never really feels nasty and sick.
We then follow the daughter as she details the things her and her mother get up to, before the weary detective; who is given the name 'Singapore Sling', stumbles into the pair's home and ends up becoming 'involved' in more insane games.
I have to be honest before I give my opinion towards this movie.
Apart from maintaining their incestuous lesbian relationship, the women now also compete for the sexual interest of their male guest, and it doesn't take too long before ambiguous conspiracies are thought up.
Shot in striking black-and-white in a very 1940's detective-story/film-noir style, but rife with "extreme" exploitation material - I honestly can say I've seen nothing like it before.
Not saying they weren't nuts before, but I'm guessing father wouldn't have approved of everything they're now doing....even though father was a murderer.
This movie was previewed before Captain America.
Never before has the emotion of the Gulf War been captured on film with such accuracy!
Nothing new was brought to the table and is nothing that the serious exploit fan hasn't seen before - but WAY better done...
Those were the days before the BBFC so it was not censored in any way.
However they stumble upon a crazy cult of yet more evil people who want to "reduce them to sexual beasts" before killing them.
And there is even a completely unnecessary and unrelated side-story about two villains who want to smuggle a drugged girl across the Mexican border to sell her to a brothel - but not before raping her themselves ...  As you can probably tell from this summary, this is sexploitation at its best (or worst, depending on your point of view).
It's also astounding to see Hu reach in the same epic manner this conclusion, more than a decade before the venerable Kurosawa's "old man's lament" in "Ran".
I saw this well before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the comparison was painful to my eyes.
A Touch of Zen was mercifully made in a time before such depressing trends in films.
This has certainly been attempted before (unsuccessfully) in other games but the Starcraft developers got it more or less right.
Luna dies before Lorenzo can tell her that he is her father, but this death has to be a secret too.
She has to travel this world and meet the characters of his fiction in "real life", before she will see him again.
In this film we see the human side of Sadako before her death & the cruel attitude of others towards her.
Most of them are fun, and they grow more challenging, so you won't tire of it before you're done, either.
But I find it hard to believe that a couple of years before these two actors started showing up in these movies, they starred in "Tammy and the T-Rex".
Julio Medem had directed a few movies before this one, with his "key" movies (Vacas, Tierra, Ardilla roja, Amantes del circulo polar) being basically the same plot rehashed in a different way.
This is certainly not the best Japanese movie ever, there are a bit too much technical flaws (could partially have been due to a bad tape though, I've seen it on the Brussels BIFFF festival), and a bit too many clichÃ©'s in the plot, and the gore was a bit too soft(for a movie advertised as a horror movie, that is) it doesn't really have something to stand out from the rest of the new Japanese movie....except for its atmosphere...really liked the atmosphere, which had a lot to do with the decors, which were very well put together.... the two people who I went to see the movie with hated it, mainly for the flaws I've mentioned before, but I guess this is a typical case of "if you concentrate too much on the flaws you'll hate it, otherwise it just might grab you, and you're in for a very enjoyable ride"  So to be brief: I loved it but I can't really recommend it...still I'll give it an 8, mainly to promote a talented filmmaker which I'm sure will deliver a few brilliant movies if he gets the budget he deserves
The elevator soon becomes a HELLEVATOR when a young, nervous police officer enters with two extremely dangerous prisoners moments before the aforementioned large explosion causes him to be distracted long enough for the prisoners to get the upper hand and wreak havoc.
Hellevator is a fairly well done cyberpunk movie that makes adequate use of an unusual setting but runs out of steam just before the inexplicable ending.
Of course I don't have to provide a spoiler to tell you what happens after that, unless you've never seen a movie before.
Things are complicated for Jakob when his friends start to believe that the bulletin came from a radio that Jakob owns - a radio which doesn't exist - and begin to hound him, some for more information, and some because they want him to destroy it before it destroys them.
Jakob the Liar is an underrated movie.I just want to say that before anything else in my review.The movie tells about Jakob Heym, excellently played by Robin Williams.Jakob is a Jewish shop keeper living in Polish ghetto in 1944.He overhears a German radio broadcast about Russian troop movements.When he shares the information with a friend a rumor about a secret radio starts spreading in the ghetto.Jakob starts making up stories to the ghetto inhabitants he has heard from his 'secret radio'.This way he brings hope to the people who are losing it.Peter Kassovitz' Jakob the Liar (1999) hasn't got as much credit it would have deserved.It's a movie about an important matter.It combines comedy and tragedy in a great way.It has a brilliant cast.Robin Williams is just amazing.This actor, who turns 55 today (congratulations) has a great ability to act both comic and dramatic roles.He is a great man and a great actor.The young Hannah Taylor- Gordon is excellent playing Lina Kronstein, the Jewish girl Jakob is hiding.She was amazing also playing Anne Frank a couple years later.I hope we'll be hearing a lot from her in the future.Then there are also these greats; Bob Balaban (Kowalsky), Alan Arkin (Max Frankfurter), Michael Jeter (Avron), Liev Schreiber (Mischa the Prizefighter), director's son Mathieu Kassovitz (Herchel) and lots of others.This is a movie that can make you laugh and it is a movie that can make you cry.It shows all these poor people living under the horrors of war, under the circumstances you can not justify.
It is not an attempt to profit from LA VITA E BELLA (this was filmed in the autumn of '97, before the Benigni film was even released in Italy).
This movie was so bad that even after watching XXX immediately before Sex and Lucia; it was still painful to witness.
"Charlotte Sometimes" addresses questions of love, intimacy and sex in ways that I've never seen before.
Rather than show some initiative, he waits for others to take action before he does anything.
I didn't really know much about Sally Anne Howes before this film, but I think she was great in it.
i only got 10 min into the movie before the picture went and i just shut it off.
She made this between "American Beauty" (before its release) and "Ghost World".
I wish I had checked the IMDB reviews for this movie before renting it.
But still there is some way to go before the quality in all aspects rise up to what we've become accustomed to.
I just rented the movie and I hadn't heard about it before.
version of this one but like suggested earlier before, this movie got more complexity, originality & layers - thus more enjoyable.
Eleven unwitting participants are thrown together into a city wide game in which they must split up into teams and make it across the finish line before their time expires.
As I mentioned before, I enjoy the American version a little more, but if you watch them side-by-side, you will realize that they are both two great shows that should still be on.
Song styles before becoming about the same thing every time by Wayne Brady, were actually funny and were about different things.
I got a free pass to see this at the Vancouver premiere which was pretty cool with a red carpet and paparazzi with the stars which I had no clue Vancouver ever had before.
Years before cultural studies, masculinity is systematically shown to a performance, a process of becoming.
He really was the Godfather of modern comedy and i can't believe i got to the age of 30 before i found this on late night TV.
The film itself epitomises his daring; nobody had ever released a major theatrical feature of a standup comedy performance before and no movie studio wanted it.
Never before has sex played such a key part in the storytelling of a movie.
Get a group of your friends (preferably mixed race -- his white/black insights are superb) and be ready to laugh like you have never laughed before.
I didn't knew about it before I went to the movie and when he was flashing it, I thought he cannot drop that but to my fear he actually did.
A year back before leaving, he had promised that he would be back and meet her on the same bridge that he saw her waiting.
It's definitely the type of love story that Bollywood has never narrated before.
I have never actually posted to this sight before but I found this movie to be so excellent that I thought I would.
I personally have never been shown footage like that before for general viewing.
When I was younger this video was in the local grocery store's limited children's section (way before Blockbuster was on the scene), I probably had my parents rent Animalympics at least once a month.
I really enjoy this " before born" joke about her.
We watch the frightening, tragic story of Sadako unfold before our eyes.
This is a wonderful film - expertly voiced over by Billy Crystal, Gilda Radner and Harry Shearer (of Spinal Tap / Simpsons fame) - full of humour and genuine affection towards sports, animals and animation (which is top quality throughout it should be noted) and as i mentioned before the songs are great - perhaps a bit dated now with the late 70s/early 80s production, but then a great tune never fails to touch you somehow, no matter how it is presented.
The sheriff reluctantly agrees, takes the boss's woman home, and relieves his frustrations on her before trying to carry the Indian awayÂ   Meyer does indeed have a fascination for very richly gifted women, and this film is no exceptionÂ The scene where Bolger talks the nurse into giving him a body massage is a classic erotic teaseÂ Also, Meyer has very cleverly juxtaposed a sensual lesbian scene against a bloody battle between the sheriff and the IndianÂ But much of the sex is unmotivatedÂ Meyer cuts so quickly, however, that it is more of a lack of respect tease than an exploitive treatment of sexÂ   Larissa Ely (Raquel) is wonderful as the steamy, sweaty, desert young womanÂ Linda Ashton (Cherry) is delightful as the sexy nurse, but Charles Napier steals the show as the violent, explosive, cruel of a sheriffÂ
I'd played all three before and thought they were all great.
Also absent was the choice of "light" and "mega" that was present in other games, because playing on lite first for a little while might have been helpful for "getting used" to the game before really going for it.
)and especially : Bad casting (although the Male lead character who's name escapes me DID closesly resemble a HeMan type o' guy...)  If you are into this kind of "underground" movies, go right ahead and take a good laugh at it before you return it to the video rental store, because I know you won't laugh as easily if you decided to actually buy this one....
The plot is simple: The government injects a spider with alien DNA, it lays an egg in someone before it dies, the offspring hatches in a decent gross-out scene, and crap happens.
Unfortunately for Marci and her fellow 'snoopers', the unlucky astronaut has been impregnated by a genetically mutated spider, and it's not long before a huge, ravenous arachnid emerges from his body to feed...
Okay, it's all very predictable, with the old conspiracy style "government creates some kind of horrible hybrid monster via experiment that goes wrong" storyline being utilised in the same old way countless movies have before.
contains spoilers the govenment is carrying out experiments on a spider and injecting it with alien DNA but when a sola flare hits the space craft were the experiment is taking place the spider escapes and begins to kill of the crew one by one then laying egges in a surviver with boldging bodyparts the special effects really get going when the spider comes out of the hosts mouth and begins to attack anyone in its path including three nosey college newspaper reporters the spider is finaly killed but not before laying egges in its creater ( some phsyco messed up bloke) who when the students get out of the lab underground find there boss dead and the phsyco bloke sitting in there seat then the spider is born.
I was only 8 years old and cried harder than I had ever cried before when I saw this movie.
Finally, Eileen Way's faithful portrayal of Lady Slane's caring maid/caregiver quite naturally brought the tears to my eyes moments before the end of this three part series.
I used to have the LP record soundtrack but 'lost' it years ago before going overseas (Grrrrr)  How do we go about getting a petition or whatever for the film company to release a DVD and CD soundtrack????
You have never seen a movie anything like this before, and unless you see Drivers Wanted, you never will.
In light of this AND that the man had been on the brink of bankruptcy before this leads many to think he must be cheatingÂbut how?
however, he is making movies unlike anyone ever has before; he takes his audience on a no-class induced hallucination through motel room and trailers, unveiling a world utterly no one is accustomed to.
Full of mindless disco beats, these songs have no meaning at all, and will most likely give you a migraine before they even start.
Here though it's more a recollection from his youth, a sunny tale from an idyllic 1960's summer that turns dark before the story ends.
Jackie Chan directed this fairly typical parodic plagiarism of several of his own films (and a few from before his time).
It's fairly short, but sort of drawn out at the same time because this whole story of a demented young individual poisoned by the ravages of civilization has been told many times before and in better situations.
Nate (Richard O'Neal) goes off on a cattle drive, not before having sex with his wife,Sarah (Barbara Bourbon), of course.
I just hope this was something Bixby had to do before venturing into the last installment which ended the Hulk saga on a high note.
With 30 minutes before he has to leave, he and Sarah tumble back into bed for a lovely lovemaking scene.
Now, the mission is to escape before the bats kill everyone!
I have never worked as an office temp before, but after seeing this movie, I have a very clear image as to what it must be like.
Lisa Kudrow, too, gives another great performance (and this was before her scene-stealing role in "The Opposite of Sex") as the possibly compulsive liar Paula.
OK, before watching this show, it is important that you are aware that the next 30 minutes is going to be full or randomness, silliness, and general surrealism.
It has it's intense moments, so parents will want to screen it before showing it to younger children.
Olympia Dukakis, Sandra Oh, and ChloÃ« Sevigny are sent to save souls before AIDS takes them to purgatory.
The personal stories of the characters have been seen thousand times before, although the directors show them as very interesting and full of deep passion.
There is worst to come;the entirely intrusive and impossible to listen to score destroys the very things you expect from a Gary Daniels movie,namely the action.His two long and protracted fight scenes include some good techniques as you would expect from Gary but unfortunately look like they were filmed by a blind cameraman suffering from Parkinson's disease.In any case they are ruined by that God awful music which even drowns out the fight sound effects and you have to ask yourself if any of the technical team working on BLACK FRIDAY had even so much as seen a movie before let alone worked on one.I have watched many of Gary's movies several times in the past(BLOODMOON,RIOT,RECOIL)but could never envisage watching this catastrophe again.If you can imagine what the worst episode of "Miami Vice" would have been like if performed by the most inept actors and crew money could buy then that gives you some idea of how bad BLACK FRIDAY IS.I have some advice for director Darren Doane and that is..in future Darren,don't!
The villain I thought was better than before but he still said BS about six times during the beginning:) The music was very bizarre but yet it grows on you as the films goes on.
I think that the music in this Robin Hood-film is much more entertaining than most of the music from any movie before the 1960's and equal to much of what is made today.
It makes each new situation in the film seem fresh and exciting no matter how much of a dead spot came before it.
Predictably, the players hate her at first, then they start to like her and at the same time the team starts off losing before they finish up winning.
Hawn is fun and is surrounded by a good cast which includes Swoosie Kurtz as her best friend; James Keach as her ex-husband; Jan Hooks as Keach's current wife; Nipsey Russell as the principal of the rough high school Hawn's assigned to; and (before becoming famous) Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as football players (these two actors would later team up for "White Men Can't Jump" and "Money Train").
The only thing that is worth noticing is that Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes and Mykelti Williamson made one of their first appearances here, before Harrelson became famous as Woody Boyd and before he and Snipes were made a team in several films.
It seemed a cheat not to be shown or told what the daughter played by Martha Plimpton thinks of not finding Bisset's character before she died.
Did she track Bisset only to find that she had died shortly before?
Sadly, the director told the audience the cut may need to change based on getting final clearance for a lot of the clips and interviews, but if it remains intact, and can find a brave distributor who's savvy enough to market this film, "F%ck" could have a very good theatrical life before making an even bigger splash on home video.
There is very little i can say about this film that hasn't been heard before but i will anyway.Errol Flynn was and always will be the greatest swashbuckling adventurer the cinema has ever known.
The ships captain asks Dick Berry if he's sure he wants to return the criminal to Earth for trial since it will be 20 years before they return to Earth, and all the witnesses will be either old or dead.
Finally, Captain Hamilton, tells Berry to save himself and his prisoner and says that there's a planet nearby and that they should leave before Lily C.A.T.
The acting is extremely under par, the story done 100 times before with much better results, and the effects were lacking which also describes the story.
I thought the writing was good - the movie really did not remind me of anything I'd seen before, and so I had no expectations of how it would turn out.
Stacy enjoys being before a camera and at the center of attention , and she is as uninhibited talking about her private life as she is ... erm, I haven't actually seen any of her videos, but getting porked before an audience of millions, I guess.
Documentarian Fugate had an idea to delve into the inner workings of a porn star, but searched for two years before the ideal candidate emerged.
She was already a petite, gorgeous woman before she had to go and mess with her body.
Those of us who were aware of Fields' prowess as a juggler gets this only movie to show just how good he was, and a few years before his drinking would start to take its toll on him.
Legend has it that Hollywood's first movie star, Florence Lawrence, derelict & forgotten, made one of her last unbilled appearances here before her 1938 suicide.
Although this film was made before the television era, in some ways it resembles an extended episode of a TV sitcom.
She even says her friend did the same thing running away with a classmate to Goa to have fun just before her wedding.
We thought Indian girls don't cuddle up naked in bed so easily before wedding and those who do invariably end up marrying the guy.
As said before, I would recommend this movie to any American or Western traveller to forewarn them of the culture shock that he/she would face.
Being the third largest religion in this world we deserve some respect for our beliefs, we aren't as aggressive as Muslims to blow bombs on this topic, but at least one could have researched on thi topic before making a movie.
Please do some research before you make another freaked out Indian movie.
There's plenty of culture shock, due to new food, busted infrastructures, and other cultural barriers but with a pace never seen before, in my opinion.
Like I said before, go pick your nose!
Never before has a version of Luthor been so evil, so calculating so egocentric and so intelligent.
I wasn't a Superman-fan before this.
I think I started watching somewhere in the second season, but I think it's a pity I didn't see it before.
Even my gf, who normally won't watch anything made before about 1980, came in when the film was just starting and ended up watching the whole movie with me and enjoyed it!
Though I must admit the villain, Brent Sheppard as Steve Longwood, is a far more ruthless and demented rival to our hero than any antagonist has ever been before, or since.
As did the crowd in the American Airlines Arena, Miami Florida who started to filter out before the match had finished.
Just a pity he hadn't done it before Mark Henry was due to wrestle.
What you get is about two hours of a cross section of the blood horror, sexploitation, blacksploitation, mondo, roadshow, and Euro sleaze trailers that used to run before and between grindhouse double features in the 70's.
I still remember 42nd street back in the day, before former Mayor Rudi Giuliani transformed the area into a Vegas-like tourist death trap.
The series collects the trailers, usually shown before and during a double feature, into a continuous reel.
An attempt at remembering the number leads to a call to an elderly man, Simon (Fenton), who only moments before was poised, barefoot on a snowy ledge, about to leap to his death into the dark waters belowÂ Against the shadowy silhouette of the bridge, blue-tinged and feathered with falling snow, director Richard Raymond elicits a most magical and haunting sense of other-worldliness, the stylised heightened reality an escapee of a Tim Burton landscape, demonstrating all of Burton's delicious dark melancholy but devoid of his black humour.
The DVD has great deleted scenes and commentaries which helped make sense of the complicated story line unfolding before our eyes.
Duvall has shown he can run a one man show before, with The Apostle, and while this film is entirely different, it's every bit as good.
Ms. Pedraza's Manuela character is very interesting as she keeps to herself before finally opening up to reveal herself to Duvall.
It has been said before, and I'll say it again: Errol Flynn did not play Robin Hood; he is Robin Hood.
Something from the fireside chat with Matt and Trey: hilarious stuff, not much to add just that "this was the pilot episode, done before we had a series so Matt and I had to do the whole thing by ourselves.
The ultimate winners were whom I wanted to win and it's a great ending to a show that has won the Emmys before.
The premise is simple, 11 teams of 2 begin a race around the world for 1 million dollars the race is broken into legs in each episode and each team must compete various task through the leg before they can continue on to the pit stop, the team that finishes last in each leg is usually eliminated (although some legs are non-elimination.)
And the stunts, in those days before wire-fu or CGI, are all for real and still take the breath away.
That is before the denouement, however, which has all of the drama and pace of a John le Carre novel.
Girls don't like each other, girls want to go to town, girls get into trouble, girls meet cute boys, girls get out of trouble, girls start to like each other again, girls stay with cute boys - crap like that was shown dozens of times before.
The twin sister that can't get along with her sibling story has been seen before in several movies.
There are some lamb bits but its a movie for young girls so if you don't like that kind of stuff of course your not going to like it, but you must have known what it was about before you went to see it?
One can say that it was with in those movies where MÃ©liÃ¨s tested his craft before making his masterpieces like "Le Voyage Dans la lune" the following years.
The lead roles are played by Dutch stage actors (the movie is based on a successful stage play with the same name, featuring the same actors), but most of these actors were in motion pictures and TV films before, so they know very well (or even remarkably well) how not to play to the balcony.
Unfortunately beast of war takes no sides and it isn't long before the violence threatens the peaceful village.
Well, it has a most marvellous musical score...which I thought I'd heard before.
As time went by I realised it's the same music used in Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'....which I think was shot before 'Dong' but I'm, not sure...we might have a chicken and egg situation here because the films are, in my opinion of equal merit...and I loved 'Ryan' and its message with a similar evangelical zeal.
When the two groups discover each other in the antiquated village (most of whom have never seen a gun before) a tense standoff occurs, which results in misfortune for the village.
No special happy ending for the village or whatever, just a moment when all of them where together, 6 as the 6 butterflies that we saw flying away from the snow a few moments before.
However, before the heated words are able to become firing guns, the small group is attacked and only four survive.
Way before Three's Company, there was Tale Of A Dog which was one of the last of these underrated MGM Our Gang classic shorts.
While "Tale of a Dog" was the last short produced, "Dancing Romeo," the film made before this one, was the last "Our Gang" comedy to be released (apparently the MGM brass wanted everyone to believe Froggy and Marilyn lived happily ever after).
We need to see Will fooling around before he gets involved with Amira, otherwise his insistence on quick sex with an exotic woman just doesn't make sense.
The scene with the autistic daughter Bea at Will's workplace was played so heavy-handedly that we knew what was going to happen before it happened--and what was the point?
It's been 10 years since director Anthony Minghella worked with Juliette Binoche in The English Patient and 2 previous film (The Talented Mr Rpley and Cold Mountain) with Jude Law before the trio meet up again in Breaking and Entering.
In the end maybe the film should have been a little shorter, it would probably please a wider audience, but, it's like I mentioned before, Breaking and Entering is an acquired taste, it won't please the masses, that's for sure but, for those like me, who enjoy raw and realistic emotional dramas, I think it's a film worth watching.
He should meet some people in the real world fast, before he drowns in a cesspit of utterly gormless goo.
You really need to watch Jude Law in an Anthony Minghella film because the director has made him portray all sorts of things, but here you can catch him as an everyday man, and sense his reactions to the dramatic and comic situations in a way he's not shown before.
She plays the suffering mother of a troubled youth and lost her husband years before.
I had some trepidation watching HellBent, as I'd not seen a slasher film before.
There's also an unnecessary subplot that involves a budding connection between the one-eyed nice guy and a "biker with a heart of gold," and writer-director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts does all he can to mine sympathy for the shy guy and the model before he kills them off.
Haven't we seen this all before--and done far better?
- with a couple having sex in a car the night before Halloween, who then get killed by a mysterious, beefy psycho (because we all know that sex kills in slasher flicks).
Parking at the very spot where the two guys were killed the night before, they encounter the psycho on their way to the festival, and unwittingly make themselves his obsessive targets.
I had heard good reviews before finally seeing this movie and am already a fan of the horror genre.For a gay slasher film it was done tastefully.I like a movie like this that is more realistic instead of being b-rated and campy.I am glad the gay characters were more normal instead of showing all the negative stereotypes that a lot of TV shows and movies show.It's refreshing to see a regular gay movie about ordinary(but pretty)people in realistic circumstances.In some ways it's just eye candy since every character was cute and sexy,but no different then a lot of other movies.This movie has a good story,good actors,and nice effects with the right amount of suspense,gore and humor.It is very well directed,produced as well as acted.I hope a sequel is made to understand the motive to the killings and to see who is behind that demonic mask.
But after seeing the Ahmad guy tell his boss that he's finish doing deeds for him and then minutes later he tries to save his life, I just couldn't sit there anymore, I turned the damn thing off before my exhaustion drive me to aggravation and might just break the damn DVD which I didn't want to end up paying for.
There's one idiotic scene, apparently ripped off from the 3 Stooges, where a croc victim is talking while the creature behind him waits patiently for him to shut up, before devouring him.
Anyways, many things happen to them all, and some of them have secrets that nobody else ever knew before.
I only pray they will figure it all out before finding a wife and having children.
He is to appear before the authorities of the Orthodox Church to face charges that he has committed heresy/blasphemy by converting to Roman Catholicism.
She decides that she must leave her husband and take their son with her, before his father has any further influence on him.
When Vlad appears before the King to ask for further aid, he is instead imprisoned for years.
This is what leads to the trial Vlad must face before the Orthodox priests.
Then Vlad himself, very much alive, appears before him.
But then again, they gave us a Brontosaurus leaping from Tower Bridge, and a carnivorous biped that seems determined to depopulate the entire plateau by himself: this Allosaurus eats a Triceratops, a Pterodactyl, and a couple of things I couldn't identify, and even tries his luck on a Brontosaurus before it falls off a cliff.
But what blew my mind was how GOOD the effects were in this movie made 70 years before Jurassic Park.
Watch it a few times before you make your judgment and you will see how great it is.
***WARNING SOME SPOILERS*** This is the one that started it all, before King Kong, Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, Godzilla, Jurassic Park, etc.
Although there had been silent short subjects featuring prehistoric animals before, The Lost World was the first full-length feature to introduce the concept of such outsized monsters invading a major metropolis.
On the whole, The Lost World is one of the more interesting silent films-- mostly because one can see some of the seeds of King Kong being sown here, seven years before.
Also, the dialogue and action are pure Tarantino, before Tarantino was there.
The first time i saw this movie, i missed the opening scene where sean penn meets with his contact before going undercover, so i didnt know noonan was a cop until he confessed it.
This Flannery gang are white knuckeld hoodlums who would shoot before they even spare a thought, even their own flesh & blood.
For example, how did Mike know how to use the old-fashioned wheel-and-cog portal apparatus if he'd never seen it before?
This film is really unlike anything else I've ever seen before and it opens up a whole new genre of documentary/performance film.
Make sure you've seen the other 3 before this one, it should help a lot.
However, it doesn't take long before Terry's rekindled relationship with his old friends and his new loyalties to another party become at odds with one another, and our hero soon finds himself torn between the two.
There is also a neat flashback sequence, with footage shot for the first film, but not seen before.
I had never seen it before, let alone even heard of it.
But it didn't take long before I began to really like it.
I have the DVD and I have lent it out to friends dozens of times and the before and after is always the same: before "never heard of it" - after "loved it" --- and it doesn't matter the age or gender or politics of the viewer.
It was also strange to see the very young Joan Crawford before she was transformed into the sleek creature she later became, and frankly, I liked her better here.
Joan Crawford looked very pretty, before Hollywood really got hold of her and uglified her.
I knew nothing of the film before I saw it, and I really did hope for something enjoyable, enlightening, what have you... but I was disappointed.
I believe it won't be long before the rest of the world recognizes her talent!
Don't expect much of the story, it's has been told many times before.
I got the feeling they were almost in a goof-off competition to see who could memorize their lines right before the take and spit them out with the most unrehearsed verve.
All those arguments are brought out into the open - more frankly, candidly and clearly than ever before.
Not to mention the film does have some emotion and controversy between Kareena and Fardeen but we have all seen that before and it's nothing new.
Lee has shared the screen with Peter Cushing before, and does here again.
And this is ten years (1998 at the time) before another film will be seen.
The most touching scene to me was when their fourth child was born and Ben, who was the oldest of the four boys, including the newborn, got to see him before he died.
Back before 1985, the medicine was derived from pooled human blood, unscreened for diseases like HIV or HepC.
We get a sense of how close the family is by the large role the grandparents play in Ben's life (his grandfather poignantly made Ben's coffin) and the love Ben feels for his family, especially his brothers (one bittersweet moment is when his younger brother says he was visited by a ghostly Ben in the hours before Ben's death).
This landmark drama, like none before, based on a real family's experience, brings this emotionally challenging issue to the fore Â with dear compassion and remarkable wisdom that will leave you emotionally scarred.
Perhaps he hopes that a weekend in this romantic city will be good for them, but the underlying purpose is that his father has died there and he needs to sign some papers before the body can be brought back to Denmark.
Nothing is what it seems, and the situation unravels before us in a constantly unpredictable way.
No other video game before it (or after it) has compelled me to play so much.
The only scene that was an original was Apu washing his hair instead of his mouth after throwing up in front of the girl he was trying to charm and that too, right before they started having that mouth-to- mouth kiss.
Interesting ... but it would really have helped to spread the word on hygiene had Apu washed his mouth before kissing this chic.
Indian movies should be reviewed by IMDb and receive a 7.5 rating with at least 2000 votes before being released stateside.
However, from an American point of view, I thought the movie was rushed and made by an amateur director who does not do his homework before setting out to do a film.
Looking at their spontaneous acting, its hard to imagine a camera rolling before them.
Personally I have a high level of tolerance for the use of dreadful clichÃ©s, but if you're exclusively looking for horror movies with innovating and daringly creative formulas feel free to skip this one, because it features absolutely nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before.
I mean you do get Richardson removing her shirt and seducing Bill, before getting a pickax lunged into her skull sticking her to a tree.
Some sisters I couldn't care less about are told about the death of a grandpa they never knew about and are subsequently left a hotel nobody seems to stay at where they get up to shenanigans that are hard to be entertained by before being picked off and murder death killed in fairly unimaginative ways by baddies we neither know nor are too scared by.
There were some okay jokes and at points the teens reacted to minor details as being life threatening, even before they got to the lake.
I just got the DVD and hadn't seen the movie before, and I was delighted.
I had seen this story before - Jane Austen's Emma.
I had seen this story before - Jane Austen's Emma.
I'm still trying to determine the words to the song that the parishioners sing before Amos's sermon.
It's funny on so many different levels you've really got to dedicate a few viewings before passing final judgment.
This movie is the dramatization of the ten years before the creation by JoÃ£o Francisco dos Santos of the character Madame SatÃ£, inspired in the 1930 Cecil B. DeMille's Madam Satan (unfortunately, this movie has not been released in Brazil and I have never had the chance to see it).
The story, as I previously mentioned, is limited to a short period before the raise of Madame SatÃ£ to the scenario of Rio de Janeiro and is very realistic, inclusive showing the homosexual activity of JoÃ£o Francisco.
Helene finds an object that seems to be the same one she'd given Popaul days before and immediately becomes quite suspicious of him.
As I read it, Helene's game is to attract men, get them to make an emotional investment, then dump them before she can be dumped--whether out of fear of being abandoned again herself, or as twisted revenge on men in general, or for some other reason.
This film was a surprise because I came across it on the Lifetime Movie Network and watched a few minutes to kill some time before another program began and found myself entertained.
Leaden Camera: It's about ten minutes into the film before the camera moves at all, and then it's moved very slightly to maintain composition, but in an incredibly clumsy fashion, like one man trying to move a sofa.
"; the villains' henchwomen hijacking an 'atomic nucleus' by dressing up as can-can girls stranded in the desert; a 120-second countdown that is long enough for someone to run away, escape the villains' lair, fly a helicopter along the longest road in Europe, land, get out, go to a cafÃ© and phone Londonn (in the days before direct international dialling) before it gets to 35 seconds on the clock; and a climax that sees a group of Scottish championship archers riding to the rescue through the snow to the villain's underground lair, the entrance to which is cunningly disguised as a small hut opposite a castle a few miles outside Munich.
He was certainly unlike some of the classical emoting stars from the silent period, unlike anything that ever had been on screen before.
(There are Spoilers) Rarely seen and almost forgotten early gangster film that in fact was the first of the great crime motion pictures of the early 1930's, released before the big three "Little Caesar" "Public Enemy" and "Scarface", that put the "organize" into "organized crime".
Just spent the afternoon viewing a horror double bill before heading out for the night.
What can I say that hasn't been said before?
The film does not have any plot so to speak, it's simply a collection of stories from just before World War II and American entry into World War II.
Anyway, this is a nice, wacky look at the days before TV.
Do you remember the times before television when people listened to radio?
The final scene on top of the roof is almost bittersweet, altho it is nice to see a landscape filled with wide eyed people, before the world was dominated by television.
The era before and during WWII, however, was anything but wonderful.
I was anything but disappointed, but I knew what the film was all about before I saw it.
It is snuggly and cozy and it made me want to go back to the 1940s, which I never wanted to do before.
But understand before watching that the plot was ridiculously stupid at best, and despite the martial arts talent in the movie, the fights aren't anything to brag about.
Lau Kar is a real kungfu practitioner for many years with knowledge and experience in this particular style of kungfu, so you will see rare footage of fight scenes you've never seen before and more realistic than a lot of other good movies.
I hate making comparisons, but this came out before Rush Hour and is funnier, more emotionally involving, and sorry Jackie, but the kung fu is streets ahead.
I have never seen a film before that when I first watched it, it completely blew me away - something that has never happened before.
I have never seen martial arts action as good as this before - move over Jackie Chan - Dacascos is after your crown if this is anything to go by.
I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has seen Dacascos before as this is surly his finest film, and also to anyone that is intrigued by an American martial arts film that can hold its own against its Chinese counterpart.
Excellent action scenes, good comedy and I don't think I have seen Mark Dacascos ever been in so many great fight scenes before.
The plot simple: Willis's character, Jack Mosley, the tired cop even more tired after a night's work sitting in an apartment where some drug dealers have been killed and waiting with the stiffs until the medical examiner can get there, has one more chore to take care of before he can knock off and go home--most likely to drink himself to sleep.
His job: transport a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def, in an amazing performance) 16 blocks from the jail cell where he's been held to the courthouse where the witness is to testify before a grand jury probe of a crooked cop.
The simple transport job gets more complicated when it turns out that people want the witness dead before he can testify--and those people are cops, led by Mosely's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse, who--as he always does--turns in a riveting performance that's marvelously restrained).
The kind of box you've seen a hundred times before on your local video shelves.
Oh yeah and before I forget ... remember that hypothetical situation with the movie boxes?
I was like "I hope they won't let this happen" and then a few seconds later it happened, bummer... for me, cuz some people seemed to enjoy themselves, which was even more annoying  Conclusion: don't waste your money on this movie or, if your going to see it anyway, have a lot of beer before entering the cinema, it might work....
As so many times before in dutch TV and Cinema the old trick of casting some young soap actors and/ or (local music television) presenters has been used to promote this movie.
This kind of thing has been done dozens of times before, but not often this well.
It is his last wish to see him once again before dying.
The intention is to follow in the footsteps of the great political documentaries that came before them.
Sylvester Stallone plays the part of Jack Carter, performed before by Micheal Caine who stars in this movie as well.
I was with the movie but 20 minutes before the end the story could have been written better.
The minute David Morse comes on the screen, you know he is up to no good before he opens his mouth.
Yesterday I re-watched "The Wedding Night" (1935), this time with my wife who had never seen it before.
I'm a fan of "the Gary Cooper" of the late '20s and 1930s, in my opinion some his best films were made around this time, before his definitive screen persona was established, especially in the early thirties.
I had no expectations for this movie before I saw it, expect a high regard for Gary Cooper and director King Vidor, and neither disappointed me in this nice effort from them.
As mentioned before, this story concerns married writer Gary Cooper --one not unlike F. Scott Fitzgerald -- who has lost his groove, and had his latest novel rejected by his publisher.
Unfortunately this was long before the days of shooting alternate versions, so we just have to imagine how he would have done it.
Though I have not seen movies from him before this pictures.
Pink Panther plots have been mangled messes before, but never to this extent.
This movie made me laugh, and laugh, and laugh, but, as I said before, if Edwards' "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" (probably the best in the series) were released today, it wouldn't have gotten the time of day either.
The story is told in such a connect the dots TV movie sort of way that I felt like I had seen it before.
He had acted in European films and had been in several English language films like The Flight of the Pheonix, The Longest Day and Lord Jim but only directed this and another forgettable film in his brief directorial career before he returned to acting.
OK, so you probably heard a lot of bad stuff about this movie before even watching it.
But once Nessie grows up we only get a few final and very dark glimpses before it abruptly sails off into the sunset.
To put things straight, the story speaks of the legend of a water horse, a sea-creature that hatches an egg before its death, and dies at the birth of its offspring.
It hatches into a creature that he's never seen before, but as a doting father he takes in the creature as his own, calling it Crusoe after Robinson Crusoe.
Goofs, The film is kicked off by two students looking at what is a world famous fake photo widely known to come from a decade before this film was set.
As a woman whose great love ended before the relationship could fully develop, she imparts what she has learned to them about what's really important in this world, and what really stays with those we leave behind when we go into the next one.
Simple crusaders die and just before their last breath, they desire to touch the Cross.
Everything is there, and we've seen it all before.
SPOILERS: There are entertaining ideas, but they've all been done before: killer transplants, vengeful spirits, immortal succubi, killer aborted twin... the list goes on.
Okay so maybe I'm a wimp or maybe I had legitimate medical reasons for fainting, but the fact is I do watch tons of horror films, volunteer regularly for a horror magazine, and this has never happened before.
The best part of this movie was the interaction of the 'trapped' , before and in between the horror stories.
Combining animation and other horrific special effects imagery, it's highly unlike anything that director Sean S. Cunningham ("Friday the 13th") has done before.
It's quite bold and radical, entirely different from anything Cunningham has done before.
The plot starts building almost instantly, unlike many movies where you have to wait through thirty minutes of fluff before the story goes anywhere.
What always impresses me about Zhang Yimou's *Shanghai Triad* is how the two settings of the film -- the Thirties-era, glitzy nightclub milieu of the gangsters in Shanghai and the pastoral scene in the second half -- are used as a counterpoint to the drama unfolding before us.
But more importantly Zhang Yimou's depiction of the criminal decadence of China in the 30s before the rise of communism is exactly what Maoists like to see.
From a wonderful introduction to Harold (he's in frame a good 30 seconds before you see him, a truly brilliant reveal) the invention never lets up.
But before I comment on this hilarious short, I disagree with the fact that this is racist.
Perhaps these people have never witnessed a "moving picture" before and are very impressed simply by the illusion of movement across large white screens (or glowing dots of light if they're watching on a television).
I paused the movie eight times to cool down before I finally finished it.
I've said it before,Adam Sandler does not do great films.He merely wants to entertain us.Though there are times when he has failed miserably,this is not the case with The Wedding Singer.While it does showcase Sandler's usual juvenile humor,this is by far his most likable character,even to date,and the chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is undeniable.
Celebrities are satirized and pulverized, stereotypes are taken further than ever before, and TV shows/Films play the central role in creating what I think is possibly one of the best shows around (along with 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad') If anyone has any other shows that are in the same vain, please tell me.
I just saw this movie on lifetime tonight; before this week seeing all the commercial for it on lifetime I would have never of knew it was out there to be seen.
Seriously, I could see the end of this movie coming an hour before it was over.
Hotel Reserve is an interesting little thriller set before World War 2 and I taped this when BBC2 screened it one afternoon.
The story is set a few years before the start of WW II.
Still one watches it for Mason, before he has developed any overt mannerisms or been sadly type-cast as a villain.
It is up to the care bears to teach the kids how to care, and teach the whole world how to care before time runs out.
Rent, Buy, Or Steal this movie right away before you die...
This, being made a couple of years before THE EXORCIST, helped bring in numerous offerings about the Devil.
Bruce plays a character that I haven't seen him tackle before.
There are 'signs' that any person should be aware of before abandoning them self to a relationship commitment.
Two male characters, one by TV Superman George Reeves (long before his red cape days) and one by Sonny Tufts who lends a humorous, homespun aspect to the storyline, are welcome additions.
Both films are fascinating and moving because they were made during the War, before its outcome was known.
The film does feature some questionable decisions by characters who seem to leap before thinking things thru.
The story--hey, we've seen (read Every Female equals) blue collar Jersey chics slobber over (read Every Male equals) callous, insensitive, brutish, infantile, chauvinistic males before.
After all, what more is there in life than beer, pool, fellatio, and filet mignon (all of which are prepared or placed before you with very little effort).
Renting this video, I obviously didn't think it was going to be on my top-ten-list, but all the comments on the cover fooled me a little (as so many times before).
It will be too late before she realizes the mistake she has made.
First, when I saw that movie in the guide i had never heard of it before but being a fan of Lewis and Thurman I couldn't let this pass even if apriori the plot SEEMED a little less than original.
Enroute the collide with another car, whose driver dies but not before informing them about some hidden money.
And before you know it, you're on a hell of a roller-coaster fun ride.
Whoever thought this was a seller had to be drinking the night before and came to work with a hang over.
Certainly not the greatest film on the subject of coming out, but it is memorable for many reasons among them:   The LOL absurdity: We see Bobby tickling his little brother just before bedtime.
A year before the slightly more superior TV movie about homosexuality (Consenting Adult) played on ABC, so even then in the 80's being gay was becoming a topic of the day.
A guy who has been a sleeper for 20 years who was a simple murderer before comes back to life and is a skilled fighter, who proceeds to treat a seasoned female rebel like she is some sissy amateur (are you OK,get down, do as I say etc)  The resistance made up of survivors all talk in American military speak in one scene and in the next are huddled round a fire being unskilled.
I seen the pilot back in 1988 when the World Series finished before the seven games.
Marcus is like "I'm a bad-ass, murderer, a human terminator who should survive on a Terminator power cell (another dumb "plot before attention to realism" mistake), I'm your greatest asset this time around, but sure I'll die, here's my heart.
Soundtrack is naturally amazing for this 80's TV series, i heard music themes from 'Miami Vice' long before today and the first episode of it that i watched, official 'Miami Vice' theme is very good and likable as well as the music from 80's that was used for this show, for example in this episode we hear well known hits such as 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' and 'In The Air Tonight'.
And as the Macross crawls back to the Earth, the enemy fleet is not far behind...  That's the basic setup, but what makes Macross stand out from the plethora of alien invasion space operas that came before it Â most notably the classic Space Battleship Yamato (1974) Â is its focus on the human element of its story, becoming in essence a soap opera in sci-fi drag.
Now surviving students fear time is running out before they figure out the motivation and identification of the killer.
Second, practically all actors have never acted before.
In 2007, "In Drei Tagen Bist Du Tot" got amazingly the Austrian film price, the now so-called "Austrian Ticket" which was given before, in 1996, to Vilsmaier's "Schlafes Bruder".
As mentioned before this movie probably is the first one of its kind to be made in Austria by Austrians artists only.
Sometimes you know what is going to happen before but that's what we call suspense and if it was good enough for Hitchcock it's good enough for everyone.
What really makes the episode stand out, though, is its sense of fun and prescience: ordinary people's reaction to the sight of Kirk and Spock is always a joy to behold, and it's pretty funny to hear our heroes mention man's first landing on the Moon as taking place on a Wednesday at the end of the '60s: they got it right, weekday and all, a full two years before the whole thing happened.
This early D. C. Fontana episode bravely goes where TOS never went before - to the time of its own creation - the late 1960s.
After the first scene, which is set in 1944, and the story skips to the near future, where the rest of the movie takes place, the film gets pretty shaky, starting with Rogue in her room with her boyfriend, just before she discovers her powers.
its just a bit unclear, something MC G should of ironed it again at the script phase, before making bale put a performance on a half completed story, and characters.
Because of that he uses way too many explosions, and action that completely overshadows the storyline, a storyline that wasn't overall too bad if plots had been kept quiet and filmed appropriately, for example, there's a scene where Christian Bale gets emotional trying to appeal to human emotions, and the scene gets you caring,....for 3 seconds then its over, it should of been dragged out, and really got you into the film before the final battle.
This film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 Million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was Bryan Singer, who's most famous film before was the Usual Suspects, a psychology crime thriller.
The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise.
I've never heard of this comic before and I hate comics in general, but I enjoyed this movie.
But before long a mysterious and deadly disease has arrived on the scene, changing the lives of these characters - and of countless others in the world - in ways they could never possibly have imagined.
Are we to think, in witnessing in the final scene yet another peaceful picnic at the river, that everything is as it was before?
My experience of films with a male gay theme is very limited having only seen Hollywood's most recent output before Les Temoins.
Note: this was one of the many WB cartoons released before 1948 that got stripped of its opening credits in the Blue Ribbon reissue.
Whomever cast Kiron Kher in 'Rang De Basanti' must have fallen in love with her heart-wrenching performance in 'Khamosh Pani' first before doing so.
And there are sequences here that you have NOT witnessed before, speaking of that originality I mentioned earlier.
Monica Belluci, reminding me of four of the top ten wet dreams ever caused by actresses before the age of thirty (all from the severely underrated 'Flash Gordon') playing living Viagra in a role that makes the male viewer think that he and the writer/director should have a drink and talk about women.
But before long, the action kicks into overdrive when a pregnant woman walking by is being pursued by a hit-man.
Like how irked he gets when people don't indicate before changing lanes on the highway.
Bottom Line: Shut off your brain before entering this movie, and you will have one hell of a time.
immediately before letting all hell break loose.
I wasn't really sure what to make of this movie before I went to the advanced screening.
Michael Davis spoke before the preview and said he was an action movie buff since the beginning and made the movie he wanted to make.
Plots like this have been done before; and done better in some films, but that doesn't stop Burt Kennedy's little known thriller 'Wolf Lake' from being a very well done and constantly intriguing little thriller.
I read an in-depth article about this series in either "Filmfax" or "Outre" and it stuck in my mind - I had never heard of the series before.
It was past the mid-sixties, literally, before I knew there was anything else around.
As she is led away she places a curse on his family that the eldest son will alway die before the father.
I certainly hope that they show this again before next year.
Were sleeping tablets issued to the cast before filming?
This movie is far less than the sum of it's assembled parts - assembled entirely from every genre movie that came before it.
I guess he was expecting a program that was more pro-slavery with comments from former slaves who had nothing but praise for the lives they led before they were free.
I have only once before ever felt so cheated and that was watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull last year.
If the studio had enlisted any movie fan and given them a chance to read the script before this turkey was made, plot holes as large as a Mack truck could have been closed.
You believe these people exist, in reality--you _recognize_ these characters because you've seen them before.
Either Kyle Reese was laying it on real thick to get in Sarah Connor's pants, or McG et al were simply incapable of delivering the dark, post-apocalyptic future setting that they kept harping on about honoring before release.
His film is fun, rousing and a startlingly humanistic look at what might be, if we all shared a generous, more enlightened view of the generations that came before our own.
I've seen it before.
The main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and is, as one would suspect, a totally generic epic fantasy affair.
Terminator- 1984, we see a ground-breaking film with never before seen special effects and a story that was 10 years ahead of its time, Judgement Day- 1992, We see more groundbreaking film-making, a stellar cast, and one of the most iconic performances ever (GO ARNIE!!!
But as i mentioned before there were characters that made the show often times not fun and just annoying where you wanted it to end.
After the half way mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes.
Many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it.
Characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before Kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust.
i've never reviewed a movie before, but i just wanted to try and share my feelings with all of you.
As I mentioned before, Sepultura are a famous example of the music scene in Brazil, mixing elements of Napalm-Death style with Biafra-like punk.
Although the prison is tremendously overcrowded and drug use and disease run rampant through the corridors, the conditions don't appear to be quite as harsh or hellish as we might have expected them to be before seeing the movie.
I was a holding place for criminals before they even had a sentence.
Filmed in the prison itself before its demolition in 2002 and built in 1956 with its mass population of around 7000 inmates, made initially for the tinier amount of some 3000.
He received a 30 year sentence, release date May 26, 2021 unless he is granted parole before that date.
Togehter with the sister-in-law and her sick child, Noqreh and her father are looking for a place to live in the ruins, they briefly stay in a crashed airplane and the bombed parliament building, before leaving the city for a more traditional country side...
A very good, intellectually and romantically stimulating and wonderful film directed and written by Julie Delpy, who also plays the main character, Marion, to Adam Goldberg's Jack; the two are a couple who spend two days in Marion's hometown Paris, before heading to their home in New York.
After an anticlimactic romantic getaway in Venice, a frustrated Jack and Marion stop for 2 days in Paris before returning to New York.
If you think you've seen this story played out on screen countless times before, think again.
The only remaining two days of the holiday are to be in Paris, Delpy's hometown, before they go back to New York, where they live together.
We rarely stop a film before passing judgment, but we just couldn't take it.
Oh, and before you start to get excited about dramatic endings: in the end, they cry and decide to stay together despite their difficulties.
However, the makers carefully avoided even this and created such a mediocre and bland story, portraying the uninteresting lives of boring characters played by boring actors in such a mediocre fashion that one cannot but wonder whether these people really intended to make a film or were just shooting up some left-over reels because they were desperate to spend all their government subsidies before the Ministry of Culture would reclaim the money.
But before you shout "rip off" and discredit Delpy's effort as another Linklater clone, I can safely say there are distinct differences between the movies, and that while Linklater's had a kind of dreamy romanticism to his, Delphy's 2 Days in Parissomehow had a more realistic, grittier, down to earth look and feel (no offense to Linklater, whose movies I mentioned I just adore too), tackling a key issue in relationship, and that's honesty.
While enjoying a whirlwind holiday in Europe, they decided to make a pit stop in Paris to visit Mario's folks Anna and Jeannot (Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy, Julie Delpy's real life parents playing her reel ones in the movie), before flying back home to New York.
The culture-clash story might have been done before, but this is still a very refreshing and most of the time utterly hilarious movie.
Both 35 and childless, they have been traveling Europe for 2 weeks, deciding to stop in Paris for a couple days to drop in on Marion's family and friends before flying home to New York.
It is a product of its time - the early 70s - and Hammer had resorted to "tricks" if you will far more heavily then they ever had done so before.
There were so many situations in this film that I had never seen portrayed before, that this proves how much film-makers avoid so many issues.
I enjoyed all the performances and believed the characters, even though I had seen all the actors before on TV.
It's unusual enough to add to the uniqueness of this film - it really is ground-breaking - and Robin Guthrie's music/The Cocteau Twins haven't been used before in movies (though you may have recognised Liz Fraser's vocals in the last Lord of the Rings soundtrack).
Out of sheer luck, I happened to find a screening in Las Vegas, almost a year after the initial release, having finished the book only one day before.
What comes to Mircalla's walking in the sunlight - well, you poor illiterates, Dracula and Carmilla and all the vampires before the silent Nosferatu could happily do that, thank you.
As mentioned before, story revolves around a daughter who comes home to an estate on the outskirts of San Francisco.
There are no "F" words, no visual sex, & the only nudity is a brief shot of the top portion of a woman's breasts (no nipples shown) before the camera cuts away to another scene.
A Hammer vampire movie directed by Jimmy Sangster, let me get through this proper review as quickly as possible before getting to the main reason I love this movie and rate it so highly.
A woman so beautiful that I pined for her long before my young mind knew quite what I was pining for (having only seen her in pictures and never managing to have caught her on screen).
Long before he worked on "The Alan Brady Show" (as documented on "The Dick Van Dyke Show") comedy writer Morey Amsterdam aka "Buddy Sorrell" scripted a few comedy movies.
Even before getting to settle in; a coffin arrives carrying the former owner and the spooked couple call the police.
The Evil Dead's are the only other films that I have ever felt this way before.
There's also an extremely important and attractive shot that breaks the monochromaticism in the dÃ©nouement, right before the obligatory and welcomed doom-laden "tag".
Having seen multitudes of similar films in my day, I hadn't seen anything here that I hadn't before.
Originally to be directed by the ace of gothic horror, Terence Fisher, he was injured in a car accident just days before filming started.
The premise is simple: A group of young film makers (think hot, scantilly clad babes) break into a dilapidated movie studio hours from the wrecking ball (the studio was closed years before after the tragic accidental death of a teen idol)to make the last movie ever there.
The whole film-within-a-film, Blair Witch Project (1999) anyone?, has been done before but Slaughter Studios incorporates it really well & the whole self referential jokes & mickey taking is done with a certain affection for the genre.
The plot centers around a group of young filmmakers who go to the legendary but now abandoned Slaughter Studios, where years before a popular actor was killed in a freak accident (or was it?)
The beginning sequence sets the tone of the story: Young filmmaker Steve discovers that Slaughter Studios, the place where his favorite B-Movies were filmed, is going to be demolished; so he gets a crew and decides to make a cheap horror film like those he loves in the night before the demolition.
Strange things begin to happen and they wonder if the place was cursed after the event that led to it's closure 20 years before: the death of a young star while shooting a scene.
Just when the Hammer Christopher Lee Dracula franchise began to run out of steam in the late sixties, the company revved up its product by turning to Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla (written before Bram Stoker penned Dracula, by the way, and a big influence on that better known book) and filming several versions of the novel.
The other most interesting one is Vampire Lovers, which keeps far closer to the plot of the book and has a more sustained sense of mood and atmosphere, but ultimately is undone by an actress who is far too old to be believable as the Lolita with fangs that Le Fanu imagined long before anyone had ever heard of Vladimir Nabokov.
What makes this click with so many horror buffs, in particularly those who love lesbian vampire films, is the one-time star Yvette Stensgard, a gorgeous Scandanavian child-woman who looks absolutely innocent (particularly when her eyes fetchingly cross), even the moment before she rips open the neck of her next victim.
Bardoni wants to get across the border before the law catches up with him.
The editing, before the era of MTV, is a forerunner of a music video to Grieg's heady music.
This St. Peterburg we have never seen in movies before, but always new from real life.
However, it was obvious that preparing to shoot the film and practicing shooting and acting took very long time before (real) production has started.
My mother took me to see this film when I was ten, the year before she died.
Even before it was hysterical for Eddie Murphy to play his whole family, we had Mike playing his own father.
This film flows wonderfully, carrying you along before you realise it, right until the end.
I had never even heard of this film before ... now i know why.
Released in 1951, before racial tensions were to explode into American history, The Well is a brave offering from co-writer's Russell Rouse {also co-director} and Clarence Greene.
It falls to the sheriff (Richard Rober) first to locate the girl then to stem the violence before a lynch mob coalesces.
Finally, the day before departure.
Not only was the Bava film made before Wes Craven's 1972 shocker LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but such retitlings imply that this film is yet another Italian rip-off of an American hit.
Bava was laying the groundwork for the slasher film, a full nine years before the release of "Friday the 13th", which is often acknowledged as the movie that spearheaded the trend of slash-and-dice flicks all over the world and pretty much changed horror cinema for better or worse.
Although he'd made similar films before (such as "Blood and Black Lace" and even "Kill, Baby, Kill"), never before had he been this explicit in his violence.
Remember, this was made several years before Dario Argento's Gialli became really gory starting with his masterpiece "Profondo Rosso", and "A Bay Of Blood" even puts a stronger focus on violence in explicit detail.
He has a solid cast, especially Nikki Stanzione, who I'm shocked not to have seen before this film.
"Sex and the City" star Kristin Davis stars as a waitress who has psychic visions of murders before they happen and as serial killings are developing she is asked by the police to help assist in the investigation.
Some of the people were really good and I'm surprised I haven't seen them before.
That guy has a familiarity that I could swear I seen him before, but when I looked him up, he wasn't listed in anything.
Overall, knowing this is a first movie, and was made by a guy who never made a movie before, it was great.
Debbie teases Kevin before sex.
He gets too excited and finishes before starting.
Actually she was 15yrs old , She only made 1 porn movie at age 18 before FBI arrested her , so all her movies were made when she was underage , Some other pornstars investigated during the early 80's and possibly appeared in porn movies underage include Alexandria Quinn , Kristara Barrington and Ali Moore , These other girls didn't draw as much attention possibly due to the fact they weren't very popular or overly attractive , at least one of the pornstars appears alongside Traci Lords in more than one movie , There is one movie were possibly all of the actors appear making nearly the entire female cast underage at the time the movie was filmed.
and you say she coulndt have possibly made any movies before she turned 16 , yet she was penthouse pet in September 84 and the story read she had starred in dozens of porn movies , so she starred in dozens of porn movies prior to September yet her first movie according to you wasn't produced and released until late 84 ?
This sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace; there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening: one shot of an arriving airplane, for example, stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop, as if this had never been captured on film before.
Bill Gates and Micro$oft may claim it now, but not before I became a WSU graduate, a Washington Apple, a "User Friendly" Macintosh.
The Indians superficially look authentic and believable as does their history which is so grounded and set up before hand that they could almost be real.
The scene immediately before he dances with Crawford made me cry.
This is done by Baron Felix in order to get back the money he owes the "Boys" before the "Boys" who've just about had it with him, in his stalling to pay them back their money, end up making him a cripple.
With time running out on him in paying the "Boys" back their money a desperate Baron Felix grabs Otto's, who's dead drunk for drinking champaign, wallet with some 15,000 Marks for him to finally pay back the "Boys" before they pay him, in working the Baron over, back with compounded interest and fractures.
The physiognomy and chemistry of icons Garbo and Barrymore, Crawford before she hardened, as the working class hero, Beery at his surly best and Lionel Barrymore as the pathetic retiree stealing every scene he is in.
I think this may be one of her greatest roles before she went on the likes of "Mildred Pierce" and her other roles of suffering women.
Other characters are abandoned before their stories have reached a satisfactory conclusion, mimicking the continuous nature of life itself.
No detail was overlooked, and in terms of production values alone few films before or after have bested GRAND HOTEL.
At the same time, industrialist Preysing (Wallace Beery) has arrived at the hotel in an effort to conclude a important business deal and has hired a stenographer named Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) to assist him--but Preysing is unaware that company accountant Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has taken rooms at the hotel, determined to enjoy himself before he dies.
The producer of the film was Paul Bern, who would be found dead in his home in 1932 just before the final cut was made on the movie.
The two fall in love, of course, much to the disappointment of Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford), a woman that von Geigern was romancing the day before.
The movies have begun "talking" not long before this film was made and the stars of those silents were still doing their acting in front of the camera as though no one was going to hear them talk.
It's interesting that the Best Picture of the year before Hitler came to power in Germany, set in Germany, made no mention of the political situation in the country at the time.
In the meantime, Armenians steer clear of the Armenian Revolt; many of them are ignorant on the subject and do not realize that the revolutionary Dashnak and Hinchak parties began to attack and kill innocent Muslims many years before Armenians were deported in 1915.
Plus, the title characters, the seven mummies didn't make an appearance to like ten minutes before the end of the film.
I had always wondered why nobody ever tried that before.
Though Jason himself only appears throughout a very small portion of the movie, this is a very decent sequel and a nice change of pace for the franchise, giving it a good ending (before "Jason X" came along, that is).
En-route they find a gold medallion buried in the ground & an old Indian guy (Danny Trejo) claims that there is a town nearby which is stuffed with gold & they can use the medallion to find it, the escaped convicts need no invitation & before long their at the town which looks like something out of a John Wayne western.
Except the rebirth is anti-climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie.
Yet other than the original several years ago I've never before seen a Jason movie.
When a shot Jason (in the form of a police officer) "unexpectedly" comes to life and grabs a woman's leg, we see his eyes open several moments before the "shock" grab, thus negating any suspense.
I was so excited when the beginning of this film was before my eyes.
By having his spirit enter into the body of some other people, it is a theme that has been done before.
In a touching tribute to the good ol' days of simplicity, overage-looking "teens" make time for skinny-dipping and tent sex before Jason splits the girl in half with a tent stake.
It was beautiful to look at, the color looked great, and this version was longer than the one I had seen before.
of Silents Please, before the Ernie Kovacs hosted episodes.
Although there were a handful of Technicolor films before this one (as early as 1922), this is the one that EVERYONE saw and so truly introduced the process to the nation.
I knew little of this film before watching it, but am glad I found it.
Aside from the bleached skulls, everything else is there as promised  Fairbanks is a joy to behold, exulting in his physical prowess, becoming a legend of the screen before the delighted eyes of the viewer.
The only hint we get of his life before this is a couple of mentions that he fought in the US Civil War, and that he went to Harvard.
I had never seen this film before until I saw it on TCM TV the other day.
This was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes, but alas, it was the only element of this film worth viewing.
This pre-code film has her kicking her legs up to throw up her skirt, sleeping in a man's room, seeing him before he is dressed, drinking large quantities of alcohol during Prohibition, and condoning violence, an unladylike characteristic.
!I mean obvious...this movie was apparently done before Joan's unpublicized sweat gland operations(just kidding)...... 2)The scene where Robert Montgomery has a boxing match in the living room during a party.
''Untamed'' surprised & delighted me, in the way, that I've never seen Joan play such a sassy, upbeat role before......
But, as was said before by others, you can tell they tried.
This is a great tribute to the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin) and Robbie shows us is amazing voice along with a style of music which hasn't been seen from him before.
This was certainly an outstanding follow-up after the wonderful "Love Me or Leave Me" two years before.
I hope Mr.Reno, Mrs. Binoche, Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Serra are going to continue like before and forget this movie (if you can call it a movie...).
With apparently no acting experience whatsoever, our heroine struggles valiantly for at least a few months (with granny's help -- the family's sole supporter) before happening upon Frederic March's Norman Maine, a former matinee film idol on the decline.
Val comes home, as he's about to marry his girlfriend of I guess 45 minutes, both are extremely young, played by Calista Flockhart, before her Ally McBeal days.
I like a film that adds a little magic and leaves the spirit happier than before.
The great actresses and films of the 30s may have long since disappeared, but surely someone can provide fine romantic/comedy scriptwriting...at least before we get to Bridget Jones 12...
Juliette Binoche shows her talent in a totally different role to most of the ones she has played before, she is a common girl with many problems and yet her nobility and class shine through.
- A non-Swede would probably not notice, but the use of Scanian accent in this project is unfortunately, and as many times before, a total disgrace to its audiences.
****SPOILER****  In this ghostly action thriller, Jack (Phillips) is a--get this--Federal Marshall, who used to do under-cover work for the CIA, and before that was a Navy SEAL.
Well I haven't really come across something like this before.
A small chain-gang that had, several years before, been in an "accident" lie dead in a small graveyard just along-side this road.
Yes, looking @ release date and others' comments, you'd pass this one by...But take another look :  It's a road movie, which is a great and under-utilised genre; It's got grim humour coupled with a ghost-line (not bad); It's got good character actors; Its script is tight; And I come from the place where they filmed Mad Max (before the US dubbed it : cringe), so give me some credit for knowing films that use deserted environments !
An horror road movie with an interesting twist, this flick about a part of Route 666 infested by ghosts is better than one may think before of seeing it.
Adel, a blonde girl of fair skin is given to the doctors as a gift to the Gods, but Elinu believes them to be mortals and wants to have the doctors sacrificed before their influence reaches the albino people and the Mole People revolt.
The Mole People rebel against their taskmasters; Cynthia Patrick is killed before she can rebel against the will of John Agar.
At long last, I managed to get my hands on Universal's coveted "The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection" 3-Disc Set Â and I started off with this film, one of three I hadn't watched before.
They don't have much time anyway because, before you know it, they discover a lost civilization of pale Sumerians who live on mushrooms, except for one beautiful babe (Cynthia Patrick, the best actor in the bunch) who looks reasonably human and has something resembling a tan.
He was enjoying the best success of his career; she would only make a few more motion pictures before retirement from the screen.
Maybe seeing it projected on a big screen in a darkened room made a difference, I don't know, but if you have never seen the film before try it with an open mind you may well enjoy it as much as we did.
so disregarding his own life and safety, he rather capture them and risk his life, then to let them go and wait countless years before another opportunity.
For March however, he has to play a weak character, something he had not really tackled before.
Sir Alan has been blackmailed by Lewis, a scoundrel who possesses letters written to the oddly named Diana Roggers ten years before he married Lady Helen.
"The Unguarded Hour" is from her early talky days in Hollywood before going on to win an Oscar for her fantastic performance in "The Farmer's Daughter."
Lady Dearden must pay for some indiscreet old love letters written by Sir Alan to a lover before he met m'lady or the letters will be made public possibly destroying him professionally.
All must be unraveled with a few surprises along the way before the somewhat hasty ending to a well made film.
Sure, we have seen this story before, but this was the first incarnation.
The Beasties themselves, who before becoming involved with Def Jam, were three untalented punkers, who knew little if anything about hip-hop and eventually moved into rap and became the three great emcees they are today.
Flip was the same way before, a slob I don't know, but he certainly acted differently from the way he acts in the beginning of the film.
I looked at this movie on the shelf for months before I took a chance and rented it....I figured that it would either be hilarious or suck fiercely.
Flip dog is just so incredibly lost in his gangster world, working out scenarios with Khalid before his talks to him, rapping in front of the mirror, etc.
Definitly you need to see both (the video game and the movie) before you can tell anything about the movie.
starts in a promising manner but somewhere from the middle or a little before that, it degenerates and fizzes off and finally ends up in a typical bollywood crass.
I haven't seen a movie about giant ants before so i have to give it extra points for being original.
There's nothing special or significant about Glass Trap that hasn't been done about a thousand times before in these types of B-grade Sci-Fi movies.
I came across this version on DVD not having been previously aware of its existence; before this I favoured the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version made ten years later as definitive.
In this version Jane guesses who the gypsy woman really is even before she sees her.
Rochester can only say a few sentences before Jane makes him stop the masquerade.
Jayston managed to bring the character to life as none before of after him has managed; the viewer never has the feeling that he "plays", that he is artificial; he really becomes Rochester while on screen and looks like he feels any line and any movement he is acting.
I haven't seen a film like this before.
Geoffrey hands Sally a drink of milk before going to bed and she gets all upset and throws the milk out a stain glassed window.
By the way either before or after Stanwyck did a film at Warners, Christmas in Connecticut an infinitely better film.
Taking a chapter from "Bluebeard", Bogey's character is an artist who paints his victims before they succumb to a spiked milk cocktail.
Then punching him before saying a witty line).
Originally storyboarded by Chuck Jones and turned into a book before his untimely death, this latter-day Warner Bros. cartoon was another entertaining lesson on American customs which Jones had previously done with Porky Pig on Old Glory back in 1939.
It's not that funny and most of scenes I've seen before in other movies.
Screwed's pace is just perfect; the laughs are fast and frequent, although you are given a slight breather just before the next joke hits.
Being a music video director before, Arau can't help but to display the influences of his previous work, giving the movie a modern albeit a bit MTV-like look.
I also think that one needs to be accepting of the movie, and wanting to give it a chance before they will like it.
Having not seen any of Shane Meadows' earlier efforts before seeing this, I cannot compare it to them, but I certainly understand all the hype about this young filmmaker from this film alone.
Rather it is the culmination of a sub-plot running through the film, as the pieces of the flashbacks from years before come together.
It stirs history of who occupied those lands before the United States (Mexico), although there is no mention the same land was in turn, taken away from the native American Indians.
I had heard so much about A Day Without A Mexican before its release, but I never got a chance to watch it in the theaters.
Mario Landi's "Patrick Still Lives" has to be one of the sleaziest exploitation sickies ever made in Italy.It's filled with incredible amount of nudity and masturbation.Gianni Dei plays Patrick,a young man who is sent into coma as the result of the random act of violence.He lies in his bed looking into space for the most part and killing people with his telekinetic powers.The script is pretty bad,but the gore is mildly shocking.Still the scene where Maria Angela Giordano has a long metal pole pushed into her vagina is a real jaw dropper...Another offensive murder scene involves a lovely black-haired woman killed by her own dogs:they chase her all over the grounds before biting,licking and chewing her around the genitals,eventually killing her.The masturbation scene of stunningly beautiful Anna Venziano is also worth mentioning.Like earlier Mario Landi's sleazefest "Giallo a Venezia"(1979),"Patrick Still Lives" is cheap,shoddy,misogynistic and gleefully disgusting.It's just a pure exploitation film,so you should enjoy it as such.Highly recommended,if you like sleaze and extreme gore.
18 years later Connie (Burke) is pretty young woman who is always at ends with her parental units she falls head over heels in love with Ronnie (Farley) a local mechanic and neighborhood boy who admits to never have dated a girl taller than him before.
The movie starts before Connie is even born, showing why Beldar and Prymatt were sent to earth and how they ended up smack in the middle of suburbia.
The killings have absolutely no element of surprise to them; you're given at least 30 seconds of warning before the soon-to-be victims see the nail gun killer, and once they've seen him, he usually interacts with them in a poor, poor manner that would not be intimidating.
(However since it is next to Critters 3, I bet you'll pick up both covers and compare the pictures on the boxes for awhile before you skip over both and rent "The Truth about Cats and Dogs," which is much cuter I think.)
Too bad his victims die so painfully before they get to hear his witty remarks.
Looking laughable, rather than menacing, in a fetching camouflage jumpsuit and black motor-cycle helmet, our maniac somehow manages to stalk their prey unseen, before blasting them with a volley of nails.
Shortly before Brecht leaves his summer residence in Buckow, young GDR-pioneers are reciting for him one of his famous love-poems from "Baal" - at that time, Brecht may have known that with the summer also his lifetime has gone.
The writer and director cleverly toyed with the relationship between the ageing Brecht, a man who fled the US before he could be indicted by MacCarthy , and Wolfgang Harich, the young dissident for whom the Stasi lie in wait in the woods.
I agree that certain elements of its narrative (particularly the pacing, as well as a few contrived interpersonal moments) felt tacked-on or inauthentic, and were perhaps invented to couch the story in a modern-day milieu that could appeal to audiences before "surprising" them with the political content of the film in its second half, as the mystery of the main character's history is unraveled.
There is Warburton's impressive full frontal nudity that arrives on the scene even before the opening credits roll, but even this robust titillation quickly fades once the story is under-weigh.
Seeing this never before released footage reminded me why I became a fan.
Therefore I have even more regrets that he only got to making one English movie before the tragedy.
And they are never been showed before.
Out West marks a distinct departure for Arbuckle as a director in that compared to what had come before it had a much stronger, more thought out and developed style and story.
Keaton and St John also have stronger parts than their usual nameless knockabout side characters that had come before.
She married the greatest film producer that Hollywood will ever know (Irving Thalberg), but even without having married 'The Boy Genius'(as Thalberg was then called), Norma Shearer would have have shined on her own - which she proved with this film before she married Thalberg.
I KNEW I had seen the film before and even reviewed it on IMDb but I didn't remember it as being called 'THE LONEDALE OPERATOR'.
The only customer is his father, a musician with a single hit record twenty years before that won a "Silver Cassette" for selling 2,500 copies.
For a peak at what a great man like Griffith was doing before he made The Birth of a Nation (1915), Intolerance (1916) and Way Down East (1920), this is certainly one to take a good look or two at, just to get a peak at what the future had in store for cinema history.
Since I haven't seen the classic that came before this, I'm unable to compare it, or be biased by it.
I first seen it on our national TV before more that 10 years and I was stunned !
It took a good 30 minutes before I realized that I wasn't watching a pathetic apocalyptical made for TV love story and suddenly grasped the neatly crafted humor cleverly stitched just beneath the scenes of growing panic and mushrooming affection.
Whatever happened before that may have been the most terrific piece of filmmaking ever, and maybe by missing that I missed the true "greatness" of the movie.
I first saw this movie 15 years ago; then the night before last I stumbled onto it again.
At the end, I looked at my partner and all I could say was "At least the old folks got to have their sandwich before it all hit", and then I busted out crying.
Released shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the U.S.S.R., it's Armageddon time shortly after Harry meets Julie, and what fun it is to watch Romeo battle his way to the side of his Juliet.
The 1st escape takes place before Papi reaches the detention island , he escapes from the prison with Maturette and CLOUSIOT not with Dega which is to scared to escape and does not help them in any manner, the escape scene is partial true , there was no party and no guard was so close to raise the alarm like in the movie.
BUT in the movie before the escape him and Dega go in woodcutting camp that's not true , Papillon went in the woodcutting camp with Clousiot AFTER THEY GOT CAUGHT, after Papillon escapes with ANtonio ,the guy who speaks Spanish, from a Colombian prison.
And I think whoever watches this movie is gonna be blown away as I've been before.
When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.
Brutal treatment in a penal colony has been explored on the screen before in such earlier films as I WAS A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, but never has there been a more graphic expose of the sort of conditions prisoners faced under the worst sort of environment.
This is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again and continue to see things you've never noticed before.
The stories have a similar setup, Bing and Bong (the hero's) sit on their sofa and a giant catapult throws them to a different tiny planet where they have an adventure before returning back home and going to bed.
but besides that the movie can be described as a ghost of the muppets before the whole Gonzo incident with the T.V.
Dudley Moore and Lily Tomlin are the guest stars, and some of the segments include a medley of Wizard of Oz songs (Long before The Muppets Wizard of Oz) with Miss Piggy as Dorthy, Scooter as the Scarecrow, Gonzo as The Tin Man, Fozzie as The Cowardly Lion, and Foo Foo as Toto.
Like I said before, if you can see it, do so.
I have never seen such a joke of a film before in my life.
That is if the sting of "Daisy Does America" hasn't worn off....  "10 Items or Less" establishes all the same clichÃ©s of being a grocery clerk that any common customer could see while wrangling this menagerie of failed auditions for Mad TV under the frayed control of manager Leslie, who assumes ownership of the family store after his father dies in a supposedly comedic fashion (a heart attack that knocks over a display stand, with the nearby employee fixing the stand first before helping the fallen owner).
Rather than waste your time and mine pointing out which similarities this show has with everything else that came before it, I'm going to tell you to watch it.
This wasn't a movie for fat women at all, contrary to the commercials that were run for weeks before the premiere of this pathetic lesson in moral fiber for skinny women the world over.
Never before in this world has there been such an obsession with fat.
But still, this movie has been done before.
A father who was passive and it seemed like he wanted to say something important but never does, her not being smart, but being in the fat suit she starts to study and does better in summer school than ever before, the emphasis jocks place on looks and being in good physical condition, but the poor guy gets a headache when she tries to explain what she's going through, that it's better to exist on chemical shakes and veggies, than a balanced diet, etc, etc.
It seems as though pride and responsibility have left director Ross McElwee long before his journey to find Sherman.
Believe it or not, we've seen films like this one before.
He liked her before his brother Frank was born.
But still, it was far harsher then anything he uttered before or after.
If it had been better shot it may have work, however I didn't even have the time to let the emotions of the scene sink in before I was slammed with a big Title Card!!!
There is certainly nothing original or creative about this film....more than an hour passes before you even get to see a werewolf...the movie seems to consider the "existence" of werewolves a very shocking revelation but you're not likely to agree.
I recommend you not watch this... but if you want to, try and see how far you can get before you throw the remote at the TV.
No doubt if they had visited the town before buying the house, this dumb movie would not have been necessary.
The acting is worse than i've ever seen before.
It's not long before Marie and the ex-nun hide in the bell tower where Marie must wait outside while she summons the Werewolves with the bell.
and people have been dogging me for even bothering to rent and watching this one before doing so.
Michael Griffin (Slater) crashes a private party and before he's done rummaging through, he murders one of the distinguished guests who turns out to be a military doctor.
So, before I begin, I think the story itself is fascinating and inspiring, but it came across weak in this movie.
Chris Farley had died five months before its release, there were bad screenings, negative sneak preview reviews, etc... and when they finally put it out, the film tanked.
The two lovable losers banter back and forth before falling into uncertain love, and you could say the film is either nicely devoid of major plot devices or is an exceptionally thin romantic comedy.
George Segal was primarily known as a dramatic actor before he was cast as Felix, the snotty book clerk/writer-wannabe.
Her role here as Anna, an innocent coffee shop cashier who falls for the brutish charms of a Mafia thug, really gives her a chance to show the world what all the giallo fans knew before: that she is also an intelligent, subtle and highly skilled actress, as well.
And before she knows what's happening, she does what Guido demands and joins his criminal organization as a call girl.
One of the highlights for me and among my favorite parts is when Bart gets carried away by the eagle before falling into the ocean (or was it the sand dune/beach?
The ending veers sharply away from comedy into deep melodramatic territory, and even though it is diffused quite handily, the film almost drowns in TV-movie-of-the-week sap before the mood lightens again.
Together, Steven and Miguel seduce a handful of other girls before the both fall for English beauty Gabriella.
The movie is about a bunch of people who will try to reach the coast of the pacific ocean before Lewis and Clark.
This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in raw sewage like Speed 2, Boondock Saints, Body Of Evidence and XXX: State Of The Union.
When Dourif beats hell out of McDormand, we only get a few introductory blows before the cut, just so we know what's going to happen next.
I have been edgy before.
I've never seen a horror movie quite like this before.
In the moment Kelly died before being revived, her spirit became lost and mixed up with Renee's (Linda Park's character) and Kelly takes on some of Renee's traits and attracts further spiritual attention (in other words ghosts).
Kelly and her mom end up finally being together and spending more time with each other like they should have before the loneliness and void of being alone and unloved drove Kelly to kill herself at the beginning of the movie.
In fact, if you have the hots for Perry, you should definitely see it because he was looking pretty good to me by the end of the movie, and I never thought he was all that hot before.
Gordon had won her Oscar for "Rosemary's Baby" the year before, and Page would ultimately win one for "The Trip to Bountiful."
So, Claire begins to hire housekeepers with no known or remaining family, and kills them to appropriate all of their savings for herself - but not before burying them in her beloved garden and promptly planting pine trees over the graves.
Can Alice discover Claire's secret before another pine tree is planted?
As we see in the first part of the film, there are at least three pine trees before we see the first woman bashed in the head with a rock and then planted.
The first time I saw the movie was in the theater at which time I laughed at the "obvious" laugh-parts, but it was not until I had seen it another two or three times before I picked up on the absolutely hysterical dialogue, terriffic comedy styles of the various supporting characters, and the sheer brilliance and irony the script presents.
I select films that I do not think I have seen before.
I suppose this inserts an opinion into the audience of a certain aura of loneliness or a 'want' to be cut off from most people in Rampling's character, and, given the film is about the want to be on one's own as they collect their thoughts; enables us to identify with Sarah before her trip to France.
Later on, when she makes love to one of a few random men she finds during her nights out, Sarah cannot hep but become interested and observes in the same composition before later still, there actually is a reaction shot from Sarah, during another sex act in the house's swimming pool from which the title derives.
Swimming Pool (2003)  Alluring and Deceptive, Beautifully Compact  All I had repeatedly heard before recently viewing Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool is that the lead actress, Ludivine Sagnier, was searingly sexy.
One scene that is quite telling of where reality stops and her inspiration starts is that of Franck-the local waiter, cleaning leaves from the pool with the net, wearing a tiny bathing suit, before he stands over the sunbathing, sleeping "Julie".
It is sometimes used in period movies whose action takes place before the piece was actually written & first performed.
But before I could roll my eyes, she swung the door knocking the vampire over and took the keys from him.
I've complained about his work before with "Rush of Fear" (there's that word again), and while this isn't quite as awful, it does rank just as high on the idiocy scale.
I never tuned into Meerkat Manor until a few episodes before the Season 1 finale.
Director Casper Andreas, who also had a hand in the script, hopes to titillate and shock his target audience with bitchy, outrÃ© dialogue and flashes of naked behinds; unfortunately, this isn't anything any filmmaker treading in queer-cinema waters hasn't tried before.
Jan-Michael Vincent, the world at his knees shows his considerable acting abilities here before crumbling into himself in later days.
Meanwhile, Roscoe returns, frustrated as never before.
Directed by the super prolific Edward Cahn, none of whose movies I've ever seen before, but the titles sound pretty good.
If you come to this film with enough willing suspension of disbelief, it won't matter that the punches thrown in the fight scenes miss by at least eight inches--the sound effects are synched accurately so you THINK the punch must have landed, and the scene has moved on before you have time to analyze it.
These are often done in a single take - one scene in particular, early in the film as she is leaving the house before Olivier arrives home, talking rapidly to Richard Wattis as they walk down the long staircase, is outstanding.
In fact her whole performance is so unexpectedly cogent to the plot and so subtle that every time I see it I have to listen carefully for something I didn't pick up before.
It's almost uncanny that Arthur Miller, whom Marilyn had wed just a few months before, was present when the movie was shot AND had to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee immediately when he returned from England.
Monroe was already in her thirties when the film was made, but the naÃ¯ve and innocent Elsie seems much younger, whereas the middle-aged Charles seems a man old before his time, an impression created as much by his stiffness of manner and bearing as by his grey hair.
But he is leaving at the start of the third day for Carpathia with his mother and son, and has another 18 months of duty before he is free.
They said, "THIS MOVIE SUCKS" and then turned it off long before it was over, and started to make any sense.
He awakens to find himself in an older mansion, where a woman, Stephanie (Catherine Dee), seems to know him despite the fact that he's never seen her before, and an older transvestite, "Roberta" (M.R.
At least the film was shot in the days before boob jobs were so ubiquitous.
I liked the movie and before writing a review I read only negative comments on IMDb to see why people hated the film.Most of them claim that the movie is historically incorrect,based on false facts.Here are two arguments of the haters of the movie:  1.The Mayans didn't make human sacrifices and didn't rip off the hearts of the victims.That is something the Aztecs did.
My recommendation to all who want to write a negative review: make some research before doing so!That is the only way to find out how much truth there is in this film!I, for example found also out that they were using exact the same type of weapons at that time, like knifes made of obsidian.
He lowers them into a hidden pit in nearby rocky terrain, but the villains capture him before he could get them out of it.
In short, Apocalypto is a beautiful, deeply moving presentation of a world that existed before Western contact, and was destroyed by it.
(The Mayans were gone long before Cortes' arrival -- it was the Aztecs that he managed to destroy.)
But if it is, as I interpret it to be, about the many peoples, societies, and civilizations that were destroyed, that suffered an apocalyptic end on Western contact, then it puts faces in our historical picture where there have been only caricatures before.
Not that "first nation" communities in America all made nice with each other before the Europeans arrived.
You know whats going to happen long before it does, and when it does, it looks good, but it's still not very fulfilling.
This is an adventure flick that takes us to places we've never been before.
And Gibson's recent PR problems only highlighted, for me, how it took an Australian-reared actor to make an exciting film about natives before Columbus.
It isn't long before she is talking to him and suggesting he do .
It takes over an HOUR of screen time before he gets revenge for Christine's death.
His victims include a go-go dancer, a prostitute and a nude model before going after his own unfaithful wife again.
It didn't seem clear how much time was passing from scene to scene and, before I knew it, it was 1987.
I'll start by saying that it's been a few years since I read the book but a review of the film I skimmed before watching it and my own surprisingly thorough recollection indicates that Visconti's film is a rather close adaptation.
Peter Sarsgaard was presented a special acting award by the SIFF organization before this screening and looking back at some of his previous works, I think this was well-deserved.
We rented the DVD and I left the room to do other things about half an hour before the end because I simply could not waste my time any longer.
(Lucas has directed stage productions before -- and done an artful, deeply moving job -- so he's not a totally-brand-new director.)
First off, the less you know about this movie before seeing it, the better.
I have never read the books before so I will go by the story of what I see in the movie.
As I said before this movie seem to only concentrated a lot on making it a lifelike as possible so tried to watch it in a highly enhance Digital Cinema like I did and you will felt quite impressive at the new technology that everything look so clear and real.
Suddenly, his old girlfriend is seen driving up to a house in the country and it's "pre-crime"--and long before he goes to prison.
This film has such a delightful casualness and yet is strongly plotted and has superb performances and full of ideas and technique that is decades before Quentin T and co.  And anyone who can get me Claude Lelouch's email id or contact address....i'd be very grateful.
You've kind of seen all this before in some form or another and the biggest disappointment is the abrupt and sappy ending.
The close ups of objects are great too, such as a shot of pebbles on the beach just before a horse comes crashing over the camera and scatters them.
Anna May Wong plays an evil traitor but confidante to the Princess, a role she reprised 10 years later in Chu-Chin-Chow the first film version of which appeared the year before this, and which provided some of the story here too.
His previous two efforts, The Three Musketeers and Robin Hood, spend a lot of time laying down back-story before allowing the hero to emerge, and this made them very profound but a little slow at times.
But since this is a section that I have never seen before, to see it at all is wonderful.
It was a lot of fun to see how filmmakers pulled off things like flying carpets and giant monsters back in the day, long before the days of Ray Harryhausen.
But since this is a section that I have never seen before, to see it at all is wonderful.
The world of the Arabian Nights springs alive before our lives, with Fairbanks as all its fantastic heroes rolled into one.
My partner got this on DVD before we moved in together.
As mentioned before, there's plenty of bare-flesh and red-stuff to go around, and if that sort of thing is your bag, you'll have a blast with "Bordello of Blood."
Now Rafe has to destroy Lillith before it's too late.
For example, when the school principal who recommended that her deformed son be placed in a "special" school and how she told him off to his face that he will thrive with the normal students and threatened to sue him, shows that her love for her son will always be first before her.
If you haven't seen it before, settle down with the boy/girlfriend on the sofa with a box of tissues and enjoy.
Leaving behind the fact that Wealtheow probably was not as nubile in the poem as in the movie and showed no romantic interest in Beowulf whatsoever, she and Hrothgar had two sons, and as mentioned before Hrothgar had not slept with Grendel's Mother.
My only taste of him before seeing this film was the slightly later 'Dead Man', and I found that to be a very worthwhile experience and one that set me up nicely for Night on Earth.
I have never had the experience of seeing a 3-D movie before on the cinema, the only experience I have had with a 3-d film, only courtesy of some 3-d glasses coming free with a DVD, was Spy Kids 3-D, a movie while mildly entertaining isn't exactly the best film every to display the greatness of 3-d.
I found the story of the Roberto Benigni episode rather stupid, but his talent in exaggerating (so he did this even seven years before 1999's Oscar ceremony!)
What Jarmusch is going for is to contrast the social classes -- he has an obvious, unfunny line where Ryder's character says she's never been to the executive terminal at the airport before -- but what's really interesting is seeing, since Jarmusch is usually a male-oriented director, how he handles women (one a tomboy, one in a position of power).
Is this cartoon mostly stuff that we've seen before?
The first, is so quick and built up that its done before it even begins.
Refusing to die with an empty stomach, the Beast decides to munch upon his spilt intestines before he falls to the ground, dead.
as said before, only the beginning on the beach is worth watching and of course the two scene's that have been removed from most versions who are in tact on the double disc, it's the removal of the fetus and the eating of his own intestines.
D'Amato emphasises this sense of characters encountering the truth about themselves through their encounter with the cannibal by a series of shots in which they see themselves reflected shortly before seeing him.
The German tourist sees himself reflected in the cannibals knife, the first dead Italian confronts a mirror shortly before death and later the boat-hiker has to smash a huge mirror in which she is reflected in order to find her way into his lair and discover his secrets.
She is claimed just before being put to sleep by Cherry Cherry after her twin B. Ho is gunned down in her "hood".
My favorite Season Two moments -   1) Mary Cherry's (Leslie Grossman) audition for judges, including Jim J. Bullock (way before "American Idol" became a household name).
This movie would get a higher rating had it been shot in real-life and it's worth considering this before packing the kids into the car.
You find that out before Jonathan kills Vladimir.
Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one.
It's my favorite performance of his because I had never before imagined that he would play a role like this.
The movie brings us the feeling of wrong idea of this exam,and it also adds everyone has thought to make difference,but in the end you wont,only hard-workers will win in the end,so criticism of exam and showing the results of working is too balanced so,we can agree it both ways..  Acting:Not the greatest there are some typecasting characters such as Big-Bad-Headmaster,Slutty music teacher,horny tea seller,punk-girl who was before a actual girl etc..But we can feel what students fell really,because of i was in that exam last year,i know that pressure and you feel it too..
But then Conchita has her point of view, which everyone *should* accept, but then the tables are turned, more than once, leading to why that bucket of water was poured on her at the train station before it took off.
As a side note, it was interesting seeing Elizabeth Montgomery (as the widow of Mitchell's friend who gets killed in one of the crashes) before she starred on "Bewitched".
If it were not for the fact that private companies like Boeing were developing planes before the military were asking for them would could have been fighting the first year of WWII in biplanes.
What to do and who would control the airplane as a strategic weapon was a running debate even before World War I.
If it could Great Britain would have surrendered after the blitz or Germany would have been pounded into submission by Army Air Force and RAF bombing of the place for three years, starting even before one American soldier was in ground combat.
A year before at Salerno, the battle took three weeks with planes from the Allies and the Axis engaged before Allies were established.
For the remainder of his life, which ended before the war he predicted, he was essentially marginalized as aviation expanded and America slowly recognized the need to build a world class air force.
I had never heard about this "documentary" before, so I saw it with an open mind..
I could not believe why I had never heard about this Colin McKenzie before, nor the movies he created.
It took me over three years before I finally found out that it was a mockumentary.
Thinking this was an interesting documentary about a person i had never heard of before (always been a great fan of documentaries).
As the movie went along, i frequently was going "incredible - why have i not heard of this man before" .. and a few times i went "this cant be true".
I first saw MOST of this film on a flight from New Zealand to Australia, but missed the ending when the flight ended before the film.
I'm baffled that people actually thought this was real since there are numerous clues, nay, out right examples of why this couldn't be real, how the young film maker made movies years before anyone else is actually quite silly.
Throughout the film you will be questioning your own eyes, laughing at events before you and at the same time relaxing, and letting Bunuel's techniques entertain you.
I admire Jackson for unearthing this silent movie master (which actually I knew about before this movie came out), and await when Salome comes out on DVD!
In it was proof that Richard Pearse flew a plane before the Wright brothers, among others.
It took me the first 10-15 minutes before I realised that this wasn't a documentary, but was in fact a mockumentary.
When Peter Jackson (yes, of LOTR fame) discovers "lost" old movie footage and then arranges restoration of same, he finds a historic record of work by one of the country's pioneer movie makers - film that shows, among other gems, proof that Richard Pearse achieved powered flight before the Wright Brothers.
What's amusing more-so to me is that the 'secret' of Colin MacKenzie- and that so many in New Zealand ended up thinking he was for real and did really film his friend beating the Wright brothers to flight by several months and things like that- came under the package of a Peter Jackson product, who before making this had three of his four works as some of the most absurd, low-budget pieces of work to ever come from that corner of the world.
I know mockumetaries have been done before but never has one fooled so many so easily.
But it also works as an exciting thriller, even if you have never heard the name Olof Palme before.
Somehow people who saw this movie were under the assumption, before entering the story, that this would be a more Hitchcockian story like VERTIGO, but in having both Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina swap entrances and exits, he manages to convey the most cerebral of his incursions into Surrealism.
The authority of Moma as the family patriarch is evident; his middle aged sons all hold him in high esteem and cower before him.
This film was 1 of 7 in TIFF 2006's Mozart - A New Crowned Hope series which is a sneak peek at the series before it screens at the Vienna Mozart Year Festival in December 2006.
I'd say a lot of Andrew McGahan's novel would be autobiographical as he went to The University of Queensland though dropped out before finishing his Arts Degree.
Another movie I had never heard of before I saw it on TCM.
That's probably why I never heard of it before.
This time around(in Single Player), more of the game passes before you get your saber, and, well, let's just say, it wasn't by accident the demo(which is very much worth playing, by the way, and not just to see if you'll like the full game, either) had you starting out with it(although the level where you get it is... worth fighting your way to).
I pre-ordered this game in January this year and got my copy 2 days before the official release date, and i wasn't disappointed.
It does have a strong emotional core, but does not offer anything different to the many other war films that have come before.
It takes a while before you begin to care about anyone, hell before you even really know who anyone is.
The battle begins almost before we know anyone really so that there is this odd distance at the start.
One can almost feel the sadness coming from text written by invested historians even today, now more than 60 years after the event that began just before 2AM on 16 February 1945.
The author of the book was the son of a US Navy Corpsman (a medic, then rated as a Pharmacist's Mate) serving with the Fleet Marines whom history had placed at the point where the large flag was raised over Suribachi (a replacement flag for a smaller one raised shortly before).
Thanks to Mr Clint Eastwood's fine directing the facts are now spread before us.
A fact that it seemed not one of us in the packed pre-screening knew before the films closing credits.
In an emotionally-wrenching scene in a hotel room before a military superior, Beach's character breaks down and poignantly expresses the camaraderie and love felt for the fallen members of his battalion.
And that is true in this case, but not before Jet takes a good beating.
I couldn't tell you what Nahon has done before this and to be honest I really don't care all that much.
You don't see Jet Li in any of his movie like this before.
Of course, there are the obligatory moments of cheesy dialogue when she says to him that all he cares about is himself, but the fight scenes kick in before any of this can significantly hinder the film.
As I said before, Fonda is good, and so is Li, who can actually act, unlike so many big-time action stars around.
spoilers  I really wish I hadn't known the title of the movie before seeing it for the first time.
But before we have to see this, BuÃ±uel blows them up in a terrorist attack.
Well, that's the penultimate act anyway before they too are consumed in some other person's desire for something that probably had nothing to do with them.
Keen to stay alive, Lui Jian flees the scene, but not before screaming, mad and completely hat stand police inspector Richard (Tcheky Caryo in his typically delirious role) sends just about every hardened police psycho after him.
Jet Li starred in 25 successful Asian films before making his debut in America as the villain in the lackluster "Lethal Weapon 4."
Surrealism has an ultimate primacy of being able to discriminate completely against "insignificant time" (as I posted on before) & even the ability to flaunt "insignificant time" as "significant time."
The story has been told several times before on TV Â is there anything new about this 2005 ITV version, apart from the Baltic locations?.
There is no doubt that Edward and Wallis were sympathetic to this aim, and even before their marriage they both had friends in, and an admiration for, the Nazi regime, and he especially for everything German.
Fredric March is excellent in this movie and cary grant is ok. Carole Lombard is only in one scene, and i had never heard of the director before.
I have heard that even Germany's greatest ace in WWI, the "Red Baron," was very disillusioned when he went home the last time before his death.
But seeing it on Soapnet, one is reminded of how good it was at least from 1975-1983, before it became influenced by the breakout success of "General Hospital" and veered from its original structure.
It isn't long before our mini-heroine, trampy, is taking mum's indirect advice, likewise ditching her back-home boy toy for a hunky, dangerous uber-dude of her own, who is, oddly enough, Kala's son.
i think everyone thinks it is repetitive, and they have seen it all before.
before showing them the mandatory and expected 'best of' their bits scene.
I like this setting even though it has been used before.
The whole concept of a dude being in the wrong place at the wrong time is good and till the end you'll just be waiting for it to hit you with another new situation that you haven't seen before, nor later.
It wasn't long before 'Vertigo' and by then, Kim Novak had become an icon, which she remains to this day.
Overall this is generally uninvolving and it just plays on until you either finish watching it or rip it out of the player & go to bed before it's over, like I did.
Not a totally worthless film, merely a ho-hum bad one that no one give two damns about as they likely have seen some variation of it before (and better).
I told before, I have no problem with that if that doesn't let you forget the storyline.
After having seen it a number of times-- first in the mid 1980's after if was released to negative reviews and poor box office receipts--most recently last week-- I think that THE MEAN SEASON is an under-appreciated, tightly crafted suspense thriller that, in spite of what other reviews have stated, does NOT pander to clichÃ©'s--this film is old enough to have helped establish those very same tropes that have since become clichÃ©s; remember, this was made before Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, 15 Minutes, etc etc...and was one of the first films to deal with the whole notion of fame/celebrity/serial killers and the lack of ethics displayed by journalists, who must rank somewhere below pimps and pickpockets in terms of moral turpitude.
Nice outdoor shots though; after viewing the film and before looking it up I would have sworn due to it's sort of dated execution (even for the time) that it had been made several years before this (even with the exception somewhat of the hair 'styles' and such which slightly may have indicated a tad more toward 1985) ALL of these people have done MUCH better!
The serial killer wants Malcolm to be his link to the outside world, via his newspaper to prove that he's the one who committing those crimes and tells Malcolm that there will be, like those that he didn't get credit for, five more killings before he's finished.
The characters are extremely well played and the idea of the movie is unlike anything I had seen before.
With this performance, Weller becomes the personification of the genius, adventurer and master-of-all-things; it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual, quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before.
Of course it gets birthed in glorious splatter and once loose, goes into the ventilation system at which point this becomes a movie you've seen many times before and probably much much better.
Him gives you shivers, never before has there been such a portrayal of Jesus in cinema.
The story concerns some nonsense about a warrior fighting the master demon, being killed, but not before he cuts off the demon's hand and takes it to a temple where it is stowed away, until the box containing it is displayed at a museum, only to be stolen by Art Camacho(one of the worst directors in the history of history) and all hell breaks loose, with the warrior(possibly reincarnated, it never really says) recruiting the aforementioned chubby cop and 'Private Dick' to help him save the Earth, or space or something, the plot, if you want to call it that, isn't exactly good, or even competent.
And even today, when ever I go to a pet store with dogs (even cats now), or when I went to a pound twice to get a new pet, I can not stay in there for long before my voice breaks and I start shedding tears.
Another, "A Place Called Saturday," was a novel about living in the desert, and I really enjoyed it, having read it just before moving to the desert myself.
The films that existed before people got bent out of shape about the things you could and could not say, do, or insinuate in a movie.
This TV-epopee of more than 8 hours was heavily criticized, or at least regarded with much skepticism, before it was shown on screen.
Besides, he already filmed another novel of Bulgakov before: "Heart of a Dog", in 1988.
I saw '100 Women' before I saw its predecessor '100 Girls'.
Viewers of the first movie will have heard it all before, but I found Monroe's grossness far more amusing and far less disturbing than James DeBello's.
Do not watch this piece of junk before reading the book!
I had seen many Russian series before this and was generally unimpressed as i think they spent all the money on the cars and not anything else.
After months in interplanetary flight, the manned spacecraft Destiny prepares for the final two hours before separation of the landing module, and its flight to the surface of the Red Planet.
The news agency GNN (Global News Network) covers these last two hours before the historic touchdown, using state-of-the-art technology, and even a correspondent aboard Destiny itself.
The visit also gave me the opportunity to actually have breakfast with Grgory Peck before the days shooting.
To be honest, I'd never even heard of Tucker before seeing this, but it turns out that he's a man that decided to build a new type of car that would revolutionise the car industry.
I had never heard of Preston Tucker before watching this movie, so it was fascinating to learn about his deeds.
That was never done before.
Lovely Joan Allen plays Tucker's devoted, whip-smart wife -- an Eleanor substitute -- and Christian Slater is Tucker's eldest son, perhaps a stand-in for Coppola's son, Gio, who died before the film was made and to whom it is dedicated.
If you had read it before, it is really worth giving it another go.
Like, for example, the entire movie before the school massacre.
It was interesting to see these pieces after having seen that film because it is so clear that his innovative and (usually) whimsical vision were present long before that film was released.
I had a lot of doubts before watching the film because as much as I wanted to see "Master and Margarita" on the screen I was not sure that it was possible to adapt it and not to lose anything important - which is everything.
The famous "Pashkov's House" with the rotunda on the top where Woland and his team gathered together before they left Moscow forever, was in walking distance from my work, and I remember, once, I almost got hit by the car -I walked and looked at that music in stone and could not take my eyes off it.
That's not to say it isn't very enjoyable at times, but it seems to peak just before Caligula's arrival.
Never before have I seen such a well-orchestrated soap opera as this, displaying the history of the 1st century- going through the Julian Dynasty.
One thing I had not noticed before was the pairing of older actresses with younger husbands.
The collection of superior performances by so many fine actors in one series has probably not happened since - it surely did not happen before.
(remember this was before CGI!
(3) I had the good fortune to read both books before the series was made, and then to watch it with a critical eye.
To it's credit, RTSL goes for much longer before the camping grounds are laid, and even after that, retains a good modicum of interest.
Ricky Addison Reed doesn't appear to have done any other film or TV work before or since, & it's not at all surprising.
They have their momentary sexual thrill and the chance to have someone really listen to their problems and are then cast off by the Woman before any real emotional bond can develop.
It was terrible, and I guess everyone has seen something not far from it a thousand times before.
All important words have been CAPITILISED, so you can just scan through it quickly before getting back to The Last Boy Scout.
The film is different and has a good story and Van Damme has a different role here.The movie has Ted Levine as a good villain!Joss Ackland performed well.Also The film has special appearances by Thomas Rosales Jr. and Sven-Ole Thorsen!The music by Mark Isham was good and the music in the beginning sounded similar like his other work in Fire in the Sky.Like I said before this is not Van Damme all time greatest but its good and different.If you haven't seen it yet check it out!
The trailer says "Van Damme, as you've never seen him before" and then just gives us a bunch of poor action clips.
He played a lot of villains before "Monk" came around.
Chris Carter finally discovered that and gave us Improbable before the end of the series.
The next time we see the killer, he approaches Mr. Burt, who is playing three card monte, having recognized him from before.
ÂÂÂ SPOILERS ÂÂÂ PS: I hope Leslie will rise again from the death for a second part x_0 PPS: If you are disappointed by this film then go and rent Man Bites Dog... it's much more dark and cynical as I mentioned before.
I've never seen such a petulant puss before.
But it's loses any real flair during the third act, when the documentary style is over and when it's becomes an slasher movie like any before is the real letdown in the film.
The rush he gets before slashing away a victim, his desire to do what he was "born to do."
It makes fun of the genre in a way that has never been done before.
This one favorite Betty Boop cartoon and also "Cinderella" is one of my favorite fairy stories; I also would like to point out that this short was maded 16 years ago before Disney's theatrical version.
My expectations were pretty low (talking Death Valley low here) before I saw this movie and I'm thankful of it.
They end up going to war over it, but before the war can start, Gulliver is found and captured by the tiny people.
But if you view it as a children's film which was lovingly made and has excellent artwork considering that it was all hand-drawn, then you may very well like me find yourself watching it again two or three times within a week before reluctantly returning the copy to the video store.
There are only 4 scene selection options, the last starts before that rescue.
The Fleischer brothers just wanted to finish something, anything, before a ridiculous deadline.
Naturally, being a zombie she brutally murders everyone in the vicinity, but it gets really interesting when we find out that before death, she and a friend were very close, and now that the heiress is back from the dead; the old friendship can be rekindled.
As mentioned in other comments before, the Italian actress playing Helene is absolutely marvellous.
Now, I myself saw it coming even before the first act of the film was finished.
Perhaps, Barbara's husband(Mike Marshall)will be able to keep her from harm before it's too late.
Midler had some little acting experience before; she was in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF on Broadway and had had small roles in about half a dozen pictures before making her screen debut (as a leading lady) here.
Ms. Midler very quietly called me over to speak with her before the entire company, thanking me for being so quiet during the shooting, not constantly calling "make-up", "hair" as the other impersonators did.
Regular people who are neither rich or famous often cannot fathom how some celebs seem to self-destruct before they've even had long careers.
Killing herself before our eyes, yet we are helpless to stop her.
Watch him as he pauses before he gets into the tractor trailer that he's just hitched a ride with, watch him as he looks back at her, almost reflecting, thinking, for just a moment, reconsidering his choice, and then makes the decision to live with the choice and get on the truck, going God only knows where, leaving her.
How many takes before they got it right?
I have yet to see the Glass Menagerie performed live, and really have nothing much more to say now about the motion picture versions, except that further commentary may very well be forthcoming since my mind has been activated on the subject more than ever before thanks to websites like this.
this was a TV Pilot that was before its time.
The premise: a group of mix-mashed crossrefrences of modern day life are Stranded deadlocked on a Island that is not on any maps and not a soul even knows that it is here... Now all of them, not only have to traverse the mystery of just who each of them actually are, but before it is too late they must Figure the right way through the Unknown Depths of an Island in which the Nightmarish truths are about to be unearthed on a Island known only as "MK:NAOMI"  excerpt: a gov cover-up a Experiment Island in which Failed Experiment Plague the Traditional Loin cloth wearing Inhabitintes have to overcome If you sleep.... hope you have a happy dream Pray Hard it is not a scary one or you might think it really is real really ... cause on this island your nightmares are reality oh and one other thing be careful what you eat oh and think before you open the door...or like the Hero you could be a little green under the gills ...wait hell ya might have gills ... in fact this show was so good i remembered it and thought LOST was the culmination of it coming back...OH well...

FX are in low budged and nice to see young Nikki Cox before you can think she is pretty babe.
Having never heard about or seen this movie before, I wish Bill could have viewed this film before he left me!
A truly butiful movie a decade before its time.
That it shows life before AIDS also adds a layer of poignancy that the filmmakers could never have planned for.
The last 5 minutes, with slow-motion photography and soaring music (pre-dates "Chariots of Fire" -1981), better illustrates male bonding than anything seen before or since.
This was before AIDS/HIV, and unprotected sex was the norm.
and Leo White (Crooked Gambler).You can also see Billy Armstrong, Ben Turpin and Broncho 'Billy' Anderson.This is a perfect comedy.There's no stop to laughter once you get started.When Charlie trains for his match and he keeps getting hits on his nose.When he shows off to Edna with the weights.How he kisses the dog on the head before going into ring.And the fight itself is priceless!
This time in a boxing contest and the preparation before it.
OK so I gave you my input on the series and it is getting a bad rep already so just watch more than one episode before you bad mouth it.
Battlestar Galactica fans made the same mistake before realizing what a complete gem the new series is.
Sci-fi, do us a favor and pull the plug on this before you ruin a classic Sci-Fi hero Flash Gordon for generations to come.
Starting off, let me tell you that I've never seen any of the previous Flash series before, so that might explain my openness.
Perhaps SciFi Channel should learn to develop their imagination before trying to "re-imagine" any other series.
Tiresome, repetitious and plodding, this trundles through a series of barely-linked scenes, none of which are particularly unexpected, most of which are reheated from the first film; meanwhile Linda Koslowski does very little and does it even more wetly and woodenly than before.
(Like when Mel Brooks used jokes in his Robin Hood movie that he'd used years before in "Blazing Saddles."
Perhaps if "Crocodile Dundee" and "Crocodile Dundee II" hadn't come before it moviegoers would be more enthusiastic about this movie.
Fans of the movie should also view the inferior, but still funny See No Evil, Hear No Evil which sees the partnership of Wilder and Pryor re-ignited for a third time, following on from Stir Crazy and Silver Streak before that.
Their lawyer is utterly useless and they are in jail before they know it, literally.
Laughed my head off - a howling laugh riot - sexy for sure - entire cast is gorgeous, but it's so funny you don't have time to think about whatever hormones may be rushing through your body as the beautiful people parade before you - for me it says just how absurd we all are and what complications we create over nothing!
Many of Rueben's friends are still involved in 'less than legal' occupations, and the poverty and wretchedness of the estate seems even worse than when he lived there before.
I'd recommend being in a "certain state of mind" before watching this flick.
And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes".
I would warn anyone who feels affection for Poirot and the great body of his work before this absurd farce to avoid it at all costs.
The ultimate winners were whom I wanted to win and it's a great ending to a show that has won the Emmys before.
The premise is simple, 11 teams of 2 begin a race around the world for 1 million dollars the race is broken into legs in each episode and each team must compete various task through the leg before they can continue on to the pit stop, the team that finishes last in each leg is usually eliminated (although some legs are non-elimination.)
This is the second Poirot I've put back in the box before finishing.
I had to stop it before I wound up as intelligent as the characters in the movie.
He believes that Man was put here as the Master of the Earth and all life forms must bow before him.
Long before the movie is over, we have a pretty good idea who is going to survive and who isn't.
Lizards lock the door, before smashing two bottles of brightly-coloured chemicals on the floor.
This movie had political correctness before that disease even had a name.
The nephew carries a rifle through the woods and proceeds to shoot himself in the leg before a pack of tarantulas descend upon him in an all-too laughable death scene Also, Sam Elliott gets to beat snakes with an oar and blast an alligator with a shotgun).
The first twenty minutes as I said before are devoid of anything remotely interesting.
OK when i was younger and seen frogs for the first time it was kind of scary,then as you get older you find all the mistakes and plot holes and such.this is no way as great as Alfred Hitchcock's the birds.this one deals with a bunch of rich people all celebrating the 4th of July.y birthdays on a Florida island.the patriarch(Ray Milland)who was a hunter before his crippling accident invites his family members all doltish and strange with the exception of his granddaughter(Joan Van Ark)and a model(Judy Pace)and a photographer(Sam Elliot)who is just passing through after his canoe is capsized by a drunken boater(Adam Roarke)the scenes with the animals attacking are really bad.and don't come off as realistic.a harmless rat snake,harmless geckos and anoles,even a snapping turtle,a slow moving one at that.there is a scene where some of the characters flag down a motorist.and the motorist stops for them one of them is carrying a rifle.OK if thats me i would'nt stop for anyone especially if they are carrying a rifle.
Another point to consider is that David Suchet himself, who has read all the books in preparation for the role, has now been promoted to co-producer status and he has said that he reads and approves the scripts before filming begins.
I was never in favour of voluntary assisted euthanasia before this film, but I now believe that there can be a case made for it, at least in the context of this dreary and highly pretentious film.
Among these are:the creature destroying an isolated structure(A lighthouse for Beast,a farm for Behemoth),picking up a car in its mouth and shaking it before dropping it,knocking a building over on people,causing mass death and illness(a disease for Beast,radiation for Behemoth),that they were both spawned at the mouth of a river,and that both are killed by having a nuclear projectile fired into them.
The creature is a giant brachiosaurus that attacks ships and submarines before converging on the city of London.
It takes half an hour before the monster is shown and then you get a good 20 minutes of more than passable special effects.
This film was made before the days of cgi and therefore must seem painfully dated to younger viewers but to us who grew up in the atomic monster age it is both scary and charming.
I am gonna have to update my Willis O'Brien My Space Page u guys need to check that out also made one of Stop-Motion Greats David Allen & Jim Danforth need to finish Allen's though I will before his B-Day on Oct.
However, by the time Behemoth rolled before the cameras, the concept of atomically created monsters had already worn thin.
Unlike Beast, with its spectacular finale- as the monster reared up before a burning roller coaster and finally expired- (a nice Harryhausen touch) the Behemoth is simply struck and blown up by the torpedo.
Instead of a stop-motion shot of the monster dead or mortally wounded, the unrealistic prop head briefly rises for a final time before plunging into the depths of an obvious studio tank.
I can't help but think that Vxf111 is either joking, or (unfortunately) did not know who Sun Ra was before viewing the film.
The merchants on the street ask for Pressure's support - the street is being torn up, and it's right before Christmas; he becomes their hero.
Broderick Crawford did some comedy before "All the King's Men" - he's excellent as a dumb associate of Pressure's who's digging the hole to the bank.
parodies his bad guy image perfectly in this flick as he wants to pull of one last heist before going straight, so he buys a luggage store next to a bank to break in, but he soon learns that he can make more money in a legit business... but that's only the beginning!
Oh Man i watched this yesterday on tv after seeing it 20years before in the cinema!
If you didn't watch a Otto Movie before you can add up to 2 Points to my Vote.
For those of you who haven't seen this one before.... Shame on you!
But as I already said before, even though I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies or of the man's work, I must say that I'm glad to make an exception when it comes to this movie.
"Sex and the City" star Kristin Davis stars as a waitress who has psychic visions of murders before they happen and as serial killings are developing she is asked by the police to help assist in the investigation.
The boys' antics shows that the Chav was alive and well long before the GLC reared their sun-visored heads...from a sister who works at the local massage parlour (as a receptionist, mind!)
However if they say bank before a question the money is safe.
This episode of 'The Twilight Zone' had an opener I hadn't seen before, or if I did, I don't remember it.
There are one or two little problems with the script; Denton overcomes his alcohol problem almost instantaneously and he is suddenly able to walk into a barber's shop and get a shave despite the fact he was so penniless that he had to sing for drink only moments before.
The story plays pretty well and is enjoyable and, if we have not seen it before, it plays pretty well.
I cannot believe I never noticed that before, that is hilarious.
I knew nothing about golf before, but this film helped me understand it better, and laugh for hours!
If everyone had to see one Sandler movie before their lives were complete, I would seriously hope this is the movie they see.
My wife's boss also saw the movie in her home at the same time, and it seems that all of us were just too tired or lazy to get up and change the channel (this was before the days of wireless remotes for cable).
Wonder why I never heard of it before."
Bollywood tries something never before seen in a Hindi film.
I have seen the movie and read reviews that were posted about the movie Indigo.I never even heard about the movie until a week or so before the showing.I personally know one of these children,most of the time he is just a normal little boy like any other child,he doesn't do a lot of the things that Gracie does,but I believe that her character was just a mix of their gifts to show what they can do.The main point of the movie that I feel is the most important is that they are here to bring out the truth,they can see behind what adults and others tell them.You will not pull the wool over their eyes,they CAN see right through you and read what is in your heart,your pain from the past wrongs in your life.And also the good things about you.They can and will heal the planet.The other thing I feel about them is that through the real truth, they will bring peace wherever they go.They came here with their switches turned on,in the past people have had to go through a life changing experience to be enlightened.Near death experience comes to mind.I pray that I meet more Indigo's,If you meet one you will never forget it,he sometimes looks at you suddenly from a break at playing and tells you something about what has been troubling you for some time,then he has that all knowing smile and off they go playing again.
The only good parts were the ones Grace was in, but we had to wait a long time before she appeared.
I am a father of 6 children who also abandoned my older children due to obsessive work and alcohol addiction before I eventually 'woke up'.
The filmmakers will tell you, before the film, that it was not dumbed down.
I actually almost walked out, and I have never walked out or even considered walking out on a film before.
You can't really expect anything certain with a title like that when you haven't heard about the film or its theme before.
I don't think I have ever been so infuriated with a movie character before as I was with Wilbur.
So incredibly touching and powerful I probably haven't seen it before...I was blown away.
It may sound depressing from the title, and you may well shed a tear before the end of the movie, but I can guarantee that you will leave the cinema a wiser and more enriched person for having seen Wilbur...
At dawn on Monday 27 June 1880, after a courageous stand-off at the Glenrowan Inn, Kelly emerged wearing his home-made plate metal armour and helmet, still firing at police, before being shot down and arrested.
However, quite enough films pre-dating 1906 survive (from various nations) to make it clear that a substantial amount of film technique -- the close-up, the dissolve, the cross-cut -- had already evolved before this movie was made.
Many early cinemas had only one projector, with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown.
The rest was hilarious as well especially with the title animal causing havoc with the boys and scaring an African-American porter played by Dudley Dickerson though one may pause a little bit before laughing since that was a stereotype of that race at the time.
It took quite a while before I could figure out all of the pieces of this scheme and the people involved which I enjoy.
The story has been done many times before, but the specific subject of sex addiction has not.
This kind of film has been done a million times before and each and every one of those million is probably better than this.
Not only is he stressed with his crumbling marriage, but is also ham strung by his boss at the police precinct who is a born-again Christian and won't allow Woods the kind of resources he demands in order to trace the serial murderer before he strikes again.
The history of a man betrayed by a system in which he believed in, first, by becoming what he hate most and after that by being abandoned by them after the brutal murder that I talked before.
And please remember what I told you before; don't have any prejudices when you're seeing that movie.
I wish Al Pacino had had a look at this movie before he starred in Insomnia.
Even though he always seems in control, we are constantly aware that he is being stared at (even before this becomes a narrative element), that he is stuck in the frame.
I must say before hand that James Woods is my favorite actor.
They actors did a nice job considering most were Poponguine natives who had never acted before.
After watching the trailer on the dvd (before watching the actual movie) i thought, well this is going to be a good mysterious and a bit romantic movie.
Apart from possibly being a tad sacrilegious, this is a truly bizarre and amazing film--one that can't really be compared to anything you've seen before (and probably ever will see).
The film places some emphasis on pubescent sexuality: Claire experiences her menarche just before she finds the bleeding boy, and there's some attempt to equate her bloodstained knickers with his bloodstained gut.
The lack of credibility a child has before the police, when an adult woman contradicts the information given by a child, and the oppression that the same woman uses over the child are some examples of why the main character feels like he can't do anything.
Furthermore the movie does not justify why these children participate in unbelievable levels of abuse before running off to play out with their ice-creams and trikes - it just doesn't make any sense.
The setup is brief before the torture porn starts, and from there it's a freefall of implausibility.
Allow me to quote the last line, as the main character sits thoughtfully by the river he met "Meg Laughlin" (aka Sylvia Likens) on so many years before: "I will never forget the gift of Meg Laughlin, though I am plagued with the torment of failing again...failing somebody...But as she taught me, it's what you do last that counts."
Ketchum, who is extremely proud of this film adaptation, speaks openly about production company Moderncine's initial pitch to him: "Let us make this movie before Hollywood does and ruins it."
I have never before seen children ages probably ranging between 8-13 commit the inhumane acts as seen in this movie.
I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie before they go to bed because it will be hard to sleep having to think about the poor girl being tortured.
There are lots of preachy/teachy speeches at first, before the murder, and then a full obsession into finding the killers.
Although the idea for a "South Park" movie probably came about before the idea to exploit the MPAA's more flexible ratings system for the TV show's impeccable satire, it's no less the perfect choice to bring the little Colorado mountain town and its foul-mouthed children to the big screen in "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut."
The Terrence & Philip movie introduces the kids to a whole world of swears and insults they never knew before (because they couldn't use them on TV) and they start using it in talking back to teachers and their parents.
i had never watched the south park series before seeing the movie.
It is hugely vulgar and uses combinations of profanity I have never heard before.
I was not a fan of South Park before I saw BL&U, nor was I a fan of movie musicals.
If you aren't familiar with that world (as I wasn't before seeing the movie), the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.
Produced during or just before the glory days of the made-for-television movie, this film depicts the struggle of a difficult man, left to his own devices in the desert.
and a copy on VHS recorded years ago (before i was born probably).
What makes the movie so compelling are the fantastic performances from a diverse cast, an utterly unpredictable, frighteningly sadistic plot, intelligent scriptwriting by Andrew Kevin Walker, and David Fincher's superb direction, which is unlike anything you've seen before.
to my horror no matter how hard i tried to wedge the matchsticks under my eyes, i could not manage to stay fully awake and with disastrous timing my video had given up the ghost the week before...alas i was lost!!!!!!!
Made by Richard lester (A hard Days Night, Superman 2 & 3) in 1969, just before Monty Python hit pay dirt, it tells the story of Brits after the bomb, working class through to upper, it encapsulates the British eccentricities perfectly.
I had never seen a W.C. Fields-film before, but I was well acquainted with most of the other comics from the 'golden era' and was excited to be introduced to this celebrated talent.
He also plays the dulcimer with his mits on, narrates the tale of the salvation army girl who high-kicked his son in the forehead, "A trick she'd learned before she had been saved," has a crying fit with a mouth full of crackers.
Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset.
Surely, the design is outstanding and the characters show their feelings as never before but they can't make a movie by themselves.
Robot Toby finds friends among orphaned children and robots down on the ground before he has to fight the robotised President Stone (Donald Sutherland) who wants the blue power source used to activate Toby (now called Astro).
And to finish off, I have some idea my review is just pathetic and just goes on about how 'great' the movie is.. when it actually is, but I just don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, it has so much in common with the original series that you wouldn't believe, it's rare nowadays that new animation movies have any background history (meaning any cartoons made and shown on TV before the movie) or even anything in common with its previous shows, so it's pretty good to see something like this come out, makes me happy to be the age I am now because when I was young CGI animation just wasn't this good... and that says something cause I'm only 17 ^^ And even if you have never heard of or even watched the original series it doesn't matter because the movie practically starts from scratch anyway if you know what I mean ;) So yeah, enjoy the movie (:
In truth I figured it would head this way when I read the director had no clue about Astro before he started production.
I never heard about Astro Boy before today.
That's a vision which doesn't look like any other that was seen before in Hollywood.
I was divinely surprised by the causticity of Ken Loach I was considering as slightly tamed before seeing this film.
I must confess I don't think I've seen a Ken Loach film before, but his style is hard to deny.
Executive Producer Dmitri Tiomkin returned to Russia to arrange and conduct the soundtrack before such cultural exchanges became commonplace.
*Pace The movie was over before you knew it and has you craving for more!
The haunting scenes are blood-curdling and it has some excellent originality which I have not seen used before.
It looked like they sanded the lens before they shot.
Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving.
I didn't know anything about this movie before I rented it, but being a seasoned horror/thriller movie lover I though I would try it.
Actually, the version I watched may have been cut as the "Stracult" book mentions an unforgettable sex scene involving eels - but, here, this is over before it has even begun as we're rushed to its messy aftermath!
In a way, Mills is a surrogate for the audience; he starts out thinking that he knows exactly what's going to happen but as events slowly unfold before his horrified eyes, it starts to dawn on Mills that he is mentally unprepared he is for a maniac like John Doe.
Freeman is perhaps the only person capable to tracking down John Doe, simply because he has seen so much sadness and horror before.
I didn't know much about Steeplechase before this movie.
It's just a matter of time before Leguziamo gets that role which will make him a superstar.
Even though I thought I knew the big picture before.
The lady turns out to be wacky Carole Lombard and just before March shows up to interview her, she finds out from her dopey doctor (Charles Winninger) that he was wrong in his diagnosis and she will live after all.
The team of David O. Selznick producer, William Wellman director, and Fredric March leading man, after having had a big hit the year before with A Star Is Born, teamed up again to create one of the great screwball comedies of the Thirties in Nothing Sacred.
Right now, the current hoax is the nomenclature used to describe the appointing of the Cabinet, as though the election were a fait accomplis: "Andrew Card, the president's new appointee......" and other such insiduously assumptive language has been used before, as this movie wonderfully points out.
Mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch.
(I've never seen anyone "act" walking across a room before!)
Much under rated this movie wastes no time in getting going, so far so fast in fact that with the knickers showing, then nude teen girl getting killed so vigorously before we know what is going on, a most uncomfortable start.
For example: "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of my least liked movies not for the movie itself, but for the fact that by time I saw it I had seen so many others do the same thing much better many times before.
Memorable set pieces include the appearance of the waiter at the elevator door, squeezing some kind of cherry crepes between his fingers before raping a mother and daughter...the daughter will have the dessert for her own when the door reopens.
Doctor Roger St. Luc (the hopelessly bland Paul Hampton) and his amiable colleague Rollo Linsky (a wonderfully engaging portrayal by Joe Silver) try to figure out what's going on before it's too late.
Your body will turn against you first, way before that happens!"
He'd said it before quite effectively in his first full-length feature, RABID.
He overpowers her, puts her under anaesthetic, and opens her stomach, before pouring acid into it.
Although Shivers might not 'wow' today's audiences with dazzling special effects and technical brilliance, there are still plenty of unsettling scenes that make this movie worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the director's later work: an early death scene sees a man strangling a young woman, before cutting her open and pouring acid into her body cavity; Betts (Barbara Steele) gets a bath-time shock as one naughty, phallic parasite pops out of the plughole and nips up her cooch; Nicholas Tudor (Allan Kolman) wishes he hadn't been getting some on the sly when his stomach begins undulating in a rather uneasy fashion; and a brilliant, downbeat ending sees the horny islanders getting into their cars for a trip to the mainland.
It's not long before the carnage begins.
Yesss, it's not long before these worms have burst from the interior of some hapless young man to destroy the entire community into an orgiastic apocalypse.
it is interesting to note this film was produced before the outbreak of AIDs, but is entirely applicable in our modern world.
What's amazing is that I've never heard of any of these actors/actresses before and they're amazing at their jobs.
Wait...have we seen that before?
Even if the answer is no, you'll feel like you've seen this a thousand times before.
Nothing you haven't seen before and there are an army of these low-budget zombie crapfests which churn out the gore more effectively.
That first of all, she wouldn't get him to get OUT of his car before showing her badge?
Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since.
And before any of the PC brigade accuses me of being homophobic, I am in fact homosexual.
While tracking his stolen gun, he has to go incognito as a former soldier who is now living a life of desperation (we learn that his character really lived this life before getting a job with the police).
The gun becomes a MacGuffin plot device, the drive for Murakami is to get his gun back before it can harm anyone else.
Watching Murakami and Yusa grapple in the vegetation, before both collapsing to the ground in fatigue, I don't think I've ever seen film characters looking so utterly exhausted.
Stray Dog (1949)  An early Kurosawa film, made before he came to the attention of cinema enthusiasts with Rashomon.
The film ends with a cryptic message on screen about the fate of the survivors that, again, gives no meaning to anything that has come before.
The crew were good looking enough but they were so slovenly that they deserved to be keel hauled before breakfast, (for the sharks that is).
Bridges(like you've never seen him before!
For someone who had directed mostly (if not almost all) musicals throughout his career, and indeed made his name on Broadway before winning his Oscar for Cabaret (beating out Coppola for the Godfather no less), Bob Fosse was the last person I would figure directed a film about the iconoclast comedian Lenny Bruce.
The Plot: Clive Owen ( before he was in "The Bourne Identity," "King Arthur," "Elisabeth: The Golden Age," and "Sin CIty" ) plays a "hire" who drives people places they desperately need to go.
And, as many have found out before and since, if you lash out at society, society will hit back - and you find that society has a lot more weapons than a microphone.
The legal cases give this film a second act, but as I have suggested before, there isn't a third.
Yes, we've seen the plot before (though not so truncated), but the cinematography is grainy, jerky, and alive.
So, not long ago in IMDb there was a link to a list of the WWII films you should see before seeing Tarantino's great film (if not his bestÂthat's certainly another story).
Of course "Bastards" was also part and well, I will be trying to see all of those films now not before but after Tarantino's "Basterds" and yes, I'm still a newcomer in regards of war pictures and yes if not for QT I probably would have never seen this film, hell anyways it would have never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray (the 3-disc edition contains a really great conversation with QT and Castellari).
Had this movie been made before Ryan and Brothers this would be the movie to set the standard with todays technique.
He often finds himself at odds with Tony(Peter Hooten), a gambler who has been up for Court Martial twice before his latest conviction of murder..Tony is a racist and makes the mistake of confronting Canfield one too many times, the result his being tossed for a loop!
Adolf(Raimund Harmstorf)is the German prisoner the team comes across, who willingly helps them along the way, before his fate is sealed with they encounter the American soldiers disguised as Nazi officers.
Castellari lets only a few minutes go by before something important happens.
But I know I'm most definitely not the only one around here who would voluntarily watch rubbish like...  -----  I had no idea I already saw "Mutator" before, once upon a full moon, until I started watching it.
When revealed in a lame sequence, the "killer" barely has the built of the murderer we saw before.
Hollywood had tried to address the plight of Southern cotton croppers before (Michael Curtiz's CABIN IN THE COTTON, 1932, and Ford's TOBACCO ROAD, 1941) but THE SOUTHERNER does so without drowning in CABIN'S sociological balance or Ford's forced humor.
But, as I said before, the film's trump card is its gradual depiction of the evolving relationship between the two leads, which really has no equivalent in GUILTY OF TREASON (where Charles Bickford's tormentors were various and generally shrouded in darkness).
Several people like John Gielgud and Peter Bull were considered for that part before Hawkins was signed for the role.
the story has been done several times before and a lot better.
griffin the boy and his crew board the oil rig shortly before it is hijacked.
the "clever" lines before and after kick some terrorist ass without even being touch were a joke, but the kind of funny stuff that doesn't supposed to be laughable.
As I have said before in other reviews, I love movies about crazy people.
To some degree that may be the reaction some people watching this film may have by walking out of this film before its even 1/4 through.
Gooding and Kinnear provide strong support, but it's Kinnear who outshines Gooding, why haven't we seen him in more prominent roles before?
Bob Fosse was a strange choice to direct this--he had only done two musicals before ("Sweet Charity" and "Cabarat"), but "Cabaret" was such a huge hit I guess he could pick and choose what he wanted.
Even Leatherface was okay, though his version of the movie was seriously tampered with before release.
Claire Goodman(Elizabeth Barondes)is set up as you female heroine and lover Dillon(John Mese), who works for her pops, Mayor William Goodman(Gary Lockwood, FAR removed from 2001, that's for sure)is the male hero who must stop the killer scarecrow before he is able to become all-powerful.
In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the "pre-fantasy" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.
It feels like you would want to spend a whole movie with, which is the first thing one must do before making the movie.
I don't feel like researching it at the moment but I'm willing to bet that this story was written before LabyrinthÂ
Both character's 'death' symbolize their own necessary transmogrification, only to arise more powerful than before and take their troops to victory.
Okay, I'll admit that I had a pretty good idea of what to expect before I actually sat down to watch this flick.
Having never heard of her before, I laughed when I saw her name in the credits.
I liked the writing and thought when Rossiter appeared and his eventual demise was an idea that worked well and one I had never seen before, even in higher budget horror films.
Let me begin by stating that I loved Psyclops and Arachnia and viewed those before I watched this poor exercise in film-making.
I've never fast-fowarded through a nude scene before this movie, but the dialog voided out the excitement from the nudity.
I had no idea of what was in store before watching this, except that the title itself projects a sense of violence.
Fosse has a close grip on the direction and Hoffman and Perrine are both absolutely superb, bringing to life two very tortured souls who temporarily found solace in each other, before finding their relationship put to the test by drug abuse and self-loathing.
And she's the sister of Judge Myrna Loy who Grant had just appeared before.
Grant is Richard Nugent, an artist who gets into some trouble and comes before Judge Turner (Loy).
Toward the end of the film, he takes Judge Turner to dinner; before long, the entire cast is at the table talking and arguing as the waiters continually sing "Happy Birthday" to one customer after another, and a diner at another table tries to retrieve Rudy Vallee's chair for his own party - it's a great scene.
Through no fault of his own, the artist ends up in court before Judge Margaret Turner who recognizes his innocence but warns him not to appear before her again on a similar charge, caused by a lady in a night club.,.
The situation then become complicated by Nugent's appearance before a high-school class as speaker, an event at which Margaret's daughter falls in love with him despite or because of the difference in their ages.
He gets into his pajamas and dressing gown and makes himself a drink, planning to read a book before bed.
Loy never played such a high ranking professional before, nor had Grant played an artist of any type.
While he had several films before this one that brought him into the spotlight, I thought that he went above and beyond for this film.
She had been a successful concert pianist before her death a few years earlier, and Tom himself learned piano under her influence.
Let's just take a bow for a moment before a film which DARES show that actually, in these situations, in 9 cases after 10, YOU LOSE.
-- and hi character's shifting moods or for the any of the many other elements of the film -- the power of music, the father-son relationship, corruption in business, a fine actor before he has been abducted by Hollywood!
The Americans love to redo what some French director did before, with mediocre results.
I've never seen Duris in another role before, but his character is complex, perennially nervous, strained, angry, but incredibly charming.
As I said, I can't make comparisons between a heavyweight like Keitel and Duris (whom I've never seen in a film before this), but on his own terms Duris creates his character believably.
I never noticed that before, but I guess you have to really sometimes look for the small things.
Interesting film but haven't we been down this road before?
A whirlwind romance follows shortly thereafter and eventually the two end up quickly marrying before Roger leaves to be a foreign correspondent in Japan.
Their financial situation changes when the child is about 2, and before the adoption is final, the adoption head honchos threaten to take her away, because now they are poor.
Dunne wrote to the kind adoption lady telling her their tragedy as soon as the girl died, and before Dunne has a chance to leave Grant for good, the adoption lady informs the couple (who have yet to make up and are just as miserable as ever - remember it has only been three days since their little girl died) that the agency just got in a sweet little boy (two years old, golden curls, the sort of kid they thought they wanted to adopt before they saw their baby girl), and would they be interested in seeing him?
This brief interlude is most amusing in hindsight as it shows a very stereotypical view of pre-WWII Japan right out of "Madame Butterfly" (the film was released a mere eight months before Pearl Harbor).
Edgar Buchanan (long before his lazy Uncle Joe on TV's "Petticoat Junction") and Beulah Bondi provide able support as their devoted friend Applejack and Miss Oliver, the compassionate adoption agency worker, respectively.
You had better bring some... though not the standard light-hearted fare Dunne and Grant had performed in before, this film is a classic example of an American tear jerker.
Because they don't hold jobs, they are forced before a judge to plead their case.
And if this town is so small, how come she and the main character do not know each other before this night when she just walks up out of the darkness?
By the way, I must say that watching "Penny Serenade" on TV I have discovered a very clever actress, too, who I haven't known before, Irene Dunne.
I watched this film before Christmas when TV decides to play movies all day long and I get very easily distracted.
Irene Dunne and Cary Grant had appeared in two other comedies before.
Once they (Cary Grant and Irene Dunne) have finally have one, the baby dies before birth.
What bothers me the most is the fact that the makers seem to have picked a the girl's country of origin at random - since they weren't going to check any facts out before shooting.
And as for the record: Never before have I sweated with embarrassment all the way through a movie.
the cut-aways to the aborigines during Glenn's flight up in space) still carry some worth as far as being filmed wonderfully or with a strange quality that makes it fun to watch - any other director might take out the crucial detail of Alan Shepard urinating in his suit before the very first successful launch of a US man into space, but it's left in, and stronger for it.
Here are three examples: Cooper dropping a tiny toy space capsule into Grissum's drink (foreshadowing), Copper reading Life magazine before the publisher enters the movie (to make sure we viewers know that Life magazine exits), Yeager bumping his elbow on a limb of a cactus tree as he walks into Pancho's at the beginning of the movie (I never noticed this the first few times I watched the movie, but surely this tiny action was deliberate.)
Stone Cold arrives but gets ambushed by Triple H before he can enter the ring.
Lazaro is a young boy, raised dolphins in the jungle, after his mother is raped and killed (before his very eyes), by wicked men!
The film, based on David Kendall's novel 'Lazaro', revolves around young Lazaro, a child raised deep in the Amazonian jungle by his mother following the death of his priest father before he was born.
The image of this, followed by the malnourished girl smiling at her last taste of watermelon before driftng off into death sleep... Overpowering.
Let me just state before anything else: 10/10.
I'd heard that this film was very sad before I saw it and knew how it ended but that didn't prepare me for just how harrowing this film was.
The voice-work, too, doesn't strain credulity- these sound like, if it were a regular live-action feature, the kids who would play these parts (and, speaking of neo-realism, the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again).
The truly beautiful thing about this movie is that as you watch the film, you want to see good things happen to these kids...Yet, as the movie opens, you see the main character, a boy named Seita, die right before your eyes.
The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.
By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before.
This refers both to the lead I have mentioned before as well as to the supporting cast.
(So, until now I still don't understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriend/wife/sister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head.)
The film opens with a traditional Voice of God introduction to the Oscars, as our narrator shows us the Hollywood sights before showing us the hotel where the event will take place, the crowds awaiting their favourite stars.
If I had seen this film before reading the book first, I still would not have liked it very much.
Maybe she should have spend a bigger part of that year auditioning better actors instead of clearing out the local retirement home at the last minute before everyone died.
I can't believe it was 6 years before I finally got around to trying it out.
Excellent story,characters,humor,drama etc.The show is basically about three(later four) bounty hunters and them doing their job.There was also a film adaptation of this, which I saw before watching the series.The movie is excellent as well.If you are an anime fan, check this one out.
Overall, the series is not the brooding anime/manga fare, as I have stated before, but a 007-esque romp that could be made into a smashing movie...which, coincidentally is due out 2011...and I PRAY it holds up to the fantastic masterpiece that is Cowboy Bebop.
The color was so garish, and the depiction of the "colored" farm hands so out of date, that I wondered whether it was actually filmed in the 30s or early 40s, before color, like the original.
Many before me have given reviews that I'm sure I'll duplicate, but this is truly the best anime I have EVER seen.
They get away, but not before Sarah is shot and killed (a genuine surprise, although I can't help but wonder if she just refused to do any more nude scenes unless they changed her contract, so they got rid of her.
Having seen Amir Naderi's film Aab, Baad, Khaak (Water, wind, dust) also with Majid Niroumand (Amiro of Davandeh) only a day before, Davandeh's power as great cinema was a trifle diluted.
It is painful to see the boy, quite literally, running for his life as the ice he's cradling threatens to melt before he can reach his destination.
I hadnt heard of this film at all before i went to see it, so had no preconceptions as to what to expect.
Unfortunately (& like the action films that try to copy Die Hard) we've really seen it all before.
It was 2/3 weeks before I actually i did get to see it at the cinema late one night with my friend and it was a good thing I did.
scared me a lot, good story line, the only horror to date that scared me,  acting was good, some well know actors i will be buying on DVD,  will watch again, music build up was good but to much blood,  had us holding to on to our teddys tightley i was to too scared to go downstairs too get a drink on my own,  had a to watch another film before i could go to sleep, surprise to see to was make in 2002 because i have never heard of it before,  10 out of 10 it a must see movie but watch it alone if you dare if not watch with a friend
How many times have we seen this fake tension builder before, I ask you?
I love cinema, and I've never slated a film like this before, but this film deserves it.
As more of the friends continue to die in accidents a way must be found to send the evil Djinn back before it completes it's mission to kill all those who summoned it...
And Although I had seen it before a few other times , I really never paid much attention to it.
remember when you would hear a song & try to claim it before anyone else saying "that's my jam"?
As usual Gary proves able to sculpt a sympathetic protagonist who is able to win over the audience into rooting for him regardless of the sometimes violent methods he uses to defeat his foes and here his vengeance against the criminal fraternity who destroyed his family and friends is nothing short of apocalyptic.As well as the superb physical skills that Gary brings to his performances he is capable of portraying strong human emotions also.He is always very effective indeed in scenes involving children and it can be no accident that he is often cast as a father in his films.Martial arts are absent from this tale until the final thirty minutes and when they finally appear in a series of brutal and superbly well choreographed fights you realise that you are watching a master at work.There are simply no current screen martial arts stars (Chinese,European or American)who could have brought what Gary Daniels brings to this role.This is a movie that should be sought by anyone who professes to enjoy action and if they enjoyed it half as much as I did then it won't be long before they seek out other Gary Daniels movies.They won't be disappointed,if anyone working in this genre delivers the kind of energy that Gary Daniels does in every role then they are being very quiet about it.Keep the British flag flying Gary for there isn't any young actor in the UK today who looks as if they even have the strength to even lift the flag up.Only the US is capable of producing a movie like RECOIL and long may they continue.
In this respect, the film is mildly entertaining Â but, in view of the utter lack of novelty on display (the means of resuscitation may have changed but the result is the same as before), it tends to feel draggy even at a mere 69 minutes!
Launer pretty much steals the film from the rest of the cast, both before and after he is killed.
Nobody should enter his garage without checking to either side of the garage door to make sure one of the creatures isn't lurking there waiting to rip the steering wheel from your car before throttling you with one hand.
This was the golden era of musicals where other giants such as Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli as directors and Fred Asteire, Ginger Rogers (a little before), Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse as performers distinguished themselves.
Anyway, if any of these characters were missing, the show would have been can-celled long before.
You may think of stuff you never thought before, or you might laugh about some past memories the movie have brought up in your mind.
It was something I have never seen before, from the various scenes, to the scenes that made me say wow.
Also present in "Le Fantome de la LibertÃ©" is BuÃ±uel's recurrent criticism of several things including the bourgeoisie (as done before in "The Secret Charm of Bourgeoisie"), the Church, police and moral beliefs, making quite clear to the viewers how much he dislikes them.
I don't know how often I could watch films like "The Phantom of Liberty" before it got old and uninteresting, but I'm glad that there was someone out there to accomplish what Bunuel did.
And this was before I even started the movie.
I had already read he comments for this movie before I saw it.
I have never seen before, such great combination of hip hop and ballet.
Sarah Johnson had a lot of talent before her mother died but gained a lot more talent having to live in the Chicago ghetto (A lot of talented people come from the ghetto).
Although I had basically seen the movie before with different titles (if you get my meaning), I thought the movie was good.
So when it turns out that he is the villain, it's a genuine surprise (for the longest time, I kept thinking that he'd have one of those Hollywood conversions right at the end and help Wayne to set things right before dying in a hail of gunfire).
After a series of tragedies, however, Wayne figures things out (Dietrich had, long before!
At least they could do some research before filming in another country.
Without suffering some kind of tragic end before the movie ends.
If you're not into that sort of thing thats been done before in "Ronin" and "Ocean's Eleven" then you won't find anything different here.
After professional thief Jack Tulliver (Snipes) and his crew pull off a meticulously planned armoured car heist, they are ambushed by another group of thieves, who kill most of Tulliver's crew but are unable to kill Tulliver before he escapes.
The English girl says, "Didn't we do this before?"
The director of this film should leave his experimenting for film school, or at least for before the movie is filmed.
The story is about the sheriff who has to hang a killer Sam Hall (Richard Boone) before sundown.
And when someone gets knocked on the head it's out of camera shot, which I thought was a convention that had been done away with some years before the film was made.
The ending is a surprise and the acting of two parts by Herbert Lom made him one of my favourite actors long before he became well known in the Pink Panther series.
I enjoyed this movie, it has an up to date urban twist on an old story...but I would wait for the tv version before I let MY mother or mother-in-love see it.
The rest of the crew, well, they act like they've never acted before (and after this flick, probably never will again), the chairs and tables in this movie act better than the actors!
While it may have a good message at heart, the execution is so mediocre and appalling that one must think twice before even calling this cinema.
Right at the get go we begin with an off the wall cameo by Quentin Tarantino, featuring a monologue and a gunfight, all set before an almost cartoonish painted backdrop of a snow-tipped mountain and a looming red sun.
I had not been aware of this director before and as he wrote the script too, (oh yes, I forgot to say excellent script) he has excelled himself.
I had not even heard of this film before.
It is apparently set in something like the mid to late 1800s, after the Shogunate has begun to lose power, but before the Meiji emperor's government has gained dominance; a time in which Japan appears to be in decline, and has been humiliated by foreigners.
But before I go into the movie itself, I feel the need to talk about the case.
You can always be guaranteed in a Takashi Miike movie of seeing things that you've never seen before.
Plus, the Japanese have a sense of poetry too, and there's even a bit of room in here for that, before the action kicks in again.
And, before you ask, no: It's not the kind of it's-so-dumb-it's-kinda-funny-flick.
and fun also and it is fun just for who have seen Garcea before and know who is he so you should see this movie i am not a fan of romanian movies but this movie is O.K.
It's a real shame because like I mentioned before the story had more than enough potential.
The opening 20 minutes, before the expedition is underway, are the most striking, with colorful touches and a slightly wacky approach that the film later loses, though there is good smattering of creepy moments and everything mounts to a pretty fun finale.
After she is rescued, another group go to stay there to see what really happened and is isn't long before killings start.
This moody British horror film was made several years before the "stalk 'n' slash" genre kicked off, yet this atmospheric chiller possesses a number of elements that would later become popular in the modern horror genre.
There's a lot of "whose been sleeping in my bed" antics before the truth about the island is uncovered.
), but five of the top twenty were written around and before fifty decades ago.
What I didn't remember was the awesome scene with Scottie getting serious rad's in the jefferies tube and passing out as Spock acts like an a hole, asking why he should say thank you, that was a little over the top as Spock had shown thanks before (I think), but Spock never gave Scottie a break.
4 of 10, season three is starting to look lame like everyone said (but there were some good episodes before this one!
Same thing goes on back at the Enterprise; Spock is more of a smartass than we've ever seen him before.
I was a big fan of this series before i appeared in it.
I must confess before you read this that I am truly a period costume freak, and this time period is one of my favourites.
The casting was well done, but in the progress of the movie I kept thinking that I had seen this one before.
My favorite moments in the movie is when the two Luis and Julia are arguing in the hotel and Luis goes into a rage telling julia how much he loves her and the last few scenes in the movie when Julia poisons Luis' coffee and Luis practically pours his heart out before willingly drinking the poison telling Julia he loves all of her good and bad inspite of all the hell she put him through(I even cried a little.
Maybe it'll come to me before I finish this review.
And to lessen the probability that she is compatible with the man, the woman must arrive in the man's country no more than 3 hours before the wedding takes place.
Right before the person drinks the poison they tell you for the 1000th time that they love you.
Pedro has worked with John Ford before and Katy Jurado was in High Noon and One Eyed Jacks.
It would still be a few years before the director could get back into full stride but this this film must have ensured that he would be able to continue making films, even if temporarily, it was still to be in Mexico.
I walked out cursing before the credits started to roll, something I make a point to see in other movies.
this movie is fantastic, the story, the songs, the acting its something never seen before and really well portrayed i don't want to give away the story but it is a good portrayal of the obstacles and difficult decisions faced by a traditional villager hoping to uphold justice for a foreign woman - its a magnificent portrayal of morals' victory over backward thinking i really recommend the movie because of the excellent acting by the male lead and the great support from the English lady leader.
She was actually a lot smarter than I thought and it was a shame that she had to die before her husband could realize it as well.
The story, another tragic tale of impossible love, has been done thousands of times before and didn't really hold my attention.
I wonder how many more times I will watch "The Age of Innocence" before I risk being exposed to Hollywood's 21st century conformity, such as "Independence Day" or "Wild, Wild West".
The comments before mine are mostly right on target...I am in awe of the filmmaking and can't say enough about the dramatic subtleties, the opulent production values and the overall magnificent way the entire project was handled.
Did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air??
However, as time passed my interest in older Japanese films began to increase, so now I am trying to broaden my knowledge of classic Japanese films, especially those that were filmed before 1945 of which I have only seen a handful.
Running just over an hour, this is a lovely film that presents a fascinating portrait of Japanese life before the war showing streets that look like narrow passageways, elevated tatami rooms used for drinking tea and smoking pipes, and buildings no higher than two stories.
(before the "THE END" hits the screen) and that is when Lugosi shoots Petrillo but the scene ends to quick.
I was hoping Petrillo would have agonized more before dying at least 10 minutes worth of pain and suffering would have been nice.
Lets face it, Dean and Jerry probably considered this one for about 14.5 seconds before passing.
A twist ending at the tail end of the picture does much to mitigate some of the silliness and illogic that had come before, and even becomes very P.C.
He doesn't speak he growls or whines in a way that I can only compare to a petulant child does moments before he's sent to his room until he's 40.
King gets the blame for several of the murders because he is trying to find out who has taken the blue sunshine, arriving just before the homicidal effects kick in.
I've learned not to go into Jeff Lieberman's films with high expectations, as although I liked his latest film; horror-comedy 'Satan's Little Helper', both Squirm and Just Before Dawn did nothing for me, despite high expectations before seeing them.
Lieberman also injects sequences that see various characters lose their hair before trying to kill anyone and everyone in the vicinity, and these too make the final package more intriguing - the sequence that sees a nanny take out her lust for violence out on a couple of irritating kids being the highlight in that respect.
With the help of his faithful girlfriend Alicia Sweeney (Deborah Winters) the trail leads to a politician named Edward Flemming (Mark Goddard) who attended Stanford University ten years before.
I knew about this film long before I saw it.
And I could only bear to watch the first 10 - 15 minutes of it before I had to turn it off.
This surprisingly intriguing horror film has people turning into bald,blue-skinned killers after dropping contaminated LSD ten years before.
I'd still recommend this movie for its train wreck factor, just don't put your hopes up high before you watch it.
This movie was not made as a response to "Shaun of the Dead": technically, it was released the day before "Shaun of the Dead".
It premiered at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham AL the Thursday before "Shaun" was released on Friday.
A lyrical, beautiful and moving film with a storyline so believable, it is as if I were with them, on the dusty roads and the rolling hills and plains, seeing the Great Southwest unfolding before my eyes.
I can't wait to see what other films this fine French director has brought to the screen, as I had never heard of him before.
He also wrote most of "Eyes Wide Shut" before Kubrick re-wrote sections of it.
"The Glittering Prizes" is among a handful of really great pieces of television, and we are waiting impatiently for the BBC to complete excavation of the archives and place this wondrous series before a new generation of viewers.
And when I mean "sprung up" I mean "sprung up" because zombies appear almost out of thin air - in the church, in the video store and in a living room (where one zombie comes right through the door without any of the five people in the house seeing it and one zombie comes up from the basement where one man had said was empty not five seconds before).
I agree that it was way before its time.
After all, it looks like Kroll relies on a Ponzi setup in assembling his empire much in the way Bernie Madoff swindled billions from investors before finally taking a fall.
Which happened just eight months before the movie "The Match King" was released!
Their first though is, sell all their shares before the public finds out.
The cynicism in this scene is a capper for what went on before, as Kroll sells down the river almost everyone he has dealings with, including going as far as murder and getting one problem person locked up for life in an insane asylum to shut him up for good.
William joined a parade of other acting talent in the repertory company that Zanuck created when he was in charge of hiring actors before he quit in 1933.
If that show would go back on the air, it would probably have better ratings than before.
the chemistry between the characters just made it impossible not to like even thou I already had made up my mind before even watching it.
I don't recall ever seeing that before in a zombie film and it actually makes some sense.
I guessed the ending and later I found I was correct, all the 'laughs' I had seen and heard before and I sat there completely board as though I was staring at a blank screen.
However, I've seen plenty of films like that before so why was I so surprised at this one?
About half the audience at my screening walked out before the movie was over.
Only one thing is left before they can get married: Simon has to meet Theresa's parents, Percy (Bernie Mac) and Marilyn (Judith Scott).
Same as the speech that Bernie stole from Ashton to woo back his wife on the day before their 25th Wedding Anniversary.
But like I said before the movie was absolutely delightful and very funny
The fake-Eastern European movies that Joseph GrÃ¼nberg alias "Jo Green" had made with his troop that he more or less evacuated form Galizia, Wolhynia, Bessarabia and Podolia approximately five minutes before the first NS-pogroms started in the 30ies, are good but not authentic.
He had sent the Doctors to the Death Zone on Gallifrey to defeat the enemies and dangers that lay before the tower.
It also gave me exposure to some of the other Doctors that I had never seen before.
I have known students like Charlie before and wondered if they actually had any moral compass other than their own egocentric interests in sex and pleasing their parents.
At least I don't recall any movie before this one.
Now if you have ever seen any films from the 50's you should know what fate always falls upon the villain.If given the opportunity to see it you definitely should just to see a basic storyline before it became overdone, but if you need your movies to go from one moment of terror to the next this is not the movie for you; otherwise this film should hold you attention from beginning to end.
It's the sort of story that had been done many times before in films, and which would soon be a staple on television.
All he wants is to see the psychiatrist who committed him three years before.
In summary, it's probably in league with Emeril as it would appear to be a program for the more sophisticated cook with the before mentioned time and cash at one's discretion.
Maybe it helps to point out that Sylvia Kristel, born in 1952 in a small town in the Netherlands, was brought up in a very strict Calvinist family and went on to study English, in hopes of becoming a teacher, before she ran away from home, giving up all she had had, defying all of her relatives and friends, and started working as a model from the 1970s on in Amsterdam.
Long before the term "crossover" was invented, EMMANUELLE brought extended scenes of nude lovemaking before an audience of youngsters, couples and little old ladies, lured in by the respectable credentials backing up the project.
It's all opium den rape, Thai boxing and pan-sexual threesomes from here, all of which remains vastly preferable to Mario's deliriously half-baked sexual sermonizing, already drastically pared down from the book, before Emmanuelle at last winds up in THAT chair, applying excessive make-up and donning a gaudy glitter dress, signaling her questionable "evolution" towards the silly '70s ideal of sexually liberated womanhood, conveniently overlooking the fact that it has been mostly engineered by men, some of them old, all of them dirty.
These days, it's hard to imagine that there was indeed an erotic cinema before EMMANUELLE as the film's style as well as its substance have forever influenced and perhaps tainted the genre since with its exotic locations, lifestyles of the idle rich and empty philosophies on the nature of love, fidelity and jealousy.
exotic locations, great music, beautiful costumes and the debut of then 22 years old sylvia krystel pursuing sex joy before the dawn of aids fear.
I grew up in New York/Philadelphia/New Jersey areas and before political correctness in marketing, the radio station WABC in New York ran advertisements for almost ALL movies opening or playing in New York City.
Nowadays Emmanuelle's life is a commonplace for many women (except for the conservatives who want to ignore it) and before the onset of real sexual diseases as one of the consequences without protection.
I remember seeing the "Emmanuelle" films (in the days before video or cable TV) at the infamous midnight movies.
It's not that I particularly have anything against pornography; but what's taboo now and what was taboo over three decades ago are different things, and besides that; you can only watch people having sex for so long before it begins to get dull.
The basic story is this: boy goes to live with his parents, dad dies, son pees all over his dad's stuff and masturbates, mom sniffs her son's butt, mom decides to introduce son to a world of sexual deviance and perversion (including participating in group sex with him), mom decides she should leave before the two of them actually have sex (but she conveniently leaves a whore behind for son to fall in love with), mom continues her career as a prostitute, son and whore whip the local restaurateur and cry, mom comes home to cause more trouble, and then mom dies and son masturbates at her coffin.
It's a shame Honore didn't realise that before releasing the film, or we could have been looking at the funniest film since 'Airplane'.
Then there was a hiatus for another twenty years or so before these tasteless scenes came back with a vengeance.
(How long before the opportunity to pull the switch is auctioned on eBay?)
Just an example, Sam's daughter Lee(Faye Dunaway) never visits her father before he dies in the book, but yet in the movie they have her visiting him.
The scene when Fay Dunaway's Lee Cayhall Bowen comes to see Sam in the hours before his execution is as good as it gets.
SPOILERS: He is forced to go on the run and later finds sanctuary, but is tracked down by a man he had come across before.
In 1947, before his kids became famous Left Wingers, Henry's role in here was more believable to audiences.
An great example of stylistic departure as a supremely successful one shot gesture; Hitchcock achieved something of the same success several times,with "The Wrong Man" and "The Trouble With Harry", although in the latter case Hitch had done comedy before...."The Wrong Man" and "The Fugitive" stand out for me as the greatest stylistic anomalies achieved by major auteurs.
When Herbert J. Yates of Republic Pictures made a deal with John Ford to produce The Quiet Man he first made Ford agree to do one of his cavalry epics with John Wayne because he wanted a surefire moneymaker before taking a chance on The Quiet Man.
A Lot of Dumbheads try to say look like ...... look like these idiot always love to look like something now mario kart idiot Mario kart bla bla was made after Twisted metal and Vigilante 8 these are basic car combat games like snes Rock and Roll racing D: relearn them then try to say look like ......

To get to the finish line, Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.
You've seen this movie before.
Here, the sadistic boss is a woman: "Hennessey," played by Joan Allen, who I thought had some class before I saw this film.
The framed for murder set up is too obvious, and before you can even figure it out for yourself they give it away.
I would recommend this movie if you are looking for fun, like I said before we just need a pure action movie sometimes and Death Race is a perfect film on that level.
If you have never seen any of Lepage's work before, this is a good place to start.
I read nothing of this movie before going in and I'm glad I didn't.
I had heard a lot about this episode before i actually got to watch it, but it lived up to, and blasted past, all my expectations.
I have heard him referred to as a subtle actor before, and I think that comes through in this episode.
And the director of this movie really loves to show guys getting hit and then spinning in the air about ten times before hitting the ground.
Honestly now...I read the comments before i watched this feature film, and I must say that I am glad I paid little to no interest in some of the posts i saw prior to my actual viewing.
This movie was soooo bad I erased the tape before I finished recording it.
The suspect overpowers several policeman before he is subdued.
He won't talk to police and Cher has to draw him out before she can even begin to find some way to defend him.
The idea of following real people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to present the whole life experience had never been done before.
I actually identified more with youngest brother Grant, who at 17, just wanted to strum his guitar and enjoy his last summer before adulthood, while dad Bill preferred his son work.
Truthfully, the American family is even more broken now than ever before, which ironically, gives this series more relevance today than it had 35 years ago.
And the main character, Marina, well, she'd never even seen a television ever before.
[WARNING-REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]  Long before their downfall, the Taliban had virtually no friends outside their fundamentalist, Islamic circle.
She's eventually detected and she goes on "trial" before a "judge" who, before dealing with her case, sends a foreign journalist to be shot and a European female doctor to be stoned to death.
The lead actress, who was a panhandler before making this film, gives an exceptional performance and the look of sheer terror and pain never leaves her furrow-browed face.
her "journey" full of "hope" ends with her being all trussed up and presented to the creep who then asks her to choose which iron chastity belt she would like before brutalizing and raping her (at the age of 12yrs.
authorities to accommodate the growing Islamic population, how long will it be before the great democracies of Western Europe look like Afghanistan?
The local Taliban, however, remembers this little detail very clearly, and starts by hosing the women down with high-pressure hoses before opening fire on them.
In accordance with the interview of the director Siddiq Barmak in the Extras of the DVD, Marina Golbahari was accidentally discovered four days before the beginning of the shootings.
Two days before the beginning of the shootings, Barmak met Arif Herati, and decided to create a special character for him, not foreseen in the original screenplay.
The real quote is by Ali Shariati, the celebrated idealogue of the Islamic Revolution in Iran--who died before he could see it happen--which says: "[Oh, God,] Put me among those who give away their worldly desires for their religious one, not those who give away their religious desires for their worldly ones."
(both sessions sold out before time) Well done Angelopoulos!!
Well, it is Matt LeBlanc before he became the lovable Joey.
She is in jail for what appears to be months before we get a girl on girl hookup (with Teresa DiSpina) and a shower scene.
We get food fights in the mess hall and dancing with a mop, but we have to wait until the movie is almost over before a shower scene?
This film was Mumblecore before Mumblecore (a genre which critics initially poured far too much praise upon).
And gold is an apt visual metaphor, particularly when juxtaposed against the black satin of a tuxedo lapel or the wintry Manhattan night scape, for a world seemingly vanishing right before our eyes--a world too sleek, too soignÃ©, too genteel to survive the steam roller of galloping blue-jeaned egalitarianism.
I'm not so sure my only finding Metropolitan was such bad luck: It's a fantastic film and, because I've watched it four times since Thursday, I probably would have had to return Last Days of Disco or Barcelona to the video store before watching them anyway.
As I said, we have all seen this story many times before, but we have not seen it done through words.
But what makes the movie is the performance of the fabulous Beatrice Lillie, unknown to me before now.
While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the sÃ©ance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...
Pietro Sibille's interpretation of an ex-military who tries to live a normal life is simply amazing, counting that he had never had a lead before, and bringing realism to the movie.
Barbara Stanwyck was a liberated woman playing liberated roles long before it was in vogue.
I'd seen Keeley Hawes in the 'Begger Bride' before this, and I was fairly impressed by her portrayal of a completely virtuous character.
Was Dickens ever so much fun before?
I also believe it is better to have already seen Shallow Grave before seeing this one, as it tackles similar themes shown in a very different way.
I hate knowing the end of a story at least an hour before it finally grinds its inevitable way there (see any "action" film).
Sometimes, the movie turns out to be too predictable: before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen, you guess that a love story will start between them.
You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand: there are sharks, it's not always shiny and Sal, the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel.
The script appears to have been written by mentally disturbed monkeys the night before shooting (probably while they were getting stoned).
He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating.
Ned is a quiet side-kick who thinks before he speaks and somehow Wilson manages to pull it off.
Let's hope Anderson can come back down before Hollywood makes him walk the plank.
This was before the Emmy's finally got sent their way but something about Warner's relationship with the show, maybe it was her use of drug terminology in describing it, that got me interested.
My wife was taking a class which meant that when our two year old went to sleep she went to work (either school or real) and I had a couple of hours to entertain myself before bed.
First of all I would have to get through 5 more seasons of mayhem before I was caught up.
I was watching the show right before it (I want to say it was "Family Guy" but I really don't remember), and the previews for season 5 hyped up the first 10 minutes of this new season.
I am on a mad dash to catch up on all seasons before Season 6 debuts in January 2007.
I am not worried about catching up before January.
I think upon all the episodes i watched it seams it talk about American history and all the suffering that America is facing from their enemies were caused by their great white leaders i think a black head of state can resolve this issues.And also i think if there such movies yet going to be released in the future all the main supporting characters should survived at least seven seasons before they are ripped off.Even though 24 is a very nice movie and it tells a lot about what America is capable i think America is boasting its self to the world that no one can touch them and it can also attract more enemies around the world by also tempting them in so many ways.
As always, I have to wait a year or two before getting into watching a television series.
Even in Season Six where Bauer starts working with someone of this origin, it is not before we are filled in that he was once a terrorist himself.
There are times they could be captured before they commit some atrocity, or destroy some seemingly vital piece of evidence, but this doesn't happen.
Throughout its four seasons, 24 provides a cliff hanger at the end of most episodes to keep you attached and has provided some of the most unpredictable twists that I have ever seen, including the ultimate shocker at the end of the first season (which I won't go into because somebody may read this before watching the first season).
Here's why....  That annoying noise as the clock counts down, then two seconds of black screen, before that annoying noise again with a split screen.
If, when Jack goes to meet his CTU mentor in a darkened, deserted building, the guy got shot right before the was about to give him the key piece of "evidence".
As mentioned before he made one documentary in the seventies, shot sections of the movie Other Side of the Wind (never finished it), made a bunch of commercials and starred in horrible movies (apart from Catch 22).
The facts for her make things awful to bear, even under payment, and Moreau also gets to reveal a deep level of sexuality that gives Welles another challenge never done before for him- how to handle a sex scene (this includes a great exchange of dialog between Virgine and Paul about an earthquake).
The final revelation from the sailor, of course, brilliantly contradicts everything that came before.
Now some of you don't 'get-it'--2,000,000 wasted Phillipinoes, before and after they helped stop the Japanese invaders?
I need to see more movies of his before I can decide.
First thing you notice about this film is it's not like what you've seen before.
one has to admit that she is unlike any other to come before, or will probably come after.
Tommy Lee Jones stars like never before and Woody Harrelson with Juliette Lewis are also super.
Well, it doesn't take long before they kill everybody except one person, whose mission is to tell everybody that Mickey and Mallory Knox did it.
The movie could still be a brilliant satire of society/the media without going into such graphic detail -- it's been proved in cinema before that sometimes seeing less is better than gratuity.
It's had its greatest success on TV ('The Twilight Zone', 'Outer Limits', HBO's 'Tales From The Crypt'), and therefore every filmic variation will indeed suffer by the comparison of style and substance to what had been set before.
Sometimes it's a matter of attitude ("Tales From the 'Hood"), other times a matter of the talent before and behind the camera (the aforementioned British classics).
Sadly, the trailer that was shown on television before the film was released had all the funniest scenes from the movie in it, but even they weren't really weren't all that funny.
Geographical errors: Like for example on the segment Honey-Getter when the two guys Edward and Preshant get off the train, right before the lady Humera starts chasing them.
This is a poetic movie describing recollection of aging Henry Miller of his stay in Paris before the WWII.
The characters all fall flat -- there are minutes upon minutes before any humor is attempted, and when it is, it always falls flat.
No, before whites enslaved them, there was certainly no murder or rape among the Africans.
This point relates to the character at the start of the film before she goes back to the past.
Never before had an African writer/director ventured into such unknown territory.
The plot happens in 1973, a moment before the fascist dictatorship in Spain fell, and Spain re-joined the family of democratic nations.
It's been twelve years almost, and I've played this game from time to time since before adolescence.
The game creates a nice illusion of a big adventure before its rather over-the-top ending.
It's very interesting, and it puts forth a different light on suffrage, one that I had never been privy to before.
This should be required viewing for every American, before they claim to understand what the words 'freedom' and 'liberty' truly mean.
I didn't know the remarkable story behind the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment before I viewed "Iron Jawed Angels."
They are very familiar with the famous suffragettes who came before them, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
Director Duccio Tessari made the excellent Giallo 'The Bloodstained Butterfly' three years before this film, and the two share the same keenness to buck as many plotting trends as possible; as while this film firmly fits into the Giallo in terms of style, the plot takes the focus away from common Giallo elements such as sex and murder and puts it more on the characters and an intriguing plot involving amnesia.
He's being treated in a hospital, and it's not long before a mysterious stranger turns up and accuses Peter of double-crossing him.
Videogames had never interested me before 1991, being a Transformers buff.
I started looking for it on DVD literally 2 weeks before it was released and was thrilled to find it available.
Just before its release I recall seeing the trailer and being won over by the scene in the hospital where Nikki begins eating the flowers.
First of all, I saw the preview of the movie before it came out and it had the scene where Nicky silently urges Pammy to run away with her from the hospital, to The Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated".
Then I bought the 2 LP soundtrack before the movie came out and listened to it over and over.
People who love:  - depictions of New York City's Times Square (and New York City, for that matter) as gritty-as-you please and before it was remade as a family theme park  - Tim Curry (see him here as a late-night radio DJ speaking to nocturnal urban denizens in verse from the center of Times Square)  - movies about youthful rebellion that are half tongue-in-cheek  will get a kick out of this movie.
But, just because the last 2 minutes before credits is great, I wouldn't say that justifies BLOCKBUSTER rental prices.
Also, the film deserves no better than a 4 because some excellent dance scenes with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson were in the film but they were cut before it was released!!
It's great when the school girls stumble across the old satanic temple and find the book on black magic spells and then they start to form a coven and try to summon up a demon and then one of their friends tries to stop them before they offer a human sacrifice, it's just really good.
However, it doesn't help having my own expectations before watching it.
I had never heard of it before, but I enjoy Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, and William H. Macy on screen, they're great actors and then I read on the summary "Office Space meets Taxi Driver", lol, I had to see this movie.
The people he despised are now his best friends, including the office bully and the office slut, who would have never given the time of day before.
It's the same tired 'this is all a hallucinatory dream sequence in the moment before death' crap that ruins so many films that almost make a statement, and then, at the last minute, confess to being delusions.
Having embezzled money from the night club he manages, Adolph Menjou must now replace the money before the auditors arrive or face prison.
Looking at Tyrone Power and Loretta Young (here before she became Attila the Nun), it's impossible not to see why they were a popular screen couple.
"He Was a Quiet Man" answers the musical question: "Now maniacs will think twice before going crazy."
Bob Maconel (the hilariously disguised Christian Slater), a despondent office worker, decides that he is going to perform a murderous rampage at his work office, yet before he can do so, a fellow maniac beats him to it.
I haven't seen it in years, might have been on Bravo before they went edited and commercial...
You stand before your future or past and you can't link to it.
I don't watch trailers or read reviews before watching something new, so I had no idea what to expect.
However, Lynch goes much further here stylistically than he has before, making very effective use of digital's simplicity (even as his montage and musical mixing reaches new levels of intensity) and making what is surely his most detailed and intricate film yet.
But then again, we saw new camera angles we hadn't see before.
The idea comes before the reason behind the idea.
Lynch's new film, INLAND EMPIRE, is similar to his other work, but unlike anything he's ever done, or I've ever seen before.
Have you seen me before?")
As the scenes slowly build up, giving us reference, we start to wonder where we saw that character, who said that line before, what location fits into what part of the sequence and how, leading up to the Laura Dern quote I used before.
The film is also very self-conscious as I said before, and also makes many subtle (and not so) pokes at the audience.
God knows they both need to boost their movie hype....come on guys get this guy into a good movie before it's too late.
This film is set in the early days of television when all shows were filmed live before an audience.
I understand that the O'Toole character was based on Errol Flynn, even though he had died before this movie supposedly is set.
"I played before an audience once!"
When he is assigned to appear in a live TV show as guest star, his reputation for booze gets him assigned to the care of Benjy Stone (MARK LINN-BAKER), a Brooklyn kid whose job it is to protect O'Toole from further exploits with the bottle so that he can perform as scheduled before a live audience.
From the first shot of him, waking up embracing what he thinks is an unremembered lover from the drunken night before, and staring in bewilderment and near terror as he realizes that it's not a girl at all but a furry THING (a teddy bear), to the last shot of him as he accepts an ovation from the studio audience in probably the only truly serene joy he's had in decades, he is utterly perfect and utterly compelling.
When the series were on TV, I had never been to Australia before.
I used to sit at home in my room every Sunday evening just before 7.
A lot of people don't know that, besides being a great rapper, Shakur is very gifted and actually acted before rapping.
Like the films of its time, the hip hop culture is blossoming before our eyes with every frame.
We're supposed to believe that before the movie Bishop was down and then all of a sudden at the beginning he turns into some cold, calculating guy willing to murder his friends?
And he got killed before he got a chance to raise up out.
I spent first 20 minutes itching to turn it off since the animation style didn't seem all that pleasant, but then things just kept happening and before I knew it I was really immersed in it.
I am no fan of anime (I wasn't before Mind Game), because the ones I have seen before seemed either too violent (Akira) or difficult to appreciate because of the Japanese cultural peculiarities (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke).
The pace of the movie picks up and slows in parts, before building up to its thunderous and (literally) exhausting climax.
This movie was the 'Da BomB'..... a bigger bomb than the one that was dropped in Hiroshima...Worst movie ever watched ....will think ten times before watching any Sunny Deol Movie...
It is heartbreaking to discover that he was executed weeks before the liberation by the Allies, and that no memorial exists to commemorates him to this day.
Especially impressive is the way Brandauer as director managed to show the atmosphere of Nazi-Germany immediately before the war, and atmosphere of fear and mistrust that forced Elser to go to extremes in hiding his plans.
Clearly intended for a quick theatrical play-off before heading straight to video, DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART wastes a terrific premise and top-notch cast.
He then has a nightmarish run through a patch of woods before coming upon an 80's Arena Rock Metal band playing "When The Ax Does Fall" or whatever it's called.
Wyman is also assisted by a police officer ("Ordinary" Smith) and her parents, one of whom is played by the wonderful Alistair Sim, not long before he played "Scrooge" in a Christmas Carol.
Alfred Hitchcock made this highly enjoyable and under-rated divertissment in 1950 after a run of glum movies in the second half of the forties but before embarking on his richest period in the fifties.
What makes it so enjoyable is the wonderful cast, which was mostly unknown to me before.
Great use of silent sequences, close ups, slow motion, black humor, and mood lighting, Hitch's most underrated talkie (Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film), this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools.
I had never heard of this movie before and had low expectations.
We never made it through the first 20 minutes before we had to shut it off.
See it before they cast Nicholas Cage in a remake!
When I first saw this marvelous film in 1999 in Russia, I could not believe my own eyes - in fact, I had never seen a single Icelandic film before that, this was the first and what a great sensation!
The story tells about 3 friends living in hamburg the night before one of them will go to a ship to Africa and later singapore.
The last night together for three friends in Hamburg, before one of them will board a ship to Africa.
Not only is it the perfect conclusion to the chaotic night before it, which is in itself a metaphor for the inherent turmoil of close friendships, it is enough to make you want to go out and phone every friend you haven't spoken to in years to find out how they are doing.
When you try to make a Fincher's like, well you put all your guts in it, or do it Ã  la classical way, we even have difficulty in being moved by the loud failure at the box office, at least the producers will think twice before giving money to Berry, especially when he tries to put on life a story so stupid.
"Petulia" (based on the novel by John Haase, "Me and the Arch Kook Petulia") touches neuralgic issues of difficult times in the United States in an oblique manner, not to avoid them, but because its center is the title character played by Julie Christie (excellent as usual): hippie culture, racial conflicts, Vietnam, drugs, illegal immigration, the intrusion of technology in the bedroom, and middle-class betrayal before the reign of so-called "savage capitalism", all appear as variables in the drama of a young woman abused by her husband.
Carnivorous robots in outer space that self-mutate and multiply underground before annihilating everyone on a forgotten planet in the future... does it sound like the recipe for a REAL turkey?
The performances are first-rate all the way, including Richard Chamberlin, who has never been this good before or since, and Joseph Cotton, who speaks volumes in his brief scenes.
I had never watched any of Colin Nutley's pictures before this one, and I can safely say that I will never deliberately watch another one.
I read all the IMDb comments before actually watching this movie and thought I'd be disappointed, but having watched it I can't help but give this a 10/10!
I've never wanted to sleep at the cinema before, but this time I actually longed to close my eyes and take a nap (I didn't, though).
One of the films you must see, before you die!
He never played a role like this one before, and he certainly does it very well, in my opinion it would be worth his first Oscar this year.
I wasn't familiar with Chris Gardner's story before this movie.
This movie doesn't get on a soapbox, not even for a second--it just tells a real-life story that owns you before you know it.
I rented this DVD partly because it's a thriller (and I'm really into those at the moment) and partly because it's an independent New Zealand film that I hadn't heard of before.
Hidden did the film festival circuit last year and won several international awards (including Best Feature at the Harlem International Film Festival, the Rebelfest Director's Award and the FAIF Best Director Award) before its limited local release last February, but it's on DVD that most of New Zealanders will get to know it.
You're about ten minutes in before you hear a single line of dialogue, and the first twenty minutes or so seems to consist mainly of people running around and hiding in the bush (actually, there's a great deal of that throughout the movie).
The "surprise" at the end isn't terribly original Â though it pays to remember that this film was shot in 2001 and spent three-and-a-half years in troublesome post-production before being released, so it's kind of coming in after its time.
Another thing as well, most of the actors I had never heard of before, I think it might have been only two people from shortland street (wow!).
It's up to nerdy scientist Dr. Iane Thorne (blandly played by Marvin Howard) to figure out a way to stop it before it's too late.
Writer/director Harry Essex, who also wrote the scripts for the classic 50's fright features "It Came from Outer Space" and "The Creature from the Black Lagoon," pukes forth a 50's style micro-budget clunker that boasts all the necessary bad movie vices to qualify as a real four-star stinker: the flat acting from a lame no-name cast (flash-in-the-pan 70's drive-in flick starlet Maria De Aragon in particular just takes up space as fetching love interest heroine Jeanne), sluggish pacing, ragged editing, rough, grainy cinematography by Robert Caramico, meandering narrative, a roaring, overwrought score by Robert Freeman, several ludicrous touches (the fireball stalks people before it kills them!
It's not long before someone realizes that a picture Kent took at the party just might show the murderer, that Kent's former girlfriend wants some money, that Nate Girard is willing to pay big for what he says he has to have, that the cops think Nate is in the middle, that Meg has some sort of side deal, that Kent will go all out to help Meg, that...a lot keeps moving around in this mystery played with a light touch.
But before i move on i got a bone to pick with somebody who said Tombstone was much better because Russel played the kind of Earp that "we imagine".
Like what has been said before, this movie shouldn't be compared too much to Tombstone, since they carried different story angles.
I will say that I saw this film before I saw Tombstone but I have to say, upon further review, this is so far the superior film it's not even funny.
He was around for quite some time before and after that famous gunfight at the OK Corrall.
I learned that Morgan Earp told Allie Earp something like, "I want to leave Tombstone and never come back" moments before he was shot to death.
Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorfulÂ Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each otherÂ  In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gamblerÂ Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignityÂ Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealistÂ Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosisÂ  In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchiefÂ He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best momentsÂ His character has his own form of abilityÂ Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosisÂ Kilmer, in "Tombstone," never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degreeÂ   Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need ariseÂ The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurysÂ The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the CorralÂ  Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film "Tombstone" does not even touchÂ While "Tombstone" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondÂThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old ageÂ   The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well toldÂ But we always remember Ford's "My Darling Clementine" for its other qualitiesÂfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the wayÂ This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magicÂ  "My Daring Clementine" was a film of touchesÂFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors danceÂ  Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriageÂ Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous "Westerners" of all time...
Hopefully you didn't put one in the chamber yourself and end your life before this point in the movie.
There possibly has never been a film that could deliver a high amount of intensifying power like this before, even outweighing its minimal plot and graphic violence.
"Combat Shock" stars Ricky Giovinazzo as Frankie Dunlan,a depressed Vietnam veteran living a meaningless life in Staten Island.With no money,no job and little hope,Frankie takes to the streets,shocked by the depravity of the neighborhood-of childhood friends turned junkies and prostitutes.The viewer watches Frankie meander through his bleak existence before a bloody and nihilistic finale that is not for the squeamish.
Fortunately for progression's sake the Mafioso had the sense to read the script the night before.
The boys hormones were raging more than ever and we were wondering if we would get laid before we died in VietNam, and we were hoping that that oh so sexy teacher would be willing to give us some "extracurricular instruction".
Okay, some of the credit for this most enjoyably sly & funny little gem goes to Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, who, for this film went where he'd never gone before, bringing along James Doohan, aka, Scotty with him on this marvelous adolescent comedy sex fantasy/murder mystery.
Just like he was in every other picture before Pretty Maids, he's the man girls want and the man boys want to be, but here it's darker and more cynical version of himself than he ever let people see on the screen.
As proved before in other movies, Ken Maynard is not much of an action star, as his fight scenes sure are flat.
For more of Cecelia before her Andy Hardy movies, check out the serial "The Lost Jungle" (1934) and the John Wayne "Riders of Destiny" (1933).
Then this would be the last before last seduction, right?
Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.
and bloodily exterminates the remaining members of the groupÂwhich transpires to be merely a delirious fantasy Â one final folly enacted in his own head, and given away really by being intercut with snippets from scenes that have gone on before!
In fact her recommendation was so good, I got the film from Amazon before I'd even seen it and as usual she was so right!
The scene that she felt the need to separate her stuff apart from her partner's right before her partner's nephew arrival certainly reflects how lesbians are practically nonexistent at that time.
This takes place right after Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones and right before Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith.
Each short is extremely action packed, which makes watching each micro-episode one after another a little exhausting, since you rarely even get a chance to catch your breath before the next section of action begins.
Speaking of structure, Clone Wars is divided into two parts: Volume I (takes place some time after the Battle of Geonosis) and Volume II (Chapter 21 ultimately concludes the story arc of Attack of the Clones, the rest takes place some time before the events of Revenge of the Sith).
If you (especially newcomers) are completely confused with the chronological storyline, it's best that you watch everything from the original trilogy and the first two episodes of the prequel trilogy before tackling with both the Microseries and the upcoming movie.
It feels good, but before you know it, it's gone!
It is full of stupid jokes, as noted before in the vein of the naked gun and Airplane.
It had some very South-park like jokes years before there was a south park.
But before the action comes funny noise from the elevator.
And new side missions, like going to Capital Autos in Harwood to sell cars or taking pictures of people at famous Liberty sites before their flights.
Yes, 80 minutes, I left before the damn thing ended, I had to.
I'll certainly be thinking twice before approaching another Sandler film.
If what happens before his flight seems outlandish, once he is on the jet, he spends his time in the cargo hold with two fluffy dogs named "Scrappy" and "Coco."
Veiled behind the facade of a retarded accent, a stupid haircut, and a constant beating of dick jokes, narrow minded cultural references, and pretty much anything else that would annoy anyone with a shred of dignity, Zohan expresses aspirations of becoming a hair stylist {in which he will make people s' hair "silky smooth"(which he repeats at least SEVEN times before the movie ends and you stop wishing to stick your head in an oven for watching this hideous abomination), which is another stupid idiosyncrasy of every single Adam Sandler movie in the past nine years, which is including a "subtle" reference to one of his older movies, which the writers apparently think is cute}.
So, I knew full well what I was getting myself into before I paid my ten dollars and a Coke the size of Zohan's crotch.
I'd never seen Ken in anything else before, and he quite simply blew me away.
it's the sort of quiet moments never seen in DTV action films, including a great dinner sequence where Nick and his men relax and unwind, a kind of calm before the storm.
It's not long before bad things start to happen to the group as they begin to realise that evil lies within the house!!!
There are a number of biblical references, and it turns out that John's father is a pastor, although John himself is filled with doubt, especially after the death of his wife before the movie started.
One of the major plot points was for the aliens to find children (in the present time) that could "hear" them and take them to another world before the cataclysmic end of our planet.
John immediately jumps to work picking apart the numbers and finds that all huge disasters in the last 50 years have been accurately documented before they even occurred, but there are three upcoming catastrophe's the Lucinda's paper predicts.
It makes a change from the typical ending where the resourceful and virtuous heroes crawl out from their clever hiding places to cry and clutch each other joyfully before skipping off to rebuild their shattered lives.
And of course it means knowing that you aren't going to get your money back even before you ask.
Christians don't believe that aliens will show up just before the end of the world to take some precious few to "start over".
Nicholas Cage's movies have lately been a lot of action flicks that may or may not seem like movies we've all seen before.
It doesn't bore you, it doesn't make you feel like you've seen it before, and yet you have a comfortability with it that intrigues you throughout.
So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!
He attacks a bystander, throwing a couple of punches before walking quickly away.
But he can only keep it up for so before it all comes out.
Lodge Kerrigan made two very good movies before "Keane"; they were "Clean, Shaven" and "Claire Dolan".
After the movie I went into the washroom and I was shocked to see that my face, neck, and chest were all blotchy and red, I've never experienced such a strong response from viewing a film before.
Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me "What do you think happens to him?"
I have never had a film reach me like this before -- in this way and so deeply.
Maybe because I've had jobs like that before : the sense of "us vs. them" and the wacky little things that the characters did to get through the day to 5:00.
However, it takes a while before you remember that they are both from the same stock with the same bad ways.I'm sure he didn't have a big budget, regardless the movie seemed to be very professional.
Do as you want, but before doing it, you may consider to check into a nearby hospital.
And if you are so curious that you decide to watch it against your better judgment, don't eat before doing so.
The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn't think it could ever be as bad as it actually was.
No, the worst travesty is not that I spent $6.75 on this movie, but that I will never be the same person I was before.
I never have before, but this movie was a waste of my time, the 11 bucks I spent on the ticket, and the five bucks I spent on popcorn/ candy.
Perhaps if you've never actually seen a satire before you will get a few chuckles out of this, but for everyone else this is just a tired & recycled complete waste of time.
When she first sees Conner (Matthew McConaughey)at his brother's wedding rehearsal, she comes across as a nagging wife to him before the audience even knows they have a history.
I was sick of the whole story before the first ghost even showed up.
I watched the sequel before watching this original.
Who would forget the early nights before Christmas, when young Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) receives the cute furball Gizmo as a present fro his dad (Hoyt Axton)?
And finally, who would forget the mischief and mayhem the night before Christmas, and the endless fun at every viewing?
Children, and wives depart many times before his life comes to an end, he seems to blame god for all his misfortune, and god does win in the end.
If I had any gripe with the series it was probably the absolute bad luck that befalls Mr Eastwick throughout his life seems to be never-ending.As smart as the ending is,I couldn't help but feel gutted for him at the way events had panned out and hoped it would give a happy ending.You will just have to watch all 8 hours of it if you have never seen it before to find out what happens.
It was my first introduction to Hugo Weaving, way before the Matrix.
now here is a movie martial arts fans will definitely enjoy.i wish all of jeff wincott's movies were as action packed as this one is.i don't think you will be surprised to find out that the plot is nothing you haven't seen before in other b movies.but who cares about the plot in a martial arts movie.all us fans want to see is nonstop martial arts fighting and that is what you get in this movie.jeff wincott is awesome in this movie showing off some good high kicks to peoples skulls.this movie and martial law 2 are the best movies that jeff wincott has starred in that i have seen.this movie isn't as action packed as martial outlaw 2 but any martial arts movie fans will still really like this movie
I don't know what they did to hack Activision off, but before Web of Shadows gets anywhere near alpha, Activision needs to get the two lead programmers from SM2 back.
Unlike the first two games where we see the detailed and sometimes emotional transformations into their villainous persona's such as Norman Osborn into Green Goblin or Octavius into Doc Ock- the villains here appear in the blink of an eye and are long gone before you realize it.
This story is changed before the fights with Sandman, and so the main movie fights are not until the very end and don't take very long to complete.
After a series of accidents Gismo multiply's and the cute furry offspring soon become little green beasts that terrorise the town, leaving Billy and his girlfriend (Phoebe Cates) to find a way to get rid of these gremlins, before everyone winds up dead.
So I was ready to give up before it was halfway through.
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
All in all I can definitely recommend this for horror buffs, especially if you are looking for something more than just "Hi, I'm Candy, I'm a teenager, and I like to go down to basements and get naked before I get killed by the big scary serial killer" kindda movies.
I never found myself intrigued by the monsters save the very beginning, never found myself laughing, and never once said "Wow i have never seen that kind of death before!"
The gore succeeds at times, but as I said before overall it feels forced and given the attempts at comedy and character development, doesn't feel like a gore horror.
The actual mogwai (what the gremlins are before they transform) are adorable.
For one thing I'd like to know just what Fonda had done before that made him a three time loser in the first place before the action of the story takes place.
The screenplay is visibly influenced by Bonnie and Clyde, who died on 23 May 1934, ambushed in their getaway car - therefore less than three years before the release date of this film.
There may not be a more ironic scene in film than henry fonda's confrontation with the priest at prison's gate...or a more pungent line than his 'they made me a murderer'.....or a more fatalistic ending than you have here...the point is that the best ingredients of film noir are present in a film made 10 years before film noir's peak...that's how far ahead fritz lang's vision was...sure he went on to make 'the big heat' and scarlet street' among others...but 'you only live once' is his starkest glimpse at man's small place in a vast, oppressive society where good intentions are powerless in a black universe.
Have you ever before heard of such a thing at all?
A long time before the emergence of objective diagnostic criteria in psychiatry and owing nothing to either that or Game Theory.
Time travel was a myth before "Back to the Future," which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents.
This is also heightened at times just before a crucial moment when the film halts and a message appears to warn you about the following scenes, very effective.
And it's not like I get freaked out easily by movies or don't watch enough of them--I watched The Shining the night before, and Alien Abduction at least equals it in suspense and intensity.
A minor triumph in independant cinema, for a tv film, I was thoroughly entertained, and even scared on occasion, which I don't think I actually have been before when watching a movie.
"Gremlins" was such a big hit in 1984 that it got re-released back in theaters the following year before it made its debut on video.
If you stumble upon this on TV at 3AM and you cant sleep, then you might find yourself getting through half of it before you get bored and fall asleep.
We've used videocams before.
The only piece of information I had before watching the movie that it is movie shot by a teenager during thanksgiving dinner, during which some aliens attack the house.
2) They picked a guy who actually had a filmography (meaning he had acted before in noticeable shows).
Now this came before blair witch so dont say its a rip off of the film.
I had never heard of this movie before and began watching it a little belatedly as it was on TV tonight.
Also, I know this came out before BWP but one of them must of borrowed off the other.
Now in 2007 i watched it a second time and before seeing it i saw people on the IMDb website saying words like it's superb or excellent and and thought to myself it must be as good as I remembered.
That phone number before the credits just helps to keep you part of the film.
I must declare my admiration for Hogan before teeing off with this review.
In short, this may not be the proper first episode of the series, but given the standalone nature of the original Trek scripts, it works pretty well as an introduction to Gene Roddenberry's seminal TV universe, a place "where no man had gone before".
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this film I suggest you see "South Park" and maybe even Borat, two of the funniest movies ever created.
I read positive reviews of this movie before heading to a Boulder video store and grabbing it off the shelf.
This is a straight, nonsensical comedy starring 2, or should 3 (Nancy) actors I have never witnessed before.
I saw "I'm Telling You For The Last Time" before I actually got into the series itself (I was young when it first aired and so now I am feasting off reruns).
The fact that I had not seen nearly every Seinfeld episode (which now I have see most of) made this bit of stand up even funnier as I had never heard most jokes before.
Movie at a special sneak preview not too long ago, and I was absolutely blown away about how funny, edgy and flat-out different this film is from anything I have ever seen before.
It is so so funny, I had to pause it sometimes because of laughing so very hard, before moving forward.
The Hispanic porno salesman is one of the best characters I have seen in any movie, and I have never seen a sex doll be a major important character before.
The movie is able to link reality with fiction, like nothing I have ever experienced before, and it does it all with twisted, edgy, provocative humor.
Also in the this movie he plays the killer, like he did as well 2 and 5 years before in the Columbo movies "Columbo: Publish or Perish" and the Steven Spielberg directed "Columbo: Murder by the Book".
Besides those two, the movie also features Robert Loggia, before his days of fame.
This tightly handled low-budget French / Italian co-production is an improbable, but an oddly bold and stimulating teaser that seems straight forward at first, then suddenly it leads you down many knotty paths (with Hitchcock shades) before breaking out the truth of the matter.
I think Bronson must have been cracking them before he threw them...
I hope and pray to the DVD gods that this gets a nice release before too long.
I don't believe there's been anything like it before or since.
Because it turns out that visiting American Paul Nicholas is really falling for bride Susan Brooks and he's got a week to make his case before the real groom Jeremy Clyde returns.
He got drunk with some mates the night before and got is...put somewhere personal.
Are we to see a more obsessed Gibbs, like he was before they found out who Ari was?!
I was a big fan of Michael Wheatherly before and so I wanted to see him again.
Michael Weatherly (Anthony DiNozzo), he used to be a former homicide detective before he joined NCIS.
Part of the new team is agent Lee who we have see before, I have read on some websites that fans wont be watching if Gibbs has a new team, the team will be back together,the producers are just making it more unmissable they know that it would kill the show if Tony, Ziva and Mcgee were written out.
He died before I got to know him.
And, as I said before, the TV is fulled.
Directed by Matt Tauber, who also wrote the screenplay with Grieg, it has a fascinating, if at times disconcerting, format of quick scenes flashed before our eyes like simultaneous conversations - and some of the power of the film is piecing those snapshots together as the film ends.
While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the sÃ©ance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...
Yes, there's some Harry Potter here, but I think Harry was a couple of years after and Cinderella (for that matter) was a couple of years before, if you're going to get into who ripped off whom.
Hopefully it will claim it's rightful place on the bottom 100 before long.
I've never seen anything Rose McGowan had done before this, besides her minor role in Scream, so I was unaware of her acting capabilities.
Bruce Campbell(again playing Ash) and his girlfriend wend their way over the river and through the woods to some cabin in the remotest part of nowhere - where only weeks before an Archaeologist(something like that) and his wife were staying decoding the book of the dead(Necrominicon(?)).
Does Ash realize that he's been here before, or hasn't he?
Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through.
Anyway, I've seen nothing quite like it before or since.
Henrik and Anna have to clear many hurdles, some of their own making, before they marry and move to a forbidding town in northern Sweden where they gracefully undertake their duties as the new religious leaders.
The contention here is the story behind Jodha, and the various names she goes by with different retellings, and that is put up front even before the opening credits start to roll.
There are a couple of nice action set pieces ranging from full scale war with the clashing of two opposing sides (the elephants were a great bonus, trust me), to a duel which turns out to be a courtship ritual, something not new since both Hrithik and Aishwarya challenged each other before (though on the basketball court), with the latter quite well versed in swordplay given her earlier role in The Last Legion, and one featuring what I thought took a leaf out of the battle between Hector and Achilles in Troy.
Rahman is top notch as usual, and dances here happen naturally as part of the narrative flow, with the first song coming out only just before the hour mark.
she looks ethereal Â a compliment she has heard a trillion times before.
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
Elsewhere, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, is soon to be working in a movie with the "Mahatama," Ben Kingsley, with whom she has worked with before, in an English version of "Taj Mahal."
I'd only seen this movie once before, when I was about 12 or 13.
Emmanuelle Beart's Milady de Winter gave a fine performance but I only wish they would have made this film ten to fifteen years before.
A film that should be owned by any Musketeer fan and I can only hope that the new Three Musketeers trilogy which includes a prequel on the Musketeers and Milady's lives before D'Artagnan that will be coming to the big screen in 2011 will be worthy of such a great novel.
The background for all this is the 30s and 40s in Budapest, Hungary, the Nazi threat right before your entrance door.
But also Erika MarozÃ¡n and Stefano Dionisi, which I haven't seen in another movie before, do everything to grant them an Academy Award.
Rolf SchÃ¼bel's first feature (he did documentaries before) uses backdrop of Nazi-occupied Budapest to deliver a meaningful "menage-a-quatre", wrapped in a free interpretation of creation of famous suicide hymn "Gloomy Sunday".
No, it's just pure stupidity that as a director you allow your film to premiere at such a big event, with a packed house filled with celebrities, but you can't seem to make/take time to check your print first before screening.
The plot is hokey and had been done a hundred times before, but the film is kept from self-destructing by the star power on display here.
Were given clues all throughout the movie of Charlie's identity and who's behind his murderous actions with a special focus of the clock, by David's bed, striking 2:06:AM and glimpses of some kind of party that David and his late wife Alison, Amy Irving, attended just before she was found dead from silting her wrists.
Long before the "Harry Potter" books and movies arrived, this somewhat similar concoction from producer Steven Spielberg and director Barry Levinson came and went in theaters.
Rather than dealing intelligently with this sensitive topic, the film uses it as window dressing for a squalid little horror film that feels like a thousand other thrillers that have come before it.
The country setting feels eerie from the moment David and Emily arrive, and Fanning's outstanding performance has her gradually changing from a cute kid to a scary little pseudo-Goth monster more slyly than native New Yorker slipping into the subway car before you to grab the last seat.
It is worth noting before watching that little of what you see playing out on the screen may be actually happening, and there may be something more sinister at work that is never fully stated in the film.
Anyways, this movie goes from okay to flat out ridiculous in no time at all, and once the big "surprise" comes at the climax of the film, you feel as if you have seen this movie somewhere before.
Hide and Seek lacks imagination anyways because the viewer is asked to be confounded by a series of disconnected scare tactics such as things jumping of closets, the last minute awareness of the culprit before the death of an unsuspecting victim, and above all, modern horror-thriller filmmakers determined to creep you out with some weirdo kid.
Erica Durance stars as Carina, a bride-to-be on a bachelorette vacation in the Caribbean just before her wedding.
Ms. Ross was the second (or third since Cicely Tyson was also nominated that year for Sounder) African-American to be nominated an Oscar for Best Actress after Dorothy Dandridge's previous nod some 18 years before.
For instance some of the sequences and moments in this movie really reminded me mostly of the first two Indiana Jones movies, which he already had made before this movie.
As a singer, She never before or since has sounded as good.
Many music critics and students agree that, before Billie, popular singers approached songs the same way that classical and opera singers always had; they sang the notes exactly as written, with no deviation from the written melody, no improvisation and, consequently, with little emotion or emphasis on feeling.
Remember this is the Thirties before the days of woman's liberation and most women only thought in certain parameters.
I, too, wish to beg forgiveness... for I have never seen Ms. Harding before tonight.Now, I HAVE to see everything she has done;and TCM is showing another 1933 film of hers-"The Right To Romance"-1933 with Robert Young at 5:00AM---she plays a plastic surgeon with marital woes with an ex-boyfriend involved.
at 5:15PM.... Director of "Double...",John Cromwell,who also directed the CLASSIC, "Of Human Bondage"-1934-which will be shown at 6:30PM- so you can see his skill...   After that- a very 'touchy' subject-abortion-will be confronted with the PRE-code film,"Men in White"-1934-just before the 'code' was enforced.
Sherlock Holmes proceeds to tell Watson all about himself before they have exchanged hellos.
Well, they're already discussing divorce on the honeymoon and decide to wait six months before they get it.
Not that the idle rich in the Depression years had it so good, of course, as they apparently had to cut back on the caviar before dinner at least once in a while.
I had never heard of this movie before, and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
The wonderful William Powell one year before playing Nick Charles!
I would recommend any parent see this movie before they let their kids see it.
It follows a formula we've seen before of inspiration and tragedy, all just to get a few cheap tugs at the heartstrings.
where is the nationalistic campaign of us before that goes this way??
Thankfully, it got the acclaim it truly deserves when it won both the grand prix and children's jury prize -- a feat never before achieved -- in the 2004 Berlin Film Festival.
When I watched it I realized I had seen part of it before but that was before I was a Vincent D'Onofrio fan.
I particularly liked Emma Thompson's entrance Â the camera zooming towards the manor from several different directions before she storms the screen.
The children are unruly and their father has his own stresses of desperately searching for a wife before his mean-spirited great aunt cuts off his allowance and everything is falling apart at the seams...until Nanny McPhee enters the house to sort things out.
The children also deserve much praise, especially when you consider most of them are not only very young but had never acted before.
I thought hard before giving a rating for this film, but couldn't find one thing to stop it from being absolutely perfect.
Jose Giovanni (born Joseph Damiani) is perhaps best known as a writer of some renown in France, in films like Melvilles Le DeuxiÃ¨me soufflÃ©, and Classe tous risques (1960) his writings usually centering on crime, an area he knew only too well, as he was on death row in France from 1948-1956 before gaining a Presidential pardon.
This is the type of goofy, sexy romp Cinemax used to show on weekends in the 80's (before they switched to soft porn).
But lest the grandfather forget, the captain puts on his helmet before he takes leave, rupturing this temporality of common ground, propagated by the universal human need for art.
One thing leads to another and before long they're resorting to stabbing a cold social worker and burying a wealthy land developer alive in wet cement!
From Ruth McDevitt to Ian Wolfe you have seen them before in many supporting roles, here you get to see them lead.
This movie shows that my strategy of knowing only stars and genre about a movie before seeing it, actually pays off.
Sure, if you really try and think about all the possibilities you will have figured it out before you've seen half the movie, but be honest: which movie has surprises for the seasoned movie goer?
It is very unfortunate that Lindsey Lohan had a few bad incidences in her personal life almost immediately before the national release of this movie.
I gave it a 7 because even though it lacks in some departments some of the torture scenes were new and ones i've never seen presented on film before.
Acting was very good from most of the cast, as i mentioned before this is my first Linsday Lohan's movie i saw and i thought she did a good job.
She had done this in the parent trap movie but never before has she pulled off such a great performance.
Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, a pretty teen who becomes the latest victim of a serial killer who has been abducting girls and cutting off their limbs before leaving them to die.
Things pieced together fairly nicely before anything became too much of a problem, but there were some holes that needed filling.
This'll be on DVD before you know it anyway.
I had heard the story of Charles and Camilla before, but this movie brought it home to me.
When they first meet they both know that they have something special, but before long when Charles is off in the navy she gets engaged with hardly any thought.
You want Diana to run away when she confronts him about her fears of his adultery before the wedding, but you know she isn't going to.
The movies clearly shows that she was accepted before she made the alterations.
I mean, it's better than most movies I've seen before.
She was like my idol in life before.
Throughout the school year their relationship takes several turns, before arriving at an absurd ending in which all problems are magically solved by Sandy getting a makeover and becoming "cool."
America is portayed as a drug-infested (only true if you live in the ghetto) land where strange men constantly approach women on the streets and try to get them to have sex with them, and which permits men to rape their fiancees before they marry.
Ganga's father agrees to the proposal and soon comes Arjun, Kishorilal's faithful nephew, who is also a good friend of Rajiv, to organise the engagement before Rajiv, who's never been to India, comes to see his bride.
Arjun and Ganga befriend each other, but the real trouble starts when Ganga is taken to LA to live with Kishorilal's huge NRI family before marriage.
In fact, I had just quoted one of the songs at work the night before I discovered that this was running on my local cable "on demand" for free!
In her teens she would get up at 4 am daily to run to the Vienna ice rink (Wiener Eislaufverein) to practice her school figures before school -- and this at a time when Austrian skaters could practice only in the cold season as there were no indoor skating halls as there were in the US and Canada.
My parents Eva Pawlik and Rudi Seeliger could take part only in German domestic competitions; they became German youth champions, each as a single skater and together as a couple (this was before Kekesy/Kiraly who went on to win the Olympic Silver Medal in 1948 and the 1949 World Championship).
Some months before my birth in 1962, my mother ended her skating and became the first female sportscaster of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF).
If you haven't seen much of their material before then this would be a great place to start.
He just keeps rambling on about freezing him, and then it turns out that the fire extinguisher is empty, because Colin had been mucking around with it before the show.
"Juste avant la nuit" ,though inferior to "la femme infidÃ¨le" "que la bÃªte meure","le boucher" or "la rupture" boasted a wonderful cast:Bouquet and Audran.Here,what have we?Sandrine Bonnaire,totally incredible as a doctor,Bulle Ogier,a grotesque matron,and Antoine de Caunes ,an "actor" generally cast in some ponderous French comedies.Fortunately,he dies half an hour before the end,what a relief!
Matthieu Chabrol turns out another of his identikit numbers - start off classical piano, add a bit of dissonance, then a bit of pseudo-comic artful jauntiness before collapsing back into classical piano mode - that adds nothing but tedious familiarity to the proceedings.
There's a slow start, the first ten minutes or so featuring Franklin Pangborn as the Fuller's landlord and his battles with the Fuller family dog isn't very good, but it's not long before Benny and the material start to work the situation for real yuks.
"George Washington Slept Here" combines a wonderful amount of early Jack Benny comedy before his usual "Tight Wad" stereo type and American History.
The second thing to remember is that Jack Benny did all of his scenes with Percy Kilbride (later known as Pa Kettle) on days in which he had gotten no sleep the night before.
When the director threatened to remove Benny if he continued this, then Benny decided to stay up all night before he had any scenes with Kilbride because then he was so exhausted that he just didn't care.
When the wrestler shows up in her town, she decides to take the chance, not before ripping the wall where she can see Blanca's image.
That's the art style as a whole with powers and such that you would have already seen it all before and kids would have as well.
If somebody thinks part of this has to do with reality, that person is wrong, I think the writer and director should have read at least a school text before making a film like this.
In essence, he signed his ticket before he departed Spain, promising the world he could never deliver, pursuing a pathological indulgence to satisfy his superior ego.
Carl Orff was a good choice as well), some beautiful cinematography and sets (some scenes almost take my breath away, like when The Sword is thrown into the water), imagination (I've never seen intercourse in full armor before), and a great story.
It also covered the story of King Arthur better than any other film before or since.
Excalibur, Starring Nigel Terry, Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, Cheri Lunghi, Nicholas Clay, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne, Robert Addie, Katrine Boorman, Paul Geoffrey, Clive Swift Director John Boorman, 1981 Director John Boorman and screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg worked on adapting the centuries old Thomas Malory epic "Le Morte D'Arthur" into a stunning, intensely dramatic movie masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before.
Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400's by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled La Morte d'Arthur ("The Death of Arthur") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare.
By the 20th century, theatrical adaptations began appearing as well, including "Knights of the Round Table" (1953), Disney's "The Sword in the Stone" (1963), and the musical "Camelot" by Lerner and Lowe which was possibly the most popular rendition of the story before "Excalibur".
The music is stirring (it uses "O Fortuna" from Carima Burana before this had become a cliche).
This is a drama/Horror with a little more depth then your average horror..I have seen this movie a few times on cable and saw the screener before it came out.
The kids died long before they got to that age and it was ALL a hallucination of a crazy bag lady.
But technology gone awry rears its ugly head in the form of self-manufacturing killing devices known as the screamers named for their high pitched sound just before they slice and dice humans.
A mixture of critical pieces of disastrous events flash before Danika's eyes as well as flashbacks to some years back when her children were young.
An amazing script and creative camera angles and lighting makes this movie worth seeing a few times before you can fully understand it's beauty.
Well I thought this game was amazing in every detail except for the revival system, I don't like it how before you can get any waters of life you have to go to a priest and revive or remove poison or curses.
Also I thi\ought they would have the ending before the credits that was a little different but what can I do.
The bosses are merciless and can sometimes be very frustrating, but I suggest leveling up as much as possible before meeting any of them!
Boy finds love, love cant be returned by lover, boy dies before lover is able to admit his love....yes - we've all seen the story before but, it seems to have a fresh angle told in the army setting.
The two fight over this just before a disastrous foray into dangerous territory.
I had seen another two movies of Eytan Fox and Gal Uchovsky's before this one, both are "gay theme", both are amazingly good.
These 65 minutes may have been OK for the theatre play that staged in Tel Aviv before the movie opened, but on screen it just leaves your mouth watering for more.
The best example is just before going out on an ambush, suddenly everyone is dancing flat out with an energy that overflows.
I saw their eyes in the room...wet... some of them showing their emotions discretely while Yossi and Lior, in a simple way, was sharing their souls in the snow... as I never saw it in a gay movie before.
YOSSI & JAGGER (Yossi VeJager)   Aspect ratio: 1.37:1  Sound format: Stereo  Originally produced for Israeli television but screened theatrically in Tel Aviv to great success before opening nationally to even greater commercial and critical acclaim, this engaging drama from director Eytan Fox has been hailed in some quarters as one of the best gay movies ever made.
Better yet, before the credits, it says that All About Us became a best selling DVD.
There are very few belly laughs - one I remember was when the protagonist Eric Linden says to his not-so-clever girl (Cecilia Parker) "I was born 100 years before my time" and she responds "I was born 10 days before mine."
Oscar nominated William Holden (The Wild Bunch) opens the story by taking viewers back 6 months before a tragic event recalling how he ended up working for the neurotic Norma Desmond, cinemas once finest star.
Once the star she descends into a world of obscurity and absentmindedness, lost in past glory before seeing the light and preparing herself for her comeback.
Never before and never again someone achieved such a sharp and cynical portrait of Hollywood.
It's hard to imagine, that Montgomery Clift really left 2 weeks before shooting, because he didn't wanted to be seen as the lover of an elder woman.
Not every actor understands the difference between film and stage performance, nor can every actor deliver that difference vocally and physically (this was WAY before the days of amplified body mikes).
Although this movie was made 8 years before I was, I saw it for the first time yesterday and I was blown away!
My suspension of disbelief lasted about five minutes before I started to get annoyed with it.
I had read a number of negative reviews before renting this movie.
Also you can tell the transitions between shots as there is a awkward pause before the actors start acting!
It is shining with a heartbreaking sincerity and honesty I've never encountered before.
The acting seems to be lifted from early John Waters' films (Pink Flamingo's & even before).
Never before has a modern film so perfectly succeeded in capturing the look, style and feel of the 70's Sexploitation classics.
I caught this film at it's Pre - World Premiere at a press screening at the Rotterdam Film Festival back in January of this year and I really enjoyed it, mainly because I have never seen anything quite like it before and don't expect that I will likely ever see anything like it again.
Backlash 2003 was all set around Goldberg and The Rock who had had recent brawls 3 weeks before this very PPV.
Reuben, Reuben is of its time - the early eighties - just before excessive style, slickness, and silly 50s-style moralism and hokeyness took hold.
Henri Jeanson and Julien Duvivier brought honour to the French cinema with this one that remains a must-see and before I sign off let me acknowledge a genuine altruistic contributor to these boards who, with exceptional kindness, sent me not only this gem but seventeen others.
It won't really ruin the story for you, it'll just show how this story was made into a film before the use of CGI and before movie studios started puking money at Jackson.
But, having plunged into Tolkien's Middle-earth once before, it was a challenge they could pull off with the expertise R/B fans had always expected of them.
Oscar NOMINATION: The only reasons I can think of for this movie being nominated for Best Picture in 1935, (before there was a limit placed on number of nominations) are (1) the groundbreaking nature of the subject matter vs the times, (2) this was a vehicle for the popular Claudette and (3) that it was based on a highly regarded book at the time.
What seems "blatantly racist" in 2004 was really quite realistic in 1934, not to mention that the novel was written some years before that.
One day before World War I, Louise Beavers comes looking for domestic work and gets the wrong address and comes knocking on Claudette Colbert's door.
As I said before, better than the remake.
Colbert looks good, though this was a little before she had hit on her trademark look with bangs.
Let it be stated unequivocally that this is one of the most remarkable films of the 1930's - unique in that it deals squarely with aspects of the racial question decades before it became common to do so.
It would be a very long time before black performers & black roles would be treated with the dignity they so desperately deserved.
Liza worked hard for six weeks before this production.
I knew of this sequence before watching the film, and I was afraid that Woody might not have been able to carry it off, but now I really don't know what I was worried about; Woody is, like in the first sequence, at his best in the scene.
Just before Woody Allen began his march towards huge critical acclaim with Annie Hall and a definite move towards more serious work he put out this.
The segment mimics the Kubrickian coldness of contemporary sci-fi, portraying the male human body as a giant, and not-particularly-coordinated, space station on a carnal mission to boldly go where other men have apparently come and gone before.
I suspect Allen was taking advantage here -- more than he had before or since -- of the newly relaxed regulations regarding the depiction and discussion of sex and violence on the screen.
But it's good natured and should leave you in a better mood than you were in before you saw it.
And the most creative of the skits is the last one where we see what happens to a man before I night of sex.
I'll bet no one on their staff ever saw it before.
Anyway, I will always love his movies made before 1991.
Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories.
Yup, before this movie, many various EX-YU actors and directors were talking about making some new movies as homage to old partisan films... luckily, this movie showed that it would be just waste of money...
I have never seen anything like it before.
If you watch some of the American romantic comedies before watching Karaula, you'll see the diffÐµrences.
It explains what happens between after Bambi's mother's death and before he grows up, and focuses on Bambi and his father, The Great Prince Of The Forest.
Overall, the rest of the cast make a very good work, considering they had to try to emulate the work done almost more than 60 years before.
What happened after Bambi met his father in that heavy snowfall and before the spring he shook owls tree scratching his antlers?
I am still a little confused by how many springs go by before the birth of the twin fawns.
I hope that you give Bambi 2 the chance to prove its quality before discarding it as another disappointing sequel.
Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
Perhaps best of all, they did it before anyone conceived the notion of a program sentimentally "paying tribute to itself," or having "celebrity commentary," and they managed to stick to their thirty minute format, not "expanding" the program to milk it.
He brought clean and wholesome entertainment to American television before the days of cable access.
Then pray that Tarantino + the other judges had a very pleasurable time as regards their leisure pursuits just before & just after the movie's screening.
Oh, and before I sign off... psssst.... what a protracted & most nonsensical bore this film was!
the soldier was afraid tried to hide and run away; wouldn't it be so much easier to TRY and love like he had before instead of facing his love face to face.
That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.
Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man.
Daughters of Satan (1972) stars Tom Selleck before he was a star.
I've only ever walked out on two movies before in my life, mind, so I'm not the type to often vote with my feet.
I knew nothing about this film before I rented it.
Mighty Peking Man is a friendly giant ape man who cares for a jungle girl and takes a lot of abuse before he snaps.
And by the time people are flocking to help push the train along the tracks (a replacement engine from the local museum, note, and therefore even deadlier than the one before) to get it past its government inspection you wonder whether these people should have something better to do with their lives than fret about maintaining what seems to be the most inefficient and dangerous train service that ever existed.
Perhaps one should see the movie and read the book, before reading my comments.
The actors were not in the least convincing.Someone should have said "Whoa" before this was put together.
How long is that going to go on before he's got a wreaked wagon, a dead horse, and financial ruin?
They may have a great magazine but they should think twice before putting their name on crap like this.
In this mediocre modernized telling, Morella is a genetic scientist who creates a clone of herself before dying.
Fortunately, the cops show up before they can finish the job, and a shoot-out ensues.
One of the girls, after being blasted with a shotgun, announces, "It wasn't supposed to be like this," before lying down gently with no visible signs of damage whatsoever.
I was bored before I began to watch, but my boredom increased me (almost to death;-)during the movie.
There was a premier in a big cinema in Athens one day before the official date in cinemas and i booked 2 tickets.
I have seen bad films in my time and i rarely EVER turn one off but this made me tap out before the half way line.
Only one group encounters a single zombie before they make their way, and they miraculously act like they all know each other perfectly the next morning.
The director, Ernest B. Schoedsack, is the very same Schoedsack who directed the original King Kong way back in 1933, but after a series of similar adventure films in the 1930s, he had been inactive for nearly a decade before getting involved here.
The story we've seen before--big ape taken from the jungles of Africa to become a stage act for a impresario of dubious character.
The movie makes me happy and you get a picture of how Norway was before!
Many memorable lines from Stripes like "I think you're ready for the Special Olympics," or "I thought I should join before I got drafted," or "All I know is that we finally get to kill someone" are hilarious.
Police Academy is way too predictable, you know where they are heading, but they stop just before they get there.
DO NOT WATCH THIS RIGHT AFTER EATING, although dieters might do well to watch it before eating.
I am the type of person that stays away from watching previews and reading any form of critique before entering a cinema.
Let us suppose, just for the sake of the present argument, that a fascist movie can be funny Â this is arguably a fascist movie Â well there isn't a single funny scene in this poor excuse for a movie, the joke are trite and all of them can be predicted by someone who has seen at least one cheap comedy before.
Just as unbelievable is that this same recruit drops out of the program one minute before graduation.
Or at least maybe they could have worked on it a bit more before its release as it definitely has a rushed feel to it.
Allan Quatermain and the lost city of gold is the sequel to King Solomon's mines that came out and flopped the year before.
There were several things to do and many characters to butcher, but way before you know it, the movie suddenly ends and everything is left undone.
I don't feel like our watching this film was a complete waste of time, but I'm really wondering how we managed not to turn it off before the bitter end, especially since the ending was not exactly satisfying.
I only did about 25 minutes before I turned it off.
I wish I had looked at the IMDb rating before I chose this movie.
And I can't recall ever hearing of the director before.
And like all the others before we get all the same scenes and characters.
How many times have we seen this before?
Meryl Streep was so poor and rigid in her role as the therapist, that I almost left the theater before it was over.
Sanada's butt and thighs occupy the center of shot for a surprisingly long time before the director cuts away.
False advertising to say the least.. but maybe they had signed their names to the contract before reading the script, and in an effort to minimize the career damage, tried to contribute as little on-screen content as possible.
I just can't accept it especially the decision was made rightly after the lose of fight, and before which, they robbed a pretty girl.
2: The car registration HB 4596 as anounsed on the loudspeaker before the race refers to bootlegging booze: HB - Home Brewed, 45 (as in 45% proof, available in norwegian stores) - and 96 (as in 96 proof, what all bootleggers aim for)  3: And the game of chess played in the tent of "Ben- Redik - Fy Fasan" (actually a euphemism for "fy faen" - norwegian swearing meaning "the Devil") is a spanish play which you'll find in many books on chess.
The thing that really bothered me was that I could feel Kal Penn's career dying before my eyes.
2) You are an IMMESNSE fan of Hulk Hogan from his earliest days of wrestling n before u die u have 2 see whatever movie he's been in.
Now if you'll excuse me I'll just take my tablets and go to bed before they come and take me away again...
I wish such a message had been written before the opening credits.
Oh, by the way, the kids looked like they were 3 yrs younger than before and the middle aged boy's hairdo gave me nightmares.
The Muslims should have disciplined Mariam before she came to the country of America.
Other than that, you've seen this plot many times before and you've seen these characters many times before.
But as I said before, the acting and delivery of dialog,were so weak in this film,( I am ashamed to use the word 'film' to describe this crap ), that it turned it into a comedy for me.I have seen "movies of the week" that were more convincing.It didn't, at any point, bring any emotion, except extreme disappointment.Please don't waste your time.
As stated before, the casting of the particular actors and actresses in TRACKS to play 14-16 year olds makes no sense, and even worse, detracts from the film; they're just way too old to play the parts called for.
Much to my dismay, I ended up watching a predictable movie that has been done at least a dozen times before.
Writers, or whoever is responsible, used the book as a very faint guideline, but their story makes little sense; if I haven't read the book before, I am not sure I would "catch their drift".
Whoever it was, please do try to understand the actual book before doing it again (better yet, don't do it ever again).
Since I've read the book one day before watching the movie, I even didn't manage to find the meaning of making a movie by the book in the manner this movie was filmed.
Suddenly, a cloud flys into their face, and even though everybody is only a foot away, they looked like they were taking the opportunity to catch their breath before finishing those last twelve inches.
So all the clichÃ©s with their predictable conclusions have to be put back in before an intelligible line could be uttered.
Echoing what others stated before me, it seemed like the whole thing took place over a series of days.
One would think he disappeared them, but that possibility was already ruled out a moment before.
Additionally before he is given the name Ged by Ogion, his name is Duny.
Under ordinary circumstances, I need to black out from the pain before I rate something this low; unfortunately, the fact that the movie claims to somehow be related to Le Guin's series warrants a further deduction for misrepresentation.
Glover mails in his lines, Ashmore fails to achieve the depth of character necessary to make the audience feel the change before and after the incident on Roke Knoll, Calvert turns Kossil into another tiresome scheming vixen; Roche at least has fun with the only role with no counterpart in the novels, and he hams it up royally.
Together, we can stop this evil before any more films of this nature are released on an unsuspecting and undeserving audience.
Plot: basically there is none ... everything's built around awfully carried out set pieces ... the most ridiculous one coming at the end where the main evil-doer chases our heroes along the shore, wait for it, on water skis, firing wildly at them before crashing.
This movie is one of only two movies that I walked out of the theater before it was over (the other being cobra, another Stallone flick go figure).
I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight.
Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel?
It's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop.
The script by John Pinkney mixes some of the traditional Vampire cinematic themes such as fangs, blood drinking & glowing red eye's with new ideas like the farm where humans are kept like livestock, bleed through special hi-tech machinery & scientifically checked for disease before it is packed into milk cartons & shipped out to other Vampires all over the world.
Why not years earlier in her life while she was still vulnerable before she had fully developed her personality & career?
I also have to mention the so-called twist ending which I figured out a long time before I actually had to sit through it.
However, it goes into the trajectory of the myriad thrillers about obsessive psychos and young kids before it, and a completely hum-drum one at that.
I couldn't get even a minimal feeling of either tension or drama, for imagining Barney Fife and Gomer (or Goober) fluttering about aimlessly and inanely around Mayberry, before Andy would arrive to straighten everything out.
Be sure at 100% you will sleep before the end.
Normally you discover something like that just before the climax, so you could have some kind of showdown between Hauer and Gould, or heck, Hauer just shooting the bastard.
And since Terry is riddled with paranoia, the filmmakers spoon-feeding us with several minutes of news footage and Bushspeak before the movie even gets underway, the movie simply has nowhere to go.
I tell you, I've never walked out on a movie before, but I was desperate to walk out on this horrible disaster of a movie.
Like I said before, if you are a fan of Westerns, you'll probably be a lot more forgiving than I am being, so you should probably go ahead and see this movie.
While it is true that the film takes place in the territory of New Mexico, 40 years before statehood was achieved in 1912, the only thing we might remember Arthur for is becoming president after Garfield was assassinated.
And in the end where there is gonna be a showdown between Mortensen and Irons, it's over before you even noticed what happened.
Word has it that production of this movie was rushed so that it could be released before The Ring came out.
1) FOOLS RUSH IN, and that's because I'd had NO sleep the night before and shouldn't have been there in the first place.
Each person's dvd/vcr player should ruin the copy before it is done as a service to those who are considering watching the movie.
The number of bloopers is just astonishing SPOILER**Just as a for instance: When McElhone rushes into the psychiatric ward of the hospital to talk to Dorff (with no explanation WHY he's in a psychiatric unit), is directed to his room "first door on the left," she is instantly there, finds him having a full-on seizure (with no medical people in attendance, mind you), and suddenly -- when she, oh, so frightfully conveniently gets a phone call -- NOW she's got to go out the door onto a stair landing and through yet another doorway before she's back in the same corridor!
Director William Malone did an entertaining job before this mess with the remake House On Haunted Hill, but here the story has clearly got the better of him and everyone involved!
he is gonna need about 10 movies as good as Interview With The Vampire, The Crying Game and The End Of The Affair for him to sink his acting chops into again, before he can wash the taste of this experience out of his mouth!
Directed by the person who brought us the underrated House On Haunted Hill, many horror movie veterans (Dorff, Combs, and Kier), and at the time a fresh concept (released just before the Ring and all the other "ghost uses everyday thing to kill you" movies), and a dark atmosphere.
I really need to stop writing this comment, before I write some more ridiculous stuff.
Wouldn't she have bled to death well before 48 hours?
The partner manages to get there ahead of time, get killed and get strung up, even before the male and female lead even make it there.
The dead body is from a little girl that people see before they die.
The dead body is from a little girl that people see before they die.
Anyway - the final scene where Dorff and the McElhone rush into the mad scientist's lair (located in an abandoned steel mill or nuclear plant - the film couldn't make up it's mind what it was - it identified it as both during different scenes in the film) and stop him only seconds before he's going to kill his latest victim had me rolling in the aisle with laughter.
The tenant finally vanishes, but not before stealing all the fixtures and fittings (why he does so, and why, if he'd planned to do this, had he bothered to set up all the potential lawsuits he hereby abandons, no-one ever explains).
In addition, all of the themes are telegraphed so ineptly that generally you don't need the scene at all, because you already know exactly what will take place before it starts.
Rent all of them before getting to this one.
That is a great film and I suggest you watch it two or three times before renting Japanese Story.
I've been stuck in the desert before too and everyone knows you put rocks or sticks or something hard underneath the tires... they just clowned around.
His death is unique because the movie never fully explained the use of the character before killing it.
Oh, please, I have seen some better Australian films before...
I suppose the audience was supposed to have foreknowledge of the game and its cosmology, since there was little explanation given to the rules that framed the events and sequences before us.
maybe ten but i would recommend renting it before you buy it.
That meant I had some expectations for this one, even though a guy I had never heard of before, Kevin Sorbo, had taken over the lead.
Buckley) is trying to buy up land before a new highway is built through the town, and he isn't particular about how he acquires the real estate.
I've never written an IMDb review before, but at the insistence of director John Stimpson I will tell the world my feelings.
There's also some pretty HD footage of whales, turtles, sharks and other charismatic marine megafauna, but nothing we haven't seen before in "Blue Planet" or other productions.
It was poor done and reminds me of one of my students handing in a book report for a book they had skimmed the night before.
Chaplin's first park comedy for Essanay is a rehash of more of the same we've seen before in his park comedies for Keystone.
Soon Margaret is conducting a guerilla war against a permanent hire (Helen FitzGerald) who gets a job Margaret had been aiming for and who is almost a mirror image of Iris when she came to work a few weeks before.
The movie does open up before "Daddy's" death, and there is even a scene where the oldest daughter, Cathy, is given a music box by her beloved father, just like in the book.
In the meantime, Chris and Cathy grow up through teens and discover each other quite fruitfully, and eventually all four of them become a family, sharing a special bond made out of the feeling of being betrayed, and the longing to escape, which occurs not before three years.
They have completely missed the point of the story: It wasn't about 4 kids sitting in an attic waiting to die or be let out; it was about four children adapting to a situation wherein they have to become adults long before their time.
The concept for "Cavite" is not exactly new, as the storyline has been worked up before in at least one recent mainstream Hollywood movie.
The nasty, bitchy fellow on the other end of the cell phone ( that was cleverly inserted into his luggage just before he left the airport on arrival ), alternately harangues him about being a good Muslim and then threatens to murder his mother.
This is the advice the makers of "Cavite" should have heard before they labored so lovingly on it.
As a madder of fact, you minds well park you brain outside before you walk into the theater to see it.
If only they'd taken their time with this one and spent more time developing the alien creatures (personality wise) because they do look pretty good but cannot carry this film, which sinks long before the end credits roll.
Could have been an old castle, spaceship or even a...Russian science ship (okay, 6/10 for originallity) Remoniscent of one of many of the genre that came before it - Alien springing to mind, mostly.
Hope that helps you out,I just wish I had read a few warnings before viewing this lemon,he he.
Armed with all the details I had learnt from the locals in Cairns two years before Open Water was released, this became a must see for me.
To name a couple, sharks do not tend to have the courtesy to wait until you are actually dead before they start consuming you and trying to drown yourself in a wet suit is damn near impossible.
I listened to it before I watched the film, and absolutely hated it!
Then every robbery so fast is too much to believe Even Dhoom 2 Mr. A looks more believable  The entire love angle, marriage front of Taj MBhal is even weirder Amitabh's characterization too fails to leave a mark The entire climax is even worst The scene together between Amitabh and Abhishek before Kajra Re is the worst scene ever featuring them  Shaad ALi goes 100 steps backward from SAATHIYA Music is saving grace but too many songs  Abhishek acts well, overdoes at places but is good Rani irritates with her voice but does some scenes well, her performance is over-hyped Amitabh bachchan is alright
There's a bizarre scene featuring a highly strung police captain played by comedian Tom Green & the whole subplot about the two cops is totally forgotten about & they disappear before the film finishes.
When I heard about this movie some time ago, I was the first to admit, this idea has been done before many times, in sketch shows, and cleverly in a Cruel Sea video clip.
Back in the late eighties, before New Kids on the Block graced our ears, there was the boy band that started it all; BoyTown.
Suspicions and paranoia begin to fester, and it isn't long before violence erupts.
The Backwoods starts off well, trying to develop the main characters, before violence eventually erupts.
And then, all of the sudden, ten minutes before the end, you have a man-on-man gunfight, reminiscent of a spaghetti western.
Charles dons mascara and "male cosmetics" before venturing outside.
I had never seen this movie before and so I tuned in late last night on Turner Classic Movies channel to watch it.
Harrison gets a court notice for doing drag, but the movie ends before they ever get to court.
Well.. you will be waiting for half an hour before any skin presents itself and be promptly let down directly after.
I would like to begin by truly saying that James Dean was an actor that met his end before we, as cinema watchers, were fully about to appreciate his talent as well as full body of work.
Furthermore the direction messed up some of the alleged jokes in the film, accidentally giving away the unfunny punchlines before the jokes were thrown.
After all of the hype for this movie, I really thought that it would be good, but the first time I tried watching it I made it through about 15 minutes before realizing I wasn't paying attention to a word they said.
I saw this movie when I attended a free screening of it a couple weeks before it was released, and while I am no big fan of chick flicks, I had hopes for this film.
And the following quote from Shakespeare (The Tempest) appeared on the screen before the titles came up:  Hell is empty; All the devils are here.
In the middle of a nice moment between the two main characters before he goes on his trip his dog passes gas.
This was confirmed by an article in the Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, which stated that The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan had been one of the earliest films presented with magnetic stereo sound (before the composite magnetic prints of Cinemascope).
At least John Waters had his animals f*&$ed before he slaughtered them.
I was hoping this would be the case for the film "Blindness" (which I saw before this one), but instead experienced a bland, rather conventional construction that was not compelling on any level.
But to little avail -- the viewer is likely to have slit his wrists well before tomorrow.
Second of all, before assigning the teacher with the task of being responsible for these kids, she lectures him for being such an awful teacher, stating that most of the other teachers and parents are fighting for his suspension.
They realize that their truck is low on gas before they leave and they don't even bother fill it up.
This movie was horrible,and I pride myself on loving all kinds of movies,but this was just terrible.The actors were very good looking the actresses were pretty with cute little bodies,but goodness I would rather them put in a few uglies than to have a ucked up script and story line.These people CAN NOT act!OK who drops down and does the nasty in an unknown barn,with a buddy missing?Not even in the worst horror movies has this happened.The story makes no sense.But if you can get a copy with the bloopers at the end,those are pretty good.The best part of this movie was the bloopers.The unfolding of the story was way too slow,the plot DOES NOT thicken,the actors can not act,the music sux,there's no "boo moments" as my friend calls them,everything that is going to happen is so freggin obvious its sad.This was a TOTAL waste of production dollars.Someone suggested that this seemed more like a student film,but as I'm sure that person knows,student films have been so much better than this before,as he said,that is no excuse.I recommend to try it because everyone has a different opinion,but ewwww!
As they search through the farmhouse and barn, they encounter a backwoods psycho whose face is hidden by long messy black hair, quietly awaiting each victim before attacking from behind when they are most vulnerable.
Not only does this flick deny you that obligatory payment for your suffering, but to add insult to injury, you are actually teased several times throughout the picture,starting even before the title sequence,every time you think, "Well at least I'll see some skin for my trouble..." you are denied.Taking into consideration that this would have at least given you something to tell someone they may enjoy seeing, you'd think it would be there.
Mistake #2 was continuing to watch the film for about an hour before I finally turned it off.
It doesn't take long before one of the four disappears and the others go looking for him, only to realize that there is something not quite right about the property.
This is the PERFECT time for the killer to kill the girls, mainly Because they both STAND BY THE TRUCK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES before walking away, yet the killer seems to care less.
How many times can a poorly equipped science vessel defeat them before all menace is removed?
Voyager is regarded as the beginning of the end of Trek, being less popular than its predecessors and less well regarded critically than what had come before.
the series suffers from a reliance on technobabble never seen before, a regular joe doesn't understand half of what is being said and the rest phase out due to the internal consistency... or lack thereof.
I was briefly involved in the craze for a couple months before I realized the story had nowhere to go.
The comedy includes all the cliches: The teenage rebel (been there, done that), who has a bully after him (ooohhh the originality), and who goes off on teachers who are dumber than him (well, I haven't seen that before.
However, one must ask: how many times can someone get kicked in the head before he gets knocked out?
Usually when movies are filmed based on true stories, I tend to find out something about what happened before seeing the movie.
Bill and Taskin dispose of Louis' goons in the parking lot outside before arresting Louis.
Taskin takes Bill to his house and reminisces about old times, trading terrible dialogue back and forth before a random scene where Taskin goes into his old house and starts suffering from flashbacks.
The car jumps onto two wheels at low speed before spinning to a stop.
Taskin forces Bill to the ground and rolls him around in the puddle of gasoline before Bill makes a run for a building.
Bill stumbles around and wanders to the edge of the roof before falling off and landing hard on the pavement (much like another character in American Streetfighter!).
In Paris, fifteen days before her summer vacation, the lonely secretary Delphine (Marie RiviÃ¨re) receives a call from her friend Caroline telling her that she would not travel with her to Scotland.
I'm just going to get this out of the way before I trash: I liked The Living and the Dead for what it was.
For stars such as Ann Sheridan and Alexis Smith to have to utter the crap served up to them must have been repulsive to them - while Ann overacts as she has never done before or after.
Seed was way more cynical than what we've seen from Uwe before, but still had some silliness because the absurd comic book-style killer.
There are so many factual errors in this flick like uni's, incorrect armaments, a unit insignia that I've never seen before, etc, etc, etc.
DianaBob's reaction to all this pounding and screaming is to stare at his stuffed monkey (a sign of something, surely) for a few minutes, before taking a pink squirt-gun in hand and finally deciding to rescue the by-now-dead babysitter.
), who leave their comfortable town house in New York City for the quiet digs of New England, a manor that they haven't even seen before signing the papers with the realtor (!!).
before speeding off in a cloud of dust.
While it might have come out before Shanghai Noon, this was just plain unbearable to watch with painfully BAD stereotypical dialogue with a plot thrown in around the last 2/3rd of the movie.
Rocket Power is basically a show about four typical preteens.They are the sports fanatics who love to be better then the others.We got Otto,an airhead who wants to go big.Reggie,who is the smart reporter,but also the surfer girl.Twister is the silly,random jackass of the group and Sam is the super smart kid,who has more book smarts then street smarts.As if I haven't seen this before!
Like I never heard that before.
If he really wants to purge his sins, it's going to take more than a half-hearted I might have goofed; perhaps a thousand-mile trek carrying Kissinger's head on a pike before prostrating himself on a Cambodian killing field, or maybe on top of some leftover ordnance in Vietnam, or perhaps he could set himself on fire like a Buddhist monk or that silly Mormon.
McNamara at one point in the film says that whenever he went before the press, he never answered the question asked but rather answered the question he wished was asked.
I guess this could be considered as a prequel to the series because it tells the story maybe a week before the series starts, but it's nothing that couldn't have been picked up just watching the show.
In the beginning of the movie, even before the titles, Reed Weller assigns an unfortunate boy suspended from the ceiling to collect a hundred and three children that should serve as offerings.
I read some reviews before I rented this little movie and I heard that the quality wasn't that great but i decided to try it out.
It is also obvious that the movie ran out of money before it could be completed (or I hope it did) as the ending doesn't tie in very well with the prologue.
Nathan is a hard, strict, bible-quoting fanatic who doesn't want anyone "butting in" to matters he considers private, even if disease and death spread because of the infected water, or what's evident before him, the fact that his family are afflicted with a plague.
I give each couple six months to a year before they get divorced.
I read about the movie before I bought it and it sounded really good, I am a horror movie fan by far, but this movie is a bomb.
Although if you think too much about it, I'm not sure if it really entirely makes sense judging by what's gone before.
A handful of years before "Halloween", "Friday the 13th" and other movies that claim to have started the slasher-genre, there was "Sister of Death"Â More than a decade before sorority-themed slashers like "House on Sorority Row" etc, there wasÂ "Sisters of Death"!
This movie was even shot (not released, though) before "Black Christmas", and that classic horror film is more or less regarded to as the granddaddy of ALL crazy murderers on the loose flicks!
It doesn't take long before they meet their killer, who turns out to be the revengeful father of the murdered girl.
The team assigned to deal with this tunnel network share some thoughts and memories from childhood the night before they ship out to begin work.
Okay, now before everyone gets on my ass, this is the best film Uwe Boll has written and directed.
Hollowborn is in charge of a group of young soldiers who risk their lives everyday where one slip is fatal even being warned not to smoke the night before they go into the tunnels the next day because the VC can smell the smoke on them.
Some we have seen before (Godzilla being one of the main ones) and a few we haven't (some weird snake looking thing).
To relieve viewer boredom before the tame killing scenes occur, Debbie Dutch dances in a bra-less half-shirt and Dori Courtney messes around with her boyfriend in the hot tub and runs around in the woods topless.
I could quote the tiresome dialogue before the words had been uttered.
So I usually turn to IMDb before I go see a movie and IMDb usually is on point with its overall rating for a movie.
I had only been let down once this horribly from the overall rating before on IMDb and that was with Across the Universe when it got a review of 4 out of 10, when I thought it was a work of art.
This wasn't a "Hollywood" boot camp, referring to the usual type of training actors go through before a war movie.
Not one second of this 96 minute torture device was funny, and the 'writers' seemed to know it (you have to use the term 'writer' loosely here, for it insinuates that the movie was written before filmed).
It doesn't take much in the way of intelligence to attack and destroy what you see before you.
They pick the small town of Finleyville but before they can land the inside of the plane is swarmed with tarantulas and the plane crashes.
Now, the tarantulas, of course, disembark, and before you know it they've made their presence known over apparently SEVERAL square miles, which is pretty silly considering how slowly they seem to move.
Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo starts in Ecuador in South America where two partners Fred (Howard Hesseman) & Buddy (Tom Atkins) are about to fly off to San Francisco with a cargo bay full of coffee beans that they intend to sell for a huge profit, unfortunately they fail to realise that lots of deadly tarantulas have gotten on board... As Fred & Buddy head for San Francisco their plane develops a technical problem which forces them to land in the small Californian town of Finley Ville, however before they get the opportunity Buddy is bitten by a tarantula & the plane crashes in a field.
The script by John Groves & Guerdon Trueblood is painfully slow as it's over half an hour of boring exposition before the tarantulas even start to leave the plane, it's dull as there are very few attack scenes & it concentrates on the deeply uninteresting drama surrounding the oranges more than the fact that these tarantulas are killing people & is stupid as it seems to take itself far too seriously & features a silly climax where a guy holds a cage full of wasp's up to a microphone to scare the tarantulas into a comatose state.
It's not long before the spiders have got off the plane and begin killing local residents; causing the authorities to take action.
I know, it's lame but I had never seen the film before today and then it all came back to me when I saw the scene.
In the end when he is out,(this is, I presume, eight years later) he gets the money(so well hidden in 60 seconds eight years before that no one found it by accident in 8 years, including the police) and heads over to "his place".
The mixture of sexual violence and mayhem/murder, a combination I have reported on before, is below any line any film-goer can draw.
The script has a lot of potential, but could have, definitely, used another re-write (or two) and a bit of patching of some truly gaping holes, before going into production.
huge spoiler alert.i'm about to give away the whole movie,in the hopes that no one else will ever watch this piece of excrement.a man gets off on taping people and getting their reactions before killing them, usually in a horribly disgusting way.oh yeah, he also talks to his victims as if it's all nothing more than a stroll in the park.he gives them little pep talks.
Not because its shocking, or depicts anything that hasn't been seen before.
I've read about this film before, & was interested in it despite the fact that most everything I read said it was bad....but I generally LIKE bad movies, that is, ones that have entertainment value other than what was intended.
We have a bunch of spoiled rich party-goers who decide to go horseback riding (despite the fact that they were blind drunk a few moments before), and of course they get lost in the woods & happen across the mysterious castle of one Graf Saxon, whose daughter just happened to get raped & dies.
Should have checked it before wasting my time...
When you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary.
Add in the junkie, the idiot savant (more savant than idiot) and a tab of Ecstasy slipped into Dad's antacid, and we're on a strange, unenlightening trip through flashbacks and hallucinations that will leave you checking your watch long before the meal is served.
In closing, this is a very poorly constructed film that probably generated audience interest primarily because of the controversial theme of the two leads living together and becoming pregnant before marriage.
He should be applauded for dealing with topic of sex before marriage without being pretentious.
Thus you get to see, extra-marital relationship going sour, pregnancy before marriage, women liberation, evolution of fatherhood in hero, numerous forced situations to get couple back together and so many other done to death scenes and dialogs that film follows a very predictable path and ends at same common oft-repeated note.
Now, this is for the producers, please pull up your socks before it is too late.
initially committed a murder, even before it was discovered that the girl could not die.
I seriously hope they actually read the horrible story before agreeing to it.
Then before you know it, its over, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
The film feels like a movie of the week based on a cheap page turning novel you pick up before you get on an airplane.
The premise of this movie is a decent one, if done before in other ways.
A long, lumbering, disorganized tale that takes so long in getting to the heart of the story that it's very likely you'll tune out before the story begins.
So, the ghosts begin to appear to one of the friends who seems to be a little psychic, and it's up to her to put the "curse" to rest before her friends' lives are at stake.
The kind of plot used is the same which have been used so many times before.
A group of friends buy and move into an old Long Island house, where 12 years earlier, a priest was brutally murdered by a teenager who hanged himself before he could be tried by the police.
Will any of them be intelligent enough to get out before the Amityville curse claims them?
But one of them is the group of friends is not what he seems to be and they better get out of the house before it's too late.
First of all, this wasn't meant to be an "Amityville" sequel, it just tried to draw its audience by using that word in the title, but otherwise has little to do with what has happened before it in the series.
Now as kind as his landlord may think he's being, giving Dennis a brand new pair of running shoes less than 3 weeks before the race is a really stupid idea.
Once Dennis spots Thandie Newton & his son past the finish line he suddenly "forgets" his broken ankle (he doesn't even limp or hobble like he was before, highly unlikely).
Mr.Pegg and Mr. Moran musta had some bills to pay.This is the worst kind of predictable"feel good" tripe imaginable.Immature boy gets girl,immature boy loses girl to rich successful mature boy and then proceeds to mature to win back girl.Also this film tries to have it both ways,there are plenty anti-American digs lobbed about whilst the film repeatedly has tons of product placement shots for Nike.Gotta laugh at that.Not a complete waste but most of the gags are flat and "been there before" kinda stuff.Shame Mr. Pegg seems to be rotating to this kinda tripe,it would make a "nice" double bill with the almost equally as awful "Hot Fuzz"
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Dennis (Simon Pegg) suffers nerves on the last minute before his marriage to Libby (Thandie Newton) and does a runner.
David schwimmer who was good when his scripts were written for him but how he thought he could write a British comedy when he has never lived here before.
David schwimmer should maybe go back to the drawing board before dragging down his, Simon pegg's and Dylan Moran's name.
My advice if they are interested: get audience feedback once you've got a starting cut of a film, then go to work and make it better before you send it out for the world to condemn it.
I couldn't last more than probably 1/3 of the way through it before I shut it off and went on to my next DVD.
If Eban discovers the spirit that love come before all else, in the face of all adversity, and that this is a good thing, one can't help but wonder what happens to the magical relationship when Charlie passes into adulthood.
"Stick Around" is one of the brief series of films that paired Bobby Ray with Oliver 'Babe' Hardy before Hardy's immortal teaming with Stan Laurel.
Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.
the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test, or like some sort of drug, to take you to a place you have never been before.
..yes, someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film.. it is!
Didn't the CIA have a chance before he was arrested ?
The plot was also extremely poor, boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before.
As you watch it, you feel like you've seen that episode before, and you kind of know how it's going to end.
That's because, in a way, you HAVE seen that episode before, and it's going to end exactly like any episode of any unimaginative half-hour sitcom based on some vaguely idiotic premise.
On a side note, just like "Nightmare before Christmas", the animation is great!
If it gets better, I'll let you know before posting this comment.
I mean, how many times have they done it before?
The direction was confusing in its absence and the editing seems to have been done ten minutes before the premier.
This leads to an anachronistic feel through out the movie and while I was watching it I was expecting there to be a shock revelation at the end where it's revealed the story is set in the 24th century and there had been an Earth shattering catastrophe a couple of centuries before .
In fact, I think I got about halfway through, having been quite patient, before deciding that whatever point the filmmakers had did not justify their approach, and I left the theatre to see another film at the festival.
The movie try to get back to Christmas horror that have been made before with more taste, like Black Christmas.
It was the first slasher movie to include a Santa-suited psycho, before Silent Night-Deadly Night, Psycho Santa and Christmas Season Massacre made the costume a slasher clichÃ©.
Why won't i re-watch it before commenting?
Low level family film is good for undemanding three or four year olds since odds are they're the only ones who won't have seen it all before.
As I said the problem is that unless you've been hiding under a rock you've seen this type of thing before.
But here, as usual, it is laid before our children as normal and beneficial.
Not much else to say about this one, other than you've probably seen it all before.
There are both better and worse films out there with nearly the same exact plot line, which doesn't make this any less monotonous to sit through for anyone who has ever seen a monster movie before.
"In the Dark" presents itself as "real" footage of the events that take place when a group of teenagers break into an abandoned, burned asylum, where years before, a few of them did *something* (raped?)
("never before has a steel building collapsed due to fire", not only intentionally misleading but factually wrong).
Unfortunately, I could only last about forty minutes before I had to turn it off.
And you see the "big plot twist" coming before the movie reaches its mid-running time.
I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off.
No character is likable for it is not a character but a cartoon-figure, every turn in this so called story can be seen coming miles away and slapstick really had its highpoint way before even my former life started.
For Bansali, "..Still Miles to go before you Sleep..."!
Only later did I realize (when I got hold of the DVD cover) that it was made much before Black even started production.
But this one, with its non-ending ending and lack of brain power prove to be the undoing before this one ever began.
Evolved is so bad that I finally stopped it as the evening wore on because I wanted time for an antidote, something ELSE to watch before bedtime so I wouldn't think my entire day had first been wasted by work and now THIS.
I have watched crappy movies before but this has to be worst thing I have ever seen.
If you have heard the tale before it's old news (a "kid" walks in and never comes out and the frat boys come and and find him dead of fright, the boys soon fall victim to a death curse).
I just want to say something real quick before we begin.
There is absolutely nothing in this film that hasn't been done before (and done better) which leaves the gratuitous two seconds of nudity as the best part of the film.
Tooth and Nail looks as if it is a real-life film student's home made class project and sounds as if it has dialogue written by the student's younger sibling after the student partied too much the night before it was due to be able to write it himself.
We see an exterior shot of her pushed into the cell, a switch to the cells interior shows an empty cell and a good two seconds elapses before the girl hits the floor.
The script really needed a couple of critical rewrites before going into production, I actually laughed out loud at the clichÃ© "dramatic face painting in preparation for war" scene near the end.
This is the kind of movie where time and again you find yourself asking "now where have I seen that before?"
Michael Madsen, who at first appears to be the leader of this group, has a minor role as the cannibal "Jackal" who whistles towards his quarry before using a two-sided ax to do his damage.
times before.
I was so unhappy with this movie, I actually stopped watching it 30 minutes before the end... something which I almost never do!
The cast was OK but acted as though they had just read their lines 5 minutes before and wanted to call it a day as soon as possible.
Gerda's mother was played by an actress (Juliet Stevenson) I had seen before but couldn't remember where.
To give a gauge as to how emotionally engaging the movie was, I spent most of the movie trying to figure out where I had seen her before.
She's lucky that her character gets to die before the movie's barely gotten started, so she can avoid the whole debacle.
The irony being: the aunt avoids taking any responsibility for the potential ramifications of Megghy's sex adventure, when she acts as a sister figure to her niece, rather than a surrogate mother, who in that capacity, would tell the young girl to wait, before dragging her back on the boat.
"All mimsy were the borogoves,   And the mome raths outgrabe"  The Mimsy before this one was apparently sent to Lewis Carroll, who shared it with his young friend Alice, who had an adventure in Wonderland.
Like Alice before them, their lives are transformed into a fascinating and sometimes dangerous wonderland.
Overall The Train chugged to a slow pace before it ran out of steam.
Adding to my negative expression were the references to Matrix and Silence of the Lambs - which I have seen in dozens of comedy movies before.
My conclusion is that it's obviously not sufficient to team up with other funny guys and come up with a topic (here: German Edgar Wallace movies) which has not been covered before.
The girls, after having a brush with the law (avoided because the driver takes the mutter into her own mouth, er, hands), decide to stop in a bar and drink before continuing their ride.
I just briefly checked the ratings here on IMDb on this movie before i rented it.
It didn't take very long before i realised that i should have stayed away from this movie.
If you're thinking of watching this tripe, do yourself a favor - attack your brain with a fifth of tequila or something similar before settling into this garbage.
Don't be fooled; it's only a matter of time before real audiences start wasting their time and money on this catastrophe and registering real votes.
And the more I emphasise that Therion have had choirs and orchestras as an integral component of their material since before Metallica's post-black-album crisis of how to revive suddenly ailing record sales, the better.
This documentary perfectly exhibits why we idolize people and bands like Led Zepplin, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, etc, who stopped producing material for public consumption long before they became completely IRRELAVENT.
I suppose I don't wanna spoil it but all i can say is rent before buy.
I knew almost nothing about the Pixies before watching loudQUIETloud, and now having seen it, I still feel as though I know nothing about them.
And that's really disappointing, because when I first heard about it, before there was a trailer, before the characters were nailed down, when they were still talking about one of the Olsen sisters as an actress, I was thinking this film was going to be great.
As I mentioned before, this movie has no main character and no plot to contain twists and turns.
I'm not familiar with Gregor Jordan's previous work ("Two Hands", "Buffalo Soldiers"), and given his speech before the film premiÃ¨re at Sundance on January 22nd, I don't doubt his good intentions about this project.
The final scene (not the conclusion, but the very final scene itself) is disturbing, sad and yes, memorable; but by then you feel like you wasted too much time with something that's been done several times, and much better, before.
The movie sets up many broken and damage relationships and a couple of potentially heated situations, before it suddenly ends.....What???
All and all, this movie is Klepisch's take at a genre he never tried before (american crime movies, not film noirs by any means, and surely not thrillers or polars), and he succeeds less-than-averagely.
This is one to avoid.The premise sounds interesting and as a film it owes much of its plot theme to David Finchers infinitely superior Se7en.Its an uncomfortable film to watch for all the wrong reasons.The characters are badly realised and the cop on the trail has to be the worst cop ever for the some of the situations he gets himself into.This is a film that will appeal to people when they read the back of the DVD in the rental store but upon putting the disc in your machine you'll realise why you hadn't heard of it before you came across it in the store.Its,save the odd moment,pretty rubbish stuff really and deserves its place in the bargain bin.Watch it you must be don't say i didn't warn you.4/10
I mean, before anything, get the script in the best shape possible.
As a reviewer mentioned before, they switched from different languages and accents at the drop of a hat.. which was weird.
But, this all stopped before the series even hit the 20th episode.
In the end I switched off before the end of the episode; something I never do to a comedy, it just made me feel uncomfortable.
Failing to show the audience the couple's relationship when it was good before showing its collapse and the shallowness and incomprehensible decisions of both of them left me with no one to root for, nothing left to do but ask, repeatedly, "what the hell is wrong with these people?"
Anyway, I've never before gone through the plot in one of my IMDb reviews but here I will give it a go cause I really am not sure what I just saw... so here's what I thought I saw:  there is this cute lovable guy he's got this annoying girlfriend who would drive a saint away, she's very jealous and her idea is that he must be sick of her cause who wouldn't be with her "boring face" and in fact, she's right about this.
It's not that funny and most of scenes I've seen before in other movies.
But before I drone on about this film, let's review.
And both of the writers had never written anything before - and haven't written anything since.
Worst line delivery: "Ok, doctor we'll just evacuate the entire country before you can say Jack Robinson".
Even its creator, Terry Nation, walked quietly away from its death-bed before the plug was finally pulled.
I for one can take only so much beautiful scenery before I start to get irritated from the LACK of a REAL story and "unstaged" acting.
I gave it 1/10 cause it's boring, it's been told before a million times and it barely relies on facts.
This gave the film a creepy, sleazy feel unlike anything I've ever seen before, which was kinda cool, in an unintentionally funny kind of way.
How far into fantasy do we have to go before we get slapped with a dose of reality?
', and they've both made crap before, but they deserve better than this.
Don't think I've seen that before!
I have seen him do a good job before in other roles so I know that he is not a bad actor, however I just couldn't buy him being the king.
Woolsey was indeed arrested, but died of his illnesses before reaching the Tower.
The last one before that was Nicholas III (1277) and after that only in 1724 Pietro Francesco Orsini would become Benedict XIII.
He died 10 years before king Francis was captured in Pavia by Charles V armies (not at the same time, as we are shown in the 4th episode).
However, Portia de Rossi is as cute as a button but gives a performance that is just bad, RuPaul is gross, Richard Dreyfuss is useless, and it seems as if almost every actor playing a minor character has never acted before.
The ending wasn't too bad, but I suppose after the mess of a plot that came before it, that's not a huge feat.
before it can happen.
The reporter races to prevent the murder before it can occur, and also help the D.A.
I have never felt moved to write a movie review before... but this was so bad and such a total waste of time that I feel obligated to warn others... just as I would if I knew the plague was headed our way...
The Off Season...sounds like what the director was thinking before he started this production because this is not something I would want on my professional resume.
Our heroine triumphs in the end writing her own best seller exposing the exploits of another best selling novelist that co-incidentally lived in the same hotel before she arrived.
Does anyone with movie making knowledge approve of a piece of work before it is released?
My roommate and I rented three movies and this was one of them...We should have saved it for last so that we could watch something funny before we went to bed.
It is hard to make any interpretations on single images and scenes while everything before and after them fights against any serious analyzes.
The plot is paper-thin, the jokes are mostly lame, and even the very young are likely to get bored well before the end.
A twist you can see coming a mile off (unless you've never seen a film at all like this before).
It's unfortunate that this film was released only shortly before L.A.
He's part of a visiting party of tourists off a yacht that lands in Saigon right before World War II starts.
The plot is plain as it can get, you know how it will end before it begins.
The dialogue is unlike any on television, and because of this the show seems more realistic and engaging than any Western movie or series ever before.
A confident village bloke, Guru, quickly becomes a famous textile businessman before its time for intermission.
Tong Po punishes Wagner for several rounds before killing him in the ring.
The tall, muscular, & ruthless Tong Po beats up on Sloan for several rounds before finally displaying the Muay Thai fighting spirit needed to pound the Thai champion into a knockout.
But somehow, despite being soundly defeated, the movie attempts to show him as "stonger than before (how?)"
Last year I saw a preview for Trust the Man before Thank You For Smoking, but with the great number of other flicks coming out in wider release, I forgot about it until this weekend.
I regret not reading any write-ups before I went to see it... definitely won't make that mistake again.
The characters are introduced and the story starts to develop but then things just start to fall to pieces right before your very eyes.
I had never heard of the movie before but when they showed it on TV it had a great review and since I like everybody from the Friends cast very much I thought let's give it a try.
If you have less of an attention span than the average person with Down syndrome, you'll be bored to the point of nausea long before the 30-minute mark.
But, as I said before, he's constantly going off the subject and getting into these little speeches that quickly got annoying.
Mabel and Harry later pick their spouses up and go their separate ways before any more trouble stirs up...There must have been some morals law if the police are arresting adulterous couples in this short film!
- and at least we were spared Brandy singing over the credits (for those of you who leave before the end, Jennifer Love Hewitt does that job).
Since this was for the afternoon kiddie matinÃ©e crowd maybe such things weren't delved into even before the Code came in place.
I'm going to think twice before i see another movie for Kinski or Dimster.
So here I am writing the 10 lines they demand before I can get it published.
Some where along the away Tealc cops a staff blast then walks a journey over some mountains that would have made Edmund Hillary tired before being healed by an ascended Ancient (what the????).
It took me a good two years before realizing the complete nonsense of actually devoting even a minute to this game, and at the point of recognizing this fact it took me less than no time to stop playing for good.
I can understand the concept looking cool on paper - having a sitcom in the format of reality, shocking viewers - but that's been done before with "The Office" and "Minding the Store" is just a poor man's version.
She always solves the murder before the cops do & every case she gets seems to have something to do with her mothers death.
Deadwood is something altogether different, and though, by the admission of it's director, short of being an historical treatise it is nevertheless an historical perspective I have never seen before.
Now is a chance, before the movie's reputation is sealed to say that this movie is almost right down the middle.
I only watched 20 minutes before I was diving for the puke bucket.
We made it through about 12 minutes of the movie before shutting it off and taking it back to the rental business.
I had TIVO'd the movie for my grand children to watch around the holidays and ended up deleting it before I even watched it all the way through.
With just 30 days left, the film shows how different people react, feel and do in the remaining days before reporting on duty.
As mentioned before, Chris Klein may have the leading man looks, but his acting is far too disconnecting to the audience.
But Sega's really been pounding the series into the ground since the late 90's, introducing more characters than necessary and cranking out games in a fashion and speed that would have Paul J. Smith kneeling before Yuji Uekawa's feet and worshipping him.
You will have seen this formula many times before and maybe better, but if you are looking for a genuinely funny 80 - odd minutes, look no further.
Woo, please read a basic finance book before writing this ridiculous story..
Then to top it all off before duelling with there bikes on the sand, the high performance road bikes take an off camera pit-stop to change the slick tires to off-road.
Entertaining and well shot, it was only a matter of time before star Tom Cruise would find himself reprising the role of Ethan Hunt.
There is nothing here hasn't been done before a thousand times - in many better films.
The film opens with a shot of a car in the distance travelling along a dirt track in the middle of thick forest towards the camera, we wait for what seems like ages before it reaches us.
Back at the camp site the hippies decide to harvest what they can and leave before more Feds turn up.
Lots of blood and body parts, but only one gratuitous nude scene (Debbie Link) before the whole thing starts as one pot grower is bathing out of a pail.
; and marries Celeste as soon as he becomes king and before he builds the city.
But before we go, here are the Dave Clark Five and The Animals to sing some more songs you've never heard of while we film them in a straight-on close up that looks like a mugshot.
Long before I saw this last episode, I was a bit afraid that the writers might use up most of the episode's runtime on the final battle.
90% involves the final battle, 5% is left for some social substance before the battle and 5% at the end, after the battle.
I've seen at least parts of this before, but I sat through it today and couldn't stop shaking my head.
how could i have missed this movie before?
He is holding a real gun against her ribs after robbing a bank- are we supposed to believe that this is an appropriate setting for plucky cutesy music and Susan musing how she's never left town before or that she is really concerned that he's playing with her Keep-On-Truckin' pin?
He asks his son why he has never spoken before and his son replies that he never had anything to say before now.
Like I mentioned before, I had a relative that contributed a lot to this movie.
all i can say is i fully expected the tavern wench/lady pirate to start removing all her clothes at every turn, as i have seen this caliber of acting before... in another genre.
There's a surprise just before the opening credits that should give you an idea of whether or not you are going to enjoy this film.
A key turning point involved the bad guy using an old plot in one of the original stories and it was so obvious I was calling it out to my wife before Holmes even started to recognize the same thing.
Of all the movies I've seen in a theater, I've never been so emotionless before.
However, like the other good-time girls before and since, her 15 minutes clearly lasted 14 minutes too long.
This so-called expose of the Kennedy Administration's close ties with the mob tells nothing that hasn't been printed millions of times before.
I somehow can envision Olivier and Peck getting together after having seen the script, and then, before the start of shooting, making a wager as to who can come up with the worst accent.
I actually prefer the horrible ones because occasionally they do actually make you laugh unlike Claude and her pals, complete misfits who's characters have been done before (the white geeky guy and the black strong mama type) it's all very safe, unoriginal and boring.
The bible should be a dead giveaway to this apprehensive encounter, but the priest removes his hat before he gets any closer, just so there's no confusion about the meaning of their meeting.
He Father says no and that he shouldn't be so interested in science at his young age, and adds "you'll see me in my grave before I let you go gallivanting off to Vienna for a couple of years".
Using the various body parts delivered to him, Victor creates a human being but needs one more ingredient before it's complete, a fresh human brain.
Yes, there was life before Darth Vader.
Naturally, the brain is damaged before he manages to sew it into the creature's cranium, providing an excuse for some lacklustre mayhem once the monster is up and running.
I don't think I've ever given anything a 10/10 before, but for a TV show, Deadwood is excellent - and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box, absolutely outstanding.
Benny Perkins, the man who won a truck before and comes back to try the contest a second time, is a genuine cowboy genius.
After watching this (and I use the term loosely) film, I find myself wishing that the Grim Reaper had killed me before I chose to press that accursed play button.
I've never seen any Michael Feifer films before this and if the rest are of a similar quality I won't be seeing any in the foreseeable future.
And again the whole film was predictable and i presumed before every scene that it was going to happen.
Rachel survives & is taken to a nearby hospital where she meets a creepy nurse (Alice Ensor) & before she knows it Rachel wakes up inside a room inside the abandoned St. Joseph's mental institution where Dr. Brown (Brent Fidler) has collected several teenagers all of whom have had near death experiences.
Don't waste your money, check the reviews and rating before watching this film (there's a reason it went straight-to-video).
Meanwhile her boyfriend is searching for her after she was struck by a car and nobody believes him that she's missing.I agree the plot is predictable and lame.It is a complete rip off of the other film i mentioned.If this was a sequel to it then it would make more sense,but it cannot stand on it's own.I couldn't even stay awake to watch the rest of it as i lost interest thinking i have seen this all before.
Yes, a stupid idea for a plot but it's certainly never been done before.
The reason for the dead Germans wanting revenge is how they were mistreated before they were killed and it seems they can only be killed by the WW2 weapons.
I also loved it when, in the "police station" (cue outside shot of a police station, before cutting to someone's spare room), the FBI agent asks if there was a phone she could use.
I said that before with a bunch of other B-Movies I enjoyed as a child, such as The Stuff.
The actors probably died before that scene since they were so old!
I was glad I never had to pay money to see it,but it's so weired to see the critics saying,I love this movie so good.My god come on don't drink before you see it.The guy ,father never got his emotions working for me.A I also had a hard time hearing him whispering his lines.He was to bland for my taste.Gary
Unfortunately, we did not read a review of Flicka before taking our three children.
?..We've seen this story too many times before and done better at that.
The only saving grace (grimace) is that it came before The Core.
Moretti could have been brave and have shot a movie about Berlusconi when he was elected head of the Italian government years before.
With the stunning visual imagery of a Sergio Leone flick and the sex, intrigues and violence of ''The Sopranos'', they make the genre come to live as never before.
This movie was so awful that I watched up to halfway through waiting for it to "start" - for the plot, characters, and overall tone to start making sense - before realizing it was never gonna happen.
Inane plot ("You'll die in 88 minutes but I will try to kill you before..."), bad cinematography (have you noticed how many phone calls there is in this movie?
And why does the killer try to kill Jack by blowing up his car and shooting at him before the 88 minutes are up?
Believe it or not, before this time, all kinds of taboos were relatively common in films coming from reputable Hollywood studios.
We've seen this all before SO MANY TIMES.
One thing I would like to do before I die is find out who it was that told Justine Bateman she could sing and slap that person into a coma.
I can't even imagine seeing this film un-Mystified right before my eyes.
We know it's fantasy or at least I thought it was before "W".
Tell me that before I watch it.
I saw this movie back when it was first aired in theaters, and it is the only theater movie I've seen that was roundly booed by the audience well before the ending.
It's about a Robot who travels to a new city to start a new life and i ask myself, haven't I seen this before?
"Robots" treats us to a pastiche of set pieces stuck together by a plot that is so clichÃ©d it's virtually impossible to put a spoiler in here because you've already seen it all before: Evil corporation, valiant naive hero, funny sidekick, "you're okay just as you are" theme.
And then the locations, though well chosen, did anyone really bother to recheck them before filming??
Sometimes I have the luxury of reading IMDb comments about a movie before watching the flick.
I had seen it before years ago, but couldn't remember a thing about it.
The pace is as slow as a tortoise and it doesn't take long before you just want the film to end.
However, even before they arrive in the midst of a medieval war they have all had several turns at arguing with each other.
Thank god it tanked, let's pray it taught a few people to actually read the screenplay before they make the film next time.
So, I would suggest you watch this movie before you read the book, otherwise the lack of "fanta-realism" and the differences between book & movie will be too irritating.
Apparently Rankin used to date her before, and she is now Vince's fiancÃ©.
It boosts pathetic dubbing, and claims to be an "uncensored version" featuring "scenes never showed before", but I doubt this is true.
Already the viewer is expecting something to come of the cigarette case clue before the noir action starts, so ultimately Jimmy's coma-induced fantasy reveals nothing we were not expecting.
I had heard a lot of negative hype before I saw it but I was impressed.
It's a decent script, with some good lines and clever little additions like Quinn's serial play based on Star Wars to entertain the children before bed.
I read some reviews of the film on this site and several others before viewing it, and I noticed a lot of comments about its "dreamlike" or "surreal" quality.
Don't knock it before you see it for yourself.
Two seemingly non-actor personal friends (or enemies) of Balchunas are trying to figure out a way to pay for the escort service they used the night before.
Tim Burton must have locked her down for a few months of food withdrawal and exercise before he started filming.
Things can only get so bad in Europe, of course, before the Americans show up, and show up they do, in an armored column of the Kentucky Irregulars, led by tattooed, bald nut case Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey).
i didn't laugh once during the whole thing and saw every single "joke" a good 10 seconds before it happened !!!
I've seen movies before that more or less has the same plot.
He's not funny, not by a long shot, and I have a strange feeling that he might have done some really shitty stand up comedy before that the director happened to stumble into one late afternoon.
She can cross over and she needs to do it now before she gets stereotyped.
Not only are the jokes unfunny, they've been done hundreds of times before and done much better.
He's been in a few duds in the past (Envy springs to mind), but he's never sunken to this level before.
Especially altering the actual characteristics of the original characters such as Fee... And Vittorio.... That's just wrong o_o  Anyway, as I said before, I found it quite disappointing and many other fans seem to agree with me upon it.
The last time Ralph and Meggie saw each other before 1954 was Matlock Island in 1935.
Donald Pleasance looks dead long before his character is actually slaughtered and Ralph Bates' character is far too fake.
I wasted an hour of my life watching this nonsense before i gave up.
She faxes a scan of it to her evil boss (we know he's evil because he's got a beard) before driving to meet her husband.
Other lengthy scenes involve Totti asking Shoesmith how much money would he have to be paid before he would eat human excrement and why has he never been to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.
Sadly, this film falls short, even though every actor I've seen before (especially Ms. Ng, Ms. Yau and Mr. Tsang) has impressed me with their acting ability.
The man who is known for director cheerful and good musical mostly in the '50's and '60's including "My Fair Lady" but also comedies, like "Born Yesterday" and well known serious drama classics as well, such as "Gaslight", "The Philadelphia Story" and for some part, before he was booted from the set, also "Gone with the Wind".
He mixed all those previous styles he had worked with before in this movie.
We watched 37 minutes, waiting for the laughs to start, before giving up.
I have never been so annoyed with characters of a film, nor have I ever prayed for a character to be killed off before I saw this movie.
The aging process was like a bad comedy, no themes we have not seen before and the acting of most of them not catching.
There were points in the film that occurred before they did in the book, quite a lot of them.
On the Roger Corman timeline, this is right after he got done using 'big' budgets (for BATTLE BEYOND...) and right before he started cannibalizing his own stuff for footage (BATTLE BEYOND... okay, so 'during' the period when he was ripping himself off, but I was thinking of RAPTOR), and the end result is something neither good nor interesting.
Okay, you've heard about "so-bad-it's-good" movies before, but this demented little thing plays in an entirely different league.
This is one of them films that gives you absolutely no feedback or background about anything that happens before, during and after the main events in the plot.
Why didn't someone come up this concept before you might ask, because its STUPID!!
No, it's fairly obvious early on that NONE of the actors had ever before acted (and probably never since!).
Like "Six Feet Under" and "The Sopranos" before it, Deadwood is emblematic of the fact that long form, done "right," provides a far broader palette for art than dinky old "cinema" ever could.
(Sorry, cinema, you were my first love, but... that was before I knew!)
There was a nasty storm the night before and electricity hit the ground hard causing the worms to turn into killers.
Not three years before this little movie she was considered the hottest woman in Tinseltown -- the personification of the flapper and an icon of the times, a more sophisticated counterpart for the full-blooded carnality that was Clara Bow.
Arbuckle uses the same presentational style he employed more than a decade before, but without the inventive comedy of those years.
Instead of boosting Betty's career he nearly ruins it, and is ultimately chased out of the studio --and Hollywood-- before he can do any real damage.
The acting doesn't help, since it doesn't look like they're trying at all - well, maybe George Sanders, as much as he can with an underwritten part, and Henry Daniell has a spark of life that makes him stand out - but if I hadn't seen Joseph Cotten before, I'd never suspect him of being a competent actor, judging by this performance.
I do wonder if Jack Warner looked at this thing before he bought it for Warner Brothers.
The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off, and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater.
Lawson is a type we've seen before Â an unlikely soldier who redeems himself heroically by the final act.
There are too many questions going unanswered, even before the film's "50/50 Chance of Survival" finale.
Ground - breaking stuff it isn't.Lance Percival tries a bewildering range of accents before settling on a vaguely Scottish lilt but cannot compete with full - on nutter Ronald Fraser or frankly weird Ian Bannen in the "Barmy Jock" stakes.Our favourite cockney veers between Bob Hoskins and John Gielgud as the whim takes him.Denholm Elliot sweats far too much to make a convincing officer,"We have a place in Wiltshire" he tells Cliff Robertson who absorbs this nugget unblinkingly Robertson himslf changes from a man willing to resign his commission rather than go into combat to a gung - ho battle - hardened leader of men in the space of ten minutes.Whatever he's on they should have given the whole U.S. Army and the war would have been over by 1942.
But only when you haven't seen ever any other movie before.
And finally, the fact they said at the beginning this was the true sequel to the first film, even though it pales in comparison to the films that came before.
Was there no sane person on the set (never mind, they didn't have a set) who had the guts to tell Claudio Fragasso "sorry mate, this just ain't gonna work, just give it up already before anyone gets hurt"?
I have to get this film out of my system before I go insane.
This "sequel" was directed by Claudio "Drake Floyd" Fragrasso who brought us such classics as 'Zombi 3' and 'Zombie 4: After Death,' and if you've seen either of those movies before seeing this one then maybe you know what to expect.
What can i say abut this cinematic masterpiece that hasn't been said before?
Why, they turn you into a vegetable before they devour you.....obviously (dont you feel stupid for asking now?)
Luckily he does this right before his sister unknowingly is about to eat some tainted GREEN ICING COVERED CORN ON THE COB.
He must pee on everyone's food before they eat corn with green paste on it.
I had a strong feeling that I'd be criticising this film for length before going into it and quite why Herschell decided to make this film this long really is beyond me; it's not even like the plot line is stronger than his usual fodder and all we end up with is a film that is more stretched out than usual; not a film with added 'good bits'.
William Friedken has given us some winners before, but this film is not one of them.
However, with very green and inexperienced actors in front of the camera--and poor cinematography and sloppy editing going on behind it--the picture loses steam even before the halfway mark.
You can probably figure out what's going on in this one LOOOOONNNG before any of the characters do, but once they catch up, there's nothing left to do.
And how much longer will it be before the sequel?
It was the only movie I walked out of before the end.
It is so predictable that I could just say what was going to happen before it ever happened.
For example, they rent a lodge, talk on phone to owner before, and are not greeted by him when they arrive.
I hadn't seen the lead female or Sherilyn Fenn before, much less Billy, and barely knew Clayton Rohner the love interest of our lead fem-reporter, 'Terry'.
The characters qualify as intelligent, positive, upscale role models and stereotypes appear conspicuously absent in this seriocomic account of a weekend college reunion before a classmate's wedding.
Harper finds himself in trouble long before he arrives in the Big Apple to celebrate with his friends.
Rosenberg, along with NYPD Lieutenant Ferguson (Dick Shawn) sets out to stop Dracula before he permanently turns Cindy into a blood-sucking immortal Vampire!
The physical slapstick doesn't work either, someone being hit by a broom and then pulling a silly face before they fall over just isn't amusing as far as I'm concerned.
Yes, it's a romantic comedy-drama full of moments that we've seen done before and while unoriginality is not a cinematic sin (or, good grief, we would rarely see any film released in cinemas) it isn't a good thing when everything has been done BETTER than the movie you're currently watching.
A romantic comedy-drama with unfunny "comedy", romance you don't care for and drama that starts to unfold before you even get to know who's involved in it all.
More happens in Eastenders (and that was before the Demi/Leo storyline).
at the top of his voice before calmly turning round and walking out.
You've seen this movie so many times before - only a series of exactly timed and inconceivable coincidences would make it all work - and (hold onto your seats...) it does!
The Distinguished gentleman takes Murphy,once again back to the street smart,con artist he'd played before.
Johnson's character is clearly a handful even before Jaclyn marries him, and her character's stupidity in falling for his little-boy tricks is a turn-off for the audience.
Also , since this is the 1980's , all car wrecks or "dangerous scenes" , have to show the bad guys running to safety just before the big bang!
It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series.
Its only now after reading around, I have come to know that the producers were in a hurry to make the movie for whatever obvious reasons even before the trial started, and the morons based the entire movie around Davids confession<--- what a stupid thing to do... its a painful story and it should have been dealt with more responsibility... all they have done is made David look like a stupid mad in love softy, whereas he might have been the whole mastermind and the poor crazy gal, who knows what mental condition shes got......... Last but not the least, the characters were soo poorly defined, holly marie combs was absolutely wasted, she is one of the best actresses in the industry and did a fine job with whatever twisted script she had.
It's not long before she's on his sofa, crying out "Oh, Holy Mary, I'll have to go to confession tomorrow!"
This is why Scrooge hesitates to view the tombstone and asks if the future can be changed before even reading the inscribed name.
I know he's played this character on stage before in a one-man-show, and he claims to have a unique perspective of Scrooge.
All-in-all, this movie isn't a bad way to kill a couple of hours, during the Holiday Season, but watch the 1935 version first, then this one, and get them out of the way, before you see the much better ones.
I've never been before, but I am definitely now a Terrence Dashon Howard fan.
I don't ever before remember seeing so many fine women on screen before at one time.
It's a waste of money - I recommend you watch it or ACTH the trailer before you buy it.
Desperate to go to the concert she and her friend try all the teenage clichÃ©s and so many things we have seen before to get in.
FarnumÂJudas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving typeÂis Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinctionÂ  Brom GarretÂthe naÃ¯ve city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claimÂpursues his remedies in some other fashionÂ   SophiaÂthe little survivorÂcould settle who killed her people, road agents or SiouxÂ  JewelÂborn with difficulties and hardships that got no cureÂwants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazyÂ  Charlie UtterÂwho considers himself an important hand at the freight businessÂ plays a man too loyal and honest for his own goodÂ  Whitney EllsworthÂwho saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridgeÂseemed very competent and trustworthyÂ  Mr. WuÂthe only source of opium in the campÂfinds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occursÂ   SmithÂthe Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of moralsÂknows from past experience that it's a solace having friendsÂ   Ian McShane is a joy to watchÂ He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a wordÂ McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he givesÂ  While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm Â Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killingÂ  Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperamentÂ Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killedÂ He took their five-year-old boy as his own sonÂ  The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul playÂ She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing herÂ She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok aroundÂ When she confronts the greasy-haired dangerous man who pulls all the strings, she fell apart, broken and weakÂ  There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood'Â It's truly a drama of memorable characters, dark and ultra-violentÂ If you love Westerns, don't miss it!
After torturing the address out of a nightclub prostitute Gina (Carole Riviere), he witnesses one of the rituals in which he believes a girl is murdered, he leaves before the girl reappears on stage unharmed.
and a whole bunch of familiar looking "gangsters" (I recognized actor/stunt man An Ping from a string of early Shaw Brothers films before he was kicked off a roof top) multiple times, etc.
Bruce Li stars in a dual role playing Bruce Lee (before he dies) and one of Lee's best friends who battles those responsible for Bruce Lee's death, for reasons unknown the bad guys kidnap Bruce Lee's mistress Betty Teng Pei and Bruce Li kicks but to avenge the matter and make everything okay.
Absolutely unlike ANY film I've ever seen before!
Were they doped up, or did they simply not read the script before signing on?
Every line, every frame, every editing technique, every musical cue, every costume, every joke, and pretty much everything about the movie has been done before and a lot better in other movies but a movie being clichÃ© is bad if it knows how to do it right which this movie doesn't.
Willem Dafoe, who played a Vietnam soldier and a special forces coordinator before, plays the defense secretary who plans to overthrow the government.
I have a very high tolerance for "bad" films(I really dug the first xXx) and have only walked out three time before (Dungeons and Dragons, Bad Company, and The Musketeer).
Veteran director Benny Chan (A MOMENT OF ROMANCE, NEW POLICE STORY) marshals proceedings into a cohesive whole, though the movie fizzles badly after a dynamic opening sequence before rallying again somewhere around the halfway mark.
Seagal should lose some weight and train up before acting again, if he wishes to be the star of an action picture.
The goal is to get a nuclear weapon away from the bad guys and then away from the populace before it detonates and kills millions of people.
The action is nothing you haven't seen many times before.
I would suggest the picture was in trouble before principal photography even begun.
Drake was the bigger player than Raleigh and burned the Spanish fleet at Cadiz the year before.
We had been looking forward to seeing this film - and made a point of re-watching the original 'Elizabeth' from 1998 a week before making the trip to the theater.
I've seen MÃ¤dchen Amick before, and liked her, but this time she definitely sank to the level of the script.
Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right.
People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.
None of these episodes has any of the fun "big" names that the Columbo character was associated with before.
I know it was more than just voodoo because I had tried to loose weight for 20 years before then and nothing had ever worked.
If you dont know Deconstruction before you go in, you wont know a thing about it when you leave.
Seemingly endless shots of chicks in jungle gear sweating and running before dying.
They should have got feedback/reviews and done subsequent drafts and sorted that problem out first IMHO before shooting.
If you've seen airplane-in-jeopardy movies before, you'll find little that's innovative here.
Even if we exclude the fact that no detail presented in "Memphis Belle" movie pertain to actual events, the general level of knowledge about World War Two matters is better to be set into minimum before you proceed to watch this.
This movie has so much filler in it and drags forever before we finally get to the only actual plot element, the final mission.
If the flick is about airplanes or pilots or other aircrew, I'll probably have seen it before I'm finished watching movies.
Its nothing you haven't seen before better.
Rage At Dawn does have a sense of seen it all before about it, but that's not in detriment to it because it's possibly a picture that has been copied more than it has copied from itself!.
They really have to preview these movies before they put them in the pack.
The plot takes a few twists before it devolves into the usual race against time.
I can't believe that this crap made it to dvd before the original Christy series did.
As I watched this film for the first time, I couldn't help but feel that I had seen it before.
It was sharp and gossipy, amusing in a clear-eyed, first-hand-knowledge sort of way (both authors worked as nannies in NYC before writing the book).
You've seen it all before if you've ever watched five minutes of any Lifetime movie.
The plot wasnt great (Man chancing in to a Werewolf... Have seen this before...??!!)
The only interesting camera angle I saw here was when it cut to the top of the judge's wig before he looked up and his face came in close-up.
The movie was great, but should not have used any pacifiers strictly bloodline facts, the Middle East and Africa before Rome was Black, Brown, Light Skined and Proud.
Aside from the utter lack of chronological presentation (showing a shuttle orbiter test flight before the Apollo 11 splashdown is more than a bit confusing), there seems to be a lack of knowledge that the Apollo and Gemini programs were not the same, and that maybe they shouldn't intercut video of the slender black Gemini capsule with that of the much larger Apollo command module.
Last night, my cable box cut out before "The L Word" - why did it have to play up during a good TV show and choose to work perfectly throughout all six hours of "Revelations"?
You should know that by now, and before I digress...
Think about this for a moment: Jesus rode triumphantly on a donkey into Jerusalem just a few days before his death.
Nothing you haven't seen numerous times before -- hey, the premise works!
They had been here for untold years before David Vincent's fateful encounter with them one dark night on a lonely road at a deserted diner, thus they had infiltrated positions in society from a prostitute in a bar to positions of power within the Department of Defense.
Only in human form could they breath our weak 20% mixture of oxygen for limited periods of time before they would have to regenerate; pure oxygen would bring on an instant requirement for regeneration.
They knew their limitations and would regenerate long before the need became critical.
When, on occasion, the need became critical, they would begin to return to their alien form, but since they could not live on Earth in their native form, they would die before the transformation was complete.
So, the social movie fast turns into a cheap thriller - with an unjustified gore - scene before sliding towards an investigation movie with dull dialogs.
And I always say now, that before he hit big on TV, he had it rough!
Rather predictable and the torture scenes are kindda boring - for anyone who have seen this type of movie before.
The kids decide to leave the highway and head across country thanks to one of the stupidest plot contrivances in cinematic history Â they forget that the clocks went forward the night before Â all of them!!
I've seen movies like Hostel and Saw before.
Hope is our story's protagonist, and during the oh-so tame "torture" scenes we're supposed to root for her, but literally all she does is whimper and bitch throughout the whole movie, and there is about three minutes of character development before she is captured so we don't even know her character to sympatheize with.
Since just the scene before she was waiting for a male friend, the bartender and bouncer in the club, to walk her to her car because Yule was there and eying her.
A pity cos it was a brave attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying that'll be OK for a scene, he puts the work in before he shoots and he is Clint Eastwood.
Now where have I seen that before?
You have to know what horror films do before you can mock them, and director Almedeyra hasn't a clue.
The plot runs really slowly and it wasn't long before I was starting to get bored with it.
The film is almost worth it for one scene: A dead woman is to be made a zombie; the ritual goes like this: a dwarf in sunglasses and love-beads, top-hat and tux (over a tie-dye tee-shirt) whips the back of a native girl kneeling before him.
Apparently, Karloff died before this was released and it's probably a good job too, as I'm sure the great horror master would not have been too fussed with how he's used here!
Just before he died Boris Karloff shot back to back footage for four poverty row horror flicks.
The niece has an extremely bizarre dream of her evil double suggestively sucking on a (real, live) snake before kissing her (?)
It's one of four much-hated movies Karloff did in 1968 before his death, constituting his final film work.
Nothing really happens until the final part of the film and before that it's just talk and more talk.
It is almost sad watching someone in his 60's hobbling about trying to save his family before being beaten up by someone less than half his age.
It tries, lamely, to suck you in with slick visuals like the nice house, office, cars, etc... then delivers nothing by way of plot that you haven't seen 10,000 times before.
This plot (or similar) has been done so many times before that is't tiresome and boring in and of itself.
They constantly sell the nationalist/republican side and although I am catholic and from Ireland I find it really annoying because it is nothing we haven't heard or spoofed before.
At one moment, before the "final confrontation", it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan.
I felt like I wasted more money on this movie than any I've ever seen before.
He exuded ham to a level I've not seen before.
Of course, true to the picture's irresistibly shameless come-on title the loony forces all the poor gals to doff their duds and bare their exquisite bodies before butchering them!
Oh man, I have to give credit where it's due, because when this scene unfolded before my eyes, it was the equivalent of cinemtic masturbatory bliss!
They are the retarded droppings of a Los Angeles nightclub; in other words, they all worked in the "Independent Film" industry before this.
At a decrepit flea-bag inn, they catch a few zzzz's before TJ and his gang run up on the owner of the establishment, Ned(Joe Goodrich)and his employee, Doug(Stephen Ferguson).
He was one of those who left the dead model's body left in a tub with running water(..the image of this dead model is displayed quickly before every murder scene takes place with the director letting the viewer know that this is the motivation behind the stabbings).
A good game to play is 'say the line before the actor does'.
And since the device could wipe out a civilisation just a few years before it was able to deactivate the artifact, surely that would be counter-productive (to whatever motive the aliens had in the first place).
Far better to create the device to wipe out any advanced species before it became a threat to the creators.
I can see why its dying at the box office, there is nothing you haven't seen before or nothing that hasn't been discussed on TV.
JW: my heart breaks to see what you have cast before salacious trotters.
A mysterious killer, dressed in black leather and a motorcycle helmet, is offing the staff and models at an agency/studio; risking their lives, Magda and Carlo (Edwige Fenech and Nino Castelnuovo), a couple of photographers, attempt to discover the murderer's identity before they too become victims.
After co-eds begin turning up murdered around the campus, Jeff Kramer (Ken Roberts) is immediately put in the frame when it is revealed that he was the last person to see one of the victims before she was slaughtered.
Aided by his lumbering buddy Mark (Blair Karsch), Jeff sets out on a mission to prove his innocence and catch the psychopath before he kills again.
Michelle McCormick made for an incredibly unapproachable final girl and the whole cast delivered their lines with the conviction of a toilet cleaner on the day before retirement.
The electrocution sequence was particularly mean spirited, but any credibility gained is certainly hindered by the fact that *every* victim manages to flash her heaving breasts before being executed.
the whole attic/shoot thing she was always jumping around in, the lovers never catching on, the new red cordless at the end of the movie, the wood plank suddenly not on the door just after she placed it there moments before....and the ending?
(Spoiler Alert) actually just before the ending the fight with Mr. Psycho...it just didn't seem truthful, but I do like the fact that she took off and didn't get "saved" by her cute man and yet the emailing alludes to the possibility of them hooking up, even if at first he seemed creepy....so what I'm saying, rent it, but don't expect truthfulness to the situation...
However, two more murders occur in the family before Miss Marple can bring the culprit to justice.
Quite dismal adaptation of Christie's whodunit, which had been filmed better twice before as Murder She Said (1962) starring Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple and later in 1987 as part of the BBC's acclaimed series with Joan Hickson.
TRAIL OF A SERIAL KILLER is an aggressively bad entry into the serial killer genre, or in this case made for video which means I won't bother comparing the good movies in the genre(Seven, Kiss the Girls) or the bad(Copycat, Switchback) This movie which lurches across the screen before dying of its own nauses would deserve a mantle all its own.
Thor is mostly absent from the film as he's off on some personal quest of his own that keeps him separated from the other heroes until the climax, while Bruce Banner/Hulk spends most of the feature incarcerated for the destruction he caused before.
Now, there are unexpected pleasures to be wrought from watching obscure movies now and then, and while I generally am pretty resistant to the 'oh wow, I've been there' effect, I did find the 1972 vintage shots of 'Place Jacques Cartier' and 'Rue St. Paul Est', well before the resurrection of the area as "Old Montreal' to be such a surprise.
Michael Hilliard is a veterinary expert who is persuaded to take charge of the investigation and straight away he sets out to find anyone who came in contact with the dead man before he died, his actions and restrictions don't go down well with local animal lovers and the press also make him out to be a bit of a loon.
First this has been done numerous times before and I don't just mean the premise...the actual Locusts thing and it's just dumb.
The film has one or two spots of slight excitement before dive bombing into B-Movie crap.
Yet she still has to match the results with the packaging before she reacts.
This sort of thing has been done many times before with bees,slugs,rats and even ticks so why not a creature feature with locusts.
Five years before his infamous sicko-film "Burial Ground", director Bianchi already damn well knew how to appeal to horror-loving audiences: the murders are extremely nasty and there's an overload of nudity wherever you look.
I only caught the last half-hour of CBS' last hastily served pseudo-big event, "Spring Break Shark Attack," and only the young that hasn't seen "Jaws" didn't know what that movie was before seeing it.
This movie starts out with a promising premise, a manned flight to Mars is planned but just before lift off there is a problem so it is decided to surreptiously remove the astronauts from the ship and fake the whole thing (of course many people believe this is exactly what happened with the Apollo moon landing but that's a different story).
Shortly before take-off, the astronauts are ordered to leave their craft by Dr Kelloway, NASA's director of the programme.
This man mysteriously disappears, but not before he has confided his doubts to his friend Robert Caulfield, a journalist.
Caulfield realises what is going on and heads into the desert in an attempt to trace the three astronauts before Kelloway's security forces can track them down and kill them.
the lovely Edwidge Fenench, a veteran of the giallo, tries to solve the puzzle before she herself is murdered.
Well, I hate to burst everyone's bubble before me, but IMAO this was a very ordinary film that was mildly amusing at best.
If you haven't seen "Midsommer", then I recommend you to see it first (if you can) before "Solstice".
SOLSTICE is a haunting yarn about a group of high school friends getting together for one last blow out before heading to college.
How many times before a story following that same sort of plot has been told ?
Much other plagiarism is evident which is OK if well done - and after all this is a film in a retro style so should be expected - but this is the sub pass rate night before deadline desperately downloading student of film plagiarism - it grates so much that there was blood running out of the DVD player.
Despite the material, Glen Boles (as Tommy), Bobby Quirk (as Ed), and their gals are a swell bunch to followÂ before degradation takes its toll.
Believe it or not, before this time, all kinds of taboos were relatively common in films coming from reputable Hollywood studios.
The media and entertainment community have stooped to some low levels before, but an entire high-budget movie?
Never before have I seen such a terrible conversation.
Everything in it I had seen before, albeit with full size actors.
What's sort of cool in the story is the early misdirection which seems to implicate Tex Preston (Billy Platt) as a cattle rustler before it's revealed there's a third party villain working the Preston's against the Lawson's.
I had seen it as a separate clip long before seeing the entire movie - feel free to fast forward here - it is truly embarrassing.
Bill Platt as Jim 'Tex' Preston, was the senior of this group and had been performing for several decades before being well cast as the wealthy loving uncle.
As has been said before, this is definitely a Sci Fi/ Film Noir/Action/Romance.
That reversal doesn't come before N.Y. newspaper lady, Janet Leigh, arrives and gets the two to come to N.Y. for a sympathetic last trip with the hopes of increasing the newspapers' circulation.
In a nutshell, nearly everything in the film had all been said before.
At the end of the second series just before the arrival of the Cylons on New Caprica there was a feeling as if everyone more or less hated living there.
Since his wife was pregnant at that union meeting just before the Cylons arrived (which was led by the then-civilian Tyrol), his baby was obviously born during the Cylon occupation.
The whole film goes to plan exactly as one would expect & when there's a clichÃ©d flashback that suggests Grone's current state is down to childhood abused you realise there really is nothing here that you haven't seen before & that The Great American Snuff Film really isn't going anywhere new or revolutionary.
Please someone out there hear our pleading cries and take away this filmmakers camera before he attempts another merciless waste of time.
I argued that there is no way this was based on a real serial killer (never heard of him before or after....do a look for William Allen Grone on your fav search engine) and there is NO real snuff footage on it.
had not faded before this was on its way to the video plant.
Instead he is not even reading the script before doing the movie.
Give me a concrete answer on why there's two of him (and how he makes it back to the future when it hasn't worked before--why this time?
I had my doubts about this even before it saw release, but my assumptions turned out correct--I masochistically sat through this idiotic mess, even though I felt compelled to turn it off at least once every five minutes.
The recent owner of the mansion was a banker who had embezzled money and had hidden it somewhere in the mansion but, he was killed before he was able to retrieve it.
My suggestion is that, before one spends even the small sum charged by a publisher like Alpha Video, one should down-load a copy from the 'Net and watch that.
10/10 because I finished my popcorn before I even noticed it was running low.
We've been here so many times before.
They actually look rather young to have been there at all considering the war ended a good 16-17 years before this movie was made?
The 'twists' are all pretty predictable, if you've seen any movies within the last ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much punch, since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained.
You'll wish you'd popped a sedative before watchingÂ   VERDICT: Awake is at very best extremely undemanding.
This film is am embarrassment to Laurel and Hardy and the truly fine comedies they made both before and after this.
This remake was a lot better than the one made several years before, but it still is missing something.
The elevator scene was beyond ridiculous, too much fist-fighting, I never once saw a thirdspace ship destroyed before or after the climactic event, and you'd think that Sheridan might have once been rammed into by a passing ship!
To its credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, that are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant.
Just exactly which war, is something our boys might well have asked, before crossing a continent in search of hot babes.
Dressed in the anonymous business suit and tie preferred by the weekend torturers, Paxton attempts to practice a bit of "Old Testament Law," before returning to civilization secure in the knowledge that he can "out-Herod Herod."
But they soon learn that the hostel is nothing more than a front for a bizarre club, where people can pay a huge fee to get to perform unspeakable acts...  My 2 cents: The director and writer Eli Roths biggest accomplishment before Hostel is Cabin Fever (2002) - weather or not that is something good is a matter of personal judgment.
But Roth has stayed true to Hollywood formula and chosen picturesque before personality, and the bigger part has unfortunately been given to Hernandez - instead of Richardson who I thought were more likable, and more interesting to watch.
The plot was unveiled 5 minutes before the end, there was a tiny bit of zombie action (without much gore - just hearts on sticks!)
If you suffer from depression, I urge you to get someone to tie your hands down before you watch this film!
The industry at the time, which was even before 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), was still struggling even to attract middle and upper class women to theatres.
It's not long before there's a discussion about the legend of Jason Voorhees, and shortly thereafter all the kids are butchered.
The rest were so amateur I hardly believed them to have have ever touched marijuana or had sex before in their lives.
This is not a compliment: just before his "untimely" demise, he talks to a mannequin, and asks the mannequin if she "remembers that night, when (she) took (his) virginity".
Yes, it was the "mean streets" of 1980s Times Square, before the Disneyfied, Shrager'd, Giulani'd Times Square took hold.
Did you know a horror franchise drowned a day before this week?
And a little obligatory nudity from our heroic pixie helps her fans put up with the mediocre goings-on before and after.
Of course, I didn't realize that this film is from 1994, before the 'Da Vinci Code' phenomenon.
Unknown actor Wolfgang Brook stars as a psychic brought in by the local police detective to solve a series of bizarre attacks on the local populace of a sleepy Austrian village nestled between the mountains ringing a cold, deep, icy clear lake that was the site of a tragedy a hundred years before.
fail to find the final fragment before Sinclair, then Sinclair will wear his sunglasses a lot and have incredible powers with which to control the world.
Enemies became friends, friends became enemies, and before words could be spoken the ending credits appeared.
And in other spots, it can't even be excused by the idea that perhaps the director had only done lighting for live theater before this - it's simply bad, bad, bad, bad.
(Yes, *that* Ken Curtis, of Gunsmoke, Sons of the Pioneers, and John Ford Western fame) Like its mate "The Killer Shrews", this one held a special place in the hearts of all grade-Z cinema lovers long before MST3K took their crack at it.
Too bad the gila doesn't eat every one of these slobs before the closing credits.
And before declaring this film a masterpiece, let me remind you on the Andersen's story about the emperor's new clothes.
Watch for the two character actors you have seen a hundred times before.
I'd seen the page for this movie on IMDb almost 2 years before I finally got to see it.
Both are good actors (Paltrow won an Oscar, though undeservedly, and judging by Eckhart's climb to fame and versatility, it's only a matter of time before he gets a statue), but they have no chemistry.
As was said before in another comment: no body in Anderson was interviewed, Ed did not run for Mayor, he had filed in the primary and then Saundra was found dead and he withdrew.
Not a single interview was conducted before production .
films he did, ("The Young and the Wild", "The Cool and the Crazy") just before he retired.
Hilariously, Kathleen finds time to serve everyone drinks from a  tray before getting beheaded by a sickle when told to go check a  window.
I can only watch a few zombie hands reaching into a cadaver and pulling out pig intestines and fake blood so many times before it gets really old.
The director shows us lots of slow moving shadows, trails of blood that go on and on before the source is discovered, and slow-moving zombies that wander for so long that you wonder how they could trap anybody.
I have sent emails alerting my friends to see it before it leaves movie houses here in Phoenix.
I know this was way before CG animation and special effects, but good lord, the effects on Star Trek TOS 10 years plus earlier looked better than this!
The film did a very poor job of explaining what "business" Enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by Andy Fastow.
There is a knock on Frank's door, he answers it & standing before him is a guy named Scott Davis (Mark Kiely) who has been told that he knows San Miguel Island better than anyone else & that he needs his help to lead a rescue mission as a plane recently crashed there.
I find it amusing that so many would bash this movie based on what they thought of Blockbuster movies that have come before it.
(Brodie/Perlman) "I'd like to get out of here before they get cable."
By way before the half of the movie we stopped caring enough to not give a damn whether he finds his mother or not.
Not bad, considering he never directed before this (nor did he ever do so afterward).
There isn't much sex on display here, just a lot of talk about sex, and you've heard it before.
Someone compared to "Happy Days",and I can see why:They were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast,and they both offer only surface ,cliched depictions of the actual eras,not even close to the full scope of it,just showing the obvious things - the fashions,toys,music,contraptions,etc,and that's it.For those too young to remember,or weren't born then,trust me,the '70s weren't like that,any more than "Happy Days" were like the actual '50s,as "M*A*S*H*" didn't accurately portray life at a US Army medical base during the Korean War,etc.
Anyone who recommends watching a stupid made-for-TV movie before "allowing" their college-aged (and therefore legally adult) children to join an organization needs to find a more credible source.
DYING TO BELONG(1997) 3 out of 10: This movie features a nice cast for the time, is a good (in more ways than one)look at the actresses Hilary Swank before her days as a Hollywood star and Sarah Chalke before being a regular on the show Scrubs, and also shows that sometimes film music needs variety.
Once the storm passes they have a difficult time getting rid of him and then to Louise's horror she discovers that Lenny was the one that attacked her before!
A big stack of unsent wedding invitations a week before the wedding?!?
We've seen this plot before, twice.
En la Cama is a film about a guy and a girl who have a one night stand, and end up opening up to each other like they never have to anyone before, and it seems at times that they wished their relationship was more than a one night thing.
'Trail of the Pink Panther' (1982) has gathered much talk about its lead star Peter Sellers, who died two years before the film was released.
I had thought (like some other people who've commented) that Sellers had actually filmed scenes for this movie but died before finishing; that's testimony that Edwards actually did a pretty good job of incorporating old footage into a new story.
Scenes we've seen before are thrust at us to pad out the running time.
We've all seen the scene before.
I was getting the feeling the movie wasn't going to move before David Niven's character (dubbed badly and most distractingly) made those comments about how the world needed men like Clouseau, etc, etc, indestructible... yawn.
Second, he wanted people to know who was behind the Panther franchise, a point made at the very start of the film when the name "Blake Edwards" fills the screen, before becoming "Blake Entertainment Edwards."
She is quite good too, but her role is confused by the script (her best sequence is not with Loggia - a sad lost opportunity by two good performers - but just before when she realizes her taxi driver is being forced to kidnap her).
However if you put to the back of your mind that this was a patchwork film made from material filmed before Sellers, and indeed Inspector Clouseau, sorry Chief Inspector Clouseau died, you may enjoy it.
Skip this one and watch the much superior Menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before.
It is also shows a great irony in today's society, where people will go to bed without knowing each other (and this probably happened even before one night stands even existed...).
Why have I never noticed such a thing on an Islamic woman ever before?
Why have I never noticed such a thing on an Islamic woman ever before?
Perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, because of course I would be noticing all the same weird things.
One female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag, then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch, without getting her hair and make-up messed up.
The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re-done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one.
He's been in Terminator (he was going to BE terminator before Arnold showed up), Aliens, AliensIII, classic B-movie Pumpkinhead, among so many others!
It has the power to tear yours out and lay it bleeding on the table before you, and it won't even give you a maniacal chuckle to which to expire.
However, the back story for Dallesandro's character isn't well developed and there isn't any character building before we plunge right into the plot).
Knowing myself a bit, I'll most likely see them...but my expectations have never before been so low!
I admired James L. Brooks before watching this film.
Now, I'm thinking that he'd better retire before his reputation is injured any further.
Mel Gibson could have thought twice before starring in this unoriginal, schmaltzy film that brings nothing new to the table and fiddles badly with sci-fi.
While he is out, things happen, his capsule gets misplaced, and, before we know it, 53 years have gone by.
Viewers have to remain patient for the first few minutes (as the film begins slowly with a sequence of his beautifully shot photos) before the story gradually unfolds.
Repeatingly telling the kids to "SHUT UP," Michael A. Goorjian has the second best scene in the movie, given the tree-house flying lesson Gibson gives Wood (but, learn how to use your wing flaps and rudder pedals properly, before trying to fly a real plane).
Marty Jannetty makes a valiant effort before succumbing to the innovative Power Plex and pin.
4/10   Texas Tornado v Mr Perfect for the Intercontinental title: Mr Perfect takes a few bumps before losing to the claw and Tornado Punch for an upset pin-fall.
2/10   'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan and Nikolai Volkoff v Orient Express: It is very weird to see Nikolai Volkoff as a face but even more weird seeing him sing 'America the Beautiful' badly with Duggan before the match.
...But I only managed to sit through half of this before I just got so frustrated with it I had to turn it off.
This is one LOOOOONNNNGGGGGG and indulgent western, proof yet again that actors or singer/songwriters need to go to film school before spending someone elses millions.
story is entertaining but almost action-free, characters are a drag, no actor emerges from this period piece, the 30's, which is lavishly filmed, but we've seen it elsewhere already... Belmondo is a lovable crook, but he's done it before...
The previews of Tulpan I'd seen weeks before looked interesting enough but sadly the film failed to excite or satisfy.
Based on a series of graphic novels by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, ÂFrom Hell' manages to incorporate a lot of genuine Ripper theories and suspects before settling on the most grandiose as its final resolution.
This is level of idiocy not seen before in any crime movie.
What's sad about that is that the writer (also the producer and director, as I mentioned before) is Indian and Hindu also.
Will they manage to save his life before the budget runs out??
However, as a caveat, there are so many odd little idiosyncrasies that I've never seen in any film before or since it's got to be worth a look for sheer car crash value alone.
A genre that before had been frowned upon and never really explored, was taken to the next level with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.
I have nothing against Cheryl or Kris but, really, didn't they read the script before they did the movie?
Ladd's the head a crack team of female time travelers who pose as flight attendants on doomed flights in the past in order to abduct the passengers before the crashes.
Naturally, potential disaster occurs, when a device used to stun passengers before their abduction is accidentally left on two separate flights, one in 1963, the other in 1989.
Make sure you are rested and had lots of coffee before watching this one.
& the 2nd reason i forgot to mention was the #1 reason i watched it off Cable was it's an Early film that "Roger The Man Corman" produced when he had NOT long before had quit directing films.
The loving God, who--like a Mafia boss--kisses you before stabbing your heart.
Not that I'm a theologian, so hey shoot me before it happens!
But he is not the only lunatic in the area, and it isn't long before the hapless youngsters meet the other members of his murderous family, including the legendary Leatherface, a maniac in a butcher's apron and a human-skin mask with a fondness for heavy-duty power tools!
One by one, the teens fall prey to the crazy killers, until only Sally is left; she endures a night of terror at the hands of cannibalistic clan, before making a break for freedom, only to be pursued by the hitchhiker and Leatherface (brandishing his revving chainsaw)...
I will think twice before snapping up any more gimmicky films from bargain bins...
The old Seinfeld crew slowly piled up the dysfunctional quirks for most of the run of the show so that we got to LIKE the characters before their "quirks" became psychopathic.
The final episode somewhat ridiculously relegated them to a jail cell which few fans could honestly lament, but we stayed to the end because of that deep well of affection and identification we had built up before they went off the deep end (well, the *supporting* Kramer was always pretty much there, but we were only given him in relatively small doses).
Everyone who took part in this movie should be ashamed.Even actors who I actually like have totally collapsed before my eyes.Seeking any deep meaning and symbolism in this movie is just absurd.It completely lacks any originality.Istead there is some kind of redneckish humour in which there can't be any allegory - it is what it is - incredibly flat and superficial.I love sex jokes but they should at least be funny,not just a line of dirty words and gross images of horny old people.I voted with one star just because there is no option to vote with half or less,but this movie doesn't deserve even that much (well,maybe for the music,but that is quite merciful).Seriously,one of the worst movies ever made.
Well, when you go to the cinema, find 2/3 of the seats empty and, before the movie is half, see more than half of the viewers leave the room before the movie has ended...  Talking about the story will not take very long, because there just isn't much of a story to be found in this movie.
I want to clear something up right away before all the fans start clicking "no."
In this sense it was a lot like "Psycho"; before it, there wasn't much to compare it to.
She is found and taken in by the most multi-ethnic 'native tribe' that I've ever seen, including a woman who looks like she put on too much bronzer before she went on set.
What you see has been seen several times before.
Also, the preview/trailer for this movie, had Jason Biggs and the 4 chicks when they say "have you ever been with 4 women before?"
Some people, who have never seen it before, wonder what's so great about it after watching it for the first time, well, this is probably because TCM is the most copied movie of all time and TCM will look too familiar to newbies.
You can really see the difference in movies made before TCM and those made after TCM became a big hit.
The unrelentingly blunt, chaotic, savage, take-no-prisoners attitude of TCM was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before and this aspect of TCM is what makes it truly groundbreaking.
I was physically attracted to Forlani before this role.
The tone, and their fate, is set, and it is only a matter of time before the teenagers will become meat to a local cannibal family.
The script for Slap Shot 2-Breaking the Ice should have been thoroughly reviewed over and over with a fine-tooth comb before they started filming.
($100 dollar bills raining from the sky will happen first before another sequel ever does thanks to this one.)
The story is a Hans Christian Anderson tale about a pauper girl who finds brief comfort in the matches she's trying to sell until the cold eventually wins and takes her life away--not before, however, she so escapes into her imagination to find comfort, warmth, and love.
The first encounter with notorious chainsaw-wielding Leatherface is as disorienting as anything that comes before it.
Isn't this part of the time-honed Argentine tradition of eating the cake before having it?
As I said before, love concept is illogical also, as they madly fall in love in some guys that they have just seen.
It is a good idea for any director to first study the culture and mentality of a country before staining the name of a whole nation.
The man speaks and acts bizarrely, and then slashes himself and Franklin with a straight razor before being forced from the group's van.
The tension that this movie generates is overwhelming at times, and if you watch it with someone who's never seen it before, be sure to keep your eye on them.
Well if sex and flying worked before, why not again.
I had no idea who Dylan and Cole Sprouse were and after seeing this film, I was surprised to learn that they had a career in film--both before AND after this terrible movie.
I've seen corny and cutesy movies before, but I usually have no problem avoiding them.
He remembers "everything" before the brutal incident but is only unable to remember the "new incidents" for a long time.
In Ghajini, the hero is a psychologically affected person who lives in a shabby manner and even forgets people whom he met before the tragedy.
Therefore, I recommend him to exercise the use of English subtitles or better hire an English-Tamil translator before going on to adapt another Hollywood masterpiece.
Imagine remaking "Titanic" with fight scenes on the ship deck, duet songs with many dancers and some mother-sister sentiment and a long dialogue by Jack before he drowns in the sea.
Before I start I did watch this movie twice, i didn't like it at all when I saw for the first first then watched it watched it second, i did find it bit more funny then before.
It's easy to take shots at 50s horror flicks featuring people you'd never heard of before, nor will ever hear from again.
Did they even read the script before accepting this acting gig?
I read the book before going to the cinema, probably one of the best and worst things that I did.
The show started off like serious topics and guests like Jerry Springer had started off with before.
It just has an uncomfortable atmosphere, as the audience are very unsympathetic, and pre-judge people, before even considering that their accuser could be in the wrong too.
I also don't like the construction of the show, recapping what the guests are saying before they arrive on the stage is unnecessary, when they can just say it when Maury asks them to.
She then rants and raves until Maury is certain that the crowd is strictly behind her before he lets them hear what the man has to say on a one minute video clip.
This goes on for about ten minutes before he practically screams that the results are in.
I have never seen such a ridiculous movie before, and it shocks me that it has gotten as many stars as it has on IMDb.
So...I do not watch "Entourage", and before today I had no idea who Adrian Grenier was.
When movie dialog is so flat, so much less than ordinary speech, and so affectedly slow that the viewer hears each line 3 times mentally before it's actually spoken, something is wrong.
It's a shame that this was Christopher Reeve's last movie before he was paralyzed.
The original "Village of the Damned" was a taut, lean black-and-white story of some telepathic alien kids growing up in an English village, causing grief and anxiety before being collectively extinguished by their professor, the only person in the village whom they needed.
Although the most prolific of those directors who rose from the ranks of exploitation films in the 70s, John Carpenter's flame may have burned the brightest but it also burned the most briefly before he descended into lifeless hackwork.
Now she has to find the person responsible for the murder before it's too late.
Only things go terribly wrong when her target is murdered before she can make a clean getaway.
I don't remember if the Asian market crash was before or after this movie.
Probably after, but if it came before this movie I would point at that as a source of resentment towards globalization.
"Akira" is the closest thing that I can think of off the top of my head and it probably beats this title on every level so go watch that before you resort to watching this.
Although most people miss it, there was a real reason for this battle, even though it happened right before the ceasefire.
Terrible on all aspects- script, acting, CGI effects (on par with the Xena or Hercules TV shows from a decade before).
Let me start this with a lesson: don't lend a movie to your friend before you've seen it, especially if you are supposed to be reviewing it for the internet's finest horror movie site.
Sure, you probably want to see it before you see "Raptor Island 2" (which seems to be getting better reviews).
Whoever told the actors where to shoot, obviously didn't speak before hand with the FX guys, because the actors shoot all over the place, and never hit the raptors.
Whenever the raptors bite or slash someone before eating them, the person disappears, and there's only a few drops of blood.
While I can't blame MOONBIRD completely (after all, Columbia studios, Creston Studios and others produced cheap animation well before MOONBIRD), it is shocking when you compare the ultra-simple Eric Carle-style cartoon here with gorgeous MGM or Looney Toons cartoons in their heyday.
The character of Will was the young boy who found out he was endowed with magic before Harry Potter was even created and I'm sad to see them throw away these books with a quick production to try to catch the coattails of the Potter craze.
Wait until it comes on TV and you have absolutely nothing else to do before you bother watching it.
I am a HUGE fan of the books - but even with my many readings and understanding of the plot - it was still at least 45 minutes in before I figured out who Merriman was :( Some good actors in there - I often wondered how they must feel, locked into a contract and just KNOWING that they are involved in something truly awful.
As Executive Producer Gregory Peck is said to have had the original 20 minutes of the film cut from the theatrical final version because he wasn't in it and felt too much time would be spent before the star of the film makes his on first screen appearance.
The Rider keeps on appearing before our young hero, and sending demonic mall security guards and evil grannies who can summon snakes after him.
The opening moments has a mysterious atmosphere, and got me interested before the movie decided to brush off its own explanations.
It's at least interesting before the disappointment hits.
Announcing at the same time that he changed the script from younger British boy to older American boy to avoid having yet another Harry... Well, Susan Cooper's book series the Rising of the Dark sequence was written long before Harry Potter and it has all the material for a good movie.
Right before the end, after he visits Mitnick, our Nakamura or so starts to seriously regret what he did.
He's fully conscious of the racism he's feeling at home just before the civil rights revolution and can't really come up with a reason to die for Korea or do time in the army stockade for desertion.
**SPOILERS** (If you've never seen a horror film before)  The victims turn out to be the children of lynch mob members who hung a man outside the asylum 15 years earlier, who've been lured there and trapped inside.
This was well before his fame in Night Court, as the tall bumbling court security guard, and the casting choice is hilarious.
Director Michael Katleman patiently waits a good 45 minutes before properly showing the crocodile Â and hence effectively builds up tension Â and it has to be said the animal looks very impressive.
The movie isn't all bad though, the crocodile is quite nasty when it pops up, there are one or two nice, brutal kills, some laughs and good CGI for the crock - as well as like I said before, good acting and a good cast.
But there is another major problem that takes the story to a completely different place, where there is a huge war going on and starts to terrorize these reporters and one by one they are killed off before the crocodile gets to them.
I have never left a movie before, but this was too much.
The B&W filming was really gritty and captured the whole pointlessness of the battle that was Pork Chop Hill, right before the 1953 Armistice.
This dud was in the theater for one week before it disappeared, and when I went I was the only person in the audience!
Now, now, before you go and reply back or whatever, hear me out, good god.
I had seen all the "faces of death" films ,i wasn't shocked or anything at all with these films and as said before they had some documentary feeling However... watching this film (partly)i had the same feeling.... until the incredible evil torture against animals,this is so sickening violent that i had to to something,if only to warn people not to spread this filth,(as a torrent,(OR ANY OTHER WAY)To my amazement i saw that this movie is widely sold and advertised.
Most of this actually bored me as I can only watch so much cadaver carving before I am ready to watch something else.
The list of equally as nasty sights and sounds just goes on and on from there I'm sorry to say these, however, were just some of the more shocking and severely stomach-churning things that viewers should probably be made aware of before watching as they are sure to horrify, if not psychologically scar you, depending on the fragility of your mental state at the time of viewing.
Following is a repeat of above text because I've already said it all, but IMDb rules require 10 lines of text before a review can be submitted: Don't waste your time on this boring movie.
Release: Premier January 8, 2008 Directed by: James Tucker Written by: Joshua Nelson  Starring: Melissa Bacelar as Delilah Joshua Nelson as Brandon Joshua James as Edgar Emma Hinz as Daisy Bridget Megan Clark as Holly  Savage Rose Pictures and Lost Angeles Films have teamed up before, notably on the project Eat Your Heart Out starring the ravishing Melissa Bacelar.
The visual of the prune-face mask becomes relevant when one of the crazies, Edgar, escapes and dons the mask before embarking on a murderous and pillaging rampage that ends in an abduction of Delilah (Bacelar) and the quest for her rescue by boyfriend Brandon (Joshua Nelson).
Charlton Heston hams it up like never before as a beaver-trapper reluctant to make way for progress and accept the fact that his precious trade is being supplanted by finer materials like silk; Brian Keith provides the brightest spot in the film as Heston's foul-mouthed partner, along with Michel Legrand's beautiful score and the desolate snowy landscapes.
The only good scene in this movie is in the beginning, so basically you can save a lot of wasted time if you stop before the opening title appears.
Moreover, when Jed tries to flag Hunt down, the sheriff sees the jacket taken off his murdered deputy and shoots first before he can confirm Jed's story.
I bow down before thee oh King of Garbage.
Can they stop Father Seaton before another person dies?
I wish I could give it more but it needs some more editing in places before it would be totally pleasing.
And there it was, writ in letters as tall as coffin nails: "not that there is anything in this movie that we haven't seen before...".
The acting is forgettable from no-one I have ever heard of before.
This love-story of his is sooooo boring, 1000 times to be seen before and flat as a sheet of paper!
Go to see it now, but donÂ´t forget to take a big glass of water before.
The combination of director James Tucker and writer Joshua Nelson has hit the monkey for dinner on the head before - Aunt Rose, Addiction, and Skinned Alive are titles you cant go wrong with on a blind purchase.
Eventually there is a big showdown, and if you've ever seen one Western before you'll be able to predict how it ends up, except that by then we have established a sympathy bond with Van Cleef, who never allows himself to really be as scummy as his gang and insists on being protective + helpful to Garrett's kidnapped, jailbaitish sister, and doesn't jump her pretty bones because he has a little bambino back at home who loves his poppa.
Kid Vengeance stars a kid, Leif Garrett in the days right before he became a pop bubblegum teen idol.
And that inspired me to watch another hour before giving up.
You need to rescue all the little sprogs in every level before you meet the end-level boss.
before strutting his lethal stuff.
These werewolves have developed from the weird pink things they were before and now have fur, proper fangs and scary yellow eyes!
i mean couldn't they just shoot the film in Toledo for crying out loud or at least try to learn about the city before trying to represent it on film.
The club that the Donnelly's tried to take over was an old Checker Auto Parts Store before they closed it down.
Across the street from the Hassayampa was the old Library, I used to go to that Library when I was a little girl before they built the new one.
In the end, the nekkid chick is defeated, but not  before taking the mask off and reminding me why I broke up with  my high school girlfriend.
), irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous, nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!)
Matt Riker and his band of comrades must track them down and destroy them, before they kill again.
In the distant future, failed filmmaker Ridley Scott built a time machine and decided to go back in time to film MUTANT HUNT, what many in this future consider the greatest film of all-time, before it is actually made.
The film doesn't really have much to keep you interested and it had the feel that I'd seen it a score or more time before.
The film is sharply, if erratically, shot, but most paying audiences will surely lose patience with Alex and his associates long before the film has ended.
It's an entertaining film that offers quite a lot of gory make-up effects and nasty scenery, but the screenplay is absolute rubbish and doesn't contain anything you haven't seen millions of times before.
In a movie with a runtime of 83 minutes before the credits roll, you'd expect the first main character would die a little sooner than 60 minutes in.
Having said that, there was a lot going for this...some nice shock surprises (albeit totally unbelievable, if the killer is supernatural like Michael Meyers it needs to be established, how  else could he be EVERYwhere at the same time, and know the kids' next moves before they make them?).
I didn't like any of the characters and we've seen them all before in so many other films (by different names perhaps).
With echoes to House of 1000 Corpses, Funhouse and other similarly set films this is the sort of thing that we've all seen before, assuming we've been watching horror films for an period of time.
no not really, but its far from gripping simply because its so similar to stuff we've seen before.
I though I'd seen the worst of the "8 Films to Die For" already but now that I've proved I haven't I think I'll just stop before I waste any more time on them.
!The one thing I'm going to say is that this is the first movie I couldn't stand and turned it off before the end!
They head out in an awesome van, run into a crazy old eccentric, and even pick up a crazy hitchhiker, before deciding to stay the night in a legendary 'Dark Ride', which is now being re-opened despite the fact that some nutjob murdered sixteen people there not even twenty years ago.
I was able to say lines before the characters because it was so obvious where the story was going (i.e.
But--all in all--this is a slow, boring horror film that you've seen hundreds of time before--only better.
You've seen it dozens of times before, and even those other ones weren't that good.
there was nothing good about this movie nothing  nothing  if i could give it negative stars i would  if i was missing some sort of underlying "purposely-awful-movie-for-the-sake-of-irony" vibe  then i might understand more  some scenes attempt introspective depth and just come off as being cheesy  the humor is interspersed in a sporadic low-brow way  the impression it gives me is that the author only respects artists who are good at realism before they paint abstract things  the movie gives off an alienating attitude and shallow view of the subject filmed  the characters are mediocre at best  it's too bad cause ghost world wasn't that bad
It was as if the writer and director scrapped the initial blueprint and started a new, much less enjoyable movie, somewhere before act 2.
Art School Confidential is a simply terrible movie built from a script that needed dozens of rewrites before it would've been coherent.
I had already figured out the twist in the storyline long before the audience was supposed to get it and spent the next hour bored out of my mind.
Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair.
Maybe it will be a long time before she makes another piece of trash like this.
She was better off before her family hired him to "help" her.
But the court case is a divorce proceeding, not a criminal suit, and one of the car accidents occurs off-camera before the story even commences.
New York artist Joan Crawford, living in a rather elaborate 'hovel', marries ex-soldier and widower Henry Fonda as a response to lover Dana Andrews constantly putting his wife, children, and business before her.
Charles Quigley, Gene, had a good career but died of cirrhosis of the liver before he turned sixty.
Anyone who's ever been to a Pink Floyd concert has seen it all before - and better.
Lastly; how could Joe go back to 1985 and explain to the card dealer that the card he showed him before now is autographed.
for about a minute before I could even remember it at all - it was that bad.
And other things, like the inconsistent use of the sad doll before each killings or the inexplicable appearance (and disappearance) of the film's other male character, the one seen at the diner table.
Breeding sharks for medical reasons, hmmÂ Now where have we seen that before?
With no direction to write home about and no performances of note this film has been dome before and so much better.
But it's not long before the film loses its novelty value and becomes tedious in the extreme, repeating the same gags (00 sliding along the floor with his gun, hiding in tiny places and acting cool with the ladies) ad nauseum.
Seen it all before & the dialogue is really flat, it feels like the actor's are reading from cue cards just off screen that were written in a rush, the dialogue just doesn't feel that personal & has no life to it.
But first before the curtain of celibacy falls, he wants to have a fling or two, so Jim is on the make for Bette and for the young Janis Paige.
Hmm, where have I seen this before?
Rather, Slick had a nice holiday/sex-spree ...um, I mean, crisis of faith... before knuckling down to work.
There is a critical clue that should allow the viewer to identify the true culprit before the end of the movie.
I know that the guy couldn't act, but still- let him put on his greed face that he'd been practicing in the mirror)  I kept hoping that Matt LeBlanc, who I love on "friends", and liked in "Lost in Space" had agreed to do this before he had a going career, like Jennifer Aniston and "Leprechaun."
Parents: do your homework before watching some of these "family" films because some of them are the normal crude comedies of today's Hollywood.
If you think the kid had a short attention span, I would have to inform you that this is the same kid that watched Lion King from start to finish every night for a month two years before this.
This is just in case those of you who shop at Diabolik are going here before purchasing this on DVD and are going by the other reviews, here's an accurate review of the movie.
Enjoy watching the inter-related stories of the dog suffering humiliation from every family member before engineering an escape to the outdoors, a short family holiday film, and the longer adventure of the dog failing to protect the home from thieves, being sent to attack dog training school, and... well you'll have to see.
Both versions have only a brief time to convince us Johnny and Sarah are in love before they are torn apart.
Now, Billy Jack likes to talk even more to his combatants before kicking their heads in.
She obviously realized that she needed to try and save her career before finishing this celluloid debacle, but little realized they would attempt to finish it without her.
So, without really analyzing the film (which I wouldn't do before I read the original 13 page William Gibson story, which incidentally has NO dialogue), I'd just like to cast my vote for using your 92 minutes wisely and viewing some of Ferrara's better films instead of this one.
Spending last night drafting my review of "Lord Of War" (only watched it the night before) and not really getting anywhere, I was distracted by the BBC who occasionally broadcast films that I have never heard of but still persuade me to watch.
Despite this, she works for a middle-aged couple (Derek de Lint and Alice Krige) looking after their infant child but before long, tragedy strikes when the baby is also killed in a fire.
As it stands, "Gangs of the Dead" is pretty much just the same old song and dance you've seen before, and done better by other movies as well.
I saw movie called 48 weeks later, why have I never heard of this movie before?, So picked up thinking it was a sequel to 28 Days later and it even says on the DVD what happens after 28 days later which is a massive lie.
John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good job  Now he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)  We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in it  The main problem is actually the storytelling, direction  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined  Ajay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredients  The comedy by Sushant Singh is poor  The film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it further  Direction by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okay  Amongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
Take absolutely no notice of positive reviews or quotes made about this film to save yourself 100 minutes; even though you'll most probably give up on this film before the end, if you ever pluck up the courage to watch it as a frightful joke (and even then I'm concerned for your sanity).
Seen that before.
Seen that before.
A young man (Kenneth Branagh) mad with the passion to create a living being in his own image recklessly instills life into a humanoid made from the bodies of dead men and creates a hapless, but unnaturally durable creature played uncharacteristically by Robert De Niro and before long, his mistake of playing God soon leads to chaos and people near to him fall victim and before long, he soon takes the responsibility of purging the creature under his own wing.
The book is fresh in my mind, as I finished reading it a mere 20 hours before watching the so-called movie version, and the only thing this movie had in common w/the book was the fact that there was a creature in it!
Please Branagh and Lady, spare us the grief and actually read the book before you blunder into putting someone else's name on your crap!
THe movie also lacks consistency and logic.SPOILERS How does a doctor who can bring a creature to life for the first time in human history study it for a matter of minutes before mistakingly thinking it is dead, and then just leaving the body hanging from his ceiling.
He is so stereotypical that he snugs his chin into his chest before going in for the kill, A typical horror film clichÃ©.
I've never had a "the worst movie I've ever seen" before.
However as a fan, I felt as though I had to watch it before casting a summary judgment.
By about midway, I was wondering whether the film would end up like The Usual Suspects, where the ending would force the viewer to re-evaluate everything that had gone before.
The fact is, they start insulting Canada before they consider a cold war with Canada (i.e.
I did recognise Chris Penn but I don't know what I've seen him in before, possibly Reservoir Dogs.
Photographed by A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Jacques Haitkin through layers of murk designed to conceal a multitude of budgetary deficiencies, and 'distinguished' by flashy editing and gymnastic camera-work designed to conceal the lack of a comprehensible plot, Tony Randel's unconvincing future noir trades the visionary outlook of the original graphic novel for the same lumbering, humorless approach which typified this particular subgenre before US producers *finally* learned how to imitate their Asian counterparts.
Its biggest fault seems to be it does nothing I haven't seen done better dozens of times before.
One of them a perverted old man, another one is a lady that looks like a man but dressed as a woman that comes up creeping on the young girls from time to time, another is a geeky photographer trying to loose his virginity and another one is a man that wants to get the virgin first before the cult does.
Anyone like well-known Sharon Stone may draw some audiences in, but before long word of mouth should sink good old "Gloria" faster than the Titanic.
The lack of a focused direction, informative introduction, and defined characters sunk this film before it even had the opportunity to leave port.
The twee goings-on advance the preposterous premise that Guy Bennett (based on Guy Burgess) went Commie because he was gay, and was thrown out of school before he got to wear his foppish upper-classmen vest.
Hubbard may have come up with this concept before these other references but with such a saturated sci-fi market they look like pale imitations.
Music during the film sounds like you've heard it before 5).
Buildings remain, though surely they would crumble long before 1000 years with no maintenance, and the cities would be overgrown as the grass and trees reclaim the earth.
This is definitely the movie people need to see before they take "Scientology" seriously.
So, I put on Spoorloos, and although I've seen it a few times before, it once again grabbed my interest, and I noticed, right away, a few details that make this version far superior to its American counterpart.
Apparently the filmmakers and producers were aiming high with this movie, they were dreaming another "Star Wars" trilogy in the making with thousand of millions wasted in merchandising, action figures and promotion, several spin off were planned before the premiere(including a sequel and even an animation series!)
The second is laughably, horribly bad starring a VERY unattractive actress as a cop who wants to get kinky with a guy she never met before.
Uncle Carl visits Ingrid's house, and remembers how  he slept with his sister before he drowned her in the bathtub, she  did not commit suicide.
It isn't long before someone begins stalking Ingrid, and the mystery begins.
This movie was made before "Pi," but I don't think Darren Aronofsky used this movie as a blueprint.
I'd heard of "The Vanishing" before, and how it was hailed as a psychological chiller classic, but I had no idea that the version that I was aware of was actually a remake of a 1980s French/Dutch film.
Some plot-lines are meant to be connected in a clever way, but we have seen too much of this before, and some parts are so generic-made it's painful.
I have seen Murder before, so her physique was kind of a disappointment here, but I'll catch the glimpse nonetheless!
I only watched it because the reviewer before me said there was comedy in here, but I failed to spot anything, and I mean anything funny - at all.
The image is surprisingly haunting, a human body inside the twisting metal of the tower, but it's not enough to make up for the gross sins that have come before it.
Not only did the studio pick an actor who looked COMPLETELY non-Japanese, but his part looked like a live-action version of the old Hoshimoto cartoons (as for his 'method acting', I think Marlon Brando watched dozens of these before attempting the part).
for me,this is probably the worst Scooby Doo animated movie i have seen.i found it boring and not that funny compared to other Scooby adventures.the i didn't think the story was very good either.there seemed to be a lot more repetition than in other Scooby movies.there are also a few elements missing from this particular movie(that i most Scooby Do movies) and one element that was nothing other than annoying and i really could have done without.those elements are that only Shag and Scoob are in this movie.the rest of Mystery,INC are absent.the element i could have done without is the inclusion of Scrappy Doo,which to me is a pointless character.i had to struggle not turn this movie off before the end.this is the exception with Scooby Doo movies,so far in my experience.for me "Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers" is a 4/10
Too many tequila sunrises were adding up for this director, and though he still had bullets in his gun, he wasn't placing them as well as before.
We have seen the storyline a million times before.
It's watchable on a Saturday afternoon just before the family arrives.
Pastorelli seemed to draw from the hell he was in shortly before his death to make the character his own.
And one of Harry's elderly visitors goes levitating to her death, but not before uttering a phrase that Karen has mumbled in her sleep: "Pana witchi salatou."
The plot is simple enough to explain, seems a demon like creature called the manitou is growing on Tony Curtis' wife and he must try to stop this evil entity before it is to late.
I remember before it premiered, the buzz was mostly questioning whether the US was ready for such an "unpleasant" central character.
Perhaps the character of Fitz WAS before the time was right.
This gag MIGHT have been funny, except that I could clearly see the actor playing the statue (in body paint) fidgeting slightly before he was meant to start moving, so I knew that the 'statue' was alive all along.
This silent film is included in Laurel and Hardy film collection, and it only features on of the pair, but I had to see what he was doing before he got with his partner.
The women casted seemed to have been on a street corner only days before and was lured to this show with a promise of a roof over their head, a pool and a chance to'win' dates on TV, in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers with a 'big' star - Flava-Flav.
It was either another game of rummy with my wife or a reality show I hadn't seen before.
This movie is not as horrible, in my opinion as many before me had stated.
Lost of comedy relief from PHIL SILVERS and CHARLES WINNINGER, some nice song and dance numbers for Grable, and the whole backstage story is easy to take, the usual misunderstandings and schemes backfiring before the fadeout to a happy ending.
Watch ANY other MoH-episode before giving this a try.
enough of how bad the movie is, let's move on to the plot of the movie  so Hero's parents are murdered and he decides to move to America, his wife becomes pregnant on the night before he moves and the wife and her brother decides to look up Hero to tell him the good news, on the day that she concieves her twins, one (the daughter) is taken away by a corrupted chinese guy co operating with the japanese ninjas that are looking for a duel with Hero and his master Pride.
After one character says a "funny" line, it's followed by a silent beat as if it's allowing time for the audience to laugh before the story continues.
Mark Burnett's other show, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.
Like I said before, the acting is good from Gwyneth Paltrow but not really right for a comedy type of movie.
One is burnt alive in a tanning bed, a girl is attacked by an army of spiders which seem to have made a home underneath her skin inside a bite that protrudes(this is done through CGI, but is particularly skin-crawlingly effective), one's penis is fried on an electric fence, and another is sliced and diced with a broken whiskey bottle by the ghoulish Mary herself(this death is said to have occurred by a falling candy machine..one almost kills him before Mary attacks).
You know what's going to happen before it happens.
If you're extremely bored and there's nothing else to watch I suggest this to waste some time before a show comes on.
Like their plans were successful every time before... And having a quarrel in front of all the scared Potentials?
I saw this when it came on TV once, all i knew about this movie before I watched it, was that it had something to do with a werewolf.
The time line of the movie makes little sense, but thats OK because the script is so bad, the characters are so poorly done and the execution of the film is so bad that you'll be screaming for someone to hand you the remote before one more minute of this clichÃ© ridden, badly written waste of disc space goes by.
I mean, any time most people buy or rent such a movie, they think before they even reach for their wallet, "Oh, my my my...this is going to be bad."
The only thing you need to know before watching this is it falls right in line with all the other low budget failures that have been flooding the zombie genre lately.
I almost took the DVD out and broke it in half when, about 10 seconds later, pitchfork guy requests a bullet to the head before having even been touched by a zombie.
I mean i had a Public Access Show in Atlanta GA in 1999 where people sent me stuff (for you kids, Public Access is how you got stuff played before YouTube), and even though the movies were cheap and low budget and technically 'bad', it was for that type of genre.
The dialog and actors leave you to believe they were selected minutes before the shooting and given no script as they make quite a few mistakes.
In one scene a couple is listening to the radio on their car stereo and when the girl reaches to turn it up... the scene cuts to live news broadcasts on a television highlighting the zombie uprising before cutting back to the pair in the car discussing the "magical" TV broadcasts?
And, how does Micah remember his father if he's only a teen and the original Gatlin slaughtering was like 12 years before this movie even happened?
Most of the idiot town gets burned alive at a town meeting but not before some toxic corn subplot is introduced.
It's pretty much the same mixture as before, but we also get boring troubles between father and son, perfunctory romances, and corn-this and corn-that.
This film does have its good scenes, mainly when Danny is arguing with his dad, the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American teen horrorfest.
Bad ass phychopath, Shadow (Candyman's Tony Todd) is executed, but not before starting a full scale riot resulting in many prisoner deaths.
Focusing on the new inmate, Solitaire (Carla Greene), a tough girl who Shadow was planning to sacrifice when she was a baby, it isn't long before the zombies of the prisoners led by Shadow himself are out to finish what he started.
First this has been done numerous times before and I don't just mean the premise...the actual Locusts thing and it's just dumb.
The film has one or two spots of slight excitement before dive bombing into B-Movie crap.
Angela phones her friend Amanda (Conchita Puglisi) to pick her up at the train station but Angela is brutally murdered before the train arrives, outside the station Amanda is also murdered.
Have the people making these movies -ever- before watched a horror film before making this atrocity?
So A1 dreams of the sexy dark-haired plod who arrests him just before he wakes up chained to the lav with D'abo.
I've seen all that's in this movie once before.
Yet she still has to match the results with the packaging before she reacts.
He's got that greasy, unwashed look to him like he's on a three-day bender and has had one too many bottles of Scotch and just finished his third pack of cigarettes before noon.
To finish this off i promise i was trying hard to think something nice to say about the movie but it happens to be so long and so slow, that when you get to an action scene or to an important part of the story you are so bored from what happened before that they go unappreciated.
Didn't the coroner determine that Aunt Louise was already dead before the stake, the so-called murder weapon was used to sacrifice, not kill, her by the insane Mottram?
She is constantly kissing and hugging him, and several times before leaving says she'll miss him.
See this if you want to be more bored than you were before you did anything, yes, it is actually better to do nothing than watch this piece of crap.
It's Mark Rolston who makes the movie, appeared before in Corman's Humanoids from the deep and Saw V he gives a perfect performance, made me even think a bit of pinhead from hellraiser.
HmmÂ where have I seen this before.
This movie isn't the way it's poster shows, and I assure you that if you don't consider my comment as a friendly warning then you'll feel very sorry after or even before finishing this movie.
The very best scene in this movie takes place about a half hour before the end.
...that utterly fails to live up to its quirky progenitor, "From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money" is only worth the time spent watching it to vampire geeks, of whom only the most indiscriminate will be pleased, and/or Tarantino/Rodriguez completists, who will remain bemused as to whether or not these renowned auteurs even bothered to read writer/director Scott "Evil Dead 2" Spiegel's script before bankrolling this mess.
Lucy Lawless was outstanding as Dr. Maddie Rierdon, a woman who is both intelligent and resourceful and who, because of who she is, has to put the welfare of those endangered by the locusts before her relationship with her husband.
My friend rented it thinking it would be hardboiled, it of course wasn't, even though the clerk at the store assured him it was and said he had rented it before.
I only managed to watch the first 30mins of the first episode of this drivel, before I turned it off.
First of all; why couldn't they get one person to take them away years before the daughter became grown.
I decided to smoke a little reefer before then started to watch at first I was thinking to myself okay not the best but maybe it will get better.
Given an intelligent editor before the script was finished, there might have been a good movie.
Essentially the story is set before Christmas with the dropping of troops via gliders into Holland to secure a secret mission involving looted Nazi treasure.
The Germans are fast-driving to capture it and send it to Berlin before the Allies land.
There`s also other serious flaws to the script like the terrible lines that belong in a CARRY ON movie , lines like " When you said uncover the agent ... " and watch out for the obvious revealing mistakes like harnesses attached to the actors as they float in the air and the laughably bad back projection  One final thing I couldn`t help noticing is that several of the cast seemed to have consumed a large amount of alcohol before filming .
It may be the ugliest display of star ego before Sean Connery got his hands on 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.
Okay, I'll admit before I go any further that I don't particularly like the Matt Helm films.
The villains are nobodies, the gadgets are not as cool as before (levitating gun < delayed / reverse firing gun), the climactic vehicular chase has worse rear projection than the Abbott and Costello movies, and the entire enterprise is slow, unexciting and drab.
Well at least we know that the hormonal kinks must have been worked out before July of 1969 when Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins went to the moon
This sort of thing has been done many times before with bees,slugs,rats and even ticks so why not a creature feature with locusts.
The acting is forgettable from no-one I have ever heard of before.
For instance, the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact.
I only caught the last half-hour of CBS' last hastily served pseudo-big event, "Spring Break Shark Attack," and only the young that hasn't seen "Jaws" didn't know what that movie was before seeing it.
We've seen it all before, done better.
But I always wondered what destroyed his acting career (before his comeback a few years ago in Ulee's Gold).
First of all, that occurred before we knew the Delos scientists were engineering human clones of the world leaders.
I think there may have been one more entry in the series before it mercifully expired.
Four years before Peter Jackson's Sumatran rat-monkey caused a whole heap of trouble for Lionel in Braindead, director Giuliano Carnimeo introduced fans of Italian horror to Ratman, an equally troublesome simian/rat hybrid played by the world's smallest actor, Nelson De La Rosa.
This "Interview" dates from the year before the controversial filmmaker's death.
This film was decadent for the time of Berlin before Hitler's rise to power.
My favorite part of the film is not the brilliant editing techniques, oh no, it's the incredible plot twists that I hinted at before.
I expected a funeral before the credits started rolling.
Speaking of spoilers, all the way through this, about four scenes before something happens, I kept thinking, "Oh, he's this" or "He'll discover this" or "The killer isÂ" Despite the fact I thought the movie was well shot, the locales made the most of the depressing city it portrays and Quaid did an above-average job, as he almost always does, the movie was very flat, (again) predictable and too clichÃ©d.
Basically the movie's about a detective bent on finding a killer or killers in so-called random murders, with clues left behind, before the next person dies!
Side note: I'm surprised I didn't get the phrase "Come and See" before Quaid's character did; I've heard it before listening to one of my favorite songs more than a dozen times: Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around.'
Other than seeing a young Sandra Bullock looking cute in a film that was made before she was a star, there is not a lot of positive things I can say.
The plot is simple - the titular characters fall in love, clichÃ©d plot devices pull them apart, before getting back together for a feel-good ending.
I've seen some bad acting before, especially in gradeschool plays I've been forced to see, but never before have I seen acting worse than on Addams Family Reunion.
Out of the other two actors, one never worked on comedy before and the other was responsible for such drivel as Casper and Richie Rich, which is comedy but is extremely childish.
We have addressed the issue of performances within performances before Â and the usual question is "Who would pay money to see this?"
Joke free and even stingier on the plot front than before, this uses its holiday resort mix-up plot in which the Addams family are accidentally reunited with the unrelated Adams family as a slim excuse for a series of underdeveloped subplots and idiotic slapstick.
"976-Evil" has an absurdly implausible plot and it takes far too long before the (tepid) gore & action kicks in.
Teenage biker-punk Spike (Patrick O'Neal), an indebted gambler, is able to use the words of wisdom bestowed upon him and break free of his poker habit before the hot line's influence has a chance to truly take hold of him.
Bullied and unlucky with the ladies, he dials 976-EVIL and before you know it, the otherwise good boy with good morals goes from fundamentalist Christian to practicing Satanist in the time it takes for you to dial that evil number.
There is panic in the Klan's ranks and Cochran's character is shot and killed just before the ensuing mÃªlÃ©e.
20 mins into the movie and Pumpkinhead is created not this time by the witch but rather by some "thrill seeking teenagers" and I actually believe the group labels themselves as "thrill seekers" before they resurrect Mr.
Think twice before showing it to the kids!
This film just must have not been thought out well before it was made.
Normally, I never watch sequels before I saw the originals but since I had already paid for it I continued watching.
It's like a runner in baseball thinking he has to touch all 100 bases before he can score.
As a result, considerable guerilla activity occurred in the South both before and during the war itself.
I know why I have never seen Grover in a film before he is bad...
In fact,we're lucky it was made before gays took over; most films now have to have at least one gay scene, no matter how stupid.
I caught it late night on a movie channel and it's not so terrible that you wouldn't want to watch it if there wasn't anything else on but it would be a cold day before I'd pay any money to own it.
Many of the scenes are shot with such quick flashes you barely are able to even witness it before it is gone.
It put a truckload of trite sci-fi elements in what was just a fantasy story, it denied everything that happened before... literally.
and "Well, the whole thing can't be bad, there's got to be something good before the ending."
lots of ppl, including us , left 20 mins before the end, quite a few patrons were quite angry at how ineptly bad it was.
Then, it heads off to the planet Zeist 500 years before.
I'd say the film is pretty much divided between being on Earth in 2024 and Zeist 500 years before, but I think it was meant to be on Earth in 2024.
Her final speech to Michael York ("How soon would it be before we started hating each other?")
All of the stories were original (well, I've heard them as urban legends before, but I never saw them done in a movie before) but this doesn't mean they are enjoyable.
They say you get more feeling from reading a book before you watch a film, if Executions was a text I doubt you would want to ever see a film of it as you would then understand that sometimes the graphic components ARE stronger than written text.
Jim Jarmusch has made decent, worthy films before (Dead Man especially) but this ain't one of em.
Not since Alex Cox's "Straight to Hell" have I had such a shoddy, amateurish work put before me by a director whose work I otherwise like.
The performers, even granted that they had little to work with, were visibly floundering; given that they were for the most part playing themselves, they never came across as people who actually existed, or that they had any reason to talk to the people playing opposite them; most often, they couldn't even convince me that they had ever actually drank coffee before.
The final scene is two old guys, both of which you've seen before but you're not quite sure where, talking about some piece of classical music.
These elements are the music of the cabaret, the lives of the principal characters, and the world outside of their narrow domain...   Director Bob Fosse captures the atmosphere and turmoil of the time and place, just before Hitler's rise to power, presenting a multifaceted portrait of a hedonistic, increasingly dangerous society, in which every brushstroke is significant and influential...
my sister and i had all four movies in the "House" series and decided to have a "House" marathon.we had just watched the first one,and had somehow made it to the end.but it wasn't easy.it was not a good film, at all.so, we suffered through the second one in.we managed to make it through 40 minutes of this dog, before we finally had to put it to sleep.this movie made the first one seem like Shakespeare in comparison.
The actors are very good.I never cared much for Liza Minelli before but in this film she gives the perfect performance.Being very believable as Sally,who goes through so many things but still,in the end,decides to continue like before.
Cabaret deals a lot with the Nazis coming into power in Germany in the early 1930's,even though it looks like a secondary theme in the movie.The closing shot is off a room full of Nazis shown through a mirror.It leaves no questions about the future of Germany.I haven't seen that many films dealing with pre nazi Germany before and I thought this one did it quite well.
So Cabaret is basically not "just" a musical.It has some darker themes about society,as well as showing us what the night life,and life in general,in poor Germany after the first World War just before Hitler came to power was like.And yes it also has wonderful musical scenes,good acting and is definitely worth the time to check out if these things interest you!!
The scene is Berlin, Germany, only two years before Hitler would come to total power.
I actually saw the movie before I read the book.
As I said before Danning is the ONLY reason for someone to watch this (and even then only when it's on cable, as it's not worth renting).
The film is based on an actual incident in northern Iraq on July 4, 2003: US soldiers arrested 11 Turkish officers and pulled bags over their heads before taking them away.
It's not, there were a couple of minor hits before it, but it sure is the best that has ever dominated our arcades.
How many Evil Christian Preacher characters have we seen before?
I've just heard it all before and it was funnier and better said the first time.
The worst performance is "Ranger Bill" played by David Johansen, he really sinks this movie before it has any chance to be anything although the other actors are not much better.
Once it gets going there is a level of creepiness to it but the whole set up before the climax is so poorly done that you find yourself caring very little about what happens.
Also, make sure they clear time in their schedule so they don't have to squeeze this in before their orthodontists appointment/ band practice.
The third tale involves a homicidal maniac whose identity you'll probably figure out long before it's "revealed."
Many people before me have talked about how horrible it is, but it was just so bad I can't resist to write about it.
As I've found myself so many times before, I was standing in front of the "horror" section.
However, if you're looking for a movie that drags itself along like a half-dead chipmunk, searching hopelessly for even a modicum of redemption before finally fading into a painful death that couldn't have come soon enough, maybe you should check it out.
Once it gets going there is a level of creepiness to it but the whole set up before the climax is so poorly done that you find yourself caring very little about what happens.
We listen to repetitive punk rock for ten minutes before the story actually begins.
Remember everyone started reaching for their jackets and handbags half an hour before the final credits ?
One of the things that supposedly led Jeremy Brett to take on the mantle of Holmes was the fact that Granada wanted to do something that no other film or television producer had done before, namely, do the Doyle stories as they were written.
As I have said before, Conan Doyle could write the heads off of some screenplay writers.
One really wonders what was going on in the producer's mind wasting Jeremy Brett's rapidly diminishing energy and life-span for this crude story, especially after having been so faithful to the spirit of Doyle's works before.
Totally devoid of ANY new or creative ideas with respect to what we have seen from him before, Kaurismaki's feature recycles his lately trademark - and otherwise very appealing - darkish, yet basically cheerful coloured backgrounds and surroundings behind and around the actors.
I suppose it could be one of those films you have to see more than once to appreciate--that's happened to me before and could happen to me again; and since I like Chaplin usually, I would be more than willing to give this another shot.
I have never before felt so restless during a movie, shifting in my chair, looking at my watch, wishing I could fast forward.
He has little flair for action, and the staleness of the script is reflected only too accurately in the kind of action sequences that most of us have seen dozens of times before.
It's nothing short of box-office fraud I know, but I maintain that this movie had at least a chance to be above average, before coming up far short.
As I said before, the opening was quite brilliant.
I read the reviews of this movie before watching, and honestly I was confident that I would like the movie despite the overwhelming bad reviews.
I actually ran through the end of this film three times before I finally got it: A virus is devastating North America and Aurora is a test-tube baby genetically designed to produce a race of superhumans who can survive the virus (by healing very rapidly) and reproduce without sex (which has left Aurora a side-effect of intense empathy).
My first reaction to Babylon A.D. was that it's not nearly as bad as its own director, Matthieu Kassovitz, has been claiming it is, although that reaction came to me before I got to the end of the movie.
Unfortunately, I happened to have learned before watching the movie that a 160-minute version would be released in Europe, compared to the 90-minute version I just saw, and let me tell you, you can really feel the blank spots.
I'm hoping that when Babylon DVD comes along it will include the uncut, 160-minute version that the Europeans saw, along with an explanation of why it was so badly butchered before released to American audiences.
At first, you're just searching for an untraceable method to get rid of one corpse you accidentally got stuck with, yet before you know it, you're mangling people especially to generate more tasty cat food.
Then I saw this series when it originally aired and I could only get thru 4 eps before giving up.
Did he eat some rotten tacos before doing that?"
I'm not exactly sure where communication between Stephen and the muses broke down but it was somewhere before he started writing this piece of trash.
I couldn't stop watching this train wreck, because I always kept hoping that they would recapture some of the wonder that was originally established before the end of the first season.
If the producers are merciful they will put Andromeda out to pasture before it becomes primarily an object of ridicule and the punch line to many jokes.
Once again, as in the earlier film two years before, we have babes in bikinis toting machine guns, killing people while saying 'poor little man' and smirking and simpering and wiggling their busts.
Hughes apparently had to cut some of the more revealing scenes before inflicting this on the general public.
The resulting fight sees Grey killed and Denning wounded before the burly Reeves manages to strangle the killer.
The vicious murderer is holding the others at gunpoint and Grey suddenly remembers where she saw him before.
The plot line is so simply you'll swear you've seen it before...  People wake up to find that their city has been evacuated and is under siege by alien robot thingees (of which we never actually see more than one on screen at any given time.)
It isn't long before the wardrobe girl gets a pick axe in her head, and when the body is discovered the police and the media show up.
And if you haven't got at least 70 minutes' worth of material to begin with, there's no way you're going to make anything like a worthwhile film - and it's not long before the Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat shows its true worth by including more padding than you'd find in a cheap mattress.
If you get bored before the end, you're not missing anything, because there is no resolution, no big finale, nothing.
The Mongols are threatening the Sultanate; Simon Aristides and his daughter come to court just in time to save Sinbad and Omar from being executed; when the old man is murdered for his secret of Greek fire, the atom bomb of the ancient world, Sinbad is allowed at his suggestion to take Omar with him and try to retrieve the weapon before the Mongol General who stole it can get its secret from Aristides' daughter and deliver it to his Mongol Khan.
Quite recently I watched a marvelous documentary on Australian exploitation cinema entitled "Not Quite Hollywood: the True, Untold Story of Ozploitation" Â which I highly recommend to anyone Â and it really stimulated me to track down a lot of titles I've never even heard about before.
Unfortunately, despite sounding like a gore-hound's dream-come-true, The Redsin Tower is actually a rather disappointing film that suffers badly from an uneventful beginning (a good 40 minutes pass before anything really interesting happens), some rather confusing moments and an unnecessary sub-plot (featuring a psycho ex-boyfriend of one of the girls), and bloody awful lighting that often makes it impossible to see what is going on.
Instead, the first half of the film is wasted watching a despicable bunch of losers do nothing but take drugs and talk about sex; the second half is spent watching them stumble around an old building in the dark before being killed.
For starters, In regards to MICDI and claiming that American Gun was made before Crash is wrong ; Crash had already started filming in late 2003 and finished in early 2004.
Parts are a take off of the Columbine massacre and details the lives of people involved before and after a similar event.
He even traps the audience inside of a gun store before the credits roll.
Not being able to pronounce the letter "r," she sounds like me when I was 5 before taking speech therapy.
before embarking on his own journey.
I think I fell asleep before the end.
and how did he know the dad was going to be divorced from his wife before he did?
The real star of the picture is the car, and the clips from open road sports car racing in the early 1950's, before they moved to closed tracks.
If, on the other hand, you're not really into Chaplin so much but just a fan of flicks before the "talkies" fad came along, well, you can safely pass on this one and not miss much.
Other than fill 90 minutes before bed, it offered poor, very dry humor with a whole cast of overacting, underacting with a cherry on top.
I fell asleep 3 times before I finally gave in and put on another movie.
"Reviewers have been wrong before", I thought.
I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it, but after some of the stuff I had heard, I wanted to preview it before taking them (I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway - boy was I wrong!).
In fact the only fun that might be even dared to be thought up in conjunction with this unspeakable waste of life is tricking your mate into wasting however long (S)he can stand to remain inside a dark,dank grottoesque hellhole surrounded by hordes of no-longer screaming pre pubescent little horrors, who bored out of their witt's end rely on drinking far too much cola in order that they can leave whichever (soon to be ex best mate's great party idea it was to take his friends to see a once proud and noble cartoon, the stalwart of the cartoon network portrayed like a picasso, lude crude and nothing like the original) that they may spend a blessed few minutes relieving themselves before the ordeal starts again  After some father/Mother dragged a kid to see this epic of rectal proportions I can fully understand the idea of parental divorce.
A later series added Scrappy who was the most irritating cartoon character before the intentionally irritating Poochie in the Simpsons.
and these " Western Brotherhood " guys confirm this by stating they're like the old pioneers before America became a god forsaken melting pot , so what are they doing hanging around with a black crimelord ?
ClichÃ©d I mean we have seen these types of characters before in other films.
Although I'm always careful to avoid others' opinions before I see a film and make up my mind about it, I often look at what others have to say after I've reached a conclusion.
Don't watch this one please, if you do, you'll be sitting there hoping that the being with finish you off before this horrible film does, I'm serious!
Basically, the film wants to drop us into the same spot where we are now, but following a Confederate victory one hundred and forty years before.
And no, deliberately making the Confederates unrealistically expansionist so that the filmmakers could turn the Japanese (whose army murdered tens of millions of Asians before and during WWII) and the Central and South Americans (who have their own obsessions with skin color and racial ancestry) into blameless victims of Confederate aggression doesn't make the stereotypes any more palatable.
while they were racist and perhaps apathetic when it was convenient, they were by no means the fascists that kevin willmott portrays them as, and many slaves were freed before the war was over.
The last two minutes before the closing credits were the parts of the film I enjoyed the most.
"Sorry, forgot to knock," quips Bond - before cold cocking the defecating Soviet.
Bond has to fall over the cliff after the plane has fallen before him, skydive to catch it up Â defying the laws of physics Â and then fly away.
And what a consistently bizarre final year she had; disclosing a relationship with her TV lawyer, having a baby, the baby's paternity contested, her case going before the Supreme Court & her son overdosing.
I knew it was her long before they copped her head off.
Ravi Chopra has made Baghban before 3 years earlier than Baabul.they have the same problem at all.BORING BORING BORING BORING ... Do i recommend Salman Khan to accept himself as a 41 years old man.he is not Prem Choudhary of Maine Pyar Kiya no more.maybe he is Aditya Sekhri at Lucky: No Time for Love,that's all with the film.boring fast food.
Indie films used to be good before all this self-indulgent crap started coming out like Garden State.
It is possible I may be confused by what the title is referring to, however, since this movie is placed in a mental ward and the characters are taking such things as Tegretol and Depakote, I leaned towards the bipolar disorder basis before I even rented the movie.
Benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation, but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer.
The second, star-wise, is interesting because it features Christian Slater (about to be hot), Steve Buscemi (had a long way to go before becoming hot) and Julianne Moore (had a long LONG way to go before becoming hot).
There's Cornelius Keefe and Lon Chaney, Jr. who recognize who Manning is before Autry does.
The simple fact that Dustin Hoffman required hours of make-up work before each scene should be enough to make that obvious.
Benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation, but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer.
That was all before I watched it.
Just before this global crisis occurred a book was created which was so well written that I do not believe it will ever be improved upon in ANY medium.
I feel sorry for those who had never read the book or seen the 1964 movie before because as you know (without including spoilers) you can't experience this story twice the same way.
It's as if they rewrote the script before each shooting day, and a Magic 8 Ball was consulted to govern the tone of each scene.
I've seen it before but I've never had occasion or the inclination to do it myself: apologise for giving a movie such a high rating.
And then he launches into a narrative about his next movie - and how good this next one, as opposed to all the losers before it, is going to be.
Fortunatly the guard stops to tell an injured black man how he's certainly going to shoot him then stands there smiling into space for over 7 seconds before Priest (with no real explanation why he's there)simply walks in and shoots him.
- Exhausted by the effort of slapping man with a bottle, The Sandman stands bolt still for a good 5 seconds before diving on the floor while Burke waves his feet in his general direction.
And before you can say Jack Nicholson, Hopkins has the assorted criminal loons on his side.
A truly disappointing finale to this series, the silly but fun "class reunion" episode a few weeks before would have made a better send off than this atrociously bad effort to produce "art".
In Terry Marcel's "Prisoners of the Lost Universe", Mr. Hatch and Ms. Lenz get to say naughtier words than they said on episodic television; and, of course, they banter before falling in love.
Red Dawn was the very first film released with a PG-13 rating in the states, The Flamingo Kid (1984) was actually the first film to be given a PG-13 but Red Dawn ended up being released before it.
Not forgetting, in the first film, Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog, and was abandoned when still a puppy, so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think?
On top of that, the film actually ends twenty minutes before the movie stops.
And before you know it, we're at the stupid ending to end all stupid endings.
It took us about 15 minutes before we realized we weren't watching the trailer.
Never seen this story before.... ho hum.
At least get your science down right before making such an ambitious film, and don't cast Hilary Swank for such intellectual roles, like a Physicist anymore.
But the spin begins long before they take the plungeÂ   At a militia symposium, geophysicist Aaron Eckhart (your average "biscuit-thrower" college professor: disheveled hair, attire and lifestyle; upon arriving home, throws biscuit to dog which has no name Â Hollywood stereotype created by Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon"), cites Physics 101, yet none of the generals seem to have even a sixth-grade education, as they stare dismayed at his demo of burning a peach with a spray-can, to illustrate Â get this!
No reason to write a spoiler, you've seen it all before a hundred times, mostly on television.
I had to wait for the 2nd 30 minutes or so before I could see a laugh coming and when they did they were mediocre at best.
However it soon becomes clear that with no one to keep the other students under control the school quickly becomes worse than before and it soon turns into a free for all as anarchy breaks loose, realising what he has done David must clean up the mess he has unwillingly created.
Tony Lo Bianco plays a Latin cad who meets women through a dating service, happily strings them along and marries them under an alias before taking off with their money; after meeting Shirley Stoler's possessive, mercurial Martha, he almost reluctantly allows his deceptions to turn into a series of murders.
Based on a real-life couple in the 1940's dubbed 'The Lonely Hearts Killers', the movie was trumped the year before by the dark comedy "No Way To Treat A Lady" (which was actually more explicit and disturbing than this film).
If she were then her partner in crime would have soon got rid of her before she bungled their plans.
The effects are crappier than I've ever seen before.
We've seen many events in other movies before, and a lot better.
You could zap into this crap every time, stay with it for five minutes and change the channel again, without the feeling that you're missing something before or after what you just watched, it has made-for-TV written all over (Afterwards I even had problems to summarize the story at all...).
West, having enjoyed a late film career resurgence with 1970's "Myra Breckinridge", made one final celluloid splash before her death (at least, it is widely reported that she was still alive while filming this!)
It's not long before they are told the truth.
And Martin Short an actor I really like has been reduced to an overacting buffoon that is only a carbon copy of baddies that have come before him.
That the appeal to audiences around the time of this film's release was probably the fashion, the music, even the actors themselves (Ami Dolenz for younger audiences and probably, Tony Danza, before he because more of a pop culture joke), things which are probably very cheesy by today's standards.
My favorite part of the film is not the brilliant editing techniques, oh no, it's the incredible plot twists that I hinted at before.
I expected a funeral before the credits started rolling.
Speaking of spoilers, all the way through this, about four scenes before something happens, I kept thinking, "Oh, he's this" or "He'll discover this" or "The killer isÂ" Despite the fact I thought the movie was well shot, the locales made the most of the depressing city it portrays and Quaid did an above-average job, as he almost always does, the movie was very flat, (again) predictable and too clichÃ©d.
Basically the movie's about a detective bent on finding a killer or killers in so-called random murders, with clues left behind, before the next person dies!
Side note: I'm surprised I didn't get the phrase "Come and See" before Quaid's character did; I've heard it before listening to one of my favorite songs more than a dozen times: Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around.'
As an "action movie" addict, I don't know how I missed it before.
I knew, before watching, that it was, at best, a B MOVIE.
Its all stuff you've seen a thousand times before, and almost always done better than it is here.
Pam isn't wife number one, he was married before to a girl named Sherrie.
It is difficult to feel anything but contempt for a continually pouting Kathy who doesn't like being in the very position in which she placed Pam so many years before.
TLC: think before you make a program.
The scenes where rabid Tea Cake and Janie face off before killing him have no tension and no suspense.
There is one story that comes back from time to time between the sketches about a "geek" (played by Ryan Pinkston) in love with the prettiest girl in class (wow, we never heard that before).
Not once did Extreme Movie refer to a successful box office movie I have seen before, and I have seen a fair few 'teenage sex comedies'.
I caught this flick before it was released and had no idea what it was about.
We've seen all these things before.
TV crap before its time.
This overwrought over-zealous over-polished Faux attempt at the famed British whodunit genre would have swept the house at Hollywood's Razi awards but since it's Bollywood, an industry that does not (well at least at the time of this review) have an award show that gives out accolades for the worst performances like Hollywood does the night before the Oscars.
Grateful for his intervention, Lopez is unable to resist their subsequent friendship, which quickly blossoms into something deeper, until she discovers they have met before under very different circumstances...
The message of the movie was delivered, but it's been delivered many times before and much better.
Plus, this is the first movie I've seen that before the credits, it says the title again.
Mr. Pryor would make one more funny movie (Hear No Evil, See No Evil) before illness would force him into early retirement.
Then it starts to rain, and before long, all the animals are terrorized by both floods and the evil Grand Duke of Owls, who, it turns out, actually set up the whole thing simply because he dislikes the sun.
I saw this movie originally on the "Wonderful world of Disney",long before I read the book for an education class in college.
All I can say is that the members of Monty Python MUST have seen this before they sat down to write The Holy Grail (Gawain was released in England 2 years prior), and decided to make fun of it.
But don't worry, he knows the train will stop before it hits them.
The friend, by the way, is Bogar before he became a star.
Some great actors and actresses in this movie like Richard Pryor, Randy Quaid, Stacey Dash, Dave Thomas and Dana Carvey (The younger, funnier Dana Carvey before Mike Myers ruined his reputation).
Now the overall idea of a working woman who has trouble balancing her high-paying job with marriage is very good, the execution looks like it needed an editing--with some dopey performances and logical errors that should have been cleaned up before filming began.
Despite its interesting and amusing elements, the film's amateurish editing, the incoherence of the "plot" and the random/shuffle nature of the soundtrack all help 4-D WITCH to overstay its welcome long before the final reel starts rolling.
While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was "Matoaka" not "Pocahontas" (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not "tree-hugging hippies"--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).
Because of this, individuals who watch this film AND have issues with a neglecting mother should think twice before watching--you MAY find this film kicks up a lot of feelings.
This movie is so clichÃ©' ridden as to be laughable, from the conceit of a short-timer squad going out on one last patrol (yeah, yeah, the same as every 19 year on-the-job cop movie where the sergeant dies the day before retirement, yawn), to the PTSD laden troubles that have been shown over and over in so many movies, so much better, in the past 30 years.
I'm 3/4 the way through and still waiting for just a hint of something original that I have not seen before (employment woes, civilian misconceptions, drug and alcohol abuse, slams against the VA -yawn).
I should have researched this before I bought it.
However, there are a great many of us (I am in the military) that do come back and lead extremely productive lives, just as we did before we left.
Next time, get a real military veteran to review the storyline before releasing such a piece of crap.
Its poor quality sneaks up on you, since there's minimal dialogue before the first extended action sequence (though said dialogue does include the news that this Iraq company will be heading home inside of a week, which anyone who has ever seen a cop movie knows is a sure sign of impending death and destruction).
It also happens that Mitchell's 14 year-old son Chris, Jeremy Lelliott, has hid in the embassy, in Chris' avoiding to go out on a date with a chubby Romnian girl, and causes so much trouble for everyone , the Serbians the hostages as well as his dad, that he almost causes the Atomic Bomb to accidentally go off before it's disconnected!
This is a low-budget film based on poor directing, dumb script and unbelievable story line (after 9/11, but even before that, it is more clear who would blow up a US embassy).
Our heroes (Daryl Hannah and Peter Weller) had to disable it before the terrorists got control of it.
There's not a lot of you, but I did ride this before I saw the films.
Dreyer is murdered before he can spill any beans but leaves a photo in a bank deposit box, a more recent picture of Alicia.
It doesn't help when random names and faces appear at any given time; it was difficult to remember what the plot was- before you realize that there is no plot.
But that is right before the best part--and most action--of the whole movie.
Goodnight God Bless was much better than I expected after seeing the preview that appears before the film on the VHS version.
The opening of "Goodnight,God Bless" is quite unsettling and memorable:we see a priest with a rosary walking near the school before murdering a young school teacher with a butcher knife and then shooting 5 school children on the playground and wounding countless others.This sequence is shot in chaotic and hand-held style that certainly packs the punch.Unfortunately after this nasty beginning the film quickly goes downhill.First of all it has more to do with dull cop drama than slasher flick.There are a couple of thrills including the scene of the woman chased through the forest,but the acting is so-so and the ending is abrupt and comes out-of-nowhere.It's a crying shame that "Lucifer" is so terminally boring.4 out of 10.
Strongly inspired by Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs" and "From dusk till dawn" this movie has none of the qualities of the before mentioned.
hmm where did i see that before.?
I have never posted a comment about any movie here before, but I felt compelled to post about this little flick.
I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better.
In typical Mitchum fashion for what he felt was Garson's condescending ways, he used to eat sandwiches with onions and roquefort cheese before their closeups.
Had the movie been a hit, it would barely have been out of the theaters before it was out of date.
I might have watched 1/3 of the movie before I couldn't take it anymore.
About ten years before he decided to venture again in Ruth Rendell universe, Claude Chabrol had transferred to the screen "a Judgment in Stone" entitled "la CÃ©rÃ©monie" (1995).
I left before the film ended, just after director Schnabel shifted to the technique of reprising a scene with different outcomes.
I am curious, cos I have never seen a Chinese movie before.
i've never felt uninterested of completing watching a movie that Meg Ryan appears in before.
One wonders why hasn't Marie left Bruce a long time before?
The writing, since the first two films, has taken a turn for the worse, something I didn't think possible before watching this tripe.
The plot line is improbable (no one could be as dumb as the protagonist seems) and jerky/rambling (no vignette really develops before we're on to another misadventure by our hero).
Can Matt and Susan manage to stop the volcano before it obliterates most of New York City?
If I get banned/blacklisted, at least it will be for a good cause to warn others before hand!
Haven't we seen this story before?
Well, the traffic jam goes on for maybe 30 or 40 minutes before she ever meets the man; I was squirming in my seat by then, but determined to see it through.
Isabella meets with Hilary once more before he sets sail.
There is also an interpolated scene with two people we have never met before who have a tender, highly erotic love scene.
I tried to watch it, but could only get through about 5 minutes before I couldn't take any more.
Was the "brutally realistic view," as you so elegantly put it, before or after the exploitation of porno shots from Latina girls parading around on the beach shore?
America, please give up on this genre and this director before we all go bankrupt!
The story follows her deteriorating health and mental state as she tries to complete her kills before her time runs out.
This has never really been done in any movie before, and there's a good reason for this, even beyond that these clips have to be viewed in their original context to retain the same power.
This picture is nothing more than a dose of mindless fun, with some creative killings (have you ever seen an umbrella impaling before?)
I didn't know this film actually was a re-cut of the original when I begun watching it (remind me to check this site ALWAYS before renting a film!)
Its been done many times before, but I have to admit this film is well made and carries the storyline very well and the main character is top notch and I must admit, I have never heard of Kristine Blackport, but she has done an excellent job of portraying the warped her heroine of the movie.
Hack director Roger Vadim, remaking his own 1956 film of the same name, had hoped this might do for De Morney what the original film did for famous sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, but the film turned out to be a box-office dud, and she'd have to wait a few more years before her chilling performance in 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' finally saw her deservedly hit the big time.
Grace Kelly was still probably with a swell-head for her undeserved Oscar win, the year before, for "The Country Girl."
From the brutal approach to movie action of the former ones (thanks to Bruckheimer), this one has scratched most of this off (no more social realism of the first and no more really bad guys of the second) and replaced it with superficial layer of humor and Murphy's funny faces, which really aren't funny when you've seen them before in his stand up comedy shows or The Nutty Professor.
After this it was a flop vampire movie (made for less than Murphy's entire fee for Beverley Hills Cop III) before Nutty Professor was the one to bring him back.
I saw "Juncture" recently at the Mill Valley Film Festival and I'll start off by saying I left 15 minutes before the end.
Unfortunately, it was rife with stereotypes, and there have been movies about female vigilantes before so I can't give it high marks in the originality department.
Every character is dull, and the reprise of Rosewood and Serge's characters only generate mild interest because we have seen them before.
As incredible as it seems, the only one of the "Beverly Hills Cop" trilogy I'd seen before the other night was the second one which I've seen more times than I'd care to admit.
And HE is suspended from the force for brutalizing a drug-using homicide suspect who he shot in the leg once before.
Fedora had already retired before but experienced a comeback a few years ago before disappearing from the silver screen, this time for good.
I just watched this movie, and it took me 10 minutes to realize that I already saw it before (but never made it to the end).
If you have not played FF7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.
We barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat.
Jim Davis plays several rounds of pocket-pool before he decides to hoof it across the African wilds to try and locate the monsters so he can destroy them.
We've seen the haunted car before: in 1977's THE CAR and perhaps most notably in the truly chilling Spielberg film DUEL (made in 1971 for TELEVISION, no less!).
the people inside the fort opening the gate before the tank crashes through .
Folks maybe before your next movie you might check out the geographic and socio-political facts, eh?
It has been pointed out before that after Jacqui McDonald retired from the show for reasons that have been lost to time, Somers' ego began to run rampant.
The viewer knows what's going to happen before the movie does.
Let me not go any further before I give the whole plot away.
Whats funny though is the fact that 5 seconds later we see him sitting on a rock by himself playing a challenging game of pocket pool, but before he can finish flogging the dolphin he gets scared and runs away.
So in conclusion, if you haven't ridden this ride before then my God, ride it!
This is a rather dull psychological thriller which finally comes to life ten minutes before the end.
compared to the TV series,this thing is crap.i couldn't get through it,i was so bored.it's just not exciting.there's no real suspense or excitement,at least up to the point i watched.that's really surprising,given the quality of the series.it takes place after season six,and before season seven,so i guess it's a season seven prequel.if you can get through it,i would recommend it,as it does fill in some gaps between the sixth and seventh season.i only know this,because in some scenes they allude to events that must have happened in the movie.for me,though it was just too difficult to get through.my vote for 24:Redemption is a 4/10
The office scenes, the sex scenes, the demon scenes, it's all been done before.
A pair of newly weds move into the family mansion in the late 18th century but unfortunately new bride Catherine keeps seeing ghostly apparitions and the bad news for her husband is that it usually happens just before she consumates the marriage .
This is why sex before marriage is essential nowadays chaps you don`t want a frigid wife screaming before bedtime , during bedtime of course is a different matter .
The script was okay about a curse put on the family of Fengriffin, but it covered territory seen before(most notably in Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles).
I may be wrong, Indian movies were never worth considering seriously before that also barring a very few exceptions.
Hmmm, to totality of possibilities seem endless of a John Wayne double feature at the Drive In, especially after sneaking in to see 'The Harrad Experiment' the week before!
And before you know it, the plot has become a freeway pileup of Indian mysticism, serial murder, topless women, stylized slow motion assaults, zombies (of course), Satanism, ritual sacrifices, hallucinatory nightmares...have I left anything out?
This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era - the dialog is still stilted and clumsy, but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio.
Like Francois Truffault before him (in "Fahrenheit 451"), Chabrol has no particular feel for sci-fi or dystopian fantasy, despite OK production design.
The main reason for British expansion in Africa was to (1) exploit its massive natural resources (oil, gold, diamonds, copper, cobalt, platinum, gemstones and many more) and (2) get there before the Germans did.
Cate Blanchett's character (supposedley a hard bitten Secret Agent)looked as if she'd just stepped off a photo shoot for "Cosmopolitan", and exuded all the sexual allure of a maths lesson.It was over an hour before I saw a German.
We have admired your work before, but films like these are beneath your best abilities.
Take one gormless girl, add two competing handsome hunks (one home, one away), mix in a land of franglais where the locals say "good morning Madame" without a single sub-title and you wonder why the heroine had to know any French to become a spy... the kind of spy who keeps saying "what's your real name" while breaking the next person's cover and rushing up to warn the next safe house as the Bosche may or may not have got there before her.
Never having seen a Butler Brothers Production before, I came into this film fresh and with no bias one way or the other.
Lance Henriksen and Doug Bradley bring little to the film and are capable of much finer performances, the ideas are not new and have been done before similarly in The CLubHouse.
and like mentioned before, a suitable film to North Indian audiences and it is a film that is worth watching (though not as good as `Alai Payuthey').
HELLWORLD isn't a terrible horror film in its own right but there's a seen it all before feel and people who have enjoyed most of the sequels will certainly feel cheated that they're watching something that could be any type of horror film
Their friend died 2 years before,and the death apparently had something to do with the game.
I have never seen anything this bad before.
The once legendary Pinhead is barely present and he's pretty much used like a typical pop-up advertisement: pointless, promising but bleak and gone before you know it.
But it's not long before Pinhead and two of his followers Â Bound and Chatterer (who are completely butchered because of lack of funding.
I saw Saathiya on December 20 at Naz8 Cinemas and again on December 25 at the same venue.I liked it even more the second time and intend to see it many more times on the big screen before I finally own the original DVD of the movie.
I could tell though, before any of drivel that passed as "horror" in a franchise that isn't even supposed to be horror, that this movie would suck based on the Pinhead shirt one of the characters was wearing.
That and a guy in a cenobite mask removed all attempts at a dignified motion picture before it even really began.
This film -- which I had heard almost nothing about before seeing it -- turned out to be a powerful, moving, and important love story.
I haven't seen such a bad movie ever before, It is absolute non-sense.
Whoever looks at this movie is:  a) highly depressed b)Doesn't have a life  If anything I think that the movie before this, "Tribulation" was better.
In the meantime such zealous Christians as Mr. T and Selma Davis are planning a rescue of Lewis before the trial.
Judgment is a low budget Christian film on the days after the Rapture and before the Second Coming as some Christians conceive them to be.
I sat there thinking I'd already this dozens of times before & I'm right, scientists look for something, get attacked by monster, hero kills monster & saves girl at the end, that's all there is too it.
They are all clones, of which "Dealer" is at least the 4th of a kind, the others being "Is there life before death?
Do doctors really sit and engage in chat room sex talk in a hospital back office before going into the theatre to do an operation?
After wasting two hours and five pounds on this movie I am losing my confidence in going to the cinema, except to see something I have seen before or has been personally recommended to me.
It started out mediocre, before dropping into bad pretty quick.
Unfortunately watched this the other night on cable because there was little on, and I was trying to see if I could remember what I had seen some of the cast in before.
His backward ass tactics would have gotten him busted long before this movie does.
The film starts off as a typical high-school comedy, in the style of "American Pie", with stereotypical teenage characters that only have sex and booze on their minds, and it really takes a very long time before until the horror elements are mixed in.
But before I get to that rationale, first the obvious complaints.
The friends give Doc a lift into town & before they part company Doc gives Johnny a bottle of tequila of his own which gives Johnny the power to read women's thoughts.
What was the point of adding that blond fat bimbo into the plot ten minutes before the movie ended?
But it is going to take some time, before this monstrosity of a film is forgotten.
)-wasn't absurd enough, we then get a subplot about a mafia chieftain whose daughter is one of the clients.He must be the new kinder, gentler form of godfather as he seems to have no problem with his daughter being involved in this.oh yeah, the ladies are worried about disease so they make the main character get tested for everything before the big night, when he has sex with at least 6 women in a row.how do they know the woman went before them was clean?
i really admire James Lipton a lot , i never admired a interviewer before.
Without getting into anything more specific, this is the set-up for Harsh Times, and the pattern the film follows for the majority of its runtime (before taking the two main characters on a rather obscure road trip to Mexico that lasts for the final act of the film).
But like it seemed before, Ayer does not want to commit to anything, so he just lets genuine moments of greatness slide past before any of the characters can use them.
Did he read the script before he agreed to play the down on his luck hero of Harsh Times?
Thank goodness he dies before the end, none too soon!
As I said before, I liked the cast (Alan King is really good in his best movie role), but this is one of those movies with high aspirations and little common sense.
He fumbles with it before he finally gets it off.
Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash?
Her only attribute (besides being in love with Okwe) is that she's a virgin, and the moment we hear that, we know for certain that before the film is over, she will lose her virginity at the hands of some evil white man.
The case here is, as stated before, so ridiculous it's insulting.
He isn't particularly worried, as there are others in line for succession well before him.
I grew up literally 200 metres from the place where Veronica Guerin was shot, so the issue and the politics have been common currency and the story was well known to me before I belatedly saw this film.
I wasn't aware of the story before I saw the film, so I don't know how true to life it all was, but let's just say I felt no sympathy for the "angelic", martyr-like character of Veronica and her irritating personality traits.
And dang, how does old Grandpa know that the only way out is to complete all the levels if he's never seen the virus before?
STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits   There were some things I was aware of before I even sat down to see Sci-Fighter.
I don't normally comment on film's but I usually check reviews before going and only see "good" ones, so as no one had commented I thought it was only my duty to try and save some peeps some money.
They all die in the end but, as I said before, I really didn't care.
and before you can think it answers "No!
It burns through him eventually, sure, but not before we're treated to the Obligatory Poetic Destiny Moment.
Apparently:   1) Sentient super computers aren't very good at providing useful information such as "there's an extra person on board" or "shall we make sure the mirrors are adjusted before turning the ship?".
Indeed, Jaspers is taken away and buried, while the girl calls a detective friend and is caught by the same guys before the cop arrives.
Indeed even before the credits appear, it is shown in large letters that yes, this movie did win an award for them.
The idea for the vengance filled superhero back from the dead has been done before and done much better: Spawn, The Crow!!
The plot has been done before, dialog was MST3K fodder, and the makeup/effects are laughable.
I love the Coasters' hit song of the same name as this film, penned by the great Leiber and Stoller partnership from a few years later than this and before watching, had hoped it had been inspired by a rollickingly funny and richly entertaining movie.
However, it is also a primer on scamming and could be worth watching before a trip to a car dealer.
Harry had two top-40 songs with this flick; "Daybreak", and the Pete Ham written "Without You", which had originally been recorded by Badfinger the year before.
No doubt before long, this film will be screening in theaters across Canada.
When I was a teenager, my friends (well, the cool ones anyway) had the (excellent) soundtrack album with its generous helpings of film dialogue, so I knew lines from SoD long before I saw it.
From here the picture becomes a scene-for-scene remake of every Naschy werewolf vehicle before it.
One woman who watches him transform before her very eyes does not even know any better than to run away, that is until it's too late.
The only point where I consciously became aware of it and found myself listening to what the music was 'made up' of was a looped instrumental part just before the little boy gets shot.
According to Richard Fell (BBC4 web-site), one of the key questions addressed is "How complex does a computer have to be before we consider it to have some kind of human qualities?".
I don't "hate" Tom Arnold for no good reason like some people out there seem to, but I don't like him very much (he's only ever caught my interest in one movie before - "True Lies") and he's completely aggravating here in a role just about anyone else could have performed better (except, perhaps, for Pauly Shore).
A busy flick with lots going on, "Car Pool" is a regurgitation of hackneyed stunts and gags which have been done many times before.
You probably think you've seen this premise a million times before but it's not really a plot that's been filmed all that many times , probably because it's so weak and obvious which leads me to be confused as to how it survived its pitch .
What can you say about Die Hard that hasn't been said a million times before?
Cue much death and destruction before happy ending.
However, before the film began, I read through the reviews on IMDb.
The "movie within a movie" premise has been done before and much better.
From what I've learned from this documentary all you have to do in order to be credited as a philosopher is point out something no one has noticed before as in " Fascists don't clap while Stalinists clap themselves " Hey Zizek might actually have a point until you watch an edition of FAMILY FORTUNES .
It might be a good idea to watch ZIZEK before you pay money to attend one of his classes because I'm sure you'll here the same things said down the pub
I had never heard of Slavoj Zizek before I saw this film.
A movie that is action packed, laced with great one liners and see's the good guys kicking ass over terrorist before it was popular.
I originally watched this movie because I loved watching Skeet Ulrich in the TV series "Miracles" (another great & provocative series cancelled by the U.S. networks, way before it's time), and wanted to see some more of his work.
Nothing he says here is funny, nothing he does here is funny, and the only debatable part of this whole self-destructive exercise was watching him get beaten up and verbally abused by every person he comes across in that little opening film he did before the concert starts.
Watch the series before you watch this "movie."
If you've seen the series, watch something else before you watch this "movie."
I also saw The End of Evangelion and loved it to death, and I think if I had seen The End of Evangelion before this I would have liked it more, however that does NOT change a thing.
The plot follows police agent Donald Pleasance's attempts to find the killer before it's too late as well as the pianist's own efforts to return a some kind of balance to his life.
One wonders if the ever present threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union spurred these women into getting as much 'crumpet' as possible before the real big bang.
I'm sorry I can't tell you about the rest of the film, I switched it off after that...   NOT because I was offended or repulsed, but because the big 'surprise' had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with what had gone before it.
I've had political agendas crammed in my face before but this is ridiculous (pun intended).
Never before has a movie sucked in this way and perhaps...one never will again.
So I think with knowing what happens in the film before watching it, this is just a waste of time.
The critics (before I knew better) raved about this film so much it got me pumped up to see it.
we watched zohan the night before and that was loads better.
My family sat there shaking their heads in disbelief as to what was unfurling before their eyes.
It's played a little differently as he isn't the driver of the first car she sees but it's the same tired old trite clichÃ© you've seen before so many times.
As for the excruciatingly predictable ending, I really could have written the last line myself half way through the movie, (sealed in in an envelope and posted it to myself and it would have been delivered before the end of the movie which felt like forever in arriving).
The bet: The twisted minds believe they can kill this family before a certain time, while the family believes in survival.
The weak sides is perhaps that it's such a classic and traditional action movie that we know the end before the movie starts, sadly, an ending that would have left me breathless would have been better for me, but maybe other people think differently.
Michael Haneke already made this film in 1997 before going on to make other challenging films like "The Piano Teacher" and "Cache."
Bruce Willis, who before hand had only Blind Date and Moonlighting to his credit, was cast as the main character, John McClane.
The thing that separates McClane from all other action heroes before this movie is that McClane is an average character.
John McClane is a much chattier protagonist than most action heroes, and even talks to himself on numerous occasions before he starts talking Hans or the cops.
There's no suspense and what little action there is (before the climax) consists mostly of pot shots taken by and against Indians on his various trips to the reservation.
But in the end, the complete product shows a disrespect towards the audience, a hatred for its own characters and story lines except a few precious upper-class New Yorkers, like I've never seen it before.
She hits Sylar over the head with a parking meter, before Peter tells her to back off.
When he made the sequel "When A Stranger Calls Back" some 14 years later he had another superb opening sequence (even better then the original's) before it fell apart the rest of the way.
Not to talk about the camera work (probably a first time operator, at least I hope so), although the "day for night" they invented for this movie is shockingly interesting (I understood this only after the first half of the movie and when I mentioned it to the others watching the movie I could see that no one had understood the purpose of this strange color effects before).
I must see some of Jess Francos older movies because he must have made something better before otherwise he could not be working anymore.
Franco's best films are the most misogynistic: SADOMANIA, BARBED WIRE DOLLS, WOMEN IN CELL BLOCK 9, THE DEMONS and EROTIC RITES OF FRANKENSTEIN - any of which you should watch before dumpster-diving into his many, many other duds.
It would seem that filmmakers within the wuxia genre showed almost no development or improvement before the year 2000.
Lucy the irritating monster in the toilet paper roll with the annoying voice -- completely unlikeable and enough to turn the channel before one episode is finished (never to return).
I like to avoid preconceptions and expectations and just let the material unfold before me like life does.
Not much because it's been done before.
I Just wish this movie could have a better storyline because "saving the forest" has been done before and it's common to viewers.
They need to have a great idea that's never been done before and really wild.
But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before.
The movie itself revolved around some historical battles and politics which are really unknown for me, and even though mr Amirkulov pointed out before the film began that we in the audience could expect some obscure historical talk in the film, i was surprised about the lack of many things in the movie.
The pillow on the couch for the father with sciatica (Provada) let him know the father was the suspect (my own mother has sciatica, why didn't he take an Advil before he went over, why didn't the pillow get moved back, why all of a sudden did he not want to kill his son), the girl her twisted her ankle (Stray) so she could easily be seen in Times Square (Not only that but the fact that a NYC subway attendant remember 2 people.
Once there they decide to check out the rooms in which the five bodies were found, before anyone know's it an evil ghostly spirit has been awakened & is killing the teens off one-by-one & unless they can stop it none of them will live to see the morning...
After watching the film, I was tempted to look up all the movies I had given 1's and 2's on before and elevate those votes to 3.
I caution anyone who has the fortune to read this before they are subjected to this film to watch or rent  anything else, even something like Police Academy 8 or Friday the 13th Part X.  
Another scene that really must be seen to be believed has Captain O'Connor flying over German lines in a reconnaissance plane which,is suddenly and miraculously transformed into a heavy bomber dropping its payload from wide-open bomb bays and pulverising the Germans beneath, before once more instantaneously reverting to being a small reconnaissance plane again.
A tedious, plodding storyline concerning a plot to steal some diamonds from a German HQ, awful acting and dreadful editing make this movie a prize turkey from the opening scene right through to the cringeworthy oh-so-60s `romantic' ending which will have you reaching for the puke bucket - that is if you haven't already reached for the `Off' button long before.
Another scene of crass stupidity that really must be seen to be believed has Captain O'Connor flying over the German lines in a reconnaissance plane which, with the help of some clumsily-inserted old newsreel footage, is suddenly and miraculously transformed into a heavy bomber disgorging its massive payload from wide-open bomb bays and pulverising the Germans beneath, before once more instantaneously reverting to being a small reconnaissance plane again.
The Detectives where at the PD checking his moves by a satellite transmitter installed on his truck, and while the Detectives where talking the older one said they must let him go into Amber's so that he confessed to her his crimes, the younger one reply him and then suddenly the older one says they must caught him before he get her, contradicting himself previous parliament.
It came out way too soon before too many facts were out and it's also way too favorable to Scott Peterson.
Basically, this movie might have been interesting before all the facts and everything was out but now, it just makes you roll your eyes at it.
Through This review contains some slight spoilers, but you'll be doing yourself a big favor if you read it before you decide to waste your money on this terrible sequel (if you can call it that).
Don't you remember what happened before?'
Oh, and this is after he watches the same thing being done 3 times in a row before this with no expression at all on his face.
Sandra Bullock character was one she plays well, but one we've seen from her often before, most recently in "Hope Floats."
But in the scenes with Kidman in Arizona, or wherever, surely the motel would have had something Christmassy - from experience in the USA, 4 days before Christmas, everything has lights and decorations.
At the end, Lahr's narration returns to tell us the outcome: Hulten was executed in HM Prison Pentonville a few weeks before V-E Day.
Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's "Moonlighting" and 1987's "Blind Date," which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.
It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller "Predator," which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Oh yeah, and although Angie Everheart does a better-than-expected acting job in this movie, her character has been done before.
The producers knew that this show would suck monkey nuts so they decided long before that no fight would be devoid of its excessive panty shots and covered breasts.
McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.
It's a little disgusting how little people actually research a subject before they make a movie on it.
In my opinion, the movie gets even worse when you figure out that you have seen it all before.
Cast before the release of "Stagecoach", he and Trevor were given a more central role in "Allegheny Uprising" as it is not an ensemble piece like "Stagecoach".
You can bet he'd be caught before he got too far!
As I said before, this movie is extremely low-budget (made with hand-held digital video) and I'm sure the cast and crew worked extremely hard to get it done in time, so I hate to rag on it.
And before you know it, the plot has become a freeway pileup of Indian mysticism, serial murder, topless women, stylized slow motion assaults, zombies (of course), Satanism, ritual sacrifices, hallucinatory nightmares...have I left anything out?
This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era - the dialog is still stilted and clumsy, but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio.
I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it!
I would recommend people rent this before buying or try to watch it on TV first!
I got irritated long before that.
By all means I recomend it highly, especially if you want to see more of Jennifer Tilly than you have before.
In addition, before he leaves the party, he sees her kiss another man (not her husband) through a partly open door.
Why did he do it - the spouses were feeding him, while his was hiding before moving to South America (he never had the chance).
I read the book a week before I watched this 'made for TV' movie.
Although David Attwood's direction throws up the odd good bit of composition, the grotty lighting and perpetual green tint on the original TV broadcast version sap any signs of life before they can bloom.
Men getting turned on by girls in big feathered hats and sequin leotards jumping around with big grins on their faces seem a little less threatening than those who want genitals of women they've never met before shoved in their faces.
Yes, those urges are natural, but only a person with low self-esteem would want to engage in intercourse before marriage.
The acting is amazingly unextraordinary, with the exception being the sole survivor from a group that was abducted and killed a few days in before this story (fittingly enough, she gets in one set of dialogue before she is separated and killed) and Leatherface's little sister, who is genuinely unsettling from first encounter (she holds tea parties with skulls and a doll made from what looks like a mummified infant), but is also barely given any screen-time.
Just before leaving the gas station in a hurry, they are given a shortcut route through the back country by drifter Tex (Viggo Mortenson, yes that Viggo Mortenson).
The men, oddly, live in a tribe of only men--which begs you to ask "how did these people get born if the tribes never interacted before this film?"
Maybe they should of thought about that before they called for makeup.
But if you do watch it, you'll probably come away thinking what the scarlet macaw did just before the closing credits - "Well, how 'bout that?"
The women of Wongo seeing the handsome Goonaien went ape over him which lead the jealous men of Wongo plan to kill him before he left the island.
One of the many departures from the biblical version is that Noah Danza wants God to give him a little more time before the flood so he can attend his son's basketball match.
They may as well just stand before the camera for two hours shrieking and making faces.
None of that hasn't bee said before.
I feel like I've seen this brand of dumb humor a million times before, albeit much better presented.
There is bad acting by everyone involved (of course all the women are hot) and if you can't figure out who the killer is in the first ten minutes, you've never watched a movie before.
I couldn't even finish this awful movie (I got about 40 minutes into before I just couldn't take it anymore) but there was no doubt who the killer was.
However, if you're getting drunk before or while you're watching a film, there are literally thousands of terrible, terrible films that become enjoyable where they would otherwise be unwatchable.
I'd never heard of Z-Channel before and was very interested to find out about it, but the filmmakers refused to present me with a clear context or history of their subject.
Too much was assumed before any solid groundwork was laid.
It's confusing and annoying to be repeatedly told of the significance and importance of something before that thing is fully explained.
I'm pretty sure that other people like me, people who had never heard of Z-channel before, were similarly bored or confused.
Some primary sources -- ie the letters (all voices are good) -- illuminate the unextraordinary, loving man under the extraordinary artist, but I did not leave knowing him better than before I went in, which anyway is not well.
My theory is that they just needed a reason to have a man diving into a mirage that is really just hot sand to add to the sight gag of the kids plowing a wooden shack to the ground because they thought it was a mirage, just like the cavernous mansion that disappeared before their eyes earlier.
You've seen this movie before.
The movie drags on and on, passing from one person to the next in this small Texas town, doing their bit before the camera before it passes them over and travels on to the next.
I'm glad I saw it before "Slackers" because otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.
The plot was erratic and stupid, never settling to get its bearings before moving on to another weak plot turn.
But the rest has been done before and better.
You only are treated to very little tension before these happenings, and an unsatisfying, weak aftermath shot.
Sarandon shakes her head dumbfoundedly and Hagman is seen racing toward the nearest bank to cash his check before the studio goes under.
And in blanketing everyone onboard Flight 93 as a hero, I guess that includes the pilots and passengers who were stabbed to death early, before the action even got underway, whose only contribution to the cause was, "Hey, wait a minute Â urk!"
There is nothing in this that has not been done better before.
Now that he's been released, it isn't long before a series of gruesome murders begin occurring on campus and low and behold, Brian is the main suspect.
With Roddy McDowall, Martin Mull, and Ione Skye's brother (Donovan Leitch) as the slasher, it was fairly predictable; down to the lame attempt at humor with the cheerleader taking off her panties before the game.
Of course, in this type of film, it takes an awfully very long time before any of the dim-witted characters realizes something's wrong and "Cutting Class" is no exception.
Someone actually has to stumble over a corpse accidentally before realizing several others persons are missing as well.
Being a fan of fantasy films, I was enchanted by the story and characters, though it was over 40 years before i saw it again.
You'll be predicting the movies plot points before they arrive.
This is where the basic building blocks -- the rules if you would -- of television writing arose from, the most notable of necessities being that a significant motivating event must take place before the first commercial break.
However, the impatient nature of production companies to get content out quickly rather than developing it to its maximum potential is resulting in a stream of uninteresting shows to be rushed out before given enough breathing space to mature from flash-in-the-pan neat to truly exceptional.
There would be power dynamics and struggles that were in place before the catastrophe.
Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair.
But before the film's over we see him dressed in the dark robes of a satanic priest, and in an unflattering spandex costume that makes him come off as an obese hermaphroditic version of Wonder Woman.
True story: before watching this film, one thing lead to another and I ended up dropping the disk down the toilet.
Ultimately, the movie loses you because it never explains why Eddie disappeared, what made him a genius, or what was eating him before he ever became a singer.
Beyond that one gets the sense that we've seen this all before including the obligatory death of the gay character.
MPB's buddy will last for around half an hour in which time they will have a handful of cringeworthy 'bonding' moments, before he is blown away leaving MPB to weep over his dead body and VOW REVENGE.
Only one thing is certain with a film like this, with all the scantily clad women center stage, it's only a matter of time before the obligatory cat fight.
That takes place about midway through, but you'll have to endure endless plodding narration at both ends before calling it a day.
I didn't realize that the hair comb was invented even before fire was?!
This sequel kept my attention for about the first hour before taking a sharp left turn into sheer nonsense territory.
Three months after the incident, he attempts suicide and is revived just before fully ascending into the "white light".
This sequel bears little similarity to it's predecessor, and in some ways it is an improvement, it certainly has a little bit more story to it, but as before, it is only good for the okay special effects, and it is still boring quite a lot.
When a movie tries to get most of its power from a plot twist you've figured out well before halfway , there's a serious problem.
This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to have Chris air-lifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers!
The premises of four motor bikers out motto-crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens.
The supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew.
This seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days - two titles released just before "M:I" using exactly the same storyline spring to mind: "Judge Dredd" and Schwarzenegger's "Eraser".
Big-wig executive Joseph Cotton is mistaken for dead, and he better figure out a way to let the authorities know before they begin the slice and dice of the coroner's table.
Davis becomes very good at searching for clues but Brent is in it to bag the story while getting the news before Garfield.
It won't be long before we learn that the island is home to a science experiment gone wrong, giant mutant shrews with grisly fangs and covered with dreadlocks running amok on the island.
You just knew he was going to get his before it was all over.
As a sidelight, it is interesting to see Dukes of Hazard sheriff James Best tall and handsome as the hero, and it is apparent that producer/villain Ken Curtis labored long and hard in the trenches before gaining fame as Festus.
I've seen a few Episodes of this Cartoon before but really Hate to admit it but I agree with the Angry Mob.
Stop me if you've already heard this one before: Six extremely annoying and unappealing college kids -- sassy blonde Rachel (Catherine Wreford), obnoxious, insensitive, and spineless musclehead Mark (a supremely terrible and insufferable performance by Alan Ritchson), sexy libidinous lesbians Atlanta (cute blonde Ashley Hawkins) and Liz (foxy brunette Tiffany Kristensen, who at least bares her breasts prior to getting bumped off first), bumbling nice guy Adam (decently played by Tom Nagel), and token black Sophie (Myiea Coy) -- on a cross country road trip run afoul of a vicious family of deadly and demented hicks after they get a flat tire in the middle of some nowheresville sticks.
Everything else has been seen before in other horror movies.
We have all seen that before.
The murder scenes was something that we have all seen before in other movies.
*begin digression* But let me just state one thing before I start.
And if Armageddon is going to come, please let it be >before< this comes out on DVD.
I had read the book once before when it was first released (I had also read Angels & Demons which I enjoyed only slightly more than TDC), and a week before it's release decided to read it again to brush up on the story.
Travelling in France and visiting Cannes just before the premiere of the film, I decided to go see it.
You fin yourself asking why he went through the whole theatrics before showing them his malicious intent.
Then please de-code this before we go, it'll help greatly........  And so the plot goes on and on and on like this, no explanation, no reasoning just blind commands that he follows again and again from anybody that cares to give him one.
The script and characters were hopeless--nonstop clichÃ©s that I've seen hundreds of times before.
We KNOW what the end result is before it happens.
Admittedly Dr. Bob Ballard's 1985 discovery of the actual wreck of the giant liner has made this the most dated version in history, considering that people in 1912 ignored some of the survivors who said she didn't sink in one piece, but broke up just before sinking.
I have been a history buff on the sinking of the RMS TITANIC ever since September of 1966 with the opening episode of the ABC-TV IRWIN ALLEN SCI-FI SHOW "THE TIME TUNNEL" where time travelers Tony Newman and Doug Philllps (Jimmy Darren & Robert Colbert) went on the first of many journeys to this ship just hours before she struck the iceberg sinking carrying 1,502 men, women and children to their untimely death's in 28 degree water.
The main note of a person surviving the water was Bakker Charles Jorgen (1888-1977) who was kept alive for more than 2 1/2 hours in the water before being pulled onto Second Officer Charles Lighttoller's overturned Collapsable B lifeboat after 1st Wireless Operator John Jack Phillips froze to death on the boat minutes before Boat No.
By the sounds of things it may be a freezing day in hell before Cussler gives his blessing for a third time.
The film was made some years before the wreck of the Titanic was discovered and nobody could have known that it is so thoroughly mangled, even if the beautifully whole and well preserved specimen the movie offers was always going to be wildly unlikely.
Historical research obviously meant squat to these people so in the film we end up with a man who played in the band on the Olympic for three years before joining Titanic.
The fact that Olympic went into service only about one year before Titanic is calmly disregarded.
I knew the film was pretty poor before I bought it, that was another reason to get it though, some poor films can be quite entertaining.
Now, Mr. Houseman's performance is fine Â after all, he was a stodgy and imperious professor at Julliard for twenty years before this so playing a stodgy and imperious professor at Harvard was hardly a stretch (as Neal Gabler jocularly hinted at during his opening remarks) Â and he has a lot of snappy, quotable lines of dialogue.
See them all, then hesitate before renting Honeydripper.
ISLAND OF THE ALIVE is a very entertaining bad taste horror comedy , maybe not a classic like Peter Jackson`s BAD TASTE but still fairly good as the film opens with a woman giving birth in a New York taxi cab and a cop trying to shoot the new born baby , while the next scene features the knowingly stupid line " It took four bullets before it died - That`s some baby " , and of course there`s scenes of the mutant killer babies ( Done by stop frame animation , none of this CGI rubbish )going on killing sprees , and I haven`t even mentioned Michael Moriarty doing a great Al Bundy impression .
Seeing him on the other side arguing before Macdonald Carey (also a two-time Daytime Emmy winner for "Days of Our Lives") to save that butt-ugly child of his was hilarious.
I really hope people read all these comments before considering watching it.
Therapy for both before eventual recovery, and both win the Grand National at Aintree.
Also the ending was abominable with only two minutes before the bomb goes the doctor has to find the little boy with the cure, kill the villain, and inform the general that she has the cure.
also the ending was abominable with only two minutes before the bomb goes the doctor must find the little boy with the cure, kill the villain, and inform the general that she has the cure.
Which she does just two seconds before the bomb explodes.
If the actors careers weren't over before this movie, they should be pretty much done now.
It doesn't take a scientist to figure out that you should be taking off your bio gear before leaving the quarantine room with contagious pathogens running a-muck.
It illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, of race which took place in the 60's....I'm born in 1980 so I didn't know all that stuff before...In france, USA's history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts !
sounds like a welcoming fate as the 93 minutes pass by before you.
At first before the movie started I had the feeling it would be cheesy like a horrible Sci-Fi movie.
For example, the President refuses to take the antidote provided by the terrorist cause he does not believe in it, the nurse tells Dr. Landis to tell her daughter she was "the light of her life" before she dies, and randomly the screen shows what hour it is since the virus was shot into the President.
The only movie I've seen worse than this is "Final Days", the movie based on the last days before Kurt Cobain's suicide.
So, according to Bratz, the only way to be successful in life is by continually clinging to the people you've known before we came out of your mother and making sure that you always, ALWAYS, wear what's fashionable, otherwise you're a totalloser.
Stopping at "Bratz" to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag.
I had never seen the movie before I went out and bought it the other day.
It will be a long time before I wash the taste of this out of my mouth.
I have never, ever willed a movie to end before, but I found myself considering walking out of the theatre.
I was just reading some comment before i decided to make my own, this guy honestly believes this film deserves a 10/10 rating.
In fact, the best acting comes from the native Mexicans cast in this movie of a bride, who wakes up on the day before her wedding to a scuzzy, wealthy guy, to find she's already married some unknown Mexican hottie.
It opens with Melissa (Laura Prepon from That 70's Show) waking up next to Carlos (Matt CedeÃ±o) the day before her wedding.
Albert Finney as Winston Churchill, Vanessa Redgrave as his wife Clementine and Linus Roache as Ralph Wilgram star in a fine, pre-WWII biographical look at Winston Churchill from his being viewed as a minor irritant and alarmist to his rise to the head of the Royal Navy, before his becoming Prime Minister.
He assures Picard he will just do what he did before to take the Enterprise back.
The Traveler tries to get them home, but he is so tired he loses control again and propels the Enterprise to 'where no one has gone before', at least, where no human has gone before.
She eventually finds a note in her room from the sailor, saying that he's leaving and that he'd like to meet her before he goes.
Later a rare peregrine falcon is mistakenly shot from the sky by the same dog basher as before.
During the festival, I heard producers talk about how distributors are coming to look for the film, and one of the producers right before the screening told someone that they want this film to be in theaters, not just a DVD release.
Anyway, as anyone who has ever seen a movie before knows, looking at a porn mag MEANS certain death, and this guy comes to a boring and abrupt end.
Then more people die, as a way of stalling us before we start seeing the horny teens (all played by people appearing to be in their late 20s) get killed.
So, in one of the only amusing developments, one of the women goes all princessy and needs a smoke, of a certain brand, before she can start putting out (though it seemed like they already had done it, andÂ I don't understand).
And what had the jury smoked before they decided on giving this film a CÃ©sar???
I have never left the cinema before the end of a movie, until now.
Even before they first consummate their love, it is quite evident that Lady Chatterley and Parkin want each other.
My dad and my uncle heard about it on their CB radios and went up to see it before the Sheriff ever got there.
If you think that you have saw a bad boring film before this one, you are wrong !
In the future I will think twice before ever seeing another Isaac Webb movie.
I only voted four because of my original impression of the film(before Isaw the end) Avoid at all costs!!!!!
And they would likely have remained largely unknown, had journalist Philip Nobile not undertaken a remarkable study of Haley's private papers shortly before they were auctioned off.
The acting was pretty sub-par, and the lines in general had a scripted sound...the sort where they literally just read it before the director said action.
My only complaint is that a theme from Ennio Morricone's score kept running through my head before I could remember this is the movie where I heard it.
Do some sit-ups right before he takes your blood pressure, or maybe walk up a flight of stairs to their office.
I think that I have heard jokes like this before and they were snowman jokes in Jack Frost.
If that's true, then the film was handicapped before it even began by bypassing Channing in favor of a very young Barbra Streisand, playing a character fifteen or twenty years older than she actually was.
If only low-budget film makers would think before making their movie.
This is the first time I've ever turned of the movie before the ending.
I think they actually spent the whole budget on the title sequence, where everybody's credit came before the title.
14) Did the lab geek take Kendo and firearms lessons after organic chemistry and before theoretical mathematics?
Im surprised he hasn't done anything before or since as he played a brilliant part, even if his accent is a little dodgy.
I don't care if they broke it off before the fiancÃ©e died, you would be more upset about the senseless murder of your "great friend," as he labeled her.
Also, could he not wait a short while before he decided to get together with the strange postal worker girl?
This came directly on the heels of "The Godfather" from the year before, the film that put Pacino on the map.
Meanwhile, Scruffy manages to fall into the river, and is rescued by a junkyard dog right before she drowns.
Just before Scruffy and this other dog are about to be euthanized they are adopted by this family, and I think Scruffy wins a beauty pageant and she also has a big pile of puppies.
Considering the Vampire race has been around for 1000's of years it seemed strange that there was only 4000 throughout the entire world & that they had never been noticed before.
The central relationship between Grant the human & Gray the Vampire was clichÃ©d & really cheesy, I mean at first they don't don't get on & seem mismatched but by the end they are best of friends & have saved each other's lives, we've seen it all before & done a lot better.
The guy next to me left 45 minutes before the movie ended and I wish I had done the same thing.
And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes".
I would warn anyone who feels affection for Poirot and the great body of his work before this absurd farce to avoid it at all costs.
This is the second Poirot I've put back in the box before finishing.
It was just before the cinema crisis in 1985-86,a crisis which put an end to all these poor quality products.
I must point out that well before the plane takes off you've seen all the chicks naked already, this is that type of film.
They just repeated the same old ones over and over and over again to the point of tedium, where you can see the jokes long before they arrive.
At the peak of his creativity, Enfield frequently killed off characters before they exceeded their natural lifespan (Little Brother himself being a case in point).
I held off for a significant portion of the movie before I finally gave up my attempt to determine whether this was intended to be an extremely deeply-seeded comedy.
At one point, he literally "reacts" to a colleague's outburst a spit-second before the guy actually makes the outburst.
Hallson (Arthur O'Connell) is dead in the centrifuge, and evidently has been for hours, although we all heard it turn on only minutes before.
What was Chase thinking of when she went before the cameras?
And since, the world has never forgotten this disgustingly sentimental heap of molly-wash. Julie Andrews gives a non-memorable performance in the title role-- where is the interest with which she has played every other part before and since?
As a kid from Lebanon Oregon we seen little like this before.
This film was obviously before JCVD had any authority in the production of movies as HE would not put out such a poor movie.
Okay, before I even delve into the horrors of this film, I'd just like to know what the heck is with Kitty Chalmers obsession with guitars??
I can imagine Albert Pyun thinking aloud right before filming this movie: "You know, there are a lot of flashbacks in this script, but I don't want to do anything clichÃ©.
There's really not much else to say for this film; if I could go back in time to be before I saw it, I wouldn't see it.
This has got to be the fastest I have ever jumped at seeing a movie before.
The acting is pretty bad, but I suppose if you're going to watch a Doug McClure film you expect that before it's even begun.
The boys family was killed by the mafia and the FBI agent was semi-responsible because he was protecting the boys family before the father testified against the mafia.
The idea has been done before, there is no originality whatsoever in any of the scenes made.
Here's what I didn't like: -The old and rehashed formula: urban school, urban kids, White-Latino comes in and "saves the day" and teaches them the refined culture of manners and courtesy which are obviously foreign concepts to them- seen this (formula) before and never liked it.
My God, the last time I checked in the mirror I was Black, and yet when I go to the movies I start to question it b/c my parents aren't drug dealers and I've never seen a gun before.
They use their "scientific method" to try to rule out regular happenings before they can draw a conclusion, but even when they do rule out everything else, they STILL aren't willing to admit it's paranormal.
Characters stare at each other for MINUTES ON END inexplicably in the middle of a @#$# conversation, children see dead, bloodied bodies and simply stand there aloof like scarecrows before casually walking away--countless reactions are completely fake and unrealistic.
It's over half an hour of tedium, poor character development & scene setting before anything that even resembles horror takes place.
Cyd gets her chance to dance, but I kept getting distracted by the fact that I'd seen all these moves before!
I went through all of the stages of dying before the third season ended, lingering a little longer at "anger" and "denial" than I think I will when the time actually does come.
Mickey Rooney plays Mike Halligan, a retired New York City detective who dies before Christmas and is sent back to Earth to find an alcoholic angel and sober him up in time for Christmas to spread the Christmas cheer to the citizens of New York.
Linda Hunt won the Oscar just before this was made, but she doesn't seem to have any purpose in the story except to trade rueful japes with Kline playing a bar matron with a good heart.
A re-make of prem rog... a very boring movie....and very predictable... u all have seen it before.... whats the point watching it all over again.
Adding more Leonard Maltin movie grading: It has already been done before!
She would never have done such a thing with a single man, let alone a married one, and mentions on many occasions that she has never had a romance, bar one young man by the name of Lionel, but "mother nipped it in the bud" before anything as mad as a fully-fledged affair could begin.
The characer "Wet" has a faded scar in one scene; a few scenes later another character is commenting on how she just got a bad scar on her face from a beating, then, minutes later (days later in movie-speak), her scars are all red a fresh, even though she had them way before the mention of any beating.
We've all seen the formula girl prison movie before.
As stated, many times before, shows like Veggie Tales sell--both monetarily and morally.
As other parents stated before, it does have the values you're looking for.
Haven't seen that before.
This results in the "real" Tom Stalls/Joey Cusack emerging, who violently pins her down before she consents to having "rough" sex with him.
As the film faded to black at the end and the credits began to roll, there was a deep intake of breath by the whole audience before universal laughter and derision.
I have never actually left a comment on a movie before, as I'm a strong believer in making your own mind up, but I'm strongly considering leaving my job and mounting a one man campaign to dissuade people from spending their hard earned cash on this pile of poo!
The discussion at the table before entering the house is excellent.
It's also, included, no kidding, as a notice right before the title sequence for WITCHTRAP.
The movie itself feels like it has ended 4 or 5 times before the actual end of the movie.
The plot is completely old hat, nothing new --stop me if you've heard this one before -- a straight guy pretends to be gay to impress a girl.
EATING OUT, like several films before it (Trick, Mambo Italiano, Get your stuff, and the Spanish movie Km.0) tries to be a light-and-witty-but-poignant-at-times gay comedy of errors and switched identities, generously sprinkled with sequences whose main purpose is to showcase its young cast's semi-naked bodies in erotic situations.
Well, if this is an example of the product put before filmmakers or distributors it's no wonder!
I spent 15 years trying to find this film before finally picking up a UK pre certificate tape of it.
RenÃ© Cardona Jr made the overlong, boring and trashy shark flick Tintorerra a year before he went to make this overlong, boring and trashy disaster/survival flick with sharks thrown in.
The survivors get themselves onto a small boat and are swept out to sea, but it's not long before hunger starts setting in, and this in turn sets off arguments between the survivors as they realise that they have to eat...something.
The plot seems all too easy and done plenty of times before, but it still somewhat keeps your interest.
It's only a matter of time before someone(..or multiple someones)would offer their services to her.
So before you buy...I strongly recommended renting it.
It's all been done before, again and again, ad nauseam.
Presumably,as a minor, they would consult with his mother before prescribing these drugs, and in fact, it would be very unusual for them to even accept him as a patient without first having contact with a parent -- at very least to arrange for payment (this being the United States).
Of course, before that we're treated to the school bus ride from "Sixteen Candles."
I rented this horrible B movie last night before checking out people's comments first.I will never make that mistake again.I couldn't even get a credit for another DVD after asking for a one at the video store because it's just their stupid policy not too because it's a renter beware thing or something.I thought the opening scene was a bit funny but knew from there it was no horror and could not get into it because it dragged on and was boring as hell.It was filmed in the same cheap same format as a daytime soap opera.I trusted the stupid cover art when it said nothing but good things about this movie.Even Fangoria gave it praise.I'm not sure I wanna read Fangoria anymore after being mislead.I don't understand how it could win anything.The idiot who made this film has no taste and it never should have even found distribution.
I never actually said this before in my life and truly meant it but, Jeff Thomas should be shot if he makes another movie and there should be laws enacted to prevent this guy from making movies especially if he decides to be the main character.
It's all been done before.
Please save yourself the 20 minutes (that's all you'll be able to get through before turning it off) and DO NOT rent/download/buy this movie.
Unfortunately I'm one of those people who has to watch a movie in it's entirety before forming an opinion.
I couldn't tell if anyone was actually interested in what was happening, or if the amount of beer drinking that occurred before the dubbing was finally taking effect.
i'll watch a Hollywood crapfest festival of Hudson Hawk followed by Gili followed by Showgirls back to back before i'll watch 10 minutes of this movie again.
It was on TV before it went on to video.
You could do this over and over before getting even a bump.
I was saddened to find out that these mini-films were made over a decade ago and prey that some day, Harrison Ford and Sean Pattrick Flannery may be brought together again (as they did in the Chicago episode) and have another go at yet another piece of the Jones saga, before yet another unfamiliar actor is brought upon to don the cowboy hat once again.
The DVD has 11 deleted scenes and the director could really have cut more off to make a tighter and story, which like mentioned before, could have fared well on the X-Files.
If you have never seen a film by Tarkovskij before, don't watch this - it might keep you from seeing his masterpieces.
A stale screenplay that never attempts to rise above itself coupled with stumbling dialogue dooms the movie long before the viewers try to grasp a plot that's really not existent.
For World War Two history buffs you may enjoy the scenes of the beaches of Dunkerque as I can't recall ever seeing it represented in a movie before.
All in all, a minor entry in the director's filmography, elevated to mythic status by legal problems which have prevented its appearance on home video, and while the film exercises a gamut of stylistic concerns (Argento followed it with an unlikely detour into historical comedy, FIVE DAYS OF MILAN, before cutting loose with his giallo masterpiece DEEP RED), it amounts to little more than a footnote in horror history.
Coming off of swashbuckling successes Captain Blood and Robin Hood, it was only a matter of time before Warner Bros. sent Errol Flynn, Michael Curtiz and Olivia de Havilland out west for a formulaic but basically entertaining (if you can get past its dated charm) adventure in the saddle.
It's not long before his fellow Americans are abusing their privileges, and Uncle Sam decides to get up and do something about it.
How many murders have to happen before they stop their annual redneck dirt celebration!
I'm sure someday Christopher Ogden (Jody) will meet up with Michael Stephenson (Joshua from Troll 2) in group therapy and have a good cry over the fact that they both committed career suicide before they hit puberty.
Young Jody (Christopher Ogden) is a pre-teen with military aspirations thanks to Uncle Sam's medal winning service in Kuwait before his death.
Hatton is ably assisted by his sidekick, Rusty (Alan Hale), who acts as deputy and backs up Hatton in all his fights, while he is sheriff and before.
Iraq was in a terrible way LONG before the American came.
I guess this is why you rent a movie before you buy it, so you don't waste your money on something worthless.
The romance between Adams and a Pennsylvania woman, Eveline McCord (co-scenarist Gwendolyn Edwards of "The Broken Hearts Club"), who came to South Carolina to teach school before hostilities, lacks any vibrancy.
The remaining 90 or so minutes that ensues is devoted to events before and after the war, and there is a hint that perhaps the protagonist didn't survive this trial by bloodshed.
This movie is a just another turkey stuffed with so many clichÃ©s that the hoven is about to explode before Thanksgiving.
It doesn't take long before Jane herself begins to suffer from nightmares and the antique hearse even begins to stalk her!
This was Akki's first film with DD who is known for his mad films, Akki had done a comic role before in SUHAAG(94) but here he plays a full comedian  The movie is a full crap and surprisingly DD released it with another film of his DEEWANA MASTANA which had better actors like Anil and Govinda(at least that time) and that film worked  This film is a complete crap film and makes no sense and it doesn't even keep you entertained, A must for comedies  The comedy scenes are trite while the main plot is itself senseless and the attempts to comedy are foolhardy though the message is a nice one  Direction by DD is bad Music is okay  Akshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days He shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man's Govinda Juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show Kader repeats his act, Paresh is awful Satish Kaushik annoys Gulshan Grover has an indefinite role
But before you can even fathom how it ends let me tell you how it begins, a girl gets a gun to her head by some freako that said he saw this town, which they didn't even know what it was then.
Richard Burton, always a wooden film actor, overacts like never before as Henry VIII.
Eye Candy: Carlee Baker, Eryn Joslyn, Eve Mauro, and Robin Sydney all provide T&A (Robin I saw topless before in "Big Bad Wolf", the other three are baring for the first time) There's also nudity in some of the extras (noted with an asterisk)   My Grade: D+   DVD Extras: Optional Intro by Al Jourgensen; commentary with Director Zach Passero, Actresses Robin Sydney, Carlee Baker, & actor Justin Stone; 19 & a half minutes of bloopers & deleted scenes*; photo gallery; Advanced trailer* & theatrical trailer* for this film; and Trailers for "The Oracle", "Love me deadly"*, "Blood Sisters", & "Witchery"*
One of the ladies gets her ass smacked with a belt before being forced to work the wheelchair-bound patriarch's "nub."
To extend the running time even more, this resorts to several of those trendy prolonged 'torture' scenes a la HOSTEL where the victim is tied down and taunted/terrorized a bit before being killed.
I appreciate 99.9% of the films I've seen because they tell a story which I haven't heard before, and most directors only make films with a good storyline.
The film is also misstated: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that.
At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts.
But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse.
)...The same conflicts of culture, politics, "vision", bitterness/resentments/revenge--even language and religion (or the lack thereof) fermented before and during the "Civil War" were continued/extended to "the West" for at least 20 years following the close of the great "War Between the States", with that most famous of bar room brawls gloriously epitomising/personifying these very conflicts!
Despite ninja mania in full swing at the time, the show curiously lasted for only one season before disappearing as quickly as......um.......well, a ninja in fact.
Flatter than most actresses before they make it to the silver screen.
If he had, perhaps he'd have recognized his own utter lack of talent and done the decent thing, which is kill himself before he made this monstrosity.
I was really excited before the movie.
So what you get is a movie about life before and during war, where nobody dies, main character has a romance, full of slapstick humor.
If you lived in a trailer before the hurricane, you lived in a shelter after it (residents from Patterson to Amelia, at least).
And if this movie inspires even one REAL stalker (and as I said before this film is a sham and a PR ploy), but if the film inspires a REAL stalker that would be quite a shame indeed.
I honestly did expected much more from the storyline, i couldn't watch it in one time, it's getting so boring so i took couple of days of interval before i finished the movie.
And in the morning when he wakes up his hair is the same, he just looks the same as he did the day before.
It was also extraordinarily fortunate that Agent McGregor (Hemingway), who had never attempted rock climbing in her life before this trip, was so instantly adept at it that her next climb was a two hundred foot vertical climb without tether.
I wonder if Ford saw this before making "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence."
Come to think of it, before the fight scene, some ex-Union soldiers begin singing "Marching Through Georgia," which annoys the Confederate veterans who strike up, "Dixie."
Scream before the masseuse goes under and her attacker reloads the rag!
So much is lacking: the lead actor can't dance enough for the big production number, the lead actress can dance but is downright homely (there's a point in the script where she says she used to be the ugliest girl in such-and-such a town before Ray Walston turned her into a vamp, and one can't help but think, gosh, is this the best he could do?
Now apart from the odd piece of bathroom humour there was nothing really to laugh at that had not been attempted before!
They live in the Heartland Â surely they've seen America's Most Wanted before, no?
Mention has been made before of the saloon brawl.
Come on, I saw it was her minutes before that!
This was Errol Flynn's first film and it was made before he made it to Hollywood.
It is laughable and silly and the only thing that I kinda of enjoyed was when I realized that Caruso and Crenna were once in a film together 13 years before this one.
Apparently there was also the voices of Jon Lovitz, and, in his last film before his death, Rear Window and It's a Wonderful star James Stewart.
In fact I know just as much now about the programme as I did before I watched this film that was based on the (supposedly) biographical book.
And while they got the history right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejecting pitches for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen.
Countless people live near toxic waste dumps to this day; New Orleans was already like a cesspool before Hurricane Katrina exacerbated the pollution.
I would take a Spanish class before partaking of this movie.
First of all - Polish mathematicians and cryptologists decrypted Enigma several years before WWII.
It probably pitches like it could be funny (and even successful), but it falls apart as a film, completely...If you understand this, then you also understand it sounds more like an off-Broadway play...As a matter of fact (and the ore I think about it), this 'movie' would probably do very well in a live theatrical format...Heck, it could take on a life of its own and become syndicated, making the US cities tour, complete with building sized promos appearing in each city months before it premiers to build the anticipation...I'm certain performing arts centers all over the country will sell out all the shows quickly as anticipation grows and of course the wealthy season ticket holders would let everyone know they'll be busy on Friday evening, because they will be at the 'premier' of that play...'The Grand'...As a matter of fact, the more 'I' think about it, given the opportunity; 'I'd' pitch it!
Actually copyright 1989, which is important: not just because this is exactly the kind of film that sits around for four years before it gets released, but because it means that this South African production was completed before, not after, Mandela got out of prison.
We lasted about 20 minutes before it got us.
I feel that if I look down I will see the tattered remains of the person I was before I saw this movie floating in a pool of my lost humanity.
The voice-over gives the date and time (sometimes the times don't synch with the amount of daylight shown), and more often than not he follows with `nothing unusual to report' before telling us that Meeko has escaped or some such.
Voldemort's past is glossed over completely as if they just expect everyone to have read the book before.
He must've faced a much more physical challenge in HBP than in any other HP movie he's done before, but then again, the older he gets, the more is expected of him.
Never seen her before, but she so definitely filled the role as the love-sick Lavender Brown to a tee.
Luckily, the Harry Potter character was well supported by the Ginny Weasley character, which means that Bonnie Wright was given a great deal more screen time than before.
As has been said before, this is a really bad Harry Potter installment.
Let that stew in your brain before you ever write anything again.
Now before I continue to rag on the choices of the writers I will say that HBP is visually stunning to a level above the previous films and what they did put into the script works for the film.
There would have been mild confusion towards the end but as said before I would be the casual fan who wouldn't really mind.
At the end of the movie the audience should be lamenting Dumbledore's horrific death, but the movie moved so fast it was hard to truly wrap your mind around one scene before another began.
WHY for the love of all that's holy, did Harry just STAND there while Snape murdered Dumbledore before his very eyes?
The movie ends neither too soon, which would leave them still tacky when you got up to turn it off, nor does it run long enough to disqualify it as a good excuse to sit down and paint your nails and let them dry thoroughly before starting in on any other projects.
The band members were a real band and had never acting before so you could forgive them their acting.
Like that idea hasn't been done a million times before.
Horror movies caught on to this idea way before this guy was busted.
This is one of the rare bad sci-fi movies that I actually stopped watching before it was over!
Here, before your very eyes, she BECOMES the message of this film.
After all, Mars is dramatic territory explored before by Edgar Rice Burroughs, C.S.
One must find themselves before one can give him/her self in any relationship, be it gay or straight.
MGM waited three years before putting it into a film and it went into one of the products of their B picture unit, Born to Sing.
Which as it turns out is to put on a show before Matthews does and showcase O'Neill's music.
Staging the number is Busby Berkeley and the staging of it is similar to some of what he did in Ziegfeld Girl the year before.
Some idiot ends up saving the day, and we're only offered a mere glimpse of good old Satan at best, before he's flushed down his infernal toilet again.
Another "I swear it - the corpse was here two minutes before!
Most of the time, the patients Â who are supposed to be dangerous and severely unstable Â are left completely unsupervised and whenever a riot or cat-fight breaks out, it literally takes several minutes before someone in a white coat shows up.
I have seen before "Turkish exorcist" at the theater.
"Black Hawk Down" is a film that offers up an indistinguishable cast of characters, Army men devoid of personality but all trailed by gold haloes (heavy irony here, as one reviewer mentioned, one soldier is presently in prison for rape), as they carry out a rescue mission that goes awry (although the plot becomes a moot point even before the troops arrive), which turns into the type of loud, exploitative, and soulless bloodbath we've come to expect from the prolific, oh-so-patriotic Jerry Bruckheimer.
To add to this Daniel looked awkward with the women and clearly has never played Texas hold-em before.
I yawned through it and left before the end.
Anti-climax #4: Bond shots Mr. White and before we actually understands who White is and his motive etc.
There have been some bad Bond movies in the past, but they were bad only because they didn't live up to the standards set by better Bond movies before them.
This movie is just BAD and an embarrassment to every Bond movie before it.
Like others have said before.
If you're hoping for any kind of Bond movie at all, watch one that was made before this one - because despite the title and the lead characters name.
By contrast in the "Goldfinger" (1964) prequel, Bond blows up a narcotics operation, changes into a tux, romances a cabaret dancer, and easily dispenses with an assassin, all the before the opening credits.
I was going to wait until a second viewing of CASINO ROYALE before writing a comment for it since my opinion on a film occasionally does change the second time around, but I am absolutely stunned at the positive rating of the picture so I feel I must get my two cents out while my grips are fresh in my mind.
Otherwise there are no new ideas no new camera angles and most of the scenes have been in the other movies before.
The sequence where Bond is mistaken for a parking attendant is the only ray of bright witty humor Bond is supposed to have and is missing and again it was used in the movies so many times before.
Yes he is a great actor, just watch his facial expression before the stunt man breaks the world record in "car flipping".
You start with a black and white scene which really gives you an impression about the times before it all started.
Another issue I had with this movie was the amount of screen time Daniel Craig was either nude or partially nude, this was not good as I had lunch just before I watched this.
If I wasn't with a bunch of other friends at the theater, I would have walked out after the first ten minutes and got my refund before it was too late.
The film should be burned and all record of it's existence should be deleted before someone else makes the mistake of trying to watch it.
Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a scientist who, like many characters Ferrell has played before (Ron Burgundy, Ricky Bobby, Chazz Michael Michaels), is good at what he does for a living, but whose self-centeredness and delusion warp any credibility the character may otherwise deserve.
I guess I just felt let down because the T-Rex as a villain has been done before in the 16 years since "Jurassic Park" was released.
I did not watch any trailer before going to watch this movie I just decided to watch it when I saw some posters of it in Manila and I did not even read any review or comment about this movie before going to watch it.
They find the most amount of the stuff in a crappy little souvenir shop run by a redneck named Will (Danny McBride), and before they know it Marshall, Holly, and Will are traveling back to another dimension that's all desert.
Whan I watched Third Rock From the Sun before this sequel of Inspector Gadget came out, I thought Harry sounded just like Inspector Gadget.
There is no sense of individualism, just flimsy cause followed by an effect that could have been predicted before the opening credits ended.
This view of the rural West feels very genuine (and I know because I've lived there before).
I am sure that the idea of getting your son his first major role was an important selling point, but did you even read the script (assuming there was one) before you agreed to get involved with this?
As I've said before, large retired actors have unlimited prospects for employment in the state of California, and just think of the reforms you could enact on the film industry as governor!
now it would have been nice if the story writers would have been more considerate and had it like all the world ad been taken over and the US,UK and the USSR joined forces to eradicate and had you fighting in different country's it wouldn't be as insulting to any one would it   Summary: now you can either agree with me (i doubt it) or disagree but at least give it abit of thought before you agree or disagree I've made my review and i stick with it.... Good Graphic Good Gamplay just racist maybe without intent but it still is racist
In the end, I feel like I know as much about Stander now as I knew before I even heard of him, which just shows you how pointless this film was.
It does not do justice to the original manga and all i have to say to anyone who is disappointed with the obvious flaws in this - please see the manga for yourself before making judgements on this great story.
The story is basically the same as before.
I thought the saddest and most poignant scene was during their last meeting together before his death and she finally approved of the small gift he gave her.
Apparently by the number of bottles of wine on his brothers desk he'd done it before.
At least in "Hurcules in America" Arnold learned how to speak English before filming so that the dubbing, no matter how horrible, would be somewhat believable.
I have seen some bad adaptations before but this one takes the cake.
But what really put me off,as mentioned before, was the adult content.
We can see how they were years before, through a series of flash-backs.
Was he and crew doing shots of whiskey with the teamsters right before shooting began?
Antonio Margheriti still is one of my favorite Italian directors (thanks to his 70's & 80's films), but the mix he presents us with "Alien From The Deep", he has done before and much better already.
By this time no one in the audience gives a damn who did it (they've known for the last 40 minutes), and one is left with the valiant hope that something dreadful will happen to the "heroes" before they mount up and ride off into the...well, you get the idea.
Oh we've seen this oh so many times before, but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed.
Several years would pass before the quality of the material given her would improve.
Granted that things were more innocent back then even in Hollywood before the Code.
I tried to watch this boring, stereotype-pushing piece of poor cinema three times before I could make myself sit through an entire episode.
A couple of Americans in Tokyo have gotten hold of some volatile information about high-ranking Japanese military officials in the United States, but they are killed before they can get the information to U.S. military intelligence referred to here as G-2.
Certainly a healthy Dudikoff might have taken Hamill out before the film was halfway over.
This reviewer attempts to describe something of merit within each work under consideration, but with this wretchedly made film, one must slide by the woeful efforts by those who generally provide audience enjoyment, i.e., director, screenwriter, actors, editors, et alia, before finally recognizing the customary able efforts from crew technicians as the sole evidence of adequacy.
I was bored of the story way before it got close to ending.
They Need more people and needed to MAke more and more of the tapes till it goes international and Racheal and Aiden has to stop it before everyone sees it.
Maybe they should learn how to make a good movie before releasing it (yeah, that's probably a good idea).
If you hated the first one, this one will make you wish you were stricken blind by burning embers before you put the DVD in.
before.
Apparently it is, and if you want to save him you could forgive him because the screenplay was adapted from his own play, and as I have said before, a play can be good but it doesn't have to make a good movie.
Now Just when you think the plot gets going somewhere, there's another cut to the bad guy (presumably the bad guy, he's really a scrawny kid) with his henchmen dropping nun-chucks on their feet and weather he's real or not isn't entirely clear as we cut once again to the 3 main characters and another training montage that is entirely identical to all the others before it.
Sometimes I watch movies from the "Bottom 100" to laugh a little, but this "film", if it is actually allowed to call it this way, outclassed everything I have ever seen before.
What can i really say that hasn't been said about this movie before?
I have seen other movies like this before like the movie dead end,but I thought the ending of the I inside was more real.He was either in a coma for 2 years and while under imagined all the scenarios of bettering his life and making up for the people he wronged,or was stuck in hell tortured with never ending memories of what he did while he watched with his own eyes the sins he committed.And his guilt was making him see how he would change things if he had another chance.
The relationship with his blind roommate is not particularly drawn out either (you're half-way through the film before you realize it's his roommate, and not a relative).
Overall, they might as well just show some before and after shots of the car for a few minutes and open up some time slots.
Richard Sachs (if you didn't even chuckles at that name, the ill-conceived 'humor' in this horror film will bore you, by the way), the collage student son of a successful businessman decides to have the inaugural debut of his reality show website shoot at an haunted house that was home of serial killer Sean McIntyre, a man who killed his family one Thanksgiving night before hanging himself.
We have seen this theme before, and even after this film (The Butterfly Effect), but that does not give any reason why Cooney should not take his stab at it.
Why is it they live and other before them did not?
"Yes," replies Burns before he tells her "don't get us mad."
As stated before, there are some actors that are good in every film, and Bette Davis is one of those actors.
3/10 ..Years later we got a second installment .Well just as before I had to see it.Groan..I didn't expect the "sequel" to be any different (but wait what a difference time makes ) low and behold my current favorite TV serial was born.
Just before he dies, Baldessari tells Emily that they didn't kill Yaakov.
Once you've seen the film's 139 minutes however, you sit back with a feeling of having seen it all before.
You are simply left with a feeling of having seen it all before.
All in all, it's sad that so much money has been spent only to have the audience leaving the cinema with a deja-vu-feeling, the thought "haven't I seen this before?
We're about 30 minutes into the movie before there's any sign of aliens, mayhem, whatever.
anyways, the alter-ego-"fight club" (and X other movies)-like twist in the end serves only to justify the completely unlikely plot and over-the-top bloodshed before and, inadvertently (unlike in "fight club"), makes 90% of what we've seen totally illogical and impossible to have happened.
Very enthralling basis about a witch who is summoned to the twentieth-century and wreaks havoc upon the descendent of the man who is her lover and persecutor centuries before.
We soon learn that he has been in this hospital before, in 2000, which is when his brother Peter was killed.
Seen it before, you say?
Stop me if you've heard this plot before(like from "My Boyfriend's Back) but Steve then proceeds to hide Amy's current undead state from his friends and family.
It looks as if it was animated by the old Commodore Amiga pixel-by-pixel painters before being blown up to DVD resolution.
I watched about a half hour of this crap before becoming so angry that i couldn't continue.
The "hero" in the movie is a fool who let entirely too much go on before taking action.
It was so bad that we were entertaining ourselves poking fun at it and decided to leave before it was over rather than waste our time any further.
Not-very-funny television show that introduces us to two brothers (Kieren "I Look Like Macaulay" Culkin and Will Friedle) whose lives are the prime focus of this show that only got a few episodes on NBC before it was booted.
The rich started taking advantage of the poor since the 16th century, when is agreed that capitalism was born (I would like to know what brilliant economic system ruled before that).
The DVD is clearly based on the the same script as the TV version available on VHS Cassette but there are many small changes which somehow conspire to cause most of the jokes, which are very funny with the VHS cast, to fall flat and as mentioned before, the sound track irritates rather than complements.
I genuinely urge anyone who has only known this DVD to try and see the VHS version before concluding that The Plank is not a very funny film indeed
Or got the fabled Futurama deathslot before the important Simpsons/Seth McFarlane trifecta.
After having a threesome with them, the twin sisters attack Waldemar who manages to kill them both but not before he is bitten by one.
I don't know when I officially had to turn it off before it put me to me sleep.
The DVD was only playing 20 minutes before my GF asked me what's this about.
Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three best-friends, so close that they could be brothers and how love and life changes them on the last summer they spend together before they go about their adult lives.
I sincerely wish that I had come to this site to read some of the commentary on this before I shelled out good money and two hours of my life for it.
I'd also read comments about the state of her lips and thought it was just internet geeks going overboard, but they are really big now, significantly moreso than in her trek role, I think she needs to ease off on the collagen before they take over her face, they're starting to look like she was beaten up.
As I kid back in the glory days of movies before TV invaded everyone's home, a double feature almost always included a "B" oater along with the main attraction, not to mentions shorts, a newsreel and a cartoon.
There are some good special effects, but nothing we haven't seen before.
Another predictable, pretentious natural disaster "thriller" made for TV, "Earthquake in New York" does nothing we have not seen before, and accomplishes zip.
Rampaging through a theater, it finds a female as others flee, tearing away at her face right before Kirk is able to catch him.
Kirk's boss, Milton(Franco Ressel)unloads two shot gun blasts into the beast before it rips away at his leg.
before having the screen go black for some inexplicable reason.
Well after watching this movie and loving it, my intial thought was : was this film great because it was different and a break from the cheesy nonsense that bollywood has thrown my way before.
A dubious hero tries to stop the contamination before the army nukes the whole town.
As it is, the film lights up the moment this dazzling hunk makes his first appearance as a clerk behind a tobacconist's counter, and the entire first half of the film that's gone before seems like a hopeless waste.
In anything approaching a plausible situation, she would have been instantly fired, and if there were any justice, slapped very hard before being ejected from his home.
A mostly no name supporting cast with the exception of Pam Grier and Jason Statham who brighten up the background for a little bit before being sunk by the bad dialogue.
i have to totally disagree with the people before me.
Some things I heard about this film before it was released was that it was "patriotic".
Further, the scenes of the children being abused before their murders were just plain exploitive and sick.
Like I said before, it's not needed!
It was nothing I haven't seen a hundred times before in other movies.
I read reviews of this video before viewing, and watched it with some trepidation.
This is the first time I've ever written in these comments - I just wanted to warm someone else before they lose an hour and a half of their life.
I wasnt sure what to expect before i watched conspiritors of pleasure except that it was a foreign film which almost always turn out to be sureal and this one did not dissapoint.
While these particular elements of plot, character and location have probably never been brought together before, there is nothing particularly novel about any of them.
I've heard (positive things) about Arturo Ripstein before, but this is his first film I've seen.
It wouldn't be long before Dickie's contract was not renewed an d he left WB.
I got eight minutes into this badly scripted, badly acted and badly directed bomb before I gave up and slipped a different DVD into my player.
If you've never seen a Bollywood film before, this is the best place you could start.
The story has been told before in several other better films.
So I think Turkish producers have discovered this 20 years before Hollywood.
This is before you even consider the petrifying inclusion of shots stolen from Star Wars (particularly one shot of a TIE fighter exploding before the FAlcon, which reappears at least 10 times in the film) in the wrong aspect ratio and the shocking inclusion of music from Indiana Jones.
Even the killing itself was a bore...just the sound of a gunshot, and W bends over slightly before being shuffled into a waiting vehicle..just like the Reagan hit in the 80's.
Those who were running from place to spot scrambling to do damage to the United States, show the unrest in the world, that was there, before we were even a country.
However this will remain to others, who have seen more than this movie and have a different understanding of this world in which we live in, an intellectual 'wheelchair' to the Liberal base that doesn't indeed look for the good in America but continues to find a 'Villain' in the U.S.   My question is, before 9/11, when there were still three thousand people in one piece, and Bin Laden was offered to President Clinton, on two different occasions, when William passed on taking him, because he said, "We have no business, with Bin Laden."
But forget all that, you're set on a journey of 30% anti-Bush protests news clips before death, 60% forensic "whodunit", 10% no freedom wagon.
This movie deserves to be protested, shot, then put on fictional trial before we all come together and whine about crappy movies.
Either that, or everyone saw this as a kid before they developed any taste what-so-ever.
Moriarty gives away almost his entire plan at the beginning leaving Holmes without a single deduction that the audience has not already made long before.
Marsh finds the house in flames and Lawford unconscious inside, before being slugged.
The film has Marlene, a war widow in 1915 now just getting by as a prostitute in this before the Code drama.
James Ryan is appropriately evil and vicious--until he just caves before our hero.
Upon receiving their new assignments each new episode, the duo go about fighting the glob goo spewing vermin that threaten the earth, but not before Martin ruins any new experiment M.O.M.
I've never been this excited for a Bollywood film before...And so I watched it.
Since Krrish was advertised as a love story before a superhero movie, I expected the same.
I got a chill in the beginning right before the plane went down.
Hoo dawgies, what can I say about this movie that has been said before and better by other people?
when they were in the middle of the two dams, they pulled over to the side of the road before stopping, why would you do that when your the only ones left?
So it's up to a small group of people to figure out how they can stop these dangerous predators before they reach a major town.
it all comes down to poor programming and it was probably a rushed job cos it was not long after that the playstation died and the black box (ps2) was born they would be trying to get it out quick style so as they could get it sold before the enevitable happened.
Kettering & his team face a race against time to stop the parasites before they take over the entire human race!
She also wears only two very unstylish outfits before she becomes his pet.
"the producers approached me and Doug (Naylor) and said he had a few questions before the go ahead, the first was that he didn't feel the American audiences would be able to associate with a hologram, so was there any way we could not kill Rimmer.
I admit to liking the occasional T&A flick, but I can't stand the setup they use here and like so many others have before (see: Snapdragon).
Everything before this is so, so unbelievably slow.
Meanwhile (there are a LOT of meanwhiles in this movie) Michael J. Pollard also has porn starlet Teri Wiegel chained up down in their basement, and she gets to display her naked breasts for the camera before being slaughtered as a ritual prize for Satan.
The Hollywood studio bosses were easily and quickly intimidated; the blacklist which ruined the careers of many actors, screenwriters and directors was gathering steam; and people were being called on to defend before Congress who their friends were, how they voted and what organizations they may have supported or joined.
They looking for guys and police blocks the road, then we see them turning right because they go that way for they little day off just before the police setup, you really think the police wouldn't stop them to do a little control?
The fairground scene equally predictable and nauseating as we see the "romantic interest" blossom, while bad kids steal fireworks, and you just know "sumthin' bad is gonna happen" There's even a "bridge crossing" reminiscent of SBM, at which point "bad earring boy" falls into lake, is naturally saved by boy, just before they all go over the waterfall that wasn't there 2 minutes ago, and the dog has disappeared only to make the customary reappearance at the end of the film when everything turns out happily ever after, the good and bad all become friends, and while playing chess (the way new best buddies always do), along comes baddies daddy, with a peace offering, and a hearty welcome and along comes doggie to be greeted with absolutely no emotion by kid, and they all lived happily ever after.
It has a big star cast as usual in such comedy films where they have so many characters and sub plots that you get more confused  So here we have The once funny now boring Johny Lever and Paresh Rawal(who is loosing his touch now) Shahid Kapur just after VIVAAH perhaps he thought of getting a hit as a comedy as those days before VIVAAH he was going bad in his career Ayesha Takia need i say anything ?
I'd say that Cary Grant (a screwball comedy veteran) and Ginger Rogers had zero chemistry as the married couple and I also thought Charles Coburn uncharacteristically walked through a part he did many times before in better movies.
All in all I found it horridly contrived and I had to keep looking at my watch to see how much longer I had to suffer it before it ended.
This was also the last movie he appeared in before his death.
Along the way he crosses swords with various characters from earlier Pink Panther films, before it is finally revealed to the audience (though not to Clifton Sleigh) what actually became of the hapless Inspector Clouseau.
Long before the end (heck, long before the middle!)
I could overlook budgetary constraints but to have the ship's Captain stand before his men and determine that a torpedo that had just exploded nearby was launched from a new unknown class of submarine; that's just too much.
Heck, he didn't even know there was anything shadowing him only a minute before!!
He looks surprised, says, "You never had no love for me," stumbles out the door, only to discover before he collapses that she'd been true to her word.
There is also a lot of pointless killing, and characters die before you even get to know them.
Never before has there been so much sizzle, and so little sausage.
Maybe if I use the Lucas Plot-Planner 2000 I can come up with what is going to happen in those films before they are released...
Kevin is not forgotten (like he was last time) but hops the wrong plane after he puts fresh batteries in the family camera right before he gets to the gate at the airport (his family had all the bad luck with high winds knocking out the electric - and the alarm clock - twice).
There is some meandering action as the Jedis escape the trade federation and pick up Jar Jar on Naboo before heading to Tatooine; then there is meandering action on Tatooine as the Jedis find Anakin and watch him win a pod race; then there is a cool-looking but contextless scene in the Imperial senate; then there is a final battle.
In the days before his release the family had killed a few people randomly, but now they get rid of the bodies in a vat of acid in an outhouse.
Near the end of the film, the cook accidentally sets her apartment on fire and then falls in love with the firemen who saves her, the gay man accidentally mixes up letters to his lover and mother, thus he has to fly back to the Philippines to retrieve the letter containing sexy pics of him and his lover and before his mother finds out - WHEW!!!
I saw this with my wife and friends (and before you ask, she and they are Filipino).
This kind of cutesy-cute camp seems to be a Cukor trademark: any time I think of Elizabeth Allan as Clara Copperfield waving to Freddie Bartholomew as he leaves in Barkis' cart in the year before's "David Copperfield", I feel sick!
And the sissiness goes on: all the film looks like a Wigstock celebration, with wicked gay touches, as making Rosaline (the girl Romeo raves about before meeting Juliet) an extremately plain-looking woman with not much attractive.
I do not live among people who shout and wave their arms about all the time, although I will of course accept such behaviour in a film where it is a natural response to a stressful situation; but if I do not live among people who behave like that, I am not likely to watch a film that shows everyone doing so continuously, for very long before I turn it off - or at the very least feel compelled to complain, as I am doing now.
I admit, the idea is intriguing-- an old man writes a novel about a bunch of lawyers being killed, and then dies himself, but not before showing the book to a disbarred lawyer who claims it as his own & makes a ton of money, but oops!
However, the old man mysteriously dies before he can return the book to him, and that's when he does something completely unexpected and decides to publish it as his own.
We both love Guillermo del Toro's movies in general and really thought we would love this...  We both saw the first Hellboy movie again before watching this (which I would strongly advise you all to do, as that way you will appreciate just how bad this movie is compared).
Watch as Zucco takes the dead girl's pulse, lets go of her hand, and it hangs there for a second before dropping to the floor.
As I mentioned before, the cop was there for no reason but to wait for a murder and the reporter was also there waiting for something to report.
The story concerns two flyers (Doug Jr. and Frank McHugh) who go to work for gangster Leo Carillo (before his days as Pancho, sidekick to the Cisco Kid) and get involved with running drugs.
The main problem is that all the "surprises" are obvious, you won't be surprised by anything in this film, the plot twists can be see long before they arrive and they have all been used elsewhere.
My friend walked out about 20 minutes before me.
This idleness is way better than the one I was expecting from my two beers the day before, but this is not fun, this is a waste.
I have watched this kind of story before, better written and executed by many directors, v.g.
Ben Stiller is once again Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson has his usual red-eyed-I may have been smoking before they yelled action- delivery that can make some dumb lines kind of funny, but other than that there's not much there there.
Never before has he accomplished comedy as great as this.
-Why did God not mercifully strike me down before witnessing the last minute?
I found "The Out-of-Towners" to be an endless series of mishaps that before long became extremely tiresome to watch.
But on the theme and story as a whole, it really wasn't pulled off right ... we the audience just didn't get the information we needed to figure things out either before or with the characters.
squad, before they find them.
I don't know, but I do know that it's not funny when I watch, not funny afterward, and not funny before.
In my humble opinion, there are much better horror gems from the 80's waiting to get discovered properly, so I have absolutely no idea why this turkey received a DVD-release before any of them.
What a terrible film, i think Jackie Chan's sons career has ended before it even began.
Having had watched porn before (who hasn't?)
The latter is especially bothersome because Strindberg himself wrote in his preface (around 6 pages printed before the play text explaining to the women and other invalids the action of the play) that Christine was meant to be a dull character, and empowering her alters the direction of the play.
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
After a few more mishaps, they finally make it to their same hotel destination with their luggage brought back earlier, thanks to the airport in Boston, but George can't get his suitcase unlocked due to the fact that the scam guy from the night before has his key in his wallet, then George goes to his interview, making it on time, in spite of his disheveled appearance (and he thought he wasn't going to make it due to the strike).
And my very favorite moment of the film, when a woman leaps out of a high window, the old woman she's walking with has to run to the window and look down before reacting in horror.
Also, there were no deep intakes of the weed which is then held a bit before expelling the smoke - no, these people were smoking this stuff like cigarettes except they weren't inhaling.
Law and order ultimately sets things straight but not before a guilt ridden member of the dealers haunted by flashbacks jumps through a ten story window to her death.
Just as I was heading inside, the power clicked back on, something in the fusebox sparked, and, before long, my entire home was ablazeÂ and nary a firetruck in sight.
I strongly recommend reading it before you read any of the other reviews (including my own - below).
Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.
In most movies, there's enough time to kill twenty people, blow up a building and have a car chase before the police even show up.
The action scenes are poor & very forgettable, there's a dull car chase & a few seen it all before shoot-outs where the bad guys can't shoot straight, no-one ever runs out of bullets & it's just a case of men standing there holding guns firing at each other.
The plot is extremely predictable & strictly by the numbers with these two mismatched partners hating each other to start with but growing to respect each other & becoming great friends & even putting their own lives at risk for one another, seen it all before & usually done much better with more humour & more excitement.
The charm of Star Wars was gone before Lucas unveiled his uber-deluxe, special treatment of the films for the third time.
You've seen 'em in the fifth element, in the trailer for men in black II (before the film started) and here they are again, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
Ernest Borgnine, as the plummer taking out the toilet, offers her a ride to wherever she needs to go, and before he knows it, she has basically become his guest.
His opening scene giving a speech to his underlings is oh-so-badly written; Cassidy obviously was by this time becoming a caricturature of his off-screen persona, much like John Barrymore many years before.
I watch this over and over, and every time I watch it, I find a different scene that I missed before.
Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before.
Please, Please, Please never F****ck up a good story again, Dutch filmmakers.....  Now they are working on making a movie of "Brief aan de Koning" (Letter to the King) - another great book about a boy who got a mission, just on the evening before he would be knighted....
Overall, the film works well enough to strongly recommend it, especially to Lemon fans, fans of comedies of this era, and fans of "hell handbasket" films, even if you didn't know you were one before you read this review.
Anyway, its just a Barbie version of the "Prince and the Pauper" that has been done so many times before.
Jenke is executed but before he dies he says he will be back.
Some nice  visual touches, and attractive British country locations buoy this  one up a bit, but not before the whole thing sinks under its own  confused weight by the last reel.
But alas, he is (spoiler) snuffed out before his time.
The fact that Zentropa would have their name associated with this amazes me - even if they have produced porn before it was of a much higher standard... Because...
There is an excellent reason that you've never heard of this movie before.
The villagers take as much as they can before they rise up and fight their occupiers.
The ''actors/actresses'' have nothing more than a few lines before the killing starts.
You can't even memorize the names before the ''action'' starts.
I never left the theater before a movie had ended.
I have never been so disappointed in a movie character before.
Though the material is far from original, I never felt as if I needed to scream out "I've seen it ALL before!!!".
We are producing them like never before.
He was supposed (debatedly) to have been a 5th or 6th century Ancient Briton, some say with Roman ancestry, and to have lived long before the Norman Conquest was even thought of.
but not before having to endure one of the most tepid, uninspired ensemble deathbed scenes 'performed' by name-brand actors I've ever seen.
Instead, it's a weak re-make of The Phantom of the Opera, without the Phantom, which was released the year before.
The Phantom of the Opera the year before also starred Susannah Foster.
Somehow Bey gets the idea to help his fiancÃ©e get over her inability to sing can be cured by arranging a command performance before the very young king.
But on the night before the marriage she vanished, and he - broken hearted (apparently) - has returned every night ever since as though waiting for her.
Audrey Hepburn, two years before her breakthrough in Hollywood, received her most substantial acting role up to this time playing the dancing darling; she's charming and poised, but the part doesn't offer much beyond showcasing her youthful eagerness.
The story also gets an extra element of mystery through Virna Nightbourne; a clairvoyant who draws the crimes before they happen.
Obviously the idea of someone being able to draw crimes before they happen is more than a little bit preposterous, but to be honest I could live with that if the resulting film was entertaining.
The ending sequence is awful - the Countess is being driven through a wooded road at night, urging the other survivor from the hotel to drive faster, faster - so they'll get to their destination before daylight, while distracting them with love chat and fondling.
It also concludes with the threat of a sequel, to which I can only respond with the Wilheim Scream our hunk unleashes just before the end.
You can imagine the lead actress saying before she goes back to her day-job as a stripper.
This movies is funny and enjoyable with a plot like I have never heard of before!
So shallow and brief is the treatment of each treasure here that if you blink, you will miss one or two -- but, sadly, you will not escape the whittering of the truly appalling Dan Cruikshank whose confidence in his own narrow and banal "Little England" aesthetic judgements is such that he needs no actual expertise in casting his pearls before us.
It isn't really like any other movie that I've seen before, so It's a bit difficult to describe.
I thought it was all very contrived and elements of the movie are a blend of others done before all meant to push forward a modern tolerant society alternative lifestyle movement.
The costumes and roles we saw before in the episodic Dae Jang Geum series - (did they re-use the sets and clothes??
A group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned, and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople.
It has been said that there are no original ideas and with the many thousands of movies that are available in stores, the finger of god would have to be pointing directly at you if you expect to see something you've never seen before.
What I haven't seen before is a film that so shamelessly yet unpretentiously zings the industry as a whole, the average movie viewer, and itself, and all in good fun.
So check it out, because I guarantee you, you have not seen THIS before.
Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must coerce the remaining inhabitants of Northfork to leave before a dam opens up and floods the town.
An extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child.
Since none of us had admittedly heard of it before, we decided to watch and give it a chance.
I had a chance to see this picture way before it's release date many times.
I also asked people who had also left before it was over what they thought, and they agreed with me.
Setting: It was said before, the was not Miami Vice, this was "-anywhere- Vice" The movie could have been set in LA, NYC or heck, Cairo!
I'm no prude but all this took place well before the 9pm watershed .
I have met these people before in another life.
My first real acquaintance with the truth came with Gerald Posner's book "Case Closed," which debunks conspiracy lore with modern science and far more accurate and detailed information than was ever available before.
I read the reviews before buying it and decided to get it anyway because it's Jim Carrey.
I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles).
happen to read this, let me ask you: did you clear this with the "RoboCop" people before making it?
But my favourite part is where the android cop takes on a trio of tough men, the first being a drunk who gets swept aside easily, the second being a karate expert who is outmatched by the robot, before leading to a real tough man being walked on by the robot.
This was back in the days when you could rent videos from newsagents, before laws were introduced to stop the assistants from recommending films.
While I was expecting horrific hallucinations or (unintentionally hilarious) hyperbolic reactions resulting from the intake of drugs, all one got is an excess of dull talk which quickly exasperated this viewer long before the film's brief 57 minutes were up!
But his father is dying and wants him to sing for him before he dies and (wouldn't you know it?)
His partner, John Dark, realizes the situation is out-of-hand and tries to stop Shade before he fully transforms into a monster.
The night before renting "bitch" I had a lively discussion with friends and colleagues about the number of fun and interesting movies that have come out of this great city, including "Night of the Living Dead (1968)" "Robocop (1987)", "Gung Ho (1986)" and of course "Striking Distance (1993)".
Oh my dear god, please people, before slating any other film please watch this one first, who in their right mind eats a banana in the bath and then tries to feed some of it to their dog??????
For such a noble thing Bette's been around the track quite a bit and gets a few more turns before the film ends.
I certainly wasn't expecting a really upbeat film, and have been impressed by dark action flicks before, but it all gets so repetitive here, it just keeps going and going, which gets pretty tiresome, maybe even depressing!
I've seen low-budget horror movies before and they provide that so bad it's funny feel to them and this was no exception.
Case in point is when Alice, after blasting away some zombies, spins her two guns, a la John Wayne, before putting them back in the holsters.
The plot of Resident Evil: Apocalypse is, perhaps, the single worst piece of writing recently played out before the eyes of unfortunate movie fans.
Why does Alice come crashing into a church through a stained-glass window, on a motorcycle, "armed to the teeth" with weaponry, to rescue the protagonists with perfect timing, despite the fact that she has never met them before and was, in the previous scene, walking around in the street with only a shotgun and no motorcycle at all?
To cap off all the "excitement", the movie reaches its climax a full fifteen minutes before the end of the film!
Soon after taking the case, Church is on hand to see a man named Zarini acquitted, only to fall dead before he can leave the courtroom.
Fortunately I read the comments on here before viewing this movie and was therefore able to enjoy it purely as the giggle-fest that it is.
That piece is just unbelievably funny, but you have to see it before you know how funny it is.
The first time i saw this movie was on cinemax 2 days before halloween.
This remake of the movie is so far away from the book I agree with another commenter that Chriton should have sued before he died for Trademark infringement on the title.
before slipping into the liquid....  2.
To boldly go where no man has gone before" oral sex preview; wooden actress and lead scientist; reporter dude and pothead desert chick; even the "don't ask, don't tell" gay reference about not having a date.... come ON!
After watching it, I tried to remember if I had ever heard anything about it before.
if you can cast VERY hot women, put them in situations mentioned before, you can be on the air for 8 years, and have an actual core fan base who collectively have the intellectual level of a turnip.
It is all stuff we've heard before and really offered me no new insight into the problem that has been made public before.
But instead it is a long, drawn out affair that repeatedly bashes you over the head with the same themes and stories we've all heard before.
And for someone that's actually made films before, AND GOT FUNDING FOR MORE, this is simply shocking.
Hmmm, let's see...a mysterious creature that can regenerate, has wings, and is seriously intelligent enough to mess with it's victims minds before killing them...?
Spidey giving up his spideyness has been done before and better in Superman II when he gave up his powers for Lois.
There isn't anything here that you haven't seen in some other action movie before.
Also, don`t the directors know that Latin was removed from school curriculum twenty years before the remake was set.
Before Jason Voorhes, before Freddy Kreuger, or even the Candyman, there's The Tall Man(Angus Scrimm), a hauntingly tower of terror who uses a the deadliest arsenals of all: The Flying Silver Spheres!
While Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's careers have taken off quite grandly, fate has dealt him the unlucky hand and he gets to co star in drivel like this, where he first speaks with a weird American trucker accent before being magically transformed into a more smoothly spoken evil alien type guy.
This is not a terrible movie, but the viewer has seen it all before.
But before all of these good films, we had Hotel for dogs.
lastly, and probably the best of the SFX moments, is when one of the main characters starts twisting about and pukes up the evil ooze before exploding.
The movie "The Blob" (Steve McQueen) did a better job and that came out many years before this.
Using every trick in the book that could be created before the benefits of CGI, director Don Coscarelli blends horror, sci-fi, comedy, fantasy and everything in between to keep the audience laughing and screaming, sometimes all at once.
What's more surprising is a much younger Stephen Dorff in the supporting role, a 'before he was famous' moment before he was the villain in the Blade films.
I only managed to see Eric Roberts for about five minutes before he had that fatal cup of coffee, but I liked him in their "final confrontation" scene.
Most of us are aware that Stallone has done porn before, so perhaps he was yearning for a return to his roots.
The character played by Rod Stieger is a little too stereotypical and his pronunciation of the word 'you' like 'jew' can only be taken seriously for so long before a serious scene involving intense dialogue is broken up by a smirk here and there.
The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room, one guy fell down before the other was also laughable.
Immensely strong and ghoulish as he turns corpses into ugly little dwarfs, before shipping them out as intergalactic slaves!
Walker tosses the staff into the air, but the TMNT manage to catch it before it hits the ground and breaks!
Well after the amazing first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and the second not quite amazing but still good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2:The secret of the Ooze the turtles return to the big screen for the unlucky third time where in the first 2 films they had a great opening sequence like in the first we had never seen the turtles on the big screen and really alive before so they kept that suspense going for about a awesome 10 Min's we finally see them all together right after there about to jump at the main titles and in the second one the turtles all jump up and the main title goes right there it was pure awesome and everyone couldn't wait for them to come up.....but in the third there is no thought no imagination its just the turtles dancing witch couldn't even succeed at being funny and brings me to splinter witch if you think splinter was an undeveloped character in the second...wait until you see him in the third splinter is supposed to be a main character that teaches the turtles but in this movie he just stands in his under ground house and at least the first two films he looks really cool but in this film he looked like a puppet behind a wall and only appeared in a few scenes witch was pointless so lets get to the plot April buys a some sort of time warp thing and warps the turtles in time and this movie would have been good story and have something that fans wanted such as shredders return and the debut a krang if thats what you are hoping to get......your wrong...instead you get 2 weird stupid undeveloped characters that nobody cared for why?
The third outing for out heroes in a half-shell (if you don't know about them by now then start at the beginning before even attempting to endure this) provides us with some time travel shenanigans as the quartet find themselves being transported to ancient Japan to fight some angry folk and rescue April O'Neil (played once again by Paige Turco).
By the way, don't the turtles seem more plastic now than ever before?
Given that the first film was dedicated to Jim because it was one of the last things he worked on before he died, this is quite the sad come-down.
(in fact, I had a dream where I was in Hell and I encountered a priest that had been shrunk and dissected by a demon and this was before I saw Phantasm) I know I would be pretty hysterical if The Tall Man was stalking me.
Templer convinces American government to send a nuclear weapon and blows the alien force up before the invasion of Earth.
If you ever thought endless scenes of soft-core sex set to lazy music could ever lull you to sleep more than a triple dose of Lunesta, you just pick up this DVD, buddy, and welcome to dreamland before you get halfway through the mercifully short running time.
There are some items of interest to movie buffs today, such as the casting of two of the Three Stooges, Shemp Howard and Joe Besser, in secondary roles; this was seven years before Besser replaced Shemp as the 'third Stooge.'
They made one more independent film in 1956, 'Dance With Me, Henry', before calling it quits for good.
The ATB system still functioned exactly as it did before, with none of the refinements you would expect to see in a game on a more powerful system.
It made people who had never even played video games before take notice.
That bit has been done beforeÂ but only like a million times before, and sometimes it's a lake or pond instead of a swimming pool, and I've seen it done with a puddle of mud and a bath tub too, but I digress.
Certainly its nothing you haven't seen before but its sense of seriousness makes it worth your time in front of the TV screen.
not the best match, but in the top 3 of the night 8/10   My Overall Grade:C-  DVD Extras: 11 Summerslam Promos; Behind the scenes of said promos; 3 clips from the Sunday Night Heat before the PPV; Evolution reacting to Orton's Victory; Eddie Guerrero consoling Benoit after his match; The Diva contestants being interviewed; and Trailers for the Gamecube game "Day of Reckoning", "Cheating Death, Stealing Life: the Eddie Guerrero Story", & "Vengence 2004"
I sometimes like to watch a "classic" that I have never seen before.
We're drowned, beat up, dogs on our tail - but hey, lets act cool right now and make it a point to have a puff or two before we say some really deep lines to each other.
Would pause at odd times and I had to wonder if I had ever met anyone so lethargic before.
I've had the chance to see this movie yesterday in Paris before I leave.
In fact, I'd guessed every single joke before I'd even seen the film - that's how predictable they are.
Kenneth Williams can only flare his enormous nostrils so much before you want to stuff them with carrots.
Immediately, you get the feeling you've been here before.
I would recommend other Carry On films before this, many of them.
Repeatedly, the person whose name is unexpectedly about to be called next happens to pipe up with some exaggerated utterance, on cue, right before being named.
Blore's character has always been well-defined and well-acted before.
Rent Animal House instead, even if you've seen it 20 times before, it's better than this!
So, no smoking in the Aidensfield Arms, no more roll-ups for Alf in the police station - over 40 years before the ban came into being!!
Seconds turn to minutes then before long a couple of hours are gone and you'll start thinking that you should have spent the time fixing the dishwasher or washing the dog.
Like everyone that has reviewed this film before me, I am going to sing it's praises, however, unlike those before me, I'm not quite sure why.
To a small degree it's creepy in the way it intends: It does seem as if Harper Lee may have seen this before writing her lovely "To Kill A Mockingbird," also about children (here just one child) wrongly suspicious of an odd neighbor.
OK, before I start on the bad, let me talk about the good.
In fact, Larsen is the only one who looks like he has acted before.
The actors, hahahahahaha...I'm sorry, thats mean, I mean the amateurs that had roles in this movie obviously haven't been in or considered acting school before accepting parts.
Let me just re-iterate something before I end the review: You're watching a movie about people that come back from the bottom of the lake every 13 years and drag more people down with them.
I had no idea who Jay Woelfel was before this but looking at his filmography he seems like a regular B-horror movie maker, who just isn't the most talented or visionary person around, no matter how hard he ever tries.
She goes to the cabin by the lake to get rid of her guilt, not before picking up a hitchhiker that she'll later screw (her parents would be proud) A mixture of bad and TERRIBLE acting, as well as some crappy split screen.
It's quite clear throughout this movie that nobody in it has ever acted before....except for possibly bit roles in Anal Paprika 3: Menage-a-Death (it's a real movie).
I wasted $6.50 at Blockbuster with this one, and I've done the same thing countless times before out of desperation and a faint hope than someday, somewhere, someone will make a horror movie we've all been waiting for.
The most exciting thing about this movie is the alligator boy and after that and before that, the movie is a completely boring and a major waste of time.
Inexplicable and pointless flashbacks of the two main characters as kids (yeah, we get it, they are buddies) are one problem, but the real weakness is the constant ripoff of Tarantino - an annoying drug dealer who engages in a monologue that exists only to waste the viewer's time, thugs who chase the "hero" for screwing a gangster's wife, we've all variations of this before.
I'm confronted with an absolutely extraordinary story, but then, it stops before my eyes before ending!
I play about half an hour a night before I get bored.
It seems that they have ported to PC just to rake in the profits, no thought to current day graphics,Try it out first before you spend your money.
Seems to me Fonda had played too many heroes before this and tried something different without thinking if it made any sense.
(That Oates would be killed was predictable as early as an hour before.)
Never before have I been so disappointed in a film from this era.
Having taped this movie from AMC's Third Annual Film Preservation Festival when the subject was comedy, I was very anxious to see the film debut of The Three Stooges with Ted Healy as their original leader and Shemp Howard in the original group before quitting, allowing younger brother Curly to take his place.
It's been done a thousand times before (and better).
it's been done a thousand times before (and better).
A dark and terrible secret lurks on the 13th floor of a plush city office block,where a supernatural curse has brought disaster to anyone who rents it.A mysterious 'presence' has driven business to ruin,made office machinery break down and created a deadly lifeforce of its own in the electrical system.The tortured soul of an innocent boy who was cruelly murdered many years before is lying in wait for the moment of revenge.
An evil force called Zatteen fertilizes many women from Earth with his seed before being eliminated, and their children inherit and perpetuate his power.
An inherent flaw then, before we even begin.
i had to come back to it and watch it from the beginning several times before i could stop falling asleep.
And even that was a clichÃ© quote ("black girls don't have enough good black men anymore") that I've heard many times before on TV and movies.
basically i don't like this film, nothing worse than seeing a film where it's pretty much already been done before and they just fiddled with the plot a tad to bring it into a modern day context.
also it'd be unlikely for Sarah to be out doing club dancing before an audition for fear of getting hurt or pulling something.
I couldn't tell if anyone was actually interested in what was happening, or if the amount of beer drinking that occurred before the dubbing was finally taking effect.
Fluorescent lights flicker on and off to add a little extra ambiance (or in my case, to irritate me even further), none of the supernatural events that occur are ever adequately explained, gimmicky editing and post production trickery makes everything extremely hard to follow, and the whole thing finishes as confusingly as it began, with a child once again whispering some nonsense that might possibly have made some sense had I not given up caring long before.
Public health, she says, sometimes has to be put before archaeology.
There is a romantic moment at the very end of the film that is spectacularly out of place and dissolves immediately any character development that might have come before, and like much of the rest of the movie, it ends with a small child whispering some utter nonsense to us.
And most telling of all, if you appreciate a filmmaker who shows you a clock stuck on 11:59 (p.m.) every ten minutes to remind you that nothing you're watching is REALLY happening, and has the audacity to think he can throw in 30 seconds of quick-cuts action just before closing credits to explain what ACTUALLY went on according to a script which must have had more scribbled afterthoughts than typed original entries, then SICK HOUSE probably is up your dark alley.
Can't a producer realise that making an interesting and vaguely original film will likely make more money through positive word of mouth than a bland, boring, seen it all before piece of cable movie sh!t like Sick House.
You've seen every single element of this movie before.
She nearly feel asleep before the "climax", which occurred with about 30 seconds left in the movie.
And she would have no idea how to operate the computer seeing as she's never seen it before and Gus designed it to his specifications.
As a stand-alone movie, not connected to the show, it still stinks, but man...it kills Thomas in a way I've never seen before.
A virus is killing young girls from 15 to seventeen, right before they die they go through a Near Death Happiness or NDH, if you will then die.
The gore will keep your attention for maybe 10 minutes at the most before you keep checking your watch wondering when this mis-fire will finally end.
He'd done it one hundred times before and he didn't think anything was unusual when the driver struck up conversation.
The stranger was a good listener too and it only seemed minutes before they pulled up in front of jimmy's house.
I loved Sakamoto's stunt coordination of his other movie "Drive" which featured some of the best martial arts choreography way before "Matrix."
It is amazing that it took so long before they were adapted to another medium and merchandised.
This is one of those films that I remember being in the can for years before anything happening w/it.
I can't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released & only on DVD at that.
If you ever see it on TV, turn it off immediately before you want to kill yourself.
I would like to congratulate the producer on remembering the theme of these movies which is cheerleading...there are 4 main problems about this movie 1.your movie had NO plot line, 2.how can losers win a cheerleading competition who have never cheered before 3.the writing suck and there was nothing remotely funny about this movie 4. i want my money back for renting this poor excuse for a movie.Your writers are too lazy so they jack other ideas off of movies.
*Why did the guy playing the mascot beat box to the costume head before going out onstage?
Personally, I wish I had a time travelling device simply so I could travel back in time 2 hours, and smash the DVD player before my girlfriend subjected me to this tripe.
I have to say, before seeing this movie, I was excited that there was a "teen" movie that wasn't about high school coming out.
As far as I've seen, Diesel 10 was never really evil before now (or afterwards, I'm not to sharp on the whole Thomas Chronology).
Even though years before I was terrified!!!!
I watched this film before i read the movie or had seen Kubrick's film.
I wonder how far they got into shooting before Alec realized what a major piece of crap he was involved in.
After the awful Foreigner & Out for a Kill I had this movie written-off before I'd watched it, thankfully it turned out to be much better then recent efforts.
Not only that, what was the deal with all the mystical crap introduced 10 minutes before the end of the movie, complete with with a Thai Mako impersonator who had taken too much PCP ??
The only thing I hated was the movie was more about homophobia and gay bashing.Not that I support Nazi skinheads but I don't understand why they were so threatened by gays instead of the groups of black and Asian gangs in the neighborhood.There was an interesting remark made in the DVD extra features that mentions that there is more violence within their own ranks then there is violence towards others.I loved the scene in the movie when a huge group of gay men got together and bashed the skinheads back.I have never seen that before in a movie and they deserved the beating.It was nice to see a bit of payback from the gay community.Ironically the most vicious gay hating skinhead David Lee played by David Lee Willson has come out as a gay man in real life.I read a really cool article about this actor and how hard it was for him to play such an evil hateful role.
However, before Miss Marple can present the solution to the interested parties and Craddock can make an arrest, the killer among the film crew strikes again...
She's a gorgeous girl who looks like a fashion model wearing the designer clothing she struts around in most of the movie, but she looked stunning even before that "makeover" and the suggested message was that the world of fashion has ridiculous, unrealistic standards.
Pernell Roberts, long before he discovered his TV niche as Trapper John, stars here as an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, pompous head of security for the San Francisco airport.
Watching Pernell Roberts (the airport administrator), Clu Gulager (the airport security chief) and Van Johnson (a newspaper columnist who happens to be in the airport at the time) try to assemble the clues, figure out what's happening, and scramble to thwart the bad guys before the bad guys can 'get away with it'...is mildly diverting in the same way that the 'caper plots' from "Hawaii Five-O" used to be.
It's a film of big ideas, in particular about the folly of America's obsession with guns; presumably it's this liberal agenda that enticed an astonishing cast, each member of which is as bad here as they've ever been before (Jeff Daniels plays an arrogant businessman who gets away with murder; Joan Allen is the wife who leaves him to work for loopy billionaire Gary Sinise; they and four or five others get intertwined in a web of violence).
Even before that, they ride for what seems like kms on their bikes, past numerous adults, not once asking for help - and has anyone there heard of 911??
I had read before viewing that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress Love.
Robert Englund is also featured here, a few years before taking on his most famous role, that of Freddy Krueger in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies.
The "actors" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since.
There should be some sort of test you should have to pass first before being given a budget, any budget, to do something like this.
The film follows a chronicle that we all have heard of before, except this time, Chabrol thinks he can make magic out of Huppert.
I wouldn't doubt that most of the movies on AMC was filmed before he fell to earth.
...okay, so it was a crisp, foggy, rainy, windy San Francisco Sunday morning....one of those mornings where you awoke, looked outa the window and immediately knew you would deservedly luxuriate in bed after a loooooooong week....this was the perfect time to catch up on some old movies I had been meaning to watch/may have missed....I had passed by Bram Stoker's The Mummy on guide listings, each time wondering, "why haven't I heard of this before?"
At almost 100 minutes Legend of the Mummy is far too long & if it doesn't put you to sleep you will lose interest well before the painfully obvious twist ending.
This is one of those films that you need a bucket and a gun before you watch.
Al from _Home Improvement_ provided a little comic relief, but there was nothing at all in this flick which so much as made me want to stop it before going for a snack.
Tales from the Darkside: Ring Around the Redhead starts as convicted murderer Billy Malone (John Heard) is about to be led to the electric chair, before he is though a journalist named Adele (Caris Corfman) is allowed to interview him.
You've seen this movie before I promise you.
Usually I give shows/movies more time before judging it.
True it did not contain any of the usual elements of gore & horror that we've seen before but how can that be an endorsement for boredom.
Anyone who has ever seen a horror flick before in his life must have secretly been praying at the beginning of the movie that the corpse in the snow was not going to be alive again at the end.
Mind you, as flashbacks later reveal, the evil Darth Voltan (okay, he's not really called Darth) has already killed the love of Hawk's life, something which almost shocks one-time Felix Leiter (in The Living Daylights) John Terry into changing his expression, before moving on to underline what a bad egg he is by kidnapping guest star Annette Crosbie's Mother Superior, prompting Hawk into action.
Most of the film is played in medium shot to cut down on the number of actors required and to hide the fact the set isn't that big Â or perhaps just out of the fear that if they move the camera too far back, the actors will take the opportunity to run away before they have to deliver lines like "My son Drogo speaks true!"
There are a few loud dance tunes before things take a turn for the worse.
There are even some moments that come close to being tense/entertaining before failing and reverting back to the standard, boring on screen action you have to endure with this group of unlikeable characters you really don't give a toss about.
It's nearly half an hour before anything remotely happens, which wouldn't be so bad if we were getting to know the characters, some back story etc, but nothing.
Put them on a yacht, and throw in a script that seems to have been written minutes before.
The film's twists are broadly apparent a full ten minutes before they occur on screen, which makes for an experience that isn't only boring, but also deeply and repeatedly annoying.
And she was so good in so many other movies, what a shame...  What does make the movie worthwhile are the performances of a nasty Tess Harper and, before all, a wonderful Sissy Spacek.
cant believe i'm even taking time to write how excruciatingly awful unfunny boring clichÃ©d this unspeakable thing was, the movie studio allowing him to make it must have been because they wanted to see him  as the assistant manager at a taco bell not writing producing movies - that is the only possible explanation  with something this bad one must not have many friends to clue you in before it too late 'hey this is bad bad bad' 7th graders on you tube have better writing skills.
Just before the end of the war, they cover a sapper disassembling a bomb and Sara is informed that her boss and fiancÃ© Carter Reynolds (Barry Sullivan) is coming to London to meet her.
Six weeks later, Carter buys a ship trip to her from Plymouth to New York; however, Sara decides to visit St. Giles by train before returning to her country.
Never before have I seen such an annoying bunch of clods in a TV show before as are on this show Punched Up but I guess I should not be surprised considering the other TV shows that have been produced by this 'how-can-they-still-be-this-incompetent?'
I suggest your kids should be at least twelve before you watch this with them.
Tivo put three of these episodes on my box before I watched any of them.
Hopefully we will see him show us what he is capable of before his streak of commercial duds sinks him into oblivion.
Its funny that movies coming out of Hollywood don't take the time to get familiar with standard military practices before making a movie taking place within the miliary.
In a sad coincidence, Lee, who plays a rival boxer, had an untimely death of a heart attack in May 1952, two weeks before Garfield died young of a heart attack.
It had already been done many, many times before, and much better (A Few Good Men by Reiner comes to mind).
Unfortunately, only twelve people show up for dinner and the host dies before he can reveal the heir's identity.
Also, how in the world can two skiers from 'hills' in Michigan be pro skiers on terrain they have never skied before arriving to try out to be ski instructors.
It shows nothing that we didn't know or guess before.
I haven't bothered to read all of the other comments but I'm sure it must have been stated before -- this is a completely mediocre comedy that is simply yet another attempt by Hollywood to ride on the coattails of much better films like "Rushmore" and "Napoleon Dynamite."
The direction in the two important fights, first with the fabulous African-American actor and former pugilist, CANADA LEE and then the final fight, were so well wrought, filmed and edited that it utterly destroys any movie made before or after which dealt with boxing.
I had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch, but I thought it was important to see just what was going on in Iraq before the US dismantled Saddam Hussein's regime.
Well I don't know how to put it exactly, I had a very high expectation on this movie before it came out, mostly because all those excellent ones made by Chen Kaige before.
as concerned as me,i take this movie Mo Gik as nothing,or just a steamed bread.one world,one steamed bread,just like the 2008 Olympic saying.Kai-Ge Chen is really not god,but he took him as,and even had been cheated by others(yes,the media and audience took him as god before,but it's more like a sneer,make him can't speak out human's word.
If you're looking for a really misbegotten enterprise, you need to check out Chen Keige's The Promise, possibly the only Asian film that can make you feel sorry for Harvey Weinstein, who pre-brought the film before realising that he'd made a BIG mistake on seeing the end result.
Why didn't they offer them before?
Not being able to sleep before the big champion fight Charlie Davis, John Garfield, drives down to his old neighborhood where he finds out that his mother, girlfriend and all of the people who knew him there don't want anything to do with him.
Back in his dressing room before the fight Charlie's reminded by the matchmaker Roberts, Lloyd Gough,that the fight with his opponent Marlow is to go the distance and the decision will be against him.
Charlie, trying to calm down his nerves before the fight, lays down to get some sleep and slowly his past comes back to haunt him in a dream.
The fact that it took two years before the producers inflicted it on the movie-going public should say volumes.
It's not long before they are attacked by a group of wasps, but they're not just any wasps - they're giant aggressive wasps!
It's not long before they put two and two together and realise that something funny is going on - shortly before they meet the most dangerous creature on the island, the rats...
They can't swim OK, and we're not just saying that because we've already filmed the ending before someone pointed out that they can swim.
Even though it is an indie film it is very below the standards of anything I've ever seen before.
I had seen every really funny line and surprise cameo before I ever even walked in the theater.
Albert Brooks should have let life imitate art and hired himself a muse before deciding to torture us with this crap.
I have never shut down a movie this quick before in my life (5 minutes).
Without giving too much away, this subplot comes to an apparently happy ending, and the movie concludes on a high note, with The Flaming Lips on stage playing before their enthralled fans, on the verge of another artistic triumph.
Nolan had played a PI in some Michael Shayne Bs before the noir cycle began so he knew the mannerisms and Philip Marlowe a tarnished knight with principles would've been a perfect fit.
The only thing good about it was the original idea of one serial killer stalking and competing with another, which I've never heard of before.
Of course they succeed in stopping the missile, just 1 second before it would be launched.
I`ve also got to point out that having the terrorist attack take place before the title sequence somehow feels wrong .
The title sequence should have been shown before the terrorist raid .
As I said before, the acting is poor, very poor.
But anyway, Leigh Lewis does a good job in her role of the women anchorperson who sees the light after losing her grandmother with the believers going back to heaven during the worldwide disappearance of souls that happens right before nuclear bombs are supposed to explode in all areas of the world.
Director-coscriptor Corbiau has Stefano Dionisi as Ferinneli forever falling down and collapsing both on and offstage for no apparent reason, and using the old device of having him hesitate to sing on cue before a full house to superficially create suspense and anxiety.
Trevor Howard plays the old chief ready to move on to the next life, but the Great Creator seems to have other plans for him before that event takes place.
And not only did I walk out after 50 minutes, but it was my wife (a "chick-flick" aficionado) who suggested we get out of the theater before she became physically ill from this turkey grande.
Tortilla soup has the right idea, mainly because it was done once before and more successfully for that matter.
I watched this recently on DVD and nodded off before the end.
For the record, THE DISAPPEARANCE proved to be Racette's penultimate film before retiring to raise her three children with Sutherland.
Mary pleading with the king to spare Anne and the King's last minute note warning Mary not to do so again just before Anne was executed).
Queen Katherine is left on the sidelines for most of the movie (except for her magnificent display of queenly outrage before the court when her marriage is called into question).
Eddie Redmayne does very well, which I am glad to see, as he never went to drama school and defied parental advice to be a banker, so he pulled it off before his father's three years of support was up, well done Eddie.
Why did they bother to tack on SOME accurate historical outcomes (in written sentence form) of the characters at the end, just before the credits rolled?
Can't let this one go: Henry raping Anne before she surrendered to him.
Speaking of being sent to the Tower, in real life Anne conducted herself with great dignity and restraint before and at her execution, likely she was trying to protect her daughter Elizabeth and better secure her daughter's future relationship with Henry.
Ah the good old days  NB : That last line was sarcasm before anyone complains
Actually the one good thing about this film is the copious shots of New York in the late 1980's which record the city before urban renewal changed everything for the better.
The plot here's been done a gazillion times before for the drive-in trade.
If you've seen these teen drive-in dramas before you know pretty much how it will all end.
I think they played four songs before they were rushed off so the Cure could take forever to come on.
He is confined to a mental institution (bad parody of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" ensue) before catching up with his rock-star comrades in NYC.
Lots of television comedians have made chumps of themselves making the transition to the big screen; the year before this came out, Kenny Everett starred in the vile 'Bloodbath At The House Of Death' and more recently, Horne and Corden's 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' failed to set the world on fire.
I was able to only stomach about half an hour of this film before common sense got the best of me and made me press the "Stop" button.
The plot is paper-thin, the action ends before it starts, and the humor is as bland as reheated oatmeal.
I have seen this movie before.
I have seen this movie before.
I have seen this movie before.
My friend saw this a few months before I did, and warned me that it wasn't very good.
It would help if we saw she doing her job before being hired in to help Tripp.
One of strangest opening sequences I can recall sees Arnie chasing what appears to be a cop on a motorbike before setting him alight.
To the viewers relief we discover that this near homicide was committed by Sheriff Arnie before the biker was indeed revealed as an impostor (phew).
The confusing part is how Arnie ends up in the fire fights he finds himself in and why seeing as he appears to be virtually invincible does he have to infiltrate the mob's ranks at all (the figures involved are all seemingly publicly known) before killing them.
Arnold plays Mark Kaminsky, a small-town sheriff who used to be in the FBI, before he was forced to resign because he brutally beat a man who had raped a small child.
As I mentioned before, I liked "Kill Bill vol 2" better.
Many have stated this before, but pray tell me, in case you wake up on your hospital bed after years of coma, how on Earth are you meant to grasp the whole situation immediately.
Jill Clayburgh masterfully plays another savvy, divorced woman attempting to date again, and though some viewers may say she has mined this territory before, Clayburgh absolutely nails the love/hate relationship fifty-somethings have with getting back into the swing of things (sometimes it's much more enticing to just sit home and mope).
The movie opens with some peculiar choreographed stuff that looks like a tribute to the moon landing at the Oscars, and proceeds before long to an absurdly jocular Douglas-Fawcett shower scene.
Hey, don't you think you ought to fasten your cargo down with straps or something before you zoom off and become weightless?
Long before the space station goes into shadow lock, "Saturn 3" is in trouble.
If God were truly merciful, he would have destroyed all the copies of this movie before it made the theaters, and long before cable.
Some other things as well before I forget: - Bubbleshock (SJA) = Slurm (Futurama) - Mrs Wormwood (yeah that was also Matilda's mum but no matter) - The map of the Milky Way; according to Wikipedia its from Star Trek: TNG.
They enter a deserted town, hit the grocery, and load up on food before the zombies appear.
About 13 minutes before "The Zombie Diaries" concludes, the narrative leaps back to the news crew as they meet Goke and Manny.
Instead, it poses for it and our heroes clear out of the room before it can inflict itself on them.
Not that it saves this film though, it's a great idea which, contrary to popular belief, didn't rip-off Diary of the Dead as it was made before it.
How many times did Thomas Edison screw up his whole light bulb thing before it actually worked?
As I've said before I'm a cheapskate and I'll pretty much watch anything I rent but even I couldn't endure this piece of junk.I've seen some terrible zombie films in my years of watching horror films and this was one of the worst of the bunch.
I hope that noted set designer William Cameron Menzies who occasionally did direct such classics as Things To Come, had Howard Hughes's check already clearing the bank before embarking on The Whip Hand.
Of course Reid's reporter's instincts are aroused and pretty soon he's like Kevin McCarthy trying to get of the area before the Pod People get him.
I'll admit that I'm not really a fan of the zombie genre, but I have watched a few of them, and a lot of them are ten times better than this film, so for a non fan of the genre I would actually go for Romero's dead films before I'd consider seeing this again.
In one scene, a shot from about 20 yards away with a rifle takes about two seconds before the zombies head is (poorly) blown apart.
One of them has been done in almost every zombie movie before and the main difference this time around was the age of the "victim".
But this film was SO bad, all I can say is: keep any and all sharp objects safely out of reach while watching this movie... because trust me, you will definitely want to slash your wrists before its painful 80 minutes are up.
What could have been an interesting premise --a zombie outbreak documented by several camera-toting groups in the English countryside--falls flat on its face before the opening credits have even finished.
What should conjure feelings of isolation in the audience only makes us lose interest before the second act has even arrived.
The forty years of fiscal irresponsibility that began with Lyndon Johnson's final debasement of our currency has reduced the once-mighty dollar to subatomic dimensions; and at the rate the current administration continues to pile up debt, it will not be long before it will take Avogadro's number of the wretched things just to buy a handyman's special, dry-rotted, termite-infested two-bedroom firetrap in the middle of a malarial swamp.
You've seen it all before, but better.
Columbo was a body-building buddy of Schwarzenegger in the before times and it really shows which of them got the acting talent.
The idea that Charles II would expect Rochester to do a 180 and write something wonderful for him, and not even read it or view it before using it for to entertain the visiting French ambassador, well, that's beyond absurd.
Imagine my surprise when scenes I had never seen before began to appear in this DVD version.
And to be fair the whole boring shebang massively improved about 20 minutes before the end.
They are now 27 and 25 and this VHS cassette tape is now my treasured possession...  About 2 months ago, a cable station broadcasted a 1995 version of 'A Little Princess' which I have never seen before, I watched it and thought the content was a little different; therefore, I took out my recorded copy from PBS and wanted to compare the difference.
But then again, please don't have any high expectations before watching the flick.
But Dr. Lambardi takes Andrea even further back Â back to a time before humans existed.
The creature has been around for some time in the movie even before Dr. Erickson showed up.
followed by a large question mark before the final fadeout, virtually begging the question of there being a sequel.
!One actor does a Foster Brooks drunk act years before Brooks.Not nearly as funny either.
As others before me have said, this is the absolute pits, to be used as a sleep aid only.
Fortunately Morris got to appear in The Great White Hope before he died as a farewell performance.
Nothing new here, it's all been done before.
Because, really, we've all seen this type of movie before, except this time someone dies.
It was made in Philly, my hometown, and having Gabriel Byrne plus Tim Roth probably assured some decent acting, but as luck had it, Pam figured out the mistaken diagnosis before the film was 15 minutes old.
It seems that in every shot they are standing in another part of the kitchen) and the acting, as said before, is only so and so.
the two makers were present to answer questions on the film, not after the screening as one would expect but before it saying that they couldn't make it after the film.
The lecture starts by addressing an academic question about slavery (note to those who never heard the question before: Adam Smith addressed it in 1776); and ends with a pathetic attempt at a visual gag.
This time she is given one final assignment (kill yet another victim) before ending her career as a professional assassin.
One scene actually has our heroine strip from head to toe right before she knocks out another bad guy.
But i'm writing this comments just to make sure that tiger user (the one that left a message before me) don't make the mistake again of telling people that NINE QUEENS was a British movie.
Maggie Gyllenhaal, usually so good (Donnie Darko, Mona Lisa Smile) was wooden and her character lacked any credibility; John C. Reilly is atrocious, partly at least due to a pitiful script whose only goal seemed to be to pad out the minutes before the film got to its end; Diego Luna was likable and moderately adept, but couldn't make a difference to the film on his own.
Maureen Lipman as the unaffectionate Miss Minchin was excellent as well-I couldn't have envisioned a better interpretation.Her authoritative nature,absolute conviction in herself, business-like mind, made her the unchallenged captain of her ship; she was a born leader, and relished conducting her crew with the correctitude she deemed right.She would ceremoniously give a speech to "her young ladies", as on Sara's birthday or before the Christmas dispersal of the pupils, and characteristically clear her throat when effectuating what she considered a rather jocular statement intended for the younger girls, as she did before announcing in an incidental manner her message from Father Christmas.A great touch that I thought went just right with her character.
After about 5 minutes I was feeling very confused - I was sure had seen it before but it had only just been released.
Claire Goodman(Elizabeth Barondes)is set up as you female heroine and lover Dillon(John Mese), who works for her pops, Mayor William Goodman(Gary Lockwood, FAR removed from 2001, that's for sure)is the male hero who must stop the killer scarecrow before he is able to become all-powerful.
Could Mel Brooks have seen this before he wrote his screenplay for "The Producers"?
The 2nd thing the film falls down on is that the fighters are told they have 30 hours to kill each other but the timer is activated before they even reach the island so the 30 hour time limit is a load of rubbish anyway.
I could see how the movie was going to end almost before it started.
It's obvious that the organizers went through great pains and spent tons of money on getting all these murderers released (a harmless bit of idiocy, by comparison) so WHY would they want to risk having them all killed before the game even begins!?
Like you have seen them before, but you can't quite place them.
Stone Cold Steve Austin is a credible enough hero and Vinnie Jones is as unhinged a psycho as ever before, but they are undermined by sloppily staged action sequences which will likely give the intended audience a headache or the desperate craving for Dramamine by the time it's over.
Then I realised I'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it.
I have seen some thrillers before and I didn't find myself holding my breath, sitting on the edge of my seat, or anything like that.
And speaking of protagonists, it's Kaji, the main character we're called to identify with, played by samurai icon Tatsuya Nakadai before he was even a supporting actor in Yojimbo, that poses the biggest problem.
I read the reviews of Three Men in a Boat before watching the film and couldn't believe that it is as bad as most reviewers claim.
As intended, Sara comes across Â this mood is set even before the situations are defined Â as a true heroine, when adversity befalls her.
Special effects in this film just are too cheap to effectively convey what the director so desires and he often has to resort to the use of objects to cloud humans before and during their transformation to, I guess, save on what little budget he obviously had.
The Americans need to soften up Pakistan before they can attack the country in the future possibly WITH India, and it is the Americans who have encouraged India to participate in Afghanistan, against Pakistan.
or i guess they were just making fun of themselves and others..  watching the title of the movie i thought that it would be some good ship movie but after watching the movie i was really disappointed..the acting was terrible..the main villain in the movie was so dumb and was thinking as he was the God..means he was so over acting at several points...  i could not understand what they were up to before and during making this movie..there is no story the action scenes are lame and cheap.. they could have done better in many ways like acting and other points..but they have to fail to do so and make a piece of crap...  never ever watch this movie under any circumstances... i wished i could give this movie 0 but that is not possible as the lowest vote is 1
He also knows that they only have two hours of so left before they go down.
Lucas seems to keep finding that his leads are killed off before he can get all the information that he needs.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS:the screenplay is not that much strong,and the suspense is not really here.The first hour is boring and what remains is a spate of clichÃ©s:best/worst example:the killer,leaving "clues" on the dead body ,I've seen it (and read it) so many times that it leaves me amazed :how can a writer ,fifty years or so after Agatha Christie and co,still think of a such hackneyed idea?Giving the killer's identity or the key to the mystery half an hour or more before the ending can be rewarding (such was the case in "vertigo" (1958)),but here ,it destroys any fear:who could reasonably think that the hero -and his girl-could be really in jeopardy after that?Only a whodunit could sustain the interest till the very end.
As soon as I saw the bimbo Jordan Ladd I knew I'd seen it before and didn't like it or her.
We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb.
And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them.
Following her arrest, Janet seems to get loonier by the minute - not that she was the picture of stability before.
In the last years, the Norwegian film industry has produced films with with better style and technique than before.
I think Norwegian film industry should just keep going making horror films, young people learning how to make their money back, learning to appeal and tell stories where we quickly get sympathy the characters, the basic stuff, before start to experiment with story structure, like in DeUsynlige, where they fail, and here is why.
Maybe because the momentum of the story really is in the past, before the story of the film.
Most of the scenes are composed of characters walking through dark locations for about 5 minutes before something actually happens.
  Average sci-fi thriller movie back in 1973.But today due to numerous improvements on the ideas presented here,this movie is only likely to be enjoyed by the most avid sci-fi movie completist.The special effects here was ripped off by numerous 1970's sci-fi TV series like those countless Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman shows.If one has seen those TV shows before seeing this movie,nothing comes out new or fresh.Come to think of it,the Six Million Dollar Man pilot episodes came out before this movie!So actually,the special effects here were not too original after all.Also,they were not content with the Six Million Dollar Man rip off,they even stole the actor who plays Dr.Rudy Wells in said TV show!No sirree.They can't pull a fast one on a guy like me who has seen a lot of movies and TV shows so I am NOT IMPRESSED at all and do not buy into the hype.So now what have we got?Story?The story looks to me like a reject script from a 1960's Twilight Zone episode.The story was too full of plot holes it's not funny.Yes indeed.
We tend to forget about him entirely when he's not directly before our eyes.
Instead of taking a fresh look at the run up to the battle, he uses every old clichÃ© you've seen before in the lips of every old stereotype you've seen before.
Please don't wake me up before you go go, but just let me sleep through the whole movie.
The fights and reconciliations, including the reuniting of a divorced couple at a classy resort, are very reminiscent of Coward's "Private Lives" which had been filmed with disastrous results the year before.
(8) Chicago Stadium, 1984 - The film tries to get across the point that home attendance was very low for the Bulls before Jordan's arrival.
(20) Post 1993 Championship - In the film, James Jordan sits in the arena where the final game of the 1993 NBA Finals was played (America West Arena; Phoenix, AZ) and talks with a character who is supposed to be a long time Chicago Stadium employee (played by Lou Rawls); their conversation seems to indicate that the two are at Chicago Stadium in Chicago, IL; Lou Rawls' character says that he's been working "this place" for a lot of years and before Michael Jordan arrived, you could shoot a cannon through "this place" and nobody would even hear it.
This is one of those cheesy, before it's time, yarns that could've waited a few years until it was picked up by a director with the expertise and resources to sign believable and talented actors and to treat the story with the reverence and dignity that it will deserve in time.
Within the first forty-five minutes, Bridgette Wilson is already gone and there's nothing left but Famke Janssen, who does all she can as Geoffrey Rush's psychotic wife before she herself too, dies, and Ali Larter, who deserves so much better than this movie and can be seen in a much better movie right now, Final Destination.
Simon has done far better plays, and should have known enough to burn the script of this disaster before letting anyone film it.
Well, first off I have to say i greatly respect Hunter Thompson, at least before he started getting more mainstream and writing for Rolling Stone.
She could've waited a bit before taking such a radical step - after all, he was only missing & presumed dead.
They went from acknowledging the drug in the previous episode and with no backstory or character development, they simply demolished the creator and sole pusher of the drug before the opening credits finished rolling on the next episode.
So we took the bait and saw the movie with absolutely no preconceptions--we didn't know who was in it, what it was about--in fact, we had never heard of it before.
Virtually every element of the film has been played out before.
The women of this film are made to be the heroes here,the star,the murdered finance of the sheriff(She was going to give the FBI pictures of the bikers doing their crimes but was killed before she could do it.
We see before the War ever begins, that we're watching as rotten a group as one can imagine - deeply self-pitying and selfish people - women without any kind of femininity ("sure, I'll have sex with you whenever you like once I've married a rich man"), men without any kind of masculinity ("sure, I raped as many women as often as I could - committed war atrocities, sure, the lot - it was WAR and I know war and you don't" (and I can't stop talking about it because I'm as self-pitying a human as you'll ever ever meet!
for me,this is easily the worst disaster movie i have watched to date.i didn't find it compelling at all,and the special effects were not believable.the movie was not exciting.usually,acting is not a big concern in these types of movies.however,in this movie the acting was the worst i have seen so far in the genre.i nearly quit watching before the end,but i decided to give it a chance.regrettably,it did not improve and i lost close to 90 minutes of my life.in my personal opinion,i would avoid this movie,as it is painfully tedious.i also felt embarrassed for the actors at times.the movie was directed by Tibor Takaks,who also directed,"The Gate" another movie i hated.he has directed other things since"The Gate",but i haven't seen any of them.anyway,I'd have to give "Nature Unleashed:Earthquake a dismal 1* star.
It comes and goes as if half of the movie was filmed before they decided that his character should have an Irish (?)
Poor production, including but not limited to, sacrificial police vehicles, at least a decade and a half old and dressed up just enough to appear as a working car before being blown up.
My personal favorite though, is the late model BMW convertible that, just before exploding, turns into a not so late model BMW 4-door sedan.
I've seen "Blast" , "Mean Guns" , "Nemesis 3" , "Crazy Six" and "Post Mortem" before "Ticker" and I have to say that all of them are bad.
In fact, if you had never seen a steven segal movie before you would very much question whether he is doing any fighting in it as you couldn't tell whether it was really him fighting....oh what a sad day.
Even the surrounding buildings are different before and during the explosion.
This is the right time for Seagal to preach some Zen before telling Sizemore how to deal with the bomb.
Storyline, acting, and the music all serving up a feeling of I have seen and heard this many times before.
I had read the novel of David Leavitt which this movie is based on just before watching it.
Though, I would definitely recommend reading the book before watching this so you'll realise it is a very good story but a bad production.
She didn't show a single instance of leadership before or during her tenure as task force "leader".
This is an RKO production 1 year before the studio was sold to Desi & Lucy.
The military had been doing atomic bomb testing near the location before the film, and the area was still hot.
I couldn't get through it before falling asleep.
Maybe his strange behavior before his death was the result of seeing a little too much of the The Conqueror.
What was probably the last "big" news "erotic" film before video took over and the porno industry went where it belongs, on the home VCR, "Curse of Debbie Does Dallas" (just like some old porno films, they have changed the name of the documentary to re-market it) could have made an interesting jumping point for a discussion on the porno industry, the country that supports it and the psychology that drives it.
Instead we are given yet another "dregs of humanity" portrait that's been done before.
But worse are the montages- aside from Bratz, which is in a league of its own, this is some of the just, well, inept editing I've seen in many a moon, particularly at the beginning and end where it seems as though nobody even watched the f***ing last 9/10ths of the movie that came before or after it!
The acting was terrible, even actors from the series who gave very good performances before seemed just awful.
At least the Series had a few seasons before it lost its way.
I have all the DVD's (and VHS before that), I own swords and clothes from both the movies and the series.
Like every other Highlander movie, this one acts like nothing came before it and nothing about it makes sense - it's an insult to the intelligence of the fans.
For the world to have gotten in this condition, more than a few years would have to have passed, and Joe Dawson should look more than a couple of years older - by rights the character should have been dead before this movie takes place.
While I'm glad to hear that it is currently being re-edited before a general release, I fear that without some re-filming, which I believe is not happening, certain flaws can never be rectified.
It also concludes with the threat of a sequel, to which I can only respond with the Wilheim Scream our hunk unleashes just before the end.
You can imagine the lead actress saying before she goes back to her day-job as a stripper.
Diamonds will be eventually found, but before they can return to civilization, the team will be engulfed by a vast forest fire, and they will die one by one.
He was killed before the revolution.
How about the adventures of a sweet young thing with a big princess attitude that barely got out of the World Trade Center with her hunky young hero just before a giant flying demon Bin Laden reduces the buildings to rubble with blast of his powerful satanic breath?
The match day is worth watching but it may render you only sad because everything that comes before it is rather unpleasant.
"Period dramas are a staple of Japanese cinema, so we decided to do something completely different with it, to reinvent it and create a type of action never seen before!"
The star, Tak Sakaguchi, is a fighter in real life who was brawling in the streets before Ryuhei Kitamura found him and cast him in Versus.
In this film, he decided to come up with "a new type of action never seen before!"
This is a movie about a Afghan woman seeking asylum in the US before 9/11.
In each decision the INS makes the right decision based on the facts before it.
If you've never seen an Asian horror movie then you might find it interesting but most people will watch it whilst thinking "Haven't I already seen this before somewhere?"
I was with my husband for 5 and a half years before we got married.
But now I realize simply that I have been watching good movies, and "License to Wed" is a healthy reminder to myself that I can still recognize the sight of horrid cinema when it veers before my eyes.
But unluckily for them, in their church community, they have to pass a "marriage course" before they can wed. And that course is run by priest-from-hell (if there ever was such a thing) Reverend Frank (Robin Williams).
Even Ben, who distrusts him from the moment he lays eyes on Frank, winds up liking the guy before the movie's over.
The pilot, angry when his boss won't pay him for the aborted delivery, calls the Feds and offers to give them the goods on the smuggling ring, but is shot to death just before the agents raid the Chinese restaurant which is the front for the gang.
But at least the beginning (where a pilot has a hilarious, and unexpected way to deal with unwanted cargo), and the ending, with it's plane chase (but not the ridiculous plane chase before it, where a plane with a machine gun can't shoot a plane down that's 10 feet in front of it) is interesting, but the rest is an unmitigated bore.
I suppose you can guess where the story is going from here - he tries to free the sorceress while staying alive and then there's a whole army of traders to contend with, most of which are quite angry as they were massacred before.
But before the unit can plan next strike, Ivan takes revenge, striking against a bank and the American mess hall.
Comments: I think that somewhere before they started to make this movie someone thought: "Hm, I sure do got a lot of fireworks, what to do?
It turns out to be a typical Hitchcockesque twist that will have you nodding your head, saying to yourself 'gee I didn't see that coming...' I'd recommend at least a dozen giallos before this one.
is cynical enough to use Venice as a distraction technique to keep people from realizing that this is simply just another tepid, poorly paced, clichÃ©d-to-the-max murder mystery we've seen dozens of times before.
Not as good as SHORT NIGHT OF GLASS DOLLS, the giallo film Aldo Lado did the year before, which I also happened to see the same time as this one.
Anyway I watched the movie a couple of times before rating and commenting on it.
PS: The poster before this comment must have had something to do with the movie.
No, the plot's not the journey of Tee to the lost cellar, it's not the victories over Lord Voltaire and it's definitely not the Delta Knights attempting to bring about the New Renaissance (they could have done that years before if they hadn't waited for Tee to come around).
Like most young women who make the same mistake at this age, Panabaker looks to her mother (played by a loving but intense Mercedes Ruhl) for advice and in response she promptly pulls her out of school, picks up and moves as quickly as possible to another town where no one will know who they are, warns Panabaker to never contact the child's father and tell him about the situation and ultimately decides that instead of having to explain her grandchild's origins and the whole messy problem itself to a new set of people she just pretends the infant is hers...one of those late-in-life babies born to a middle-aged woman shortly before her divorce through what seems like some sort-of miracle and without the hassle of the whole in-vitro process.
Somebody was obviously sucking a medieval bong before they went out to chase down the dynamic duo.
I don't write movie review, I've never written one before, but this was awful.
Never before as a TV movie ever actually brought tears to my eyes.
I first saw the movie in a theater years before I read the book.
If this has happen before to someone, that person should tell this story.
One of those movies, that you know what is going to happen even before you enter the cinema.
When I searched for it before, I took a road trip across all of my country's video stores and still didn't find it.
I've seen other Miike films and never been this confused before.
Plot: A serial murder tries to kill some local small town teens before they ruin any respect we may still have for comedy.
They end up locked in a mental asylum with a topless tap dancer where Divine repents to the Virgin Mary before they escape and make their way to the hospital where a whacked out surgeon butchers his patients.
So does a soldier woman with long painted nails putting on her make-up before the attack.
and most recently as Ellie Mae Farmer in "The District" before her untimely death.
In a movie, like this, when you have to cut it down to a few loosely connected scenes, all suspense is lost and all we have is a long dull waiting before the action finally begins.
Just before the invasion, the mercenaries are together going over the attack plan one last time and when they are done, Walkin raises his fist and shouts the name of the dictator they are about to murder and the other soldiers echo his gesture.
Roger Ebert named this as the worst film of 1988 six weeks before the year was up.
A new half breed mineral-animal mutant creature is born, fed by poisonous gases etc...and Godzilla is there to fight it before humankind gets destroyed...although the new monster has 3/4 time the upper hand...in the end the idea of the child characters saves the day after many ups&downs.
Despite looking the same as before, he starts acting more like a human than a monster with his hand gestures, boxing and wrestling tactics, mugging whenever he can't get a good shot in on Hedorah, and a couple of odd scenes where he scratches or rubs the side of his nose with his finger.
The special effects suck, even Destroy all monsters which was made seven years before this had better action.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution contends the film before you is an indisputable dud, the weakest film ever made by the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.
Your head may be doing much the same before you see this turkey come home to roost.
With the help of a former cult member named Rowsdower, Troy hopes to get to the bottom of the mystery before he ends up like his father.
I seriously wonder how many decades this sat finished before release?
Pretty much a loner kid who exists before the popularity of the internet.
Then when I saw that tonight TCM was highlighting Danny Kaye movies and that "Wonder Man" was on next, I rushed over to IMDb.com to read the reviews on it since I had never seen or heard of this Danny Kaye movie before.
Two of us fell asleep before it was over; the other two of us stuck it out to the end just to make sure we wouldn't miss anything in case it did get better.
The spirit of Buzzy contacts his twin brother, Edwin Pringle (also played by Kaye), a stuffy bookworm, and asks him to testify before the D.A.
A woman gets her tongue ripped out of her mouth for no other apparent reason than the fact that nobody else in a Dario Argento movie had that happen to them before.
I paused the movie repeatedly, wanting to recover from sequences of stupidity before slogging onward.
Jackie's Fist of Fury technique -- described on the back of my VCR tape case as "a new and deadly art, never before revealed on the screen" -- which involves waving his arms up and down slowly during funky 70s hypno-music.
Unless you're a brain dead zombie from Night of The Living Dead, you know what the plot of this movie is going to be before the $8.50 even leaves your hand for the movie ticket.
To be honest I still had some respect left for Eddie Murphy before this.
Also it appears that no one, from the unicorn that looks like it's ready for the glue factory, to the old lady , can eat ANYTHING without a deafening smacking of the lips before and during ingestion.
His gimmick is having his foot stomped on before going on stage; and his crippled dance becomes a dance hall sensation.
Man that spun me sideways before I burst out laughing.
Each clichÃ© heavier than the one before it until it collapses, whimpering, under the pro-life ending.
This film was so bad that I quit before it was finished.
Perhaps the audience was made up of Sun City retirees like the cast, and they had never heard of "Shrek" before.
Everything this director does has been seen before, and besides that, what he does merely serves to detract from the story.
I knew before I read it here that the director had done music videos, because that was what this movie feels like in spots.
I've seen this movie before, a long time ago, and thought is was really good.
Another standard Columbia quickie made before Michael Landon landed as Little Joe on the Prairie, this one must have been filmed in less than 7 days and really doesn't have much going for it.
The "brilliant" comments before mine makes me wonder if we all saw the same movie.
Besides, Hollywood is such an obvious and all-too-easy target, and this sort of thing has been done a zillion times before, and mostly much better.
This begs the question: why didn't Ursus just tell the King about Zabro's army waiting in the forest before being sent to the dungeon?
Like I said before, the whole script is riddled with such silly contrivances that it was almost impossible for me to enjoy it but being a fan of S&S films, it's watchable for sure, but then I would watch the cheesiest of them all and still be entertained.
You know right what's gonna come out of a character's mouth even before he or she says it.
Most of the chapters you don't know whats going on unless you listen to all the chapters before it so you cant even listen to one part of it without getting lost.
The story begins coherently, but falls into complete nonsense before then end.
I thought we reached the bottom of the barrel last October when we went to see 'space chimps' but that was long before Donkey Xote (DX).
Then, on top of this inanity, add lots of gratuitous nudity which contributes nothing to the story except that the person making the film was probably getting off (it appeared the camera froze in a few chosen spots...like we have never seen those before!)
Even the mighty Mitchum is lacklustre, injecting just a few moments of the requisite cynicism before going back to counting the zeroes on his cheque.
It's one of those 'camera cuts away just before' movies.
Naturally, it's not long before the more morally bankrupt members of the murderous trio decide that they wanna piece o' Lisa; to their horror, however, the girl proves to be not quite as defenceless as she at first appears...  Axe is one of many low-budget pieces of trash that gained notoriety thanks to its inclusion on the Video Nasty list during the 1980s, and, as such, will forever be of interest to those who are compelled to check out the 'forbidden'.
It's not long before the men have raped her, and in true seventies exploitation style; she's getting her bloody revenge against them, using things like razorblades and axes.
It's also fair to say that this film is merely a dull reworking of better and more successful films that came before it, and if you want to see some sick seventies blood and guts; you could do a lot better than this.
These are things I've laughed at a million times before in the TV show, but the movie was just overkill.
Hell, I even blazed one before I went into the theatre.
Meanwhile Ted Gage (Daniel Cosgrove) has returned home to see his family but before he gets an opportunity to see his Brother Brian (Chase Hampton) he dies in mysterious circumstances when his flat blows up.
They even had the nerve to use the ridiculous "bad guy pauses to explain the evil plot to the good guys before shooting them" routine.
Staring the biggest -- most talentless -- show offs that ever went before the camera.
Then he thanks the star whom he had wished for doing something magic before the match so that the people could forgive him (sorry for not informing before) and his father too is proud of him.
The chicken alerts the town about the aliens but the aliens leave before he could give them the proof, and so, the chicken is ridiculed again for wrongly alerting them.
Therefore, in the end, you do not feel that Chicken has suffered much and endured a lot of pain before achieving success in the end.
But before that, they were busy destroying planets?
Good for him, maybe he should have thought twice about that before firing the Disney animators in the process, considering there are hand drawn Disney sequels, and Studio Ghibli films they distribute.
Irina Palm is a small,quiet film about a widow (Marianne Faithful,who will always be remembered as Mick Jagger's girlfriend back in the mid to late 60's,and had a brief recording career herself before Heroin & other drugs side tracked her), who has seen better days,finds out her grandson is dying from an illness that could only be cured in a hospital in Australia.
It's like he forgot to take the watch off before the shot, and the director said, "Oh, well, shoot it anyway."
Can friends and colleagues like Walter Abel (as Fuller), Lloyd Nolan (as Stutz), James Arness (as McMullen), and Andy Devine (as Willie Moon) locate the downed crew before they succumb to the cold winter's wrath?
It's like the editor discovered a new trick on the Avid and then got sick of it before he knew how to use it.
How about the great Leone showdowns with Clint, Lee Van, Fonda, and Bronson- the close ups of the eyes, the tension before the first man goes for his gun.
I made it through about 20 minutes before I reached for the Pepto Bismol anti-depressants.
Daninsky offers them refuge when they become lost, and it is not long before he becomes romantically involved with Elvira (convenient, eh?).
you met the bloke about a day ago and thought he was lying to you before.
and then a moment later, before the next reel started, "WHY?"
Instead, they must just unbutton one another's shirts and rub the back of their hands across each other's breasts for a few seconds before the director yells "CUT!"
Luckily, Elvira and Genevive find relief when a mysterious man named Waldemar appears out of the blue, to offer them a place to stay before the night falls.
Like I said before, I expected at least some decent childishness to amuse myself.
The only decent performances in the entire movie were by Neil McDonough as Bison and, surprisingly, Moon Bloodgood as a detective Â but that's made moot by the fact that the writer has apparently never heard actual humans converse before, so the dialogue wouldn't be worth listening to even if it were delivered well.
The acting is horrible, plot is stupid and when you look at the cast before you even see the movie you already know its going to be a bad movie.
Kristin Kreuk's performance in this film reminds people that a person should take acting lessons before doing a movie.
There was a huge scene where Chun-Li, the heroine, is sobbing and whimpering before she leaves for Thailand (a temporary visit).
Would "the bride" whimper and cry to her friends before she goes off to KILL BILL???
Now, before I get into how bad this movie really is I will start with what is good about it.
So both Balrog and Bison are killed in this movie, before the tournament even occurs.
Not only did the trailer not come out until just over a month before the release date, something I've rarely seen and usually only with horrible movies, it showed characters that looked NOTHING like the game...at all.
Movies before the 50's were packed with such stigmatizing, defaming, and historically inaccurate depictions of Black people.
Its a tired story anyway which has been done many times before and surely better though I haven't watched this type of film as I know what it is going to be like boring and unfunny.
Unfortunately, Shore didn't think the premise all the way through before shooting.
As a matter of fact, there are a lot of things he didn't think through before shooting.
I ask myself if any of the actors rehearsed their parts before playing them, even the prestigious actors were easily forgotten, and had little effect on the movie.
Good performances need actors who get understand the essence of the movie and probably what happened, along with the fact that the purpose of the movie is vague, was that most of the actors were given their lines immediately before playing them.
I saw it on the shelf and had looked at it before, but never had the guts to rent it.
Maggie meets up with the owner and it doesn't take long before she's offered the job.
When a commentator bluntly states that "When Stevie Wonder wants to make a record, he makes a record" it makes you wonder if he or the director do any research into Motown and their factory-like operation of churning out hits before butchering history.
Though the fact that Napster was a good 5 years before Ashlee Simpson's time, this salvation doesn't appear to be well thought out.
Yes it's a big subject, Balzac and Dostoyevski wrote about it long before we were all born, but it was done so weakly.
I hadn't seen Luther Adler in anything before but he was perfect in the role of the scorned older brother.
Obviously the budget was spent on special effects as most of the actors dully slog through the script, which has only one bright spot, when Robot-Gaily begins to wonder who she was before.
Or, perhaps I missed something obvious because my attention drifted away long before the sudden and seemingly tacked-on denouement?
Come on, we've seen it all before.
Anderson before he did it so often it ended up becoming clear that it was all for show and the whole thing was basically just set up.
The very premise of the show, wherein the main eventers were selected because of their 'ability' to carry on training for long periods of time without stopping and taking a break was rubbish because obviously the human body (male or female) can only carry on training for so long before they have to stop for a bit or risk dehydration, spraining ligaments or whatever.
For about half the movie, when guy loses doll and before guy gets her back, Doll Face the movie flops into angst and anguish, with over-acting by Blaine and far too much screen time with her and her ghostwriter, Frederick Gerard (Steven Dunne).
She tries every other avenue before settling, reluctantly, on sex work.
Even the murderer's choice of a giant phallus as a weapon isn't too novel, since while reading up on Ursula I learned that there was another Italian film made before this with a killer that employed the same noteworthy instrument of death.
And to make things crystal clear from the get-go, the fun already starts in a most verbal way, just before the opening credits, when evil sword-wench Sultana shouts "I will have my revenge!
And has John Lazar (of Russ Meyer's BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS fame) ever acted so laughably idiotic before in his life?
The fact that Attila The Hun died over 700 years before Ghenghis Kahn was even born is, of course, ignored.
I recommend to watch the first "Deathstalker" before watching this, and I personally laughed more during the first film, but I guess it doesn't quite make a difference.
Actually, I don't think I've ever rated a movie a 1 before, but that's only because IMDb does not allow a minus or a zero.
Then his obnoxious grandfather dies and leaves him 100 million dollars...IF he gets married before his 30th birthday.
In order to protect a $100 million inheritance, commitment-shy bachelor Chris O'Donnell (as Jimmie Shannon) learns he must marry before he reaches his impending 30th birthday.
It also requires Jimmie to clean up his act before Anne leaves.
Personally, unlike the other reviewers of this cartoon, I found "Galloppin' Gaucho" very entertaining and I personally prefer it to Mickey Mouse's first two cartoons before it, "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie", for the following reasons: 1.
As I mentioned before, Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse are very "cool" in this episode and they both dance very well (in a sort of slow-music style).
It's funny, about ten minutes or so before the movie ended, there was a scene that looked like the ending of the movie.
I have not read the book and many people seem to say that you should read the book before watching this film, but purely as a stand alone movie this film just does not work.
The 14-minute "Life With Joan" focuses on Dunaway's total absorption in the part during the stormy production and includes an extended opening sequence that was deleted before release.
Not enough growth and realization, not enough of a connection was achieved before their time expired.
Soon after, he is given an eye roller of a group photo of the exes, and before he dies Harper describes the afterlife (purgatory?)
The cast (Rea, Polley) looked good, and I liked 'The truth about cats and dogs', the only film by director Wells I had seen before.
David Keith, one of my favorites, acts like he never read the script until just before they call "Action".
He could have been contaminated himself just anytime of the long time before he sealed the house off but after he made his late decision to seal the house off he won't let his wife in and there is no question anywhere around that he might even consider dying with his wife that he seemed so devoted to just minutes before.
Let's just hope that we are wise enough to exterminate it before it exterminates us.
We get 20 minutes of grief, anger, frustration, then mental exhaustion, before he is finally convinced to seal the house against the impending toxic pollution.
My biggest gripe about this movie was the fact that WB decided to wait an entire year before releasing it.
It's also the last time we see the Batman characters in the Fox style before their revamps on the WB network, plus, with the exception of the "Old Wounds" episode, it's Dick Grayson's last adventure as Robin.
That next morning, Sarah awakens in a daze and soon she's feasting on rare meat before graduating to human flesh.
Actually, before I went in, I thought wouldn't it be a great idea to smoke pot and then watch it?
While on the subject of the zombies something that actually had me laughing on the floor of my room was a transformation sequence in witch a man in a hospital bed instantaneously turns into a zombie his face rots and his eyes glaze over in about three seconds and before you know it he's eating his wife.
I can honestly say that I've never felt so bored during an action sequence before.
I knew it was going to be bad after a zombie scaled a hospital ceiling for no apparent reason other than being some type of crazy generation x zombie...not to mention zombies later on poking air conditioner ducts with crutches and floor sweepers (apparently not blessed with the gravity defying before mentioned wall crawling) in order to get at non zombie flesh crawling to safety.
Ten lines of text needed to complete this comment before it can be submitted ---- OK. Let's see.
The long takes of following the stage tech wondering around backstage reminded me of the recent film "Elephant"(but to it's credit it did come 7 years before that film).
When Reno tries to convince a gallery owner to front $500 for his latest painting in order to pay his bills, he is turned down; factor in the punk band that has moved in to the apartment beneath his (and never seems to stop jamming), and a commercial viewed on late-night TV (for a portable power-pack)...and it's not long before our disheveled, vulgar hero takes to the squalid New York City streets, decimating the wino population with a power drill.
Life for Adam consists of doing his farm chores, courting his sweetheart Ruth Simmons (Meredith Salenger), daughter of Joseph Simmons (Robert Urich), and desperately trying to win the approval of his gruff, temperamental yet good-hearted father Moses (Tommy Lee Jones - before he was ultra-famous).
The surprise is blown even before the march begins as Paul Revere and his co-riders ride through the countryside and warn every little town, including Lexington.
The battle sequences are well set up and photographed, one of the most striking audile effects being the drums of the advancing English force, which we hear through the trees for a full minute and a half before the lobsterbacks come into view.
Tommy Lee Jones and Chad Lowe both went on to successful careers, and this movie proves that they had their acting chops down long before they were famous (April Morning Pre-dates Life goes on and Under Siege).
Even before the kids are ready for MONSTERS INC. or SHREK 1, 2 or 3, this ROMEO AND JULIET, Sealed With A Kiss would be a very good choice for a wise parent.
Think twice before watching it, it doesn't bring anything useful to your life, doesn't even make you laugh.
Never before have I seen a movie that made me feel quite this dirty.
They didn't have a dog, but I'm sure it either ran off or died before filming started.
That's the basic set up for this, Ferrell's third collaboration with "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights" director Adam McKay, a tired, annoying, and sometimes cringe inducing display of the same shtick you've seen many times before.
The film also suffers from a degree of unoriginality, nothing is recycled directly from the previous McKay movies, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I've seen this all before, or that McKay and Ferrell weren't even really trying anymore.
But...Hans Fjellestad should have got all the raw materials together before doing it.
I'd heard about it before it was filmed.
"Three minutes before you flat line in there" Then Jake Mcqueen (why try and make it better by changing the name?
The TV movie before 2010; KR2000 was crud but it at least had some relevance to the 80's series, Team Knight Rider was also terrible but still had ties to KITT and The Foundation.
Having never seen "Gregory's Girl" before yesterday, I couldn't quite work out why it was held in such high regard but there is no denying that there is something special about this movie.
It does not probably deserve a vote of 1 from me, I used to watch the show happily before I had taste.
The whole thing has the air of the script being written way before the film was shot, and of no one caring enough to go back and adjust it.
Rex went on about the new wave of sex in the movies and said about this movie: "Well, sex is back in "X Y & Zee," as wretched and slimy a pail of slop as I've ever seen dumped on a movie screen, with the misguided Elizabeth Taylor playing chief pig in the pig sty..."X Y & Zee" is a depraved lesbian horror film with flabby, oatmeal-colored Michael Caine trying vainly to out-weight and out-scream the bloated Miss Taylor before they both get thrown out of the Screen Actors Guild."
A few years before this film, Wong Jing (no one's favorite Hong Kong director) did a movie that was part "Die Hard" with kung fu (supplied by the ever-able Jet Li) and part satire on the career of Jackie Chan, "Meltdown".
Her fight with Christy Chung for example is extremely tasteless, as Lui imitates martial arts stances and goes through a bumbling slapstick routine, mere minutes after a young girl watched her mother machine gunned before her eyes.
The story is one we have seen many times before in many variations - terrorists take over a cruise ship and kill randomly, crew betrayals and heroic actions by a former cop (with a bitter past to add some depth to the character) to save the day are nothing new.
Once the movie starts and you get into it you begin to unravel the plot pretty quickly and then it's just a matter of time before the some teenage killings and some sex like all horror movies need to have.
A little welcome nudity helps a tad to keep viewers from nodding off completely (although none of the girls could really be classed as total babes, they do have nice jugs), but it's left way too late before big bro' finally gets into full-on killing mode.
The entire film is set in one house & I just have to ask how many times can you have your character's run up & down the stairs before it begins to get tiresome?
I don't think this man hates America, he just doesn't roll himself in the flag before he goes to sleep every night.
The truth is that Wilson should have practiced a bit more first before taking on a challenge as this.
You should have practiced by making some Youtube movies first to get warm in the clothes before going for the trophy; Michael Moore.
Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success.
Never having seen men before, it's not long before the men are subject to intense scrutiny and testing.
Being lecture at, in other words, by the people who were trading in African flesh centuries before the Europeans reached Africa, who taught the Europeans the slave trade, and who are trading in African flesh today in places like Sudan, Mauritania, Mali, and Niger.
I have never before seen an actor get EVERY line of a movie wrong before.
The wing man turns out to be the heir to the throne of some fictional Mediterranean country and has to get laid before his 21st birthday, or whatever.
We've seen this story a million times before--usually much more convincingly told.
And then to top it all off, Mulder raises his hands and starts walking across the field toward the barn where they were firing from moments before, doing his best "Dances With Wolves" impression.
I love Mandy Moore, but one has to wonder if she even bothered to check out the script before she said yes to this drivel.
There was really nothing original about this movie either as you have probably seen it done before and better.
The excitement and anticipation of "the first time" (first kiss etc) is beautifully expressed by Madeline "The best part's before you taste it..."   This movie is not for viewers who require explosions to satisfy their entertainment criteria but if you wish to relive the joy, the sweet pain, the magic and the limitless possibilities of your adolescence let Billy Forsyth transport you.
But then suddenly...the anger was gone and 'Archie' was able to act in the same (slightly patronising in my opinion) manner as before.
We've seen this before in every other romantic comedy ever made.
This movie could have been good if it hadn't already been made so many times before.
What an anti climax when 'grease' came on while my mind kept flashing back to the wonderful ,previous film i had watched before.
How Alby provides for his family, or what exactly his wife saw in him before she kicks him out in the opening scene is never dealt with.
Then in the final shot, riding a bus home to his family, Alby gives us one last asinine grin before blowing a great, big bubble, presumably from his pouch of big league chew.
Taking into the fact that I anticipated an average-mediocre film even before I went in, Wenders' ambitions seem to always get the better of him.
Perhaps one sequence where Jubei was actually relaxing with his friends, a little break before we are punished with another barrage of gore.
It's Napolean Dynamite 25 years before Napolean Dynamite.
I've had this problem before, mainly in regards to anime series, but in this instance I don't think it is a translation issue, I think it just isn't clear.
Ultimately emerging as connected pieces of different half-baked incarnations (one of these was even called PSYCHO A-GO-GO before the music was eliminated), the movie begins with a zombified maniac running around town strangling people.
I don't have a problem with the hackneyed premise--many good films have come from bog-standard scenarios before, but the characters are no more than clownish caricatures, the dialogue painfully unfunny, and the acting is hammy and highly overperfomed (perhaps in a vain effort to make the dialogue funnier.)
It is often the slow ride before you plunge, where you hold the breath and wait in excitement that makes the moment, but here you just keep on going downwards from the cool beginning to the more and more excruciating ending.
He says he's never been on a bus before.
No one noticed this before?
Picture this in a modern prison -- he'd be lucky not to get shanked before the bridge.
Say It With Songs became the first of two films he did without the blackface, a fact I hadn't known before.
fr Noah Wyle is so cute as the steamroller of California's last few inches of free livable terrain that zealous liberal women of all ages melt before his dreamy gaze.
At the big climactic concert, Mara hesitates before going onstage, pining for vapid, avaricious, pretty boy Wyle (who has overshot his financial dreams and wound up screwed by the evil banks who've foreclosed on his dream project) and doubting the motives of everyone she ever trusted in her life, from birth.
I came away with a bitter taste after having watched this, surely the actors read the script before even agreeing to appear in this film?
Probably it has to do with the 'transformation of character' I mentioned before: the theory of filmmakers is that, as a teenager, you express yourself through what you wear.
It's interesting to see the first films of this type before CGI, which is why I am investing the week exploring them.
Even though I thought I knew all the funny bits after seeing it so many times, each viewing finds me laughing at things I hadn't noticed before, as well as at all the other bits that never seem to grow stale.
Those F&S shows are hit-and-miss, but it's not long before another sketch comes on.
Kill this series before it gives the great British comedy a bad name.
The letter states that there will be murders before the flight lands.
But in this awful movie, the wife is just pleased as punch that she gets to spend the rest of her life with a mentally challenged man, because he was kind of a jerk before he was shot, so you see, he and everybody else is better off because he was shot in the head and made retarded, the wife gets faithful husband, and the kids get the little brother they always wanted.
It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases.
They continued the trend of showing Ken Melansky bumbling around again before getting bailed out by others to do his job.
to the people that posted before.
OK, so this is Jack Ryan before Patriot Games (given that he's unmarried ... the movie is unclear on the time when it's set), so he has to be young, but Harrison Ford managed to portray Ryan as a nice guy, insecure but fundamentally smart, and Affleck just can't do it.
So to all you smokers out there, quit before you turn into one!
Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middle-aged white european neo-Nazis who make stock Hitler-loving speeches that any avid movie-goer has heard a million times before.
Too bad, they didn't blow up this film before it was released.
It also has one interesting little monologue about how the internet and technology has connected terrorism globally like never before.
For a start it's very slow going, almost half the film has gone before anything even remotely horror orientated happens & the story just doesn't work for me at all.
I have nothing against anyone with lots of tattoos but I just think it looks repulsive & the way The Tattooist tries to place tattoos as a sexual thing (Jake tattoos Sina just before they have sex) & tries to sexualise them is something I could not relate to at all in any way.
As the film tepidly moves along, begging you to find the murderer among the passengers before anyone is actually murdered, you'll be treated to outrageous mid-70's fashion (brown is IN!
You got a meaningful flashbackÂ from Zoltan, Dracula's dog, so we could see what a lovely dog he was before being bitten by Dracula.
When the Russian army(I think their Russian, based on their uniforms, but no one has any kind of accent) unearths Dracula's tomb, they decide to burn all of the corpses, but not before some foolish soldier decides to pull the stake out of Zoltan's body, allowing him to regenerate and drain the blood of said soldier.
Director Gorman Bechard and much of the crew and cast worked on this and before it both 'Psychos in Love' and 'Galactic Gigolo' for Full Moon.
), all the murder set-pieces but especially the one where a nurse has needles painfully stuck in her face (years before Takashi Miike!
Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the States) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany.
Unfortunately Mr. No Legs isn't actually in the film that much, he dies at least 20 minutes before the end & he only has one proper fight scene which comes as a disappointment.
It is deffo frisby material but before you wang it out of the window it is worth one watch because you don't want to miss out on : What is going on with Bolo?
To avoid any confusion let me make clear that this film is an exercise in applied bad taste made long before the term "political correctness" was even coined.
The first time Claire sees the ghost in the bathtub, before Norman runs in after her scream, it takes what, 5 seconds for the whole tub to drain!
This film, along with "Hollywoodland," seems intent on informing us uneducated hicks from the heartland that homosexuality existed before 1990.
Also it leaves you with asking a lot more questions after the movie than before seeing the movie.
Too much happens at the end and it was like a student cramming for a midterm 5 minutes before the test begins.
I, personally, have researched as much as I possibly could on the case long before the movie came out...and the only thing that actually lived up to true drama of the real events was the crime scene.
Nor does Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography escape a rap on the knuckles for a ridiculous lesbian stag film (presumably made at a cost surpassing the combined budgets of all blue movies produced from the 1920s to the 1950s), and a self-conscious and overly elaborate shot in which partners Blanchard (Eckhart) and Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) engage in a shootout, followed by the camera slowly rising up floor by floor of an entire apartment building, proceeding to a befuddling shot of the building's roof before it at last discovers the Black Dahlia's body in a vacant lot in the adjoining block.
We have SO seen that before!
Rebound doesn't really have characters; there are just static, singularly-painted figures that we can't root for because it follows every sports film clichÃ© in the book, meaning the audience knows in the first five minutes how everything will turn out before the characters even get there.
Where have we seen this before.
As for the characters, you've seen these people a thousand times before, and as recently as a month ago.
Speaking of, The Fly II might as well be considered a Dead Dickweed Movie, because almost none of the characters are fleshed out beyond being a bunch of absolute wads, and we have to put up with them for over an hour before the main character transforms into a fly and offs them.
One can see why this one sat in the can for over a year (copyright 2000, released 2002) before finally being dumped to video.
A tired and amateurish farewell to Mansfield, who, contrary to popular belief, was not beheaded before its release.
Because she died before it was completed,it ended up on the shelf, until the director (and Mansfield's ex-hubby) Matt Cimber, made the decision to finish the film.
Jayne gave a valid performance in "A Guide for the Married Man" shortly before her death, and that would have been a more fitting end to her (modest) career.
Fashionable, but formulaic we've seen it all before.
But be aware of this before you watch the film--you could easily be offended.
Shirley is well played by Vivienne Osbourne, an actress I'd never seen before, who is vivid in a two-dimensional, underwritten role.
It isn't entirely clear, and I wish the screenwriters had worked out their themes (and followed their intriguing premise) more carefully before the cameras rolled.
Now you probably are immediately reminded of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's films, though there were some that came out before theirs that were actually far more difficult to stomach--the films were so old fashioned and the singing so dreadful.
The characters' depth is non-existent, the movie is boring, the kid is boring, the bully is ridiculous and the sheriff was a zombie before he was dead.
I had never heard of any of the actors or actresses before, and sometimes thats not a bad thing, but usually (and it was the case here) it means you're in for a low-budget film that really won't be that great.
of course in a good movie this leaves plenty of room for heroic changes, but they never made any (at least not before the audience stopped caring).
Even if I didn't new the series before seeing the movie, I wouldn't of give more then 4 out of 10 for this piece of ...  Everything is very predictable, nothing is really funny or new, nothing to push me to the limits.
Not a lot to irritate anyone in The Maltese Bippy, but it's all been done before, better, by others.
Matthew McConaughey really surprised me because he has played this role before without conviction.
The fights are choreographed okay and there's no poorly done CGI to laugh at, but we have seen this sort of thing before and I expect better from The Asylum.
As I mentioned before, Elvis was the only good one because I could see Elvis doing the "look out man!"
Some films age badly, but Golden Boy practically decomposes before your eyes.
There were allegations that the show had run its course several years before they finally decided to end it.
See it at Blockbuster before the Summer Blockbusters open, better yet rent it if you were given a gift card from a friend.
You need to run your head into a brick wall a few times before you watch this and, if you like it, you need to return to the wall and hit it much harder.
As it was, my ten year old, eleven year old, my spouse and myself had to leave the room before the movie was part over.
A man suffering from amnesia coming back from war to be confronted with a wife and child...Well we've seen this before and long ago...To be precise in 1938 ,when Curtis Bernardt -who continued his career in America afterward- directed his "carrefour" starring the excellent Charles Vanel and Jules Berry.Here the director -very academic- substituted the Middle Ages for WW1 and presto!an original screenplay!
Now, the "serious" side of this movie flounders like the fully dressed blacks diving into the pool--we're supposed to think here of baptism, even before we see the image of the little boy floating in the crucifixion pose--and we are also supposed to swallow yet another screenwriter's slam-dunk of a terribly complex and many-sided situation, that of racial injustices of sixties Alabama.
I went to see my ageing parents and it was on, at around the halfway mark - "Hello," I thought, "even though I've never seen this before, it looks unmistakeably like Irwin Allen."
You see, while I might not have seen this particular movie before, I can certainly recognise Irwin Allen's distinctive signature on celluloid.
Newman, Holden, Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine all veterans of Irwin Allen disaster films from before just go through the motions here.
The patrons of the bar make a hasty escape right before the red lava eats it up.
I was too young to see this movie when it was released theatrically, but I can just picture the audience throwing popcorn at the screen before walking out in both confusion and disgust.
but obviously time ran out for the script-writers some time before they had finished the job.
Airport '79 before 1980's When Time Ran OutÂ aka The Day the World Ended aka Earth's Final Fury finally sounded the death knell for both the genre and Irwin Allen's career.
OK, but stop me if you've heard this before.
The climax is one of the longest scenes of people crossing a bridge ever filmed (nigh on two whole reels of it) before one brief badly matted-in explosion.
Then there's the rickety bridge over the river of lava, which, of course, gives way before everyone gets over it.
This film just made it under the wire before the Hays Code came along, so Lupe showed us about all of her breasts.
Apparently he would prefer to live in a society where only his matters and everyone must bow down before him.
(J. Arnold): Well, in all honesty and I know I'm speaking against my own financial interest here, there are many 50's movies that you should see before "The Space Children".
Yet this seems to be all he did Â in a manner inferior to that of droves of dramatic film-makers before him.
Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING IT (2 outta 5 stars) It gets 2 stars only out of respect for what Mel Brooks had done before.
I guess if you are already chuckling at the idea of Leslie Nielsen playing Count Dracula you will probably enjoy this movie... but he can do these kinds of movie is his sleep by now... he doesn't really do anything that he doesn't done better before.
Maybe we can  have hope for "Jeux d'enfants", a new French horror movie whose trailer  I saw before this one.
7 days to live is an OK horror film if you have never seen a horror film before.
and one must not neglect the amount of alcohol one drank that day, as well as the acidity level of any foods eaten in the period before the water was taken.
I can get back to whatever i was up to before you bothered me.
I had watched this once before and knew it had something to do with a house, but I had forgotten much else.
They don't know the story of the house and how it has destroyed many other families that lived there before.
And before you can say Jack Nicholson, Hopkins has the assorted criminal loons on his side.
I've tried that before.
Anyway...in the final frames of the long shot before the boy runs away you can see the dead girl move.
Naturally, the demons want them to kill before granting them their wish.
One of Them will put you to sleep before long with it's inane dull story, it's bad special ed effects, and it's apparent complete disdain for the hapless viewer.
", you'd have to have your stomach pumped before the movie ends, which ironically is a better fate than watching One of Them.
So in a totally superfluous scene tacked onto the end, we see Bride DeHavilland and Groom Forsythe, with the rest of the cast kneeling in a cathedral before a priest during what is obviously their wedding ceremony.)
Spaceballs was probably Mel Brooks' last funny movie before his schtick got old and dry.
Didn't anybody watch Spider-Man Unlimited or The Batman before hiring him?
And before long my doubts are cleared, they are brought/forced together in a very unconvincing and awkward way.
I have given myself a day to calm down before 'voicing' my critique of this shoddy film.
It's awhile before we even know that Mexico is the foreign country where the characters are.
That was 4 years before SG-1 started.
With all the hoopla I'd heard about this movie before its release, I was expecting a lot more.
I've seen that done 100 times before and 1,000 times better.
Using a poisonous drug, Rotti had it placed in the vial containing a formula Nathan was working on for his pregnant Marni who fell ill. Nathan, using the infected formula, instead causes the illness to worsen, needing to surgically remove their daughter, Shilo(Alexa Vega)before certain death.
Mag will meet Shilo with a domino effect transpiring..it's only a matter of time before Shilo will discover the truth about her father's practices and the real reason behind the death of her mother.
It's probably a bit unfair to compare this version of the Sweeney Todd story Â as well as any other film version ever made before Â with Tim Burton's film which came out in 2007, but at the same time also inevitable.
I've read bad reviews before, where the reviewer totally bashes the movie they are reviewing.
Well, the theater was full before the movie began, but by the time the movie ended and the lights came up.
He's limiting my time with my grand daughter and is now trying to get my 19 yr old daughter to be with him and he took out a life insurance policy on her 3 months before she died for more than what he insured himself for.
Eric Roberts, an actor who I was not aware of before this movie,stars as Bob Wilson , a man with very bad facial hair,looking late 70's.There is some scenes in the movie where he looks like he has lost some 'teeth' on the left side and the beard is a beard to hide the fact.
Woody walked this path before (six characters in a country house) in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, but did so with a sense of whimsy and an unexpected show of hopeful romance.
Something more dumber is that they all seem to see there friend dead before them dying, it is repetitive, the only different death is the last one.
A bunch of spelunkers go to India to explore a creepy cave before one of them goes off to get married.
Not to spoil the ending (if that were possible), but how many times can you blow up and burn a vinyl Centipede before it dies?
It's nothing you haven't seen before - typical giant bug of the day run amok due to irresponsible toxic waste dumping movie (complete with exclamation point) - only worse.
Well before long, Elwood and the gang found themselves surrounded by every cop in a thousand mile radius, as well as the Russian mafia.
The show has always been sort of predictable, but now I usually know what will happen before it does.
Having some idle time before going to work, I looked at my "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" DVD collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: Zis Boom Bah starring a forgotten Grace Hayes.
Fortunately, ELIZABETH TAYLOR is only allowed to parade her beauteous face before the close-up cameras without uttering a word.
But this film did play in the fantasy/horror film festivals before being released to DVD.
However, the accomplice sees her and takes the phone away before she can send the message.
The guy gets up with a nasty gash on his forehead, and stabs the accomplice with a sharp object, before passing out for 5 seconds.
Having not seen the film before, my thoughts were that with Stanwyck, Burr, and Hayden, along with character actor Dano and Fay Wray, how could I go wrong?
Though she was able to pull it off just a few years before in "Clash by Night" and "Jeopardy", by 1957 Stanwyck was now 50 years old and simply no longer convincing as a sultry love interest.
The script, as I mentioned before, is absolutely deadly, a laugh fest almost from start to end.
(It won't be before time when they do.)
When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: 'Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?'
When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: 'Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?'
(Peter Sellers) and perks secretary/fiancÃ©e, start giggling even before finishing ingesting brownies.
That's about all I could remember before I checked myself into the local looney bin.
Even more pointless is that they already seemed to know this before they even went on the voyage.
This film appears to be made long before scientists even know the Earth revolved around the Sun, with special effects that are unconvincing and even downright pitiful.
The guy before me called it "visually stunning".
Somehow, (There is an awful lot of unexplained "Somehow" in this film) this is connected with a supposed meteor that hit Siberia 75 years before.
One of the crew goes outside to fix something before they hit an even bigger slightly more expected meteor shower.
He sets off with the only black member of the crew and lowers HIM down the very deep hole for some reason, before getting a puncture in his space suit and dying.
I wonder who they were because we had seen neither of them before.
Actors talking to each other and explaining the situation, like they never met before.
You may, if you like, interpret this as a failure of nerve of Dmytryk's part: he had originally refused to testify as to who was a Communist before the House Unamerican Activities Committee.
If Bill read the script before declining to sign up, I think I can see why he declined even if it were put down to problems with Lucy.
Wow that has never been done before.
When you watch an episode, please remember that while the foul-mouthed, violent, absurdly convoluted, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes, several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water.
We're half an hour into the film before she has a line of dialog -- and not many after that.
she is swearing and lots of dumb people laughing her.this is not a comedy,not even a black comedy.i could resist the disgusting jokes only for 8 minutes.nobody can laugh that jokes unless he is idiot.i have doubt about Americans after this show.they gave high points for this show.if they liked it they must have problems in their mind.i can not believe that people pay for this disgusting show.it does not worth a penny..i looked its rating before getting it,but i am very disappointed.this is the worst show i have ever seen.
I should add that the advertisements for "Creative Light Entertainment" that come before the movie starts are even funnier than "Spplat Attack" itself.
Watch it first and decide for yourself before considering showing it to your kids.
Film is literally past 75 minute mark before lone-masked-avenger is introduced - and the scene's a howler, as the Diminutive Dick (Keaton) rams through the crimelord's door with one kick, oversized shiny revolvers waving wildly, screaming and frothing behind an oversized ski-mask for everybody to hit the floor.
I hadn't seen Caine as bad as in this one before, but then again I haven't seen that many flicks with him in them.
Killing characters before time, changing names, cutting important scenes, and creating some that don't even come in the book, thus looking artificially inserted.
As I mentioned before, the movie sucked because instead of being a normal action/horror movie (the action is horrible; it's scary if you consider wolves in a procupine suit scary) it tries to throw in religious themes (which isn't in the film enough to justify all the freaking imagery everywhere.
I got it from a friend who had bought the DVD without viewing it before...it was so horrible that he gave it to me just to get it out of his house.
It's really a shame, as there were elements of a good story but it just looks like the film was rushed into production before the complex plot was worked out--sort of looking like it was improvised.
I was extremely disappointed in this film...a diamond scam film that has been done before, and better.
The Prestige, a film that throughout its running time shows and tells us that the magic in the film is one rooted in realistic trickery and that the rivalry between the two main characters is based on which can come up with the cleverest ruse, believes that it does not need to ask the audience to suspend its disbelief before laying down the biggest of deus ex machina macguffins seen in recent cinema.
According to what i've heard, this movie spent 3 weeks in select theatres before they realized it was a piece of crap and decided to release it before the theatres threw it out.
Obviously the producers had money and spent it on hiring a great casting director, who was well connected... and yet all the actors signed on to something that was absolute crap... did they even SEE any of the animation before it was being voiced?
And the one revelation/twist that's really an out-of-left-field surprise is completely unmotivated and implausible, given all that went before.
It's not that he does it better (although compared with most Hollywood releases, he really does it better), but that his work is instantly recognizable as unique, clearly identifiable, unlike anything we've seen before.
Even when it thinks it's being cool (like the lame reveal that those alien spheres are actually "arks" trying to save animal life before the world is annihilated) the script fails miserably.
You'll never believe this but humanity, or at least the American government run portion of humanity, take immediate military action against the alien invaders before giving them the chance to make their case.
The style is definitely there, but just before it triumphs, something completely illogical is said or done that breaks the suspension of disbelief the film tries so hard to build up.
The "style" of the movie is to cut away from shots and scenes before the audience can figure out what they are supposed to mean, because that's "deep" and "mysterious" or something.
A grotesque menagerie of stereotypes is wheeled before the camera, each one comporting itself in a fashion consonant with the film makers' expectations: the saved cavort with the Spirit and dribble glossolalia from contorted lips; violent "bad men" with vacant faces and empty, idiotic bravado shoot stop signs, do meth, go to juke joints, go to prison; trailer-dwelling sluts revel in sex, bars and bad men; coal miner-banjoists live hard lives and are inscrutable.
I've never encountered that before.
and i want me 91 minutes and 22 seconds back.but,we don't always get what we want do we?i guess this is supposed to be a horror comedy combination.well,if so,they left out the horror part.actually,they left out the comedy part too.mostly,this movie very slow and boring,but believe it or not,there are worse movies out there.Warwick Davis plays the Leprechaun,and it looks like has a blast in the role and is not taking it seriously at all,which is one good thing in the movie.Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie,which came out about a year before "Friends".anyway,this movie spawned 5 sequels so far,and to be perfectly honest,it doesn't merit any sequels.for me,"Leprechaun" is a 2.5/10
Basically Daniel 'Dan' O'Grady (Shay Duffin) has returned to America from Ireland after stealing 100 pieces of gold from the magical and nasty Leprechaun (Warwick Davis), but he manages to trap him in a crate covered with a four-leafed clover before having a stroke.
Reding (John Sanderford) and his spoilt daughter Tory (introducing Jennifer Aniston, a year or two before Friends) move in to O'Grady's old house.
shame on bashir and shaw for being completely one-sided and prejudicing michael jackson before they ever even started shooting.
Well, they did but before you were born.
There's Richard Burton, Hardy Kruger, Roger Moore, Richard Harris, Stewart Grainger; any one of whom would have single-handedly carried a movie a decade before.
I've never submitted a comment on a movie before, but I HAD to for this one.... that must say something.
It also looks like none of these people have ever fired or held a gun before, for that matter.
I always watch the whole movie if I start watching one and I think I have only once before had to stop.
And the sham piety of credit card company reps testifying before Congress is more than a little sickening.
You see the aggressive expansion of the credit market into areas where creditors wouldn't have pursued before, since they used to not be profitable, like college students, and people with generally low income.
At only about 1:20 minutes (before the credits start rolling) it felt like 2+ hours.
Not really helping is the fact that it jumps from message to message and story to story and sometimes seems to highlight a subject only to abandon it before the point is made.
I agree with all comments before me - there really can see cheap, poor acting, ugly script, plot and bad directing.
It all sucks to high heaven, and you're bored before the Klowns show up.
When it all falls apart (because of her) she decides to have a go at the guy she wanted before.
Perhaps these actors should go on a new mission: steal the prints of this craptastic movie and burn them before any unsuspecting viewer can see this dross.
You start to reassemble the beast and what emerges bears no resemblance to anything you've seen before.
Scenes lurch from the comic set ups to a tearful husband and wife the night before he is to go of into combat.
Once dropped behind enemy lines the whole thing changes direction, one undercover Englishamn takes a beating before LeBlanc rescues him and beats the German to a pulp.
A measure of how messy the film is that you are watching it for a full before it becomes apparent that most of the characters are members of the one family.
There were cop movies before this, there were car chases before this.
I went to "Best Buy" one day browsing through the horror section and I happened to glance at the movie "The Dead Next Door" and i had before read reviews on numerous websites that stated it is a fun and enjoyable cheesy horror b-movie...BIG MISTAKE buying this movie...The Budget not only made the movie cheesy and sh$#ty but the acting was Horrendous!!!
i have never felt compelled to comment on a film before but was so disappointed in this film that i had to register and say my piece.
Mr Bookwalter, go and learn how to make movies before actually making one, The Dead Next Door entertained me for all the wrong reasons turning what was meant to be a serious stab at filmmaking, into a camp classic for the 'Don't care' generation.
Hal Holbrook, Shelley Winters, Richard Pryor (before anyone had heard of him), Ed Begley and even Dick Clark are in this film.
But, it's a shame to tune out before the film's final scene, which is hysterical.
And this was years before anybody could have predicted the Cambodian Khmer Rouge!
There was good stunt work, lots of explosions and some good martial arts action, but that doesn't compensate for a poor script, and we've seen it all before  Secret agents for God?
With a nearly Lucas-caliber disregard for physics (news flash: human bodies at 700 degrees Fahrenheit, whether in the direct rays of the sun or not, would vaporize before you could say "This planet is named WHAT?
He invites a local reporter to visit him (he goes under the pseudonym of Alucard, hee hee hee, like nobody's ever heard that before).
All of Asia, Europe and Australasia (ie most of the world) will have been in the Day of Wonders long before most people in the US would have had their breakfast.
That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.
Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man.
Brooks gets an inordinate amount of attention and praise simply because she was a big feminist before her time, so Liberals gush over anything she did, even it stinks.
And what about Thymian's tendency to pass out before being taken advantage of?
Joe Rock kindly permitted me to interview him in his home a few years before his death.
that comes right after hepatic shutdown, and just before irreversible coma.
Nielson had four more years to wait before having his career saved by his appearance in Airplane!
The dangerous ones are when you are contagious for a long time before showing symptoms and then you die.
The Waylon Jennings soundtrack (and, in response to a previous poster, this was before Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid) is interesting, but inappropriate.
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it has never been produced anywhere in the world since 1970 - and hopefully, the sun will grow cold before it is produced anywhere ever again.
From here on, the rest of the movie has our good guys challenging and defeating each of the assassins in turn before working their way up to the big boss himself.
Needless to say a fight inevitably breaks out during which our heroes give the clubs patrons a jolly good beat down before leaving calmly.
Unwatchable t*rd, unbearable, actually irritating, hateful crud, painfully dull, painfully feeble, had me hitting fast-forward, the director should be shot, but not before I get my Â£1.99 refund, Darren Day is the worst person alive - you have to see his retarded scene where he is covered in dirt getting sucked off in the back of a van, it is a atrocious, the whole thing is atrocious - Day even pulls out a script towards the end and starts flicking through it... my God - spooky clowns and dead kids, who gives a damn, give me a break, I'm taking the hammers to this, if I ever see the director(s) (it took two people to sh*t this out?)
I just had to get back from the screen really far before it looked right, then it was pretty cool.
What a massive desception this flick is, A movie based around a plot as thick as ice is on a hot-Summer night is usually something you don't want to step on, normally there would be some leverage before the layer breaks but beware step on this and you won't need a peddle you'll be swimming.
Those are the five major points where the film actually shot itself in the foot for no reason, as those points could have easily been fixed before they started filming.
version of Bob & Carol And Ted & Alice....Or Ken & Barbie Meet Limeyrocktwit & WholeEarth MotherNympho....You take your girlfriend home and before you  know it, she's in bed with your mom...If that sounds like fun, or if you can relate...this one's for you...A poorly directed, nasty story that made me want to shower with kerosene and steel wool.
Surely they have had plenty of opportunities for experimentation before now.
They could have rebelled (even secretly) before now.
I don't usually get too upset when I see a bad film but this film had its characters going down this unrealistic road I had to turn off before the accident.
Lisa Cholodenko should have asked herself one question before ever beginning to write and shoot this film: "What do I want to show here?"
I hope she will do this before starting her next project, otherwise her films must be shown with a refund policy.
The Monster Musical has been a failed genre since the brave creation of "The Incredibly Strange Creatures..." Like almost every monster musical before and since it has the distinctive characteristic of being truly awful.
I remember how I watched this movie as a kid before 20 years in cinema and had fun like never before!
The monster masks alone, fashioned by freelance designer Vic Door, who also worked at a milk processing plant, are laughable when compared with those from the Mos Eisley Cantina just three years before - lending understandable succour to the myth that they were made by producer Milton Subotsky's milkman.
If your main reason for watching it (as was mine) is to see San Diego locations, forget it, because in the 45 minutes I lasted before walking out, I saw none (and I never walk out of movies).
The Japanese have been doing it for years before.
Where is any mention of the key Larry King interview given two weeks before her death?
There's an apocryphal story about Lavoe actually meeting Marc Anthony shortly before his death.
The music is enjoyable, but I'm afraid we've all been down this road so many times before that "El Cantante" fails to stir either our passions or our sympathy for the sadly benighted couple and all that they're going through.
I should have rented this movie first before I bought it.
I wasn't familiar with Hussey before but will correct that mistake as she turned in a very nice performance.
He's been severely sleep deprived before we even enter the scene and the wreckage that's been left behind is all we have to follow.
Another commenter in this section states that the lighting was authentic in that the Cornish locals at the time figured that as they had never been attacked before, there was no reason to assume that they ever would be attacked then or in the future.
These men showed a tremendous amount of courage in those early days of aviation before WWII.
This movie was awful, although I have seen some worse movies before.
I had not read any reviews or advance press before watching it.
Then they rush Spock into another test, with Kirk in full agreement, and blind him seconds before McCoy finds out it wasn't necessary.
Despite being just over an hour long, A Night to Dismember is really boring; I had a headache before watching it, and it only got worse as A Night to Dismember droned on.
Oh and before I forget to mention it, about 30-40 percent of the movie is out of focus.
If you want to see a good Wishman film watch "Nude On The Moon" or "Bad Girls Go To Hell" and leave this one alone, especially if you haven't seen a Wishman film before.
Soon after her arrival, she's told by her wacky mother that love is in the stars for her when Venus and Mars align - and before you can say "Seen that before" an American hunk named Cody appears (have you ever noticed that these guys are always named Cody or Ken?
Then they try to find the darkest, warmest and juiciest part of your body (hmm..yep, somewhere around THERE), bury there heads inside you and drink your blood for a few days, before dropping off and finding another food source.
If you ask anyone who spends a lot of time in the outdoors, it won't be long before you find someone who has a tick story about a disturbing place they have found one (or more ..).
I also got some entrainment from seeing a young Seth Green on screen, before he developed much personality and Alfonso Ribiero AKA Carlton Banks from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
Years before he made Everyone Says I Love You, which was also a big 30's Hollywood homage, Purple Rose of Cairo was a nifty take on the separation between fantasy and reality (or as one of my friends calls 'magic realism') and how it relates to the depression and the escapism inherent in those fluffy romantic adventures.
I did like her morbidly obese sidekick (gee, where have we heard this before?)Cassie.
Not really, she acted like she more strung out on speed or trippin on some bad shrooms or LSD...Has she ever even smoked before?
PS: It was pathetically funny to see the characters make some position before and after all the roundhouse kicks they made many times against their 'oh-so-powerful enemies', that bothered them everywhere, except in their 'base', funny to see how their enemies knew even their thoughts but not the location of Zond's batcave.
had any of the creative team ever even visited it before?
You should have told me this before."
This man ran out of steam long before Full Moon ran out of business.
Sorry, I'd watch "Titus", twice, before this.
It's also one of very few that I actually walked out on before it ended.
Indeed, if you read the book, you'd be way past page 100 before any reference to the murder appears.
I wondered why, with two such great stars as Gene Kelly and Deanna Durbin, I had never heard of this movie before.
So I ordered it...I watched it....and now I know why I 've never heard of it before.
The thing is, the TV series grew very monotonous and repetitive, always having Ash defeat Team Rocket just like he has several times before in every other episode.
In this movie, it takes an hour and 45 minutes before the dreaded comet hits Earth.
There was also an strange moment when Nino and Louise suddenly were great pals, walking down the street arm in arm, having only met vaguely before that.
*groan* Then if I remember correctly, towards the end we get a couple more semi gory killings, before Jackson collapses crying and screaming "No!
OK, so I admit that tastes vary and it's very much a subjective issue but really Â before awarding any such lofty accolade, do so with at least some perspective and knowledge of the genre to which the relevant film belongs.
I wouldn't waste my money to see it again if I knew before how sorry it was.
In fact this movie has been done before.
The actors seemed to walk through their parts, as if they simply sat in a sound booth and read lines they had never seen before.
The glaring deficiencies in the quality of CGI, screenplay, voice acting and the feeble rip-off of other far more capable screen stories makes one wonder why someone at some point didn't come to their senses and ditch this project long before it ever made it in the can.
But, this celebrity status is non-existent from the beginning and she manages to go to a concert with Pi without anyone noticing her Â that's before the trip above water where they should've died.
Never before had I seen anything that ripped off anything else to the degree that this film does.
Yet, no one ever went searching before.
Characters, too, and not just the fairies, appear suddenly before freezing in place to say their lines.
This is another one of those "intelligent art films" you need to read the review first before you can understand the movie.
I'd never heard of it before buying it, and I wish I'd not bothered!
Rainer and Angerer were neither "bad Nazis", nor hostile to Hinterstoisser and Kurz: Actually they had decided to join forces before they started the climb.
This potentially funny situation has been done before and better by other shows and movies, like the ones mentioned above.
It has its funny moments at times, but they run dry long before the movie is over.
She insists on marrying before having sex, and so the alien marries her.
I'm sorry... the first predator dies instantly to an alien... the 2nd puts about about a 20 second fight before dying to another alien... then after that awe inspiring 21 seconds of alien vs predator action, it goes back to the humans being lost and stupid again for an additional 20 minutes... then you are rewarded with another 20 seconds, where it shows the remaining predator kill an alien... but its not the uber fight you think its going to be... it takes all of .5 seconds for him to slice through the head with ninja like reflexes... im glad at least one of the predators wasn't a total weakling right?????
Anyhow, Bishop has discovered a pyramid located deep underground in Antarctica, and he wants a team to drill down to itÂ oh, crap, where have I heard this before?
Not a lot of them, but you do need to respect the movies that came before.
Not only was the plot terrible, lets talk about acting, because apparently, they did not discuss it before casting anyone for this debacle!
Anyone with even a lick of respect for either franchise can see how utterly stupid this film was even before any production was set forth.
AVP tries to set up the former factor with Lance Henriksen's character anxious to find the strange artefact under the polar cap before he dies.
Human characters have so little character development that often you don't even get to learn their names before they are killed, and so much more makes you feel like the script was made from a tipped over box of alphabet cereal.
Every other Alien/Predator film released before this one had and R rating.
You would see an Alien just getting near a guy before the camera would cut away, leaving you thinking, "So not only do we have no story but we have no gore?!
I really can't believe that the prison guards wouldn't have intervened long before they did.
BUCK known for many nice movies before, that all are very nice and comical, was more than a promise.
I had not seen him before, but seeing how he could even pretend to be in character in this turkey was impressive.
I've seen his type many times before... they always crack under pressure.
I didn't know who Jennifer Garner was before I watched this, so I googled her.
Because I seem to be the only one to notice that this series is old dug up scripts/actions/themes that has been seen many, many times before on TV.
But I give everything a chance before I render an opinion.
I have heard that this movie came before the Blair Witch Project, which I thought was excellent (and in my opinion it's popularity is well deserved), and that it may have inspired the Blair Witch Project.
What "Return to the Blue Lagoon" really is, if you think about it, is an unsexy pornographic movie for kids; a stage for kids to go through before they see the softcore and hardcore porn films.
"Frankenstein Reborn" is another of those direct to rental flicks that usually makes you hesitate before you rent.
However before that Uncle is overthrown by a bunch of clowns and Baba goes to jail .
They don't show him killing her it freeze frames before that.
After this, the evil space pirate and her crew head toward the island, and it's obviously up to the Power Rangers to try and stop her, but before they set out, Zordon and Alpha 5 give them new powers called "Turbo powers"!
A few months ago, I watched "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" (which I had never seen before), and around the beginning, I found that it was mildly amusing, but was disappointed to find that the amusement soon went away.
"Hamlet" and father make amends just before that and Dad let's his son get away.
Yes, the actors do very well with a minimalist script and some nice photography, and the viewer wants to know more about them before the tragic ending turns into 'bathos,' i.e., imitation pathos.
She winces when he crawls atop her and tells Keith that she's never made love before.
On this discovery she runs big-bellied through the night-time streets of Rome until she collapses before a painting of the Virgin and Child.
For several minutes we watch her tattooed naked body before a bathroom mirror while she shaves her armpits, applies lipstick, and watches tears roll down her cheeks.
The plot of God taking a vacation has been done before and I'm sure that it will be done again.
The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start.
That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits.
Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy.
Henry Winkler of "Happy Days"; Shelly Long of "Cheers" fame; Michael Keaton way before "Beetlejuice" and "Batman".
the only good points are 1) it ended before 90 minutes were up, and 2) the zombies, which appeared for about ten minutes at the end to play basketball, at least had good makeup.
Even if you have never delved into bad films before, try renting this, and prepare for the time of your life.
What with US army personnel parading around London in uniform before the US had entered the war; the stock footage of the 1970s era London Ambulance rushing the agent to the hospital; the "military" DC3 in civilian paint scheme; the Rolls driving around with headlights full on in the blackout; the "French Port" with lights blazing, also in the blackout; the "Social Club" in London that had both male and female members; the two "heroes" jumping out of the aircraft without a jump-master; and... Well, I could go on and on but I think you get the point.
Two Americans do unbelievable heroics just as France is being occupied by the Germans in the Second World War - and before the United States had entered the conflict.
Then suddenly a new wave of Graboids appear, Burt warns the town & convinces them to help him kill them before they turn into Shriekers.
There's nothing here we haven't seen before, the Shriekers are not seen at all apart from the opening sequence & at almost 100 minutes long it does drag at times & the constant silly humour & one liners does get tiresome & repetitive quite quickly.
Also just look at 42nd street before Disney took over.
We've seen all this before in other films, like "My Own Private Idaho".
Ted is the only male around, therefore, its only a matter of time before Ted finds himself seduced by a bare-breasted witch.
Script, script, script I hear the gate keepers, the producers, the film council shouting, if the foremost essential key to a successful film, but know one obviously took the time read this one and kill this abomination at birth, in fact it would seem that unbelievably know one read it before taking part in this rubbish.
Paradise Grove is totally devoid of anything resembling humour, the script sounds like it was made up ten minutes before shooting started and some plot devices look like they were bolted on from a completely different film.
It`s a spy spoof with refferances to IN THE LINE OF FIRE , SPEED , PULP FICTION etc and even includes a sly nod to FELLOWSHIP OF THE THE RING years before that movie was filmed !
Lets hope someone realises this before he ends up like Lloyd Bridges...He too was a great actor who was reduced to being letter-boxed as a slapstick comedian-actor.
It's all been done too many times before.
And for people which know about the Neeson case, it will be even more boring, for they know the end before the movie even starts.
If you're not, you might need to view a couple of times before the story grows on you.
So honest, in fact, that when she gets OLDER, I am going to make my 12-year-old aspiring Chef read it before she decides in fact to spend oodles of money on Culinary school.
The hilarity begins well before that, as there are too many quotes to list.
However someone else much more unwelcome decides to gatecrash the party, a brutal killer is at large & intends to slaughter them all before the night is over...
There is nothing in Slumber Party Massacre III that any horror fan wouldn't have already seen a 100 time before in just about any other slasher.
The acting was poor throughout, don't give up your day jobs girls...  Slumber Party Massacre III is nothing to get excited about, frankly I was pretty bored & felt liked I'd seen it all before.
I watched it with several friends, and I'll tell you what, we never had such a good time making fun of a brain-dead exploitation movie before.
And we've all seen the standard electrocuted-in-bathtub death scene countless times before, scene, though instead of the usual hair dryer or radio being tossed in the tub, this time it's caused by a vibrator that one character plugs in and leaves sitting on the sink while she's taking a bath.
the English dub sounds like a cheap 70's porno, the animation looks like a bunch of junior high kids got together some day and drew this crap up, keep in mind that this came out in 93, only 2 years before ghost in the shell.
Why couldn't someone with a conscience have burned the final print before it was released?
We also have the vampire-seduced kid plot line that seems to wind around and around before the ultimate non-climax.
I tried to get into it twice before I finally forced myself to watch it all the way through.
I've seen it done before and I've seen it done better.
The confrontation between O'Reilly and Jeremy Glick was also interesting, and I had not seen that before to the best of my recollection.
But it's not a bad film, and you should see it before Bush leaves office and the film loses relevance.
I came here and read the reviews before I watched this on TV last night.
I don't think I've ever laughed this much to a Swedish movie before and I doubt that I ever will.
The rest of the film seems to consist of either seen it all before POV's or more of these overly lit side shots, I thought Dan O'Bannon could shoot films?
But when small technicalities get in the way of justice, you have to compromise your morals and let rapists and murderers on the loose--just because the police may have performed a search without a warrant, or taken garbage out of a truck before the lever was pressed and it was dumped into the back with everyone else's trash, thereby becoming "trash" and not the garbage of a certain individual.
Catherine grieves for her father who suffered from insanity before he died.
Maybe the complete belief in the 'universal' (rather coprophagous) appetite of the masses for a bit of cheap entertainment between reality show "Big Brother" and the soporifics Late Hour News...  On the other hand, a proof that prestige of American film in general, and of names like Schrader, Liotta, Fiennes are untouched   If I write here right now that we took it as a bona fide self-parody, or maybe an attempt to emulate Ed Wood in producing the worst film possible - Yes, things like that are already been said before on this board, as I read above...
When he later says he is going to kill everyone I really thought it would be Fiennes, Mol, then the director, the screenplay writer (same guy, maybe), the cameraman before turning it on himself.
Most historians agree that the "taming" of the west occurred when women began arriving in greater numbers--before then, men of the region spent the majority of their time getting drunk and killing each other and the Indians--and someday that would make a really good movie.
Anyway, I will always love his movies made before 1991.
Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories.
Yup, before this movie, many various EX-YU actors and directors were talking about making some new movies as homage to old partisan films... luckily, this movie showed that it would be just waste of money...
One can fully understand why Warner Bros. went through such length to keep this film from being seen by critics before it was fully released.
When the word gets out before the release of a movie or TV show that it's a real bomb, a snowball effect begins.
They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie, and when could you ever have said that before about Connery, even if he does wear a bear suit?
Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video.
Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says "how now brown cow?"
I believe that he was a traitor during Nazi occupation, siding with the puppet French government...but he did remake his name before his death.
SPOILERS - READ WITH CAUTION  While this movie claimed to not follow any rule, there was still one big general rule that really should have been followed - as pointed out by Randy Meeks (who makes an appearance via a recording filmed before his death), at the end of a trilogy, ALL BETS ARE OFF.
The fundamental problem with SCREAM 3 is that we've seen it all before .
After returning from a tour in Iraq, two soldiers attempt to track down their squad leader who has gone AWOL before something terrible happens.
I'm sure people who have worked in the restaurant business might be able to relate to this film more, though I have worked in the customer service business before and I know how it is to deal with difficult people.
(I personally didn't know who he was before watching the film) Why does Martine McCutcheon have to talk with that ridiculous American accent in a film set in Austria?????????
It is like watching persons literally age before your eyes.
there is some awkward violence right before hand, but where most films would show the actual rape, the director cut to a black screen.
The moral dimension of such statements greatly destroys other interesting points like the History of Balkans in terms of "war/peace" cycles (The Boxing/Drinking scene "as long as we're in good health" mentality, etc.., - i think it was already mentioned before)
Imagine a kids film directed by Lars Von Trier, add a dash of "Amelie," a scent of "Donnie Darko," a sprinkle of Lynchian strangeness, and a good heaping of Terry Gilliam inspired wackiness, place in a blender, then travel back in time (as this movie came long before and probably inspired "Amelie" and "Donnie Darko") and voilÃ , you'll have "Toto."
But soon enough we know what's going to happen almost before a scene begins and what should be shocking becomes merely tedious.
he almost forces the crowd to listen to how each day seems as bad as the one before, with him getting fired from his job, his wife divorcing him, or having to care for his ill mother (although that doesn't seem to both him as much).
In following the tone of all that's come before, the suspect conveniently makes a quick succession of unbelievably stupid moves to bring this impossible-to-follow disaster to a shoehorned-in conclusion.
That kind of lame sweeps-week cop-out (I better copyright this stupid pun before the Kojak writers see it) doesn't usually surface in a series's long journey to the middle until their ratings take a nose-dive, seeing as how ridiculous and pathetic it is as a basis for an episode's plot.
This has nothing I haven't seen before.
It makes me feel old and long for the days before reality TV ruled when good drama and sitcoms proliferated.
This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.
It was said before "Chicanos good, Caucasians bad".
3) I watch movies because I want to be entertained or moved or see something intriguing, not because I want to walk away from it dumber than I was before.
Let the eagle soar, soar as high as she has never soared before.
I have never written a review at this site before because nothing has ever moved me to do so like this dud.
You have to buy into a lot of insane stuff before you can even begin to get sucked into the story.
In the horrible movie PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, writer/director Ed Wood, Jr. incorporated some footage he'd shot of Bela Lugosi just before Bela's death.
Also surreal and sick is seeing Gig Young in his final film--just months before he killed himself and his partner!
While I am trashing the film, I may as well point out a few other things before I actually go on to praise the film.
Well, it's not a Bruce Lee movie, but it *is* called "Game of Death"(the title Lee had intended to use for a totally different film before he died).
Speaking of that footage(in which Lee also takes on student/instructor/nunchaku expert Dan Inosanto and hapkido master Ji Han Jae), it was shot immediately before work on "Enter the Dragon" began and obviously was not intended to be used in the final "Game of Death" project.
As others have already mentioned that was all that he had filmed years before and they decided to use stock footage and other actors to fill in the rest of the move....... about 90% of it!
His presence alone made him the martial arts genre worldwide, he was truly a man before his time.
If they'd used all the real footage of Lee either before or after this, the film would have made much more sense: instead, they used alleged look-alikes, their faces sometimes hidden by false beards or motorcycle helmets, intercut with close-ups of the real Lee.
I checked with Amazon before purchasing and they assured me that it would play in NA - I took a chance and ordered it - received it and it plays wonderfully and I don't have fancy equipment - old TV and cheap DVD player.
Jennifer Tilly is lovely and carries her part very well, but Scott Glen and Stockard Channing's characters require more script quality before they could be held responsible for the out come.
This includes the aforementioned treachery at the party, easily the most unpleasant party ever captured on film, and that's before all the bad stuff happens.
So far, vintage Italian horror has an obviously different tone indeed from vintage and especially new American horror in the way that there's an unnerving sense as one is watching (if you haven't seen the particular film before or many in the genre, like me!)
I'm not sure if they were married at the time it was filmed, but in listening to Karoline recall during her interview how/when she and David met, it was on a plane to NYC in 1975 so it seems like they at least had been in some type of relationship for several years before this movie was filmed.
If you're able to sit through 90 minutes of terribly depressing exploitation, you may enjoy the ending, but I suspect your finger will have pressed "stop" long before then.
Stephanie Beacham is great as the seemingly selfish Rose Millar with flashes of kindness underneath and her friendship with Blanche is one of the joys of the series,the aborted escape causing a real rift between the two,this is resolved when Blanche is sent back to her friends in the 2nd series after being sent to another camp at the start of series 2 along with Nurse Nellie Keane(who falls in love with Sally(Joanna Hole)in series 1,and Slyvia,Blanche informs them,that Slyvia died a month after arriving in the new camp,Nellie dies a few months before the end of the war in series 3.
Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on.
At least, that is what anyone would have thought before seeing "Crash".
Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time).
The writing is simply awful, and the film has an awkward, shifty pace that ruins the mystery before it even has a chance to start.
Also thrown into this sordid tale are further cardboard cut-out characters including a champion skiier who is hell-bent on bedding as many women as he can before the screen credits go up and his jilted lover (wonderfully portrayed by Cathy Paine) who hams it up in a campy performance that involves her threatening to slice his cheating 'ass' with a butter knife before having a cup of milk thrown onto her as she falls to the floor screaming hysterically.
Of course, the kids remaining aren't much help as they were all out partying together the night before and don't want their parents to find out.
Director Meg Richman has tried, as others have tried, to convert a Henry James literary work into a compelling movie, but falls far short, as others have before her (see 'Wings of the Dove,' 'The Bostonians,' 'The Ambassadors,' 'Portrait of a Lady,' and 'Daisy Miller').
Firstly three years before there was a straight dramatic version of The Three Musketeers that starred Walter Abel as D'Artagnan by RKO.
I honestly did expected much more from the storyline, i couldn't watch it in one time, it's getting so boring so i took couple of days of interval before i finished the movie.
The best parts of this are filmed on the island, before that it's almost all extremely long sex scenes which get rather boring.
If you can sit through this mess without wanting to vomit, i would say you either agreed with the slanted view of the world (that corporations are EVIL) or you hadnt gotten any sleep the night before and passed out during the film.
Like I said before, it was a nice thought, but it simply isn't worth the trouble.
He admitted to things under duress and was never allowed an attorney before questioning, the same way you hear the police on "Law and Order" act like they are angry when a suspect "lawyers up" and act as if it is a bad or wrong thing.
I was surprised at the fine quality of the movie, and the fact I had never heard of it before - since it was made 2 years ago.
If you plan to spend money on this game, make sure you can test play it a bit before, so you can decide for yourself whether you get along with the movement controls.
However, she doesn't seem to remember having met Lutz and Garner before, or having learned of Will's witchcraft skills, which Keli had.
I believe it was 28 minutes into the movie before *any* main character actually spoke a word to someone else, and that was through a headset to an unknown party.
For example when he attempts to report the danger to the police, his mother starts an intimate affair with the officer whom she had met briefly once before several years ago?
He must follow the ancient prophesy of marrying her and sitting on the legendary Throne Of Fire before the day is out, otherwise..
Still, it is not the worst movie I've ever seen, and I didn't erase it before watching it.
First let me go over what I did like about this film before I trash it.
As I said before our star use to be stuck with an evil gym teacher who was out to make his life a living hell.
It is not funny and if you are looking for films that contain the same sort of jokes or themes they're plenty of other films Thornton has made before Mr. Woodcock.
There are many actors who I admire and even adore, who have done a fair share of bad movies, but for some reason (before these three movies) I can't think of any less-than-satisfying ones that Billy Bob has done, except for maybe "Waking Up in Reno."
Like I said before, he probably just did the film to collect a paycheck.
Never before have I been so annoyed by a movie that I felt the need to bitch about it to the rest of the world; to warn potential viewers that to rent this movie is to agree to a waste of a little over an hour of their life.
i have never rated a movie before because i have never been so compelled to rate a movie as i have this one.
It is truly shocking that this film made it to DVD before many other, better-remembered titles from the era.
The last time Maurice Chevalier appeared before a movie camera was in this anemic comedy from the Magic Kingdom, Monkeys Go Home.
Monkeys Go Home just doesn't quite get off the ground as a comedy, Dean Jones would have to wait until he found a Volkswagen with a soul before he scored big in Disney films.
This guy made another dutch classic called 'Philene is sorry' with the same actress , Kim van Kooten ' and that film was maybe worse , but this one comes in close.I Cannot believe that his films are being taken seriously.it is supposed to be a film about a guy filming his sister in video format while he is constantly talking frustrated text into the mic.commenting on his sisters behaviour before the lens.
This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big.
This movie is "reformist" in the same way that Cecil B. DeMille's early movies showed a lot of nudity, just to make sure we knew how sinful nudity was; or in the same way as one of those anti-war pictures that show us the brutality of combat before we inevitably win the battle.
It continues trudging along into an undeveloped storyline that makes the viewer wonder if anyone actually viewed this film before it was released onto an unsuspecting public.
It's been said before, but it bears repeating: If you want to send a message, call Western Union.
Never before have I seen assembled into one movie so many humongously breasted women.
I read somewhere that Kull, before its release, was edited countless times from a new director.
Would definitely recommend...especially to anyone who has lived in a big city before!  
For a starter he resurrects the boss-witch who passes through some great metamorphoses before wisely settling on the form of Tia Carrera.
I am a firm believer in watching an entire movie before you render an opinion.
Before I even start I have to tell you that I had to stop watching the movie before it was over because it was THAT terrible.
But Connecticut suburbs, brand new Volvos, and gargantuan supermarkets can only take a movie so far before dysfunctions on a Todd Solondz-type level can push it further.
"Last of the Dragons" died, he reveals a gift to Bowen before he dies, a dragon egg.
Well, surely a misunderstanding such as this calls for ample chase scenes, as Schlatter tries to prove his innocence, especially with a cold cop breathing down his neck and giving him a deadline, basically, before he hauls him into jail, his patience wearing thin.
The only reason I kept watching was that I ate dinner late and I needed to let it digest before going to bed.
But what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:  - the death of Poppaea and St Paul's talk with Nero at her dead body,   - Claudius' mention of the current conquest of Britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife much before his death),   - Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother,   - Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators,   - finally, Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by Acte "Let us forgive him"  All in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the Roman Empire.
"Ten years later," the story resumes just before the assassination of Caligula.
Just before the film goes forward in time about ten years I myself was expecting the credits to appear.
after watching this movie i tried to find a way to get in touch with the director to sling some abuse , no other movie has driven me to that point before don't watch it unless your video store has a ' didn't like it?
I watched this movie with my two young nephews (8 and 11 years old) and it very nearly put all of us to sleep on a Friday night before the sun went down (8pm).
Produced, inexplicably, by Zanuck/Brown (a year before they hit pay dirt with JAWS).
I didn't have much time for jim sheridan before i saw this movie, after seeing it i had none.
I'd never thought particularly highly of jim sheridan before seeing this but after seeing it i thought even less.
Four stars for effort, but it's a pity that more time wasn't spent tightening up the story before production got underway.
This film presents an explanation and a verdict before the smoke has even cleared, and it stirs up sentiment that will not help end the conflict in Iraq.
The film describes an endless series of falsehoods before it even reaches the half way point in its run time.
Broomfield even chooses to sensationalize it more by showing moments before that the man had the shovel to plant a tree at a celebratory party, making the scene all the more despicable to include in the film.
But I'll watch the real Beales of East Hampton a dozen times again before I sit through this travesty a second time.
Never was I let down this much before!
Only interesting as a curio from the era before "Friday the 13th."
Tricks never before seen, tricks of a gruesome violent nature.
Naturally, I had seen it before, but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept (yet still revolting) gore effects.
The story is absolutely predictable and done like 1000 times before, the plot is boring and lame as hell, the subplots for each character are so boring, depressive, and badly explored,that i don't think any actor could do any better with such bad material to work on, the dialogues are lame and foolish, etc.
The actors must not have shown up for the filming of this movie, and been replaced by extras who had never acted before.
An honest attempt at doing the same thing millions of movies have done before.
Although the picture and sound is good for being produced for a B-horror film, the rest of it is poor acting and scenes you've seen in at least 50 movies before.
Everything in Camp Slaughter has not only been done before, it has been done much much better before.
However, Sean Connery decides that he will grant the young O'Keefe one more year to live his life before he will chop off his head.
To someone watching this movie, who has not read these works before may not be as...repulsed...by it as one who has.However, even someone with no knowledge of the texts will still not enjoy this movie.Really the only good thing about it is Sean Connery.
However, it completely fails on the lack of acting ability of Miles O'Keefe, who did a lot of movies of the fantasy variety before being consigned to Direct to DVD Perdition.
on Wednesday (two days before the release) and i was really looking forward to this one.
4) At one point, this guy (yeah...i didn't care enough to remember his name) has 20 baying dogs on him as he rushes to the car, yet, finds time to take his jacket off (an attack PROTECTION jacket) before he gets in the car?
*Sighs*  8) They know the dogs can break into there house, as they had done before.
But before that it was simply s**t.
All horror movies of the same Hollywood cash-in repetition should, but like many before it this had a theatrical release.
The thing is that you know what's going to happen a few minutes before the characters do.
As for the rest of it, nothing we haven't heard before from various members of the pretenders to the documentary throne.
This film has been made before at least twice, so come up with an original concept for once- instead of remaking Republican propaganda that discredits Moore.
I will think twice before snapping up any more gimmicky films from bargain bins...
If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie.
Even in a film like Scarface, there is a period where Al Pacino's character is likable as he begins his climb up before the inevitable fall.
The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her.
I watched Flandres before and thought it was pretty pretentious and halfhearted in his artsy approach but I could watch it... quite the opposite to Twentynine Palms which I could hardly watch without staring at the fast forward button of my remote control.
A desert ecosystem is a fragile one and, like a human life, can only take so much abuse before it is destroyed.
But when she saves his life and he responds by assaulting and brutally killing her before killing himself, we are left with even less than we had before, which is a big fat zero.
Seen it all before.
: Been done much better before.
I also disliked Ophuls La Ronde, made three years before this film.
Eventually he hooks up with Joe Carioca and Panchito and they sing the title song before the film turns into a song filled series of travel stops.
Technical inaccuracies, historical inaccuracies, inept special effects -- there are so many things here to compete with the film's sophomoric script in motivating the viewer to hit the "eject" button long before the actual end.
Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly "obliviates" the entirety of Paris.
Everyone except the lead actress whom I mentioned before.
What I remember most about GANGSTER NO 1 on its initial release was the critics mentioning the amount of violence shown ( Channel 4 also pointed out the "disturbing" content before the broadcast last night ) but I don`t really see what the problem is .
The people who have a problem with this movie are the same people who have a problem with porn movies , honestly you`d think they`d never seen nine people in love before  !!!!!
Using her amazing strength, Supergirl frees herself from the demon and using her super-speed, Supergirl circles Selena and the wind she creates lifts Selena before the demon; Supergirl summons her inner strength to turn the tables and make the demon eat witch.
Kara has helped lose it, so she must reclaim it before everyone in her city presumably dies.
In few scenes this enormous ham female falls in ridicule ruinously: when Dunaway prepares the spell-love potion with a spider and a walnut she's really embarrassing or when tries to seduce Etahn painfully or still in the final battle when she screams clumsily before to become feeding for the monster.
An FBI agent they want dead is fed to a shark, but pulled back up before dead, put into a bag and left back at home to die?
The one judge x's everybody before they start and then when the other two don't because they want to give the talent at least a chance to perform, he reaches over and x's their buttons for them stopping the talent.
In fact, with two of them, she was actually shaking her head NO before saying yes.
Had the cinematographer ever SEEN a movie before?
How come I didn't think of that before!?...")
But "nobody's ever died from taking 'shrooms before," she's reassured, thus guaranteeing they'll be squealing like stuck piglets before the 90 minutes is up.
Ireland is a land where schoolgirls riverdance in circles - and that's before our tourists are barely through passport control.
Meanwhile, Tara's witnessing their grisly deaths before they happen - or is she?
I had seen the poster for this film, but I didn't really think about critics opinions or anything before I watched it, maybe I should of.
In the end, which many will see before it comes, is a very lame and empty conclusion.
I just thought from that point on i'd seen it all before.
I assume that a second or third write was never thought of before filming and that nobody thought to expand on the story a bit.
If you took a sip of your Irish coffee every time someone in this movie said "shrooms," you'd be dead before the first jump scare.
Never have left comment here but feel compelled to warn you all before wasting your money in cinema - AVOID!
this movie was the first ever i saw at the drive-in and even if i was 7 years old , it was an exceptionable film.even if it is an 80's,you have to look further than special effects to like or love this movie.the acting is simple , so is the storyline , if you saw the first one , and the fight scenes are human.it's the best of the film of the duo,and no one should destroy them before seeing the rest.you have to accept the fact of the budget they had and also the music in wave at the time.the in sync of the fight was a choreography to make ballet cheap.and do not forget that it was shot in Italian first,they had to transcript all of the scenario.i just think it was a gem.
Since childhood I've found the actors playing the bad guys more interesting than the main characters,at least till about 1970 or so.Many that I viewed in the 1950's didn't last long in a movie or TV program because they were an early victim to the star.Some eventually went on to make names for their selves but for the most part I liked them more when playing minor roles.Some of those minor role villains are in this movie and I found them very entertaining.There's Neville Brand playing King Fisher,a good performer but sometimes a little bit to scary even for me when dealing out punishment.Others like Faro (Lee Van Cleef),Sundown Whipple(John Doucette) and Blackburn(Claude Akins) are in top menacing form.While not a household name another quality performer is Robert Middleton playing Ben Ryerson.Whether playing a politician or a mob boss he gives a quality performance.In this movie he's a bit grubby looking but handy with both a gun and a knife.Then there's Willie (Elisha Cook Jr) one of Fisher's men.He usually bursts into a room big eyed bearing news but has to grab a quick drink before speaking.So much to my delight the cast includes a rouge's gallery of personal favorites,almost like a dream come true.For those who like the good guys the movie leans more towards a nightmare.Jack Palance plays Jacob Wade the main character.As usual he has the look of a strong tough looking man.His performance is better than usual but that just means it's not as stiff as usual.The story lacks a bit of direction also.Those two points are forgotten because of Anthony Perkins who plays Jacob Wade's son Riley.His part lacks direction or maybe a director as it seems like he or someone else wants to sabotage this movie.First off he's too old and big to be playing the part of the son.When he does show some sign of a emotion it's fitting more for someone at least 10 years younger than him.To the simple statement that his mother(deceased) was a fine woman he responds blandly"talk about my mother again and I'll kill you",really off the wall.Elaine Aiken gives a good performance and is nice looking.In another comment it was basically said her character with it's good qualities has no reason to be interested romantically in the wimpy Perkins character,that's hitting the nail on the head.So this movie was just about what I expected,the minor roles out shining the main characters.One of the main characters looked like a good friend must of gave them the part.
It kept my interest in a most peculiar way, and it took me nearly to the end of the picture before I figured it out.
When I was a kid, I used to get my dad to rent it every single week (in the days before you could buy it).
I had never seen him before in a movie or anything so I was suprised with his performance as well.
So, I watched this and then came to IMDb, only to be surprised how many comments (18 before me) it had.
Sure, the setting, dialog and some scenes may be different than in the previous or following iterations of this plot, but the *core* has been used before.
And look at his CV: he already had done ten roles before his first BH2010 episode aired on 4 October 1990.
However it all ends in a laughably horrible ending that (almost) destroys everything that went before.
This movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before Belushi died.
It comes before his great films 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' and 'Hable Con Ella', both more mature than his earlier films, and this film is the beginning of the grown-up AlmodÃ³var.
For example when Kim Novak was preparing dinner and she had salad and lemonade all sitting there before her family was home.
But before he arrives, Bharati runs away leaving a suicide note.
Adapting three stories from his 1967 collection "The Season To Be Wary", Serling came up with a thoroughly engaging anthology film that combined morality, melodrama, suspense, and the supernatural into a stunning brew not seen on television before.
Segment 2, "Eyes", stars Joan Crawford as a ruthless, imperious blind woman who blackmails a prominent surgeon (Barry Sullivan) into giving her an ocular transplant so that she may enjoy roughly twelve hours of sight before going blind again.
Then Young heads to the precinct for the graveyard shift, riding in a prowl car with a new partner he's never met before (Chill Wills, who also plays the unseen `Voice of the City').
In his earlier days, going way back to "Candid Microphone" before TV, the emphasis was always on human interaction.
Ronald Reagan before he left for even greener pastures said that the two best friends he made at Warner Brothers were Pat O'Brien and Dick Powell.
I have been there before myself.
Only caught a few episodes before it suddenly ended... what I did see I found intriguing and very moving at times.
Also this is the first Goku villain that's held a grudge against Goku before they meet either on TV or movie.
Her husband, Jack, is an artifacts dealer whom she met by happenstance years before.
The theme of this story has been done before, but thanks to a fine performance by John Heard, the character of Jack Saunders is intriguing and foreboding.
The storyline, as mentioned before, is fairly straightforward (and admittedly clichÃ©d at times), but thankfully this doesn't sidetrack from its unique charm, especially as the narrative progresses from a bogstandard battle of Good vs Evil into something else entirely, which I won't describe in great detail lest I completely ruin the surprise for you - however, I will say this: the ending itself is one of the most awe-inspiring things I have ever seen.
It moves along at a nice pace, it has some nice twists & turns while it's one of those films which really comes together during the final 10 minutes when the truth is finally revealed, it may not come as the biggest shock in the cinematic world but it's effective, satisfying, you'll be thinking about it whether you liked it or not & it ties up everything that has gone before really well.
It derailed a possible franchise before it even got started.
The Tiger Claw must find out what the Kilrathi plans are and delay them before they can jump into the Sol-system.
I had since Freddie Prinze Jr try to act before, and wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of his, so I was slightly weary as to whether or not this film would be any good.
I wasn't familiar with this actor before but he is amazing.
The place is Germany and the time is before the turn of the century.
An Interesting take on plot thats been done so many times before, but never quite like this.
The story in itself is something unique and untouched before-- an illness that drives people to suicide, the only cure being sound... Acting by Asano Tadanobu only makes the film more stunning-- he plays his usual disconnected and silent character, but it was very effective in this film, maybe more so than in his other works.
It is when Rory suffers a near-fatal heart attack that the film really gets it's biggest interest (although there are moments of good chat before), and all characters are brought together to rediscover themselves.
If I hadn't seen it the day before, she would tell me every detail about it, and vice versa.
MYESTERIOUS ISLAND, more like JOKE ISLAND there is no excuse for such poor special effects in this day and age it was very poor quality total rubbish, so unbelievable, the animals were a joke, i was expecting it to be quite good with it being a modern film, and a pretty good cast, the scenery is beautiful, but totally spoilt by the poor effects, look out for the cast away guy he has a hair cut and his hair appear blond were,as it was dark brown before, and the crow was pathetic, i have seen better effects in movies from the 70s, over all it was a very disappointing film wish i had not bothered, i can not rate it more than 1 point totally laughable
One group of pirates provide the opening scene of the film, before cutting to the Confederate prison in Virginia.
Either they were wondering whether Stewart had lost his marbles or they were filmed in a completely different studio way before Nemo's lines went into the can.
Besides all that, I will be perfectly happy to live out the rest of my life and never again see a movie in which someone washes up onto a beach, sleeping soundly, and then coughs once or twice before getting up to go exploring.
d)The door key magically appeared in Martin's pockets some time before, because he won't let us know who gave it to him, and if we knew it, that would mean that someone else knew about the existence of the hole, and that would have made it too complex for the writers.
Like, I said before, this episode is full of nostalgia and most of the main recurring characters are brought in for a (seemingly) last hurrah.
It especially hit when they began talking about having seen the toxic blood before as if it were old news and Scully explains it to Billy.
If the joke was lame it was rendered even lamer still by the fact the camera isn't locked on the actors close enough before the joke was revealed , we knew they were sitting on a park bench long before the punch line !
Maybe I shouldn't be too hard since Bill Forsyth has made a successful guerilla film , but I should point out to people reading this page before seeing the movie that Bill Forsyth is a very idiosyncratic film maker whose movies lack a universal appeal , that's probably why we hear so little from him these days
I have no idea if it has aged well or not because I haven't seen it in over 20 years but I will say this in it's favour/defence, "That Sinking Feeling" gave Glasgow a voice and a character that's rarely been heard before nor since!
This was made WAY before "Dead Calm," another favorite of mine, but in "Overboard" fate is the villain.
It is especially fulfilling because it was made before American movies became dominated by crass taste, coarse language, and adolescent mindsets.
I used to pretend I was Princess Malta every night before I went to bed.
The countries which have access to nuclear missiles combine forces in order to save the world, before thousands of asteroids will hit the earth....
Now, in my defense, before i go on, i have to say that on the night in question (last night,) I was at home alone in my small room suffering a cold and had a small fever.
I saw this on Showtime, just before the 147th showing of Spidergirl.
All pure stereotype and nothing we haven't seen better before by real documentaries.
I would make statements about the cinematography, but since it mostly consists of one person standing before the camera and speaking, there really aren't any opportunities to be creative in this department.
It opened your eyes to a side of prostitution you never seen before.
The Hole can be seen as a parable about how far some may go to get what they want, as well as how far co-conspirators may go before they try to divorce themselves from events gone wrong (there are clues throughout the film that other characters had various levels of knowledge and involvement).
Although the movie's plot has been done before (lets face it, nothing is ever going to live up to The Exorcist), Scott's own love for the horror genre makes this movie just fun.
We rented this movie because we were looking for something scary to watch, I had seen The Exorcist before so this movie looked like it would work.
But before long the plot starts to unravel until, by the time we get to the climax, it is effectively meaningless.
I didn't think the movie would be so good from the beginning, in fact to be honest, there's quite a poor start to it, and I suspect many would switch off before it gets going.
To begin with, Spanish Horror cinema is one before and after this movie.
The world never looked this dark before the Apocalypsis.
I had never heard of this before, I didn't read reviews or thoughts or anything about this movie and I didn't even read the small texts on the cover of the box...This could have gone very wrong but instead of that it became 100 minutes of pure fun.
Like I said before, this film contains a lot of humor but it never spoofs the genre.
With the aid of metal-head Jose Maria(played by Santiago Segura) and the fake psychic Professor Cavas(played superbly by Armando De Razza), he goes on his quest to kill the baby before the anti-Christ's reign begins.
It does not take long before said beast/weapon is awaken and then all hell brakes loose.
The time is 1938 London before the World War.
When I watch a film I haven't seen before, I try to keep an open mind.
Having been enthralled by the magic that is "Casablanca" some years before, I had been seeking out other films like it made by Warner Bros. in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s.
I am so glad that I read one of the comment before i rented this movie.
In doing some searching I learned that these films were preceded by a Jimmy Allen radio series, but I had not heard of that, either, before now.
In the boys deception they have had to leave it furnished just as it had been before their taking possession from the very gay prior tenants.
Made slightly before the Gay Liberation movement, this film gives a surprisingly sensitive view of the gay lifestyle and gay community of this era.
Its also the sort of film that you've seen variations on before.
It has been done before.
With how much he has done before this, it's a shame it didn't happen sooner.
The idea of a soul being sold to the devil and then being forced to do the devils dirty deeds has been seen before but not like this.
I gave it seven painful 40 minute viewings before I decided to call it quits on this show.
He then finds out the hard way that his parents sold his soul to the devil before was even born.
Legend talks about a big surf, so powerful that it'll wipe everything before it clean.
Later they escape and before they go home they ask one request of one of their friends (a young Freddy Kruegger) who has now become their commanding officer- will you surf before we go home.
Oh yeah before I forget the film also can 'boast' (and I use the term loosely) a forgettable cameo by Mr. Super-Size Me Morgan Spurlock, in a role so atrociously acted that one of the people from the group of individuals that he made fun of during a college lecture can act circles act circles around (no I'm not going to use the term he did, you have the internet, look it up)   My Grade: D
Perhaps the greatest two scenes in the beginning come when Bear is making the "Big Wave board" and speaking of the day when "a swell so big will wipe everything that came before it".
Be on the lookout for Melanie Mayron as Dixie, before she went from frump to vixen.
I wish Sidney J. Furie, the director, should of done more background information about both Hollywood legends before trying to make a film about them.
Struggling in the mid-seventies just before the blockbuster era settled in, Hollywood looked back to its history for material, and this was one of the results.
4) In real life Gable and Lombard had worked together years before their affair started.
With the help of a girl who lives next door, Ben uncovers old skeletons in the family closet and a tragedy that occurred many years before.
"Blaxplo" fans have seen stuff like this before, but there are plenty of rough guts to chew on in this action drama where the ghetto is no place to hide or escape from.
I was not familiar with this movie before I stumbled upon it in my local independent video store.
Not only are they in a race to get their hands on the three men before the mafia does, but also confronting their own personal plight.
This is the type of junk you've seen six dozen of times before already, and every single one of them was better and less insulting to your intellect.
officers that scramble to nab the trio before Mafia kingpin Anthony Franciosa can lay his hands on them with help of local black hoodlums.
Harris wipes a black cop and a white cop with bursts of machine gun fire before the villains can extract themselves from their predicament.
"Across 110th Street" is all about paying the consequences for your actions and everybodyÂbut Lt. PopeÂhas to pay the price before this riveting law & order opus is over.
At the same time, Pope and Matelli are looking for the same three men and trying to get to them before D'Salvo does.
Unlike any movie before,I rooted for every character depicted.
Not a typical black cop/ white cop movie this breaks rules and has scenes Ive never seen before... you cant do better than this flick.great theme song too which was re-done and updated again by the original composer Bobby Womack for Jackie Brown.check it out!You wont be dissapointed....
The two lead characters try to solve this thing before it is too late, since the mafia is willing to use violent ways in order to get its money back..This is a premise for this classic film.
The violence despite being brutal in mental way, is very strong physically, too, as the mafia tortures people without remorse in order to reach its target, but also they should have finished before it became too late.
The basic final sequence has been done many times before, but the way Resnais directed it put it in a class above the rest.
Overlooked in this hairy situation was the fact that Robert Taylor got a very fine role for himself as a boxer determined to make a quick buck and get out as fast as possible before becoming a punch drunk rummy.
When the owl saw his family @ radio station G-O-N-G, the father had a change of heart, just before Jack Bunny's about to gong him off!
I didn't realize it was Butch from the Little Rascals before!
THE GORILLA was a Broadway "Murder Mystery" from the 1920s that had been made into a film once or twice before.
I had never seen the Ritz brothers before.
She starts to piece together the puzzle and must stop him before he claims her life next.
The episode I inflicted on myself featured a lacklustre plot about a vengeful motorist in a Batmobile, and I only managed half of it before falling asleep (literally, not figuratively).
In the slum in Morro da Sinuca, a couple of days before turning eighteen year-old, Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) tells his best friend and also orphan Acerola (Douglas Silva) that he misses his unknown father.
Now, personally, I recommend you watch the TV series before watching the movie due to many flashbacks throughout the film.
I thought Thomson must have been a fisherman before turning to acting.
Don't turn your television off before the end!
When I read these reviews I try to find someone who appears to have a similar outlook to myself and then predict if I will like the film or not before I go to see it.
When I first heard about this, I was intrigued, I had been interested in the Titanic long before the movie came out and underwater exploration of the shipwreck had always been fascinating to me.
All in all, this was good and showed some stuff I haven't seen before, but if you really want to see better footage of the shipwreck inside and out I'd recommend other documentaries that are in the same line as this one.
The story of Titanic is one that has fascinated me for many years,so this was a must see for me.The idea of getting never before seen looks inside this long ago lost mother of all luxury liners was very exciting indeed.This film is not for the average movie goer,it is for people like me who could sit for hours and watch footage of underwater ship wreckage and never get bored.Upon looking at the new footage,it brings back the excitement I remember feeling upon learning of the ship being found in 1985.My only regret is that I did not live the 3D experience of this film in the theater.Unlike other certain documentaries with their political agendas and made by that certain guy from Flint,Michigan,this one you can watch and not get angry,providing you are interested in the subject matter.A good film.
At one point the viewer is staring up front at a bathroom mirror with water jug and glass eerily standing exactly where the stateroom's occupant left it before the collision.
They go into parts of the ship never seen before so it was very good.
It's obvious they wanted to try something different for the Columbo series, as they tried numerous times before and after this movie as well.
The movie was too fast paced,not much in the way of a plot that hasn't been done before & the actors could not act to save their lives for an exception of Kelsey & even he couldn't save this picture.
The premise of the Ball-Arnaz marriage and the "I Love Lucy" program, that opposites attract and can have a happy marriage, was a new idea in the pre-civil rights era (before 1961).
and these " Western Brotherhood " guys confirm this by stating they're like the old pioneers before America became a god forsaken melting pot , so what are they doing hanging around with a black crimelord ?
(BTW: I missed something before: Reggie was in his cell alone and singing to his James Brown tape.
It's also another spin for Hill on the dying embers of the West, with a motorbike gang (I sense this was first drafted in the 70s) proclaiming themselves the last true outlaws and bastions of freedom before offing some random cops and entangling themselves with Nick Nolte and his amazing never-ending revolver (I count 11 shots in the final barrage of bullets into the bad guy alone).
And if you don't like, wonder how far sequelitis had worked before we ended up with Beverley Hills Cop 3 or Lethal Weapon 3 and thank whatever you worship that we never got a 48hrs squared.
I have to admit this film has a 'Have I met you before' feeling to it.
In the early scene at the car-wreck site, the woman riding with Duvall, Anne Carter Cash, born 2 years before Duvall, appeared to be his wife.
(SPOILER COMING) Even when he is about to be arrested for the murder of his wife's lover, we still have to put up with 20 minutes of preaching and singing and shouting and praising the Lord before the police can finally lead him away.
I don't recall him playing a more believable character ever before.
Thankfully, it's only a film and it ends before the collection plate comes your way.
Story points introduced early on and developed before half way give the film a strong feel of The Fugitive, the TV series - laid back, story based but with the undercurrent of "a ticking bomb under the table" (Alfred Hitchcock).
Hopefully this will be on DVD before some Hollywood clown remakes this with tons of computer effects crap and ruins the whole thing.
They try anyhow and crash land a bit later, at a rather extreme "flying circus" just as some of them actually were at the time, with flyer's who lived passed their expected time and definitely are ready to die for the glory...  Before they landed, did the spot a HUGE air ship in a cloud and that valuable information, plus the fact that they happen to shoot down a very impressive Gotha Bomber (forgot that part) just before they saw the girls...
Dolores Del Rio is hopelessly miscast as an island girl who falls for Joel McCrea, the seaman who virtually rapes her before jumping ship.
In the most significant period of sexual liberation before the 1960s, and still in an era where plucking a bride from a primitive culture did not seem a bit dodgy, a picture like Bird of Paradise could exist.
Bird of Paradise also includes a couple of "before they were famous" curios.
Oh, and there's one more curio, in that you several times clearly hear the Hawaiian word "wiki", nearly seventy years before anyone thought of joining it to "pedia".
The film is kind of a mess for its first half before finally finding somewhere to go.
Sure I spent a good hour hating the film but in its second half it pulls together for a bit before its overly anti climactic ending and there are some good moments.
Actually nothing to say would make you understand how great this movie is and you don't even need to read the reviews before you watch it, All you need to do right now is to watch it because seeing this movie is a MUST.
Alternating one with the other, we experience what they do upon each meeting or journey, hearing their thoughts as they anticipate the next rendezvous, knowing how the one feels before seeing what the other felt at the exact same time.
Their will to move forward and enjoy every minute they have with each other before Henry's impending fate.
Thus it's no surprise that he's a bit of a mess when, working his Chicago job as a research librarian, he's approached by Clare Abshire, a woman he's never seen before, who professes that she's been in love with him for decades Â and that it's been mutual.
Such is the case of  the scene in which the bedridden Collin is escorted outside of  his house and his eyes open to see spread before him his  mother's beautiful garden.
I can only imagine the discipline it must have taken to wait for the sun to peep out from the clouds and then roll film hoping that the cast can pull off the shot before the light changed and a second take became a long wait.
I was a little tired before going to this film and got myself awake early in the film and watched it.
These movie is great for both fans and people who have never played the game before and hopefully you'll enjoy the movie as much as I do.
Now the remaining survivors must fight their way back out of The Hive before the door seals permanently... and at the same time they must contain the virus before it reaches the surface.
Personally, I think the game series is awesome, and I can't believe that I had never played it before, but I thank Anderson for making this movie and bringing this series to my attention.
It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them.
Some of the actors seem to be playing their parts in a trance, as if hypnotized before shooting, like the cast of Herzog's Heart of Glass.
In another scene where this mobster is talking to his girlfriend (just before he kills her!
Just before they're shot, all the actors look like you do when you're going to pop a balloon, stiff and all, cus you know the bang is coming.
One of the urban gangster killers then actually slings his M-16 before hopping off the backyard deck.
The film is at its best before the group joins the rebel force as the story seems better developed during this stage of the film while the part with them being in the rebel group seems rushed.
I had never heard of Venus Wars before and I think it's a shame that the flick hasn't got more recognition, because it really is one good film.
This is how they should treat all movies before transferring them to DVD.  
So they just started their honeymoons and the first wives stopped it before the honeymoon night.
This was before "Move Over Darling".
Monroe died before the movie was completed and it was canned.
We've been down this road before in movies, but let's remember that when MacMurray shows up alive, her marriage to Douglas no longer legally exists.
It is a one joke film that tires way before its 84 minutes are up.
Businessman's wife, widowed for one year before marrying her deceased husband's best friend, finds out her first husband is still alive; he was believed by the Coast Guard to have drowned after the sinking of his ship, but instead was rescued off an island.
For example, no town, no matter HOW corrupt, would have crooked judges who issue release orders (writs of habeas corpus) the second the crime is committed or before the person is even charged--especially when it appears they will be up on murder charges!!
Idealizing the mafia before the Godfather was even thought of.
This is also the perfect DVD to show to somebody who has never seen Kathy before!
If you wish to hear about Brook Shields mom, getting drunk at her daughters weeding, groping Kathy, molesting Kathys husband before calling the grooms mother "a really nasty word" then this is the DVD for you.
In total there are eight levels to conquer before you can fight the master mind Dr. Wily.
Or at least saved up a little bit more material before having another go.
After a brief but fruitless protest, the tribe chooses to avoid a violent confrontation and regretfully departs, but not before the nefarious settlers claim Silver Eagle's young maiden as their own.
You could easily tell when a joke was coming seconds before it happened and most of the time you could probably predict exactly what it was going to be.
It should be noted that before seeing the movie, I hadn't seen the trailer or any of the TV spots, my friend informed me afterword that both these scenes were shown in them.
I think Kayla should change her hairstyle, it was better before.
As I said before, I was VERY surprised by this movie.
I studied Latin in High School, but have never heard it spoken on screen before.
It takes a good twenty minutes before anything that happens really becomes clear.
Worse is when, at the end, a bit of voice-over repeats what a character stated less than a minute before hand, showing indeed one of those pesky and annoying horror movie motifs where apparently the director or producer or maybe the studio or something decided that the audience wasn't intelligent enough to get the point (plus, it leads the way to a possible sequel, which is predictable).
Or that he later hammers a hole in his forehead before tearing off his face and growing a third eye?
This seems like a studio afterthought, tacked on gracelessly before an otherwise inspired and fast-moving siege flick.
Occasionally I'll sneak a peak (when they brought back Frankie) but I am unable to watch more than a few minutes before I get disgusted/angry.
But there is a very funny twist at the end before tragedy strikes.
He leaves the plane before it takes off and he abandons her.
The need to develop trust and comfort before completely letting go.
I've never seen so many broken, sad and confused characters in one film before... And the interplay between them is moving and captivating...  Be warned however...
These filmmakers did just that, spending months with the girls in Troop 1500 before even turning on a camera.
He gets them all on the phone at the same time, thus allowing them to tell their horror stories one by one before sticking it to him.
Georgia Larisson (Lana Turner) was likewise plucked from obscurity, rescued from a lifetime of self-loathing sex and alcoholism, before being abandoned in her moment of triumph.
Douglas shakes her out of her lifelong funk by dumping her in the swimming pool and coaxing a magnificent performance out of her before dumping her for some bit-playing whore.
We knew John Aniston before he was Jennifer Aniston's father as Victor Kiriakis.
Ironically, they all went to a secret island somewhere like Lost long before that show came on the air.
The year before this, he played one of the most misanthropic characters ever to grace the silver screen in "Ace in the Hole."
And don't just dismiss me before you've actually seen the two.
Hurt feelings and gnashing of teeth to follow but not before the Turner character has a career again, the Sullivan character has a resume, the Pidgeon character is awash in black ink and the Powell character has banked thousands of relative easy dollars and accumulated enough first-hand material for a blockbuster on Hollywood Babylon.
Jonathan quickly forgets the friendship Fred and his wife showed him before becoming a big producer.
When we first watched this film, it seemed much better, than on this viewing where a lot of things surface to make some of the story much weaker than before.
But before he can carry out his mission, he mistakenly drinks from the "waters of forgetfulness" and is taken prisoner by Queen Omphale.
I was drawn into Days in Dec. '06 when Chelsea was treating Nick horribly - just before he turned into 'The Lonely Splicer'.
Eventually, I recognized Steve from an episode of The Nanny (as I'd never watched ANY soaps before this...) Then I followed religiously the Shawn and Belle escape from Phillip (who I couldn't stand at the time) and Sami and Lucas's wedding triangle.
Aside from that, as a film, it gets a little too didactic towards the end (it was more emotionally involving before his conversion than after); however, Raul Julia's performance is superb.
EXTRAS: The tape contains a trailer for Mr. Write (1994) before the movie starts.
This was a few years before Mr. Blanjs struck gold with the Tai-Bo gimmick and no longer needed to play in these cheesy films.
It has a beautiful innocence to it in this tale of the early days of the Finzi-Continis family before WWII.
Slowly but surely the Jews of Italy have their freedom taken away from them; before they know what's happening they're headed for Auschwitz.
She represents a snapshot in time, a personification of Europe before things went bad.
This was probably Vittorio DeSica's last excellent film before his death in 1974 and it took me about 20 years to view it a second time.
Basically the whole series is based on Gus capturing Booth, before the FBI can get Gus.
Anyone who watches TV with any frequency, has seen it all before.
He saw it happen, and had time to report it by telephone before he was overwhelmed by the escaping gases or falling rocks.
The point of the film cannot be to show how two contrary characters complement each other, as Andersson was even more happy with von Sydow before and because it's all told in such a detached manner.
Soon they fall in love, but are separated, the sort of usual machinations with an infidelity story begin to unfold, and yet not losing the emotions from before.
I saw this film in the 70's (on PBS i believe) and remember laughing out loud at the unlikely inventions offered up with earnestness and enthusiasm by their slightly delusional inventors(before watching them go wrong, horribly wrong).
So many of the people in this film should have tried their inventions out before calling the newspaper out to film them.
I was in love with Jennifer Connely long before this movie, but this movie made her go to my top 5 beautiful woman of all time list.
Add to that the fact this will remind you of how hot Jennifer Connelly used to be before she got all stick figure on us in her adulthood.
Hollywood had never seen the likes of Jennifer Connelly before.
Then he leaves town with Jennifer's character, but not before he stops in town to show off the woman he's leaving with.
It was before she had dieted down to where she now has two pool cues for legs.
As I watched the thought provoking opening sequence of Limbo I knew I was about to watch a film the likes of which I'd never seen before.
Dracula realizes the sun is about to rise and he makes a fruity run to his castle... but before he can even make it to the door, he's fried by daylight right on his welcome mat!
That said, the film contrives to dispatch its two horror stars well before the end (Naishâs is undoubtedly among the clumsiest ever devised) to make way for the âfireworksâ promised by the titular bout (which was too dark on the print I watched anyway!)
That's because both J. Carrol Naish and Lon Chaney, Jr. both starred in this film shortly before their deaths.
Much fun has been made of the numerous permutations that Dracula vs. Frankenstein and other Independent International pictures went through before reaching the big screen; instead, Sherman and Adamson should be applauded for their dedication and persistence in sticking with these films and working on them until they got them right.
Not that it's very important or very life-changing, but it shows early Hollywood and its naive look at life, before they made movies with language and excess of everything unnecessary to movie-making.
I saw this movie several times, in another life (before WWII), with another title (Invitation To Dance)and in another world (Eastern Europe).
I've seen most of the main actors before, either on TV or on big screen.
Well, they did but before you were born.
I had looked forward to seeing 'A Clockwork Orange' for a long time before my opportunity to see it came.
Never before I felt such high adrenaline rush for watching a movie.
I haven't read the novel that this film is based upon, and I didn't know that much about it before I sat down to see it.
He drives two days to the Army base in hopes of quelling the situation before it gets any worse.
The valley is said to be the spot where biblical boy David met Goliath and defeated him with a sling shot, where other warriors had fallen before.
After watching this at Santa Cruz CA's delightful Art Deco Del Mar Theater, my spouse and I drove home in silence, and poured a stiff drink before either of us could even begin deconstructing such an astonishing piece of cinema.
(Or were these guys sadists before they joined the army and got shipped to Iraq?)
The David of our hopes marched into Iraq, but the lengthening shadow of Goliath still stands before us.
Doesn't this film make one wonder if there were other youths sent before David to face the Giant at the Valley of Elah and who did die or become maimed without their stories revealed?
Tommy Lee Jones hands in a subdued yet internally complex performance the like I've never seen him do before.
The performance of Tommy Lee Jones could be the best of his career, he brings out a much more emotionally quiet side in Charlize Theron than we've before seen, the short performance of Susan Sarandon is particularly powerful, and all of the soldiers are played with a feeling of sincerity.
Its unlike anything i have ever seen before, and the soundtrack from Joe Hisaishi compliments the film perfectly.
But, despite their having fun while wasting away the hours, it's only a matter of time before the path of violence and death will escalate.
I'm not entirely sure what to make of this film--I suspect I need to view it at least once, and probably several more times before I can get a good hold on it.
Tony Shalhoub is a fabulous actor but in the charactor of Adrian Monk he has truly outdone himself, making Adrian come to life before our eyes.
So Kitano's gang arrive in Okinawa only to find that there is no such "deal" but instead his gang are steadily killed off leaving only himself and 3 other gang members and an abandoned young woman, whom he saves from a rape ordeal by her husband  They move to the coast well away from central Okinawa and wait for the troubles to calm down before considering returning to Tokyo.
There are few highlights - such as the Sumo scene, the firework fight and even the scene where Aya Kokumai removes her t-shirt in front of Kitano so that she is semi-nude before him.
Eventually the asterisk would be removed, but not before Maris' death some time later.
The Yankees were awesome that year, like I've never seen them before or since, not even the recent teams with Joe Torre as manager.
Maris had just emerged as a star the year before, winning the American League Most Valuable Player award in his Yankees debut, which followed three solid but unspectacular years with other Major League teams.
(Shortly before his death from cancer in 1995 at the age of 63, he acknowledged that he would have taken care of himself had he known that he was going to live so long.
It did occur to me early on that this whole film might be a mis-packaged spoof of all the bad films that went before, but no - they appear to have been serious in their attempt.
I believe I've now seen nearly all of the earlier episodes via reruns, but for some reason had never seen this initial episode before.
Â I've never been to a home-made funeral before.
The only positives I can say about this film is that it had beautiful Vermont scenery, and it was fun to see Shirley McLaine in her first movie, as well as Jerry Mathers before he made it big on "Leave it to Beaver"!
It's interesting that, at one point, Edmund mentioned that he might have elderberry wine before he was went over to Mildred N's and this was the drink that was used for poisoning in the other story.
Natwick's character (she says she's 42, but Natwick was about 55 at the time of release of the film) appears to have never had a sexual experience before, and now with this Captain, played by Gwen, who we learn has distorted his past accomplishment, love might come to these two people.
The charming performances help considerably starting with John Forsythe, long before his Aaron Spelling years on "Charlie's Angels" and "Dynasty", as Sam.
That is indeed six-year-old Jerry Mathers as Arnie a couple of years before starting his six-year run on "Leave It to Beaver".
I never knew the film was a comedy before I began watching, so you can imagine my surprise when one innocent character after the next stumbled upon a brutally murdered corpse and react in the very least expected ways possible.
Sure we have seen this all before in various movies but this film is lifted by Adam Baldwin who is more creepy and evil than one can possibly imagine and he certainly scared the hell outa me.
He is brought before the judge and he gives him attitude.
I've never seen him before, but I certainly will remember his energy and incredible footwork.
Her struggle is disturbing, and any woman who remembers the dark days before Roe v. Wade will feel her character's pain, fear, and especially her desperation.
Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
The film gets some details wrong - when Nagumo gets word that the first wave has sunk numerous US ships, he orders the launching of the second wave; in fact the second wave took off an hour before the first wave made contact with their targets.
Granted, this is nitpickery  The actual attack is presented in most of its entirety - some key scenes missing include early torpedo hits on Battleship Row and hits on the West Virginia before her skipper gives the order to counter-flood and stop her from capsizing.
I had the unfortunate experience of viewing the Prince & Me original movie just before the sequel, the Prince & Me 2.
there's nothing to be saved, they should just give up before they invest money and time in any more dumb ideas.
It appears the film was made on a shoestring budget, or else the film-makers could not wait another day till the Czech flags, displayed for national holiday or a prominent festival, were taken down before shooting city scenes.
Oh yeah, in the beginning, they will be all fairytale and lovey dovey and then of course, not to bore us out of our wits with boredom of their lovey dovey, everything is grand kind of thing, there will be somebody who wants the crown and tries to spoil it for the happy couple only weeks before the wedding.
Between Luke and Kam the attempt to convince us they were the Edward and Paige from before felt so forced that I just kept asking myself all through the movie why did they change Julia Stilles, who had done such a great job.
Eddie decides just before the wedding that he can't marry Kirstin.
But seriously, the research done before this film is hilarious.
When the original actors are not reused - the immediate thing that happens in my mind is comparing and trying to figure out if this character is really supposed to be the one I saw before - and realizing how different they are, and not in a good way....which takes away from the movie and its plot.
This, I think, is Reygadas biggest contribution: Never before a Mexican film has gone this far on the sex issue.
As for the sex, it was not as awful as some made it out to be - or perhaps reading the comments before watching made me expect much worse (that and I'm not fat phobic).
Also it again pairs Truffaut with actress Lafont, the two hadn't worked together since his and her first film 13 years before.
Since he had collaborated with Rosi before, it seemed logical he would portray Carlo Levi in the movies, something that he does with ease and elegance.
And suddenly all the way from the capture of Romasanta the pace quickens considerably and the movie is over before my curiosity on the Romasanta character is completely satisfied: Who was he?
Whatever it was that they were taking when they came up with Bee Movie, I suggest you have some before watching; it'll make the experience less painful.
Joining forces with DA Bastida(Bary Piquer)they are on the hunt to find him before more and more lives are taken by the wolf.
Romasanta comes clean before a court, that he is in fact a wolf who takes the guise of a man to seduce his victims, is he a wolf or just a psychotic killer?
As an actress her job is reflect reality and some of the people who turn to the military in rural small town America where often times jobs were hard to come by before the economic meltdown.
It will be a long, long time before your body loses all feeling, and everything goes dark.
Poole (Michael Pena) has suffered an embarrassing injury and is on his way to reconnecting with his fiancÃ©e before heading back overseas; and the also-injured Colee Dunn (Rachel McAdams) is on a mission to deliver a precious guitar to her deceased boyfriend's parents in Las Vegas.
I believe the lack of mystery with the lead character, i.e., the viewer knows who is the killer before watching the film, is the greatest flaw in this screenplay.
Universal, where series was shot, had never done TAPE before and all 'THE SUITS' would come to watch & see 'how is that done?'
This was an example of the expression "jumping the shark"--it was obvious it was all downhill for the show from then until its cancellation--and with crappy episodes without the original formula, it wasn't long before the show breathed its last.
In the very early 80s, a little while before Schwarzenegger/Stallone and a good while before Seagal/Van Damme, Chuck Norris enjoyed a period where he was pretty much the number one name in action movies.
Kristen makes a deal that if she can get one of the families back on the nice list then it will prove that there is hope for mankind and Santa won't quit, but she has to do this before midnight on Christmas Eve so she has to work fast.
'Romasanta' tells the chilling tale of Manuel Blanco Romasanta, known murderer of 15 people (although confessing to murdering many more) and how he charms women before killing them brutally like a wolf.
A series of brutal and bizarre killings takes place.When Mara witnesses one of the murders the black-gloved killer starts terrorizing her-she turns to her boyfriend Lukas for assistance.But will he be able to uncover the culprit before his girlfriend becomes the next victim?Antonio Bido's "Watch Me When I Kill" is an enjoyable giallo,albeit heavily influenced by Dario Argento's works,especially "Deep Red".The film is an above-average effort filled with enough suspense and shocks to satisfy fans of Italian horror.Surprisingly effective murder scenes are another reason to check this film out-in particular,the muder of Fernando Cerulli in a bathtub,set to opera music,would make Dario Argento proud.The performances are pretty good and it's nice to see Fulci's veteran Paolo Malco in one of the main roles.8 out of 10.
There are better versions of this film..... watch Vincent Price's version before you get bored with this one.
Fortunately I read the comments on here before viewing this movie and was therefore able to enjoy it purely as the giggle-fest that it is.
That piece is just unbelievably funny, but you have to see it before you know how funny it is.
It's a visual force unlike anything gone before.
And you will be doing this a lot, as the landscapes are are so stunningly rendered- natural beauty unlike anything you've seen before.
I had NEVER seen this before.
Now, before you all go and say 'Awwwww' I have to say that the story is dark and very gritty.
See it before you die or you just might not make it into gaming-heaven.
The first type presents some source whose story offers up a world or view of a world that we never had the privilege to see before.
It makes you laugh, cry, and pull your hair out, and doesn't give you time to catch your breath before starting this cycle all over again.
Watching Jon Stewart, Bill Clinton and other famous people work at the crossword somehow humanizes them in a way that I have honestly never seen before.
Even before we get on to human rights: by failing to appreciate the value of others, we devalue ourselves, whatever the gender.
So there is a good case to suspend traditional judgement and let the film speak in its own language before finalising your opinion.
I can definitely buy that it was cut to pieces in the editing room, because the characters don't even get onto the boat until about 30 minutes in - the time before that being taken up by about three different, and inconsequential subplots that fail (in my opinion) to enhance the story one bit.
There should be a warning before every showing of this film that you will experience deep anger, regret, fury, malice and a strong desire to harm the nearest person to you when you finish viewing this film.
Here's why:  Never before have I felt so misled by reviews from you-know-who (2 Thumbs Up?!)
One Apache isn't quite dead yet and shoots the man who picked Nora up from the stagecoach station before he succumbs.
I've watched it several times and I keep noticing things I have not seen before.
The rifle used was a Henry, long made before the recent import of Italian copies.
I had never heard of her before seeing this film, and am amazed that she wasn't more famous.
A dead man is found in their back yard, that they had seen while eating dinner the night before and the two start their own investigation as to who the man was and why is everyone being blackmailed.
By the way, the first scene is very grisly and cold-blooded, and you *know* it's gonna be a great movie when that happens even before the opening credits.
However, this movie has very little in common with Corman's other than the title, the fact that both movies are based on Poe's work, and that there's a scene towards the end where some unlucky b*stard tries to get free before the pendulum slices him in half.
I don't know enough to say if the concept is completely original, but it didn't remind me of anything I've seen or read before(I hear that at least one aspect is similar to Brazil, though).
It's surprising that nobody had this idea before.
It's strange he never played one before.
Being a slave for the rest of his life is an idea which Greg isn't too keen on so with the help of a rather good looking female slave named Delphine (Lea Brodie) who luckily for any male viewers wears a skimpy cleavage revealing dress & some of the local wildlife they decide to make a break for it, but will they be able to rescue Charles & make it back to the diving-bell before they are either eaten by some monster or killed by the Atlanteans?
Made before the onset of cgi effects, this film has an innocent, non-cynical feel.
"Analyze This" is a wickedly funny tale of where a tough, foul-mouthed New York mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) suddenly loses his mind and is persuaded by Jelly (Joe Viterelli), one of his two bodyguards to go see a shrink a few weeks before a big meeting.
This movie didn't try anything tremendously fancy or new, it took a lot of things we've seen before and turned out a movie that was more than the sum of its parts.
"Q" a strange man comes and lives with the family but before he injures the father by hitting him in the head with a large stone, who he later becomes friends with.
"Visitor Q" sat on my shelf for about a month before I gathered the gumption to put it in one night and I have to say, what they hell was I waiting for???
You're stuck there in the best seat in the house, centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "When the F*** is this film ever going to END???"
Call me over the shock-rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this.
Laugh, cry, let your stomach turn a little and feel like you've experienced something never before experienced.
Miike plays with multi point of views, particularly during the opening scene, in which the girl takes photographs of her father before they sleep together.
As a teenager scoring one success after another she was given pep pills to make her work harder and longer followed by sleeping pills so she could get some rest before the cycle repeated itself the next day.
Here they find a mother and daughter (the best actor in the film) the mother having tattoos that Victor notes "Never seen tattoo's like that before", possibly because they were drawn on with a marker.
You wonder how long the emergency services are going to wait before reacting.
David tries to escape to from this cult with the help of Libby and saves his friend before it's too late.
Interviewed shortly before his death, the writer Dennis Potter identified the three of his works he considered the best: his serials 'Pennies From Heaven' and 'The Singing Detective', and this short play, in which he addresses childhood (and the memories thereof) by casting adults to play their younger selves.
There's a great thematic consistency to all of Potter's writings, and it's easy in retrospect to see everything he wrote prior to 'The Singing Detective' as leading up to that masterpiece (he was shameless about self-plagiarism), a view which also explains the relative vacuity of his later work; and this means that watching 'Blue Remembered Hills' today, it doesn't quite have the impact that it may first have done, before elements present in it were reworked (together with elements from all his other dramas) in his landmark achievement.
Plus, the title characters, the seven mummies didn't make an appearance to like ten minutes before the end of the film.
En-route they find a gold medallion buried in the ground & an old Indian guy (Danny Trejo) claims that there is a town nearby which is stuffed with gold & they can use the medallion to find it, the escaped convicts need no invitation & before long their at the town which looks like something out of a John Wayne western.
Izabella Miko seems satisfied prancing around in her underwear without any regard to what is actually unfolding before her eyes.
My kids asked many questions about J.T's world after the movie; it showed them a slice of life that they had never before seen.
I remembered the main points though, the little boy who lived with his mother, nursing a homeless cat back to health in an abandoned building before and after school, the tragedy that happens, the saddest moment on TV since the Martins forced Timmy to give up Lassie to move to Australia in "Timmy and Lassie", (both of these tug at the heart strings and bring a tear to the eye) and the 'turn around' happy ending.
(Ja'net DuBois went on to play Willona Woods on "Good Times," Theresa Merritt starred with Clifton Davis in "That's My Mama" and starred on Broadway in "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" shortly before she passed away in late 2001, and Holland Taylor recently appeared in several TV movies.)
It took several weeks before I realized it was never coming back.
Jim Varney should have stepped in and said something before this movie was made.
though utterly inexperienced before an hostile court, Vinny manages with a little help from his girl friend Mona to draw victory in a case of mistaken identity from the jaws of defeat.
The movie concerns two New York college students (Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield) who stop at a convenience store in Alabama shortly before a murder takes place.
As I mentioned before, it never really takes off until Pesci appears.
He went to law school but took six attempts before he passed the bar.
In those days before CGI they could have stunt men hanging by wires, the camera could be tilted, blue screen could be employed, but no matter what they tried it just wasn't going to look like the comics.
Yet what if someone had never seen a Laurel and Hardy film before this?
No longer are there silent era delays in the action and no longer are there long set-ups before the comic act.
A 1941 release before the attack on Pearl Harbor (by only two months), this is another of the pro-Army non-specific enemy movies.
Julie Gavras, the daughter of famous director Costa Gavras, tried her hand at directing before.
another witty example at one point her parents take her to a rally to demonstrate solidarity, but later in the film, when 'exercising solidarity' with her classmates who all believe Rome to have existed before Greece despite her knowing better, she learns that solidarity and being a sheep are two different things.
Harold Ramis's comedy obviously borrows ideas from past comparable films like "Grosse Point Blank" and "Mafia," but as this production proves, just because it was done before doesn't mean it cannot be successfully accomplished again with the right casting.      
I wondered why I haven't seen that movie before... Because we are very familiar with movies with leading actors... Prestige or illusionist...
The story isn't entirely original as we've all heard con men stories before, but the way the story unfolds and the development of the characters involved makes it a new experience.
Rachel Weisz has always been great in everything I've seen her in, but she commands the screen in this movie like I've never seen before.
Even before we get in the theater, I know we're in for a different experience.
Once inside, the director, Rian Johnson, shows up just before the show starts, fresh off a flight from Abu Dhabi no less.
Truly, even before the opening title graphics crawled across the screen some seven minutes (significant?)
into the first reel this reviewer craved the blissful relief of an untimely death before the next zoom-in close-up of Peter Spelson's heavily lidded psychotronic stare!
The absence of dialogue between the two principals (everything that needs saying being conveyed in whispers) was an interesting way to go and the look of the movie is (as usual, for this particular director) beautiful... but the surreal ending, which on the face of it seems to have no reason for being whatsoever, undermines much of what has come before.
Ignorant of the world, the girl seems content to live with the old man even allowing him to bathe her every night, however, one day a teenage boy is amongst those who come to fish on the old man's boats and the young girl feels a stirring in her heart that she has not felt before.
I have never seen Yeo-reum Han in a film before, so I'll need to see her to see whether she is a very good actress.
In Bom Yeoreum, the student monk leaves the lake before the preparation is complete.
He scares the fishermen with his bow, stops them from touching her and finally stops the girl and the young boy from leaving before the preparation is complete by tying the rope around his neck with the other end on the moving boat.
This is one of them rare films that already make you feel uncomfortable before it even properly takes off.
What strikes me as kind of sad was that the film often feels like its standing in front of you waving at you in a pathetic attempt to make you think you haven't seen this before.
It was the first feature film made entirely in Chicago since the Essanay era before WW1.
I knew very little from this movie before seeing it and was very pleasantly surprised.
"Smile before Death" is such a film Giallo connoisseurs have certainly heard about already, but the film remains unavailable on DVD to this day and if you really want to see it you have to be satisfied with a computer ripped bootleg version with poor picture quality and unidentifiable foreign subtitles.
"Smile before Death" is not bad, but certainly not great neither (otherwise it would be wider known by now, ha!)
"Smile before Death" a stylish but sadly dull and underwhelming mystery thriller.
The plot contains elements we have all seen before: bullies, Italian mafia, single waitress mom trying to raise a boy; but it all comes together in a unique plot for an amazing adventure, during which our young heroes bond and grow together.
We all had seen side stories of Dragonball before and all of 'em deserved appreciate.
And of course there's this sad ending where Goku Jr. cries all because the dragon ball didn't grant his wish, soon a figure appears before him, it's his great-great grandfather Goku!
Goku also tells him that he needs to collect seven dragon balls before he can make his wish for his grandmother's health to be better.
I mean come on, he didn't help Pan throughout her life, didn't show up to anyone else's special events in their life before they died, and this dude wasn't even dead like in the Buu saga for Pete's sake.
In fact, it's a miracle that Amandio has managed to keep his script from becoming a complete mess; as aside from this new flair for murders, and the central situation; Smile Before Death is also a twisty little thriller, which manages to pull several things out of the hat before boiling down to a superb and unexpected conclusion.
The police declare it suicide, but it's not long before Dorothy's daughter, Nancy, makes her way to her mother's house; where she meets the seductive Gena and her stepfather, Marco.
Notes:   The first version of Suburban Commando released has a special message by Hulk Hogan before the movie starts.
I am a Big Wrestling Fan but i enjoyed this movie even before i was.
I liked her even before when I watched Tru Calling.
But Dushku is interesting to watch here (and not for any of the usual reasons) and shows promise she never has before.
What a great way to end the first season of the x-files.An apparent unrelated.minor car chase leads the agents to the discovery of what seems to be concrete evidence of a government conspiracy.The early sequence of the man being chased who then is shot emits green blood which has toxic properties is a classic.Also Deep Throat plays an important part i this episode though can the agents trust him after his lies in E.B.E?A stunning moment happens when Mulder enters the warehouse and before his very eyes is bodies in tanks of water.When he returns with Scully the bodies are gone much to Mulders disgust.He thought he had irrefutable,indisputable proof.This episode must be watched!
Smilin Through before Sleeping Through, i was really disappointed in this film it lacked character and interest.
The first ten minutes made me laugh more than the whole of "The Bucket List".A blonde - haired lady with muscular thighs and some sort of circus costume jumps on and off lorries killing highly - armed soldiers before disappearing from our ken rather mysteriously.That bloke from Bros should have stuck to causing pre - pubescent girls to lose bladder control because there's more future in that for him than in acting.
Christy must not only hide the pain of her lonely existence and the hallucinations that plague her, she also has to face the humiliation of condescending treatment from the neighbours, nurses, and cops around her; though one of them, Jeff Burdan (Warren Christie), is pretty kind to her, his cop pal Randy (Patrick Gilmore) makes a cruel remark before being introduced to Christy.
To be certain its the sort of thing thats been done before, but even then this has some genuine shivers and some creepy moments.
Plagued by visions and a sense that her sister was buried alive she begins to search for clues as to what happened seven years before.
I've seen the play many times before, but this production startled me in it's final act with a single bit of stagecraft.
The score (with the filmmakers realizing the not everything is of-the-moment, and the avant garde of the 30s would still be "processing" the avant garde of the 20s, teens, and before) gives us snippets of Le Sacre du Printemps and some of Satie's piano pieces.
(My English isn't excellent , I'm learning it at school)  When I saw this movie I understand that, those tribes who live in this forest , were there for thousands years before all others people who live near this forest like the Brazilians and other.
It is a performance everyone should see before they comment on her as it leads me to believe she has been largely wasted in the rest of her career.
Or maybe I need to shut up before I get slapped with a Thoughtless Human with Penis label and written into another script where men fail to make the world entirely comfortable for women.
Set in scenic Upstate New York, the movie explores the anxieties and fears that many women face before, during and after pregnancy.
As most of the comments before, acting was superb, the story was well laid out, intelligently and without patronizing explanations.
Go and see the film before it closes and if you miss it at the cinemas get the DVD!
So be very careful before paying any money to go see it.
To make matters worse, his own marriage has failed before his own eyes, as Maureen, his wife of many years has decided she has had enough, and moves out.
I don't know why Danny Aiello hasn't had more leading roles before this, and I was impressed by Jane Curtain in a drama since she's really only been in comedies, like SNL.
Shaft senses this is a trap as he makes sure the coast is clear and interrogates Jazar, before he finally relents to her persistence and they make love in her cabin.
First, while watching this movie I laughed harder than I ever have before.
I thought I'd seen some bad movies before, but this is seriously the worst ever.
Not that Christopher Lee singing and dancing with a deadpan look on his face isn't somewhat amusing, but this is chock full of songs and after a while I just wanted to stop the DVD before the end, although I somehow managed to get through it all.
This is my kind of movie, I had never heard of it before, and only found it due to a purchase I made from Amazon, noticed this title as well.
As usual his humor has again occurred before its time.
The very premise of the film is fascinating, and though we've seen the "old-time hero in the modern world" premise before and since, this is one effort that really delves into the potential of that idea.
The plot centers on a list of names the now-nutso Ellis apparently slipped his deputy, but that canny device flutters away before they've crossed two names out.
Outside of the slick cover, there's nothing else in between, but if you won't take my word for, read some of the other user comments before proceeding with wasting your money.
There's some inklings of a plot in there and the finale (a black mass) is slightly interesting, but you'll fall asleep long before this.
The film begins with a scene that sees a man carrying the body of a dead girl before burying her, and then being pursued by a bunch of people with guns.
Lisa Gastoni (at 43) is still a sensual and attractive woman and has her hair dyed reddish blonde here, but this proved to be the last of several roles in a similar mode Â to which I alluded above and of which I wouldn't mind catching Jerzy Kawalerowicz's MADDALENA (1971) and Giulio Petroni's LABBRE DI LURIDO BLU (1975); in fact, she went into a long period of retirement right after this one before re-emerging two years ago.
I have identified as polyamorous all my life--even before the word was coined in 1990.
It's funny and charming, but it's also quite a bit darker and more serious than the American films he had made before it in the sound era.
The movie just barely got in under the wire before the Production Code began to enforce the prude's code of morality on America.
This wicked crew just barely sneaked *Design for Living* past the Production Code before it clamped down and sterilized the mainstream studio productions of Old Hollywood.
So many people at their peaks produced this classic - Lubitsch, Hecht, March, Cooper, Hopkins, Horton and Paramount, getting it past the Hays Office just before its peak.
Personally I regard Lubitsch's Trouble In Paradise from the year before as one of the best films ever made, but this is certainly one of his best pieces of work too.
In this surprisingly risquÃ© film made before the Hays code, two men and a woman share an apartment in Paris and talk openly about sex.
This was another of those "vintage" films of which you had the chance of reading a lot about, but before Universal released "The Gary Cooper Collection", where it's included, you had nowhere to watch it.
They end in the middle of nowhere like unfinished highways miles before they reach a destination.
And no, before you ask, I'm not a die-hard Lucy Liu fan.
He had hit Harlan Tyler on a running horse at about 400 yards and before that he had killed another running rider early in the picture.
The early scene with Will Kane sitting at a table without a gun talking tough to Irons and Tyler was too unbelievable, I'm sure they would have noticed he wasn't wearing a gun long before he got up out of the chair.
This director, Jerry Jameson would be well advised to watch Lonesome Dove before he directs anymore Western movies.
It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told, and we have all seen this before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry.
But while we indulge in wistful scenery, the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset, and we have to wait a few seasons to past, and 45 minutes into the film, before they find a leveler in food.
As mentioned before, the starring of John Saxon surely increases the status of this film.
Never seen a DVD that had that much extra playing time before, so be prepared.
Unfortunately, years before, the commanding officer was also bitten while trying to rescue these poor soldiers, but has been pretty good at keeping his "sickness" at bay.
One, he's having flashbacks to Vietnam, where he witnesses two of his men chowing down on somebody before biting him, and two: his teenage neighbour is coming on strong but all John has is an urge to bit her.
The mysterious nature of the rituals involved is quite convincing Â the symbols, the ancient books, the dusty vaults Â but it's too talkie and seems tediously slow by today's standards and, as I said before, the finale is truly the most disappointing in Hammer history.
It's up to humble, but shrewd and charming best-selling occult novelist John Verney (superbly played by Richard Widmark, who makes for an engagingly unlikely Hammer hero) to stop Father Rayner and his avid followers before it's too late.
When Nanny is found hanging in the Denver's bathroom on the evening Iris returns home, it's not long before Detective Bruce (George Raft) suspects it's not suicide, but murder...and Peter is the lead suspect.
Ms. Ginger Rogers is 43 years old by now (1954) and in one of her last roles before retirement.
I had asked the spirit to take me to a gorgeous girl i had met in London a few weeks before, as i regretted never asking for her phone number after having to rush for a train.
Blanca Portillo and Anabel Alonso have proved their great ability as comediennes, but the great discovery here has been unknown Carmen Machi, who had mostly worked in theater before and is now heading for a spin-off based on her character, Aida.
As it emerged both of them reached heights they never did before or after with this movie... (yeah, i know the entire series of maniratnam's movies and most of Ilayaraja's music...)   The main protagonist's death is but a matter of ti me, and the leading lady is in a similar situation.
later, the heroine does'nt want to be with him as she is afraid he might die before her.
See it if you have a chance, even before Szabo's other, bigger films.
I loved to watch this one to see Katey Sagal as the candidate's secretary, years before her Married with Children fame.
Fast sport cars, crazy dressed punks, roller-skates, bad '80's music and of course '80's star Charlie Sheen in it, just before his "Platoon" role, which really marked his breakthrough.
The stunts are OK & there are some decent explosions but it's nothing we haven't seen a hundred time before & the tings we haven't seen before including a car which can magically reform itself are just plain daft & feel out of place.
Yes, laugh at the shadow of the camera (in the days before monitors) during the race scenes, at least they bothered to use real cars on real roads at high speed, unlike pathetic cgi cars (fast & the furious, 2 fast 2 furious, gone in 60 seconds) with crap physics.
This movie is totally innovative, nothing like it before or since and there are a lot of techniques used in this movie that I haven't seen bettered since.
(Watch the bit in Mad Max 2 just before he crashes his Interceptor...you'll see.)
While I was aware of the sacrilege going on in the Amazon, this opened my eyes to it like never before.
The time is well before World War I. de la Verne has a reputation of having seduced just about every daughter, wife and mistress among the town's grande bourgeoisie and petit nobility, not to mention their maids and a number of night club singers.
A woman will be chosen at random, and if Armand has not seduced her before the regiment leaves, he and his friends will pay for a sumptuous farewell dinner.
I'd seen only the great films from the 30's by this director, before enjoying this first color film from 1955.
Paul has a right to be worried, Brett has a grudge against Cartwright, whose meddling stopped his plans years before - he now wants revenge.
The efforts made by the bad guys are so over the top and convoluted and use so much energy to get what they want, things fizzle and go out long before the end of the movie.
Then one day Paul's mother introduces him to Brett Curtis (Warren William), a smooth, gracious man Paul feels he's met before.
But, not before, she got into a big huff with Robert Young, her boss and there's a matter of a "slight" misunderstanding.
Their father whom Pablo never seen in his life before, is in coma.
Many people that have seen this movie have labelled it a Giallo, and while the film does have it's Giallo moments in the first half - I'd put Spider Labyrinth in with the robust Gothic horror films such as Kill Baby Kill, Inferno and Suspiria before listing it amongst the likes of Solange and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage.
It's not long before his professor host ends up dead, and our hero is being plunged into a world of mystery and sinister cults, which all seems to focus around some strange 'fist-sized' black balls.
The costumes looked new, like they had never been worn before.
It's not long before Valentine is up to her pommel trying to save the king and to foil Mazarin's schemes.
Although we're an hour into the 170 minute production before they appear and the movie isn't about them, there's something poignant, amusing and inspiring when we see the aging D'Artagnan, Athos (Christopher Cazenove), Aramis (Alan Corduner) and Porthos (John Rhys-Davies), heavier now, gray, a little slower and often used for comedy relief, answer the call to honor and arms.
The 'younger generation' - the sons of Athos, Porthos and Aramis - were well-written, acquiring individuality of their own even before we found out who they were supposed to be, and not just clones of their respective fathers.
It's another, "been done before plot" with some added special effects and humour, all of which added together equal a movie worth seeing.
Jim Evers must discover the mystery in the Haunted Mansion before it's too late for his family and himself.
The opening sequence of the feature ruined any suspense for many later events and could have been done in a different way that didn't give away much of the story before the audience even had a chance to settle down in their seats.
The problem lies mostly in the plot that is often flat and predictable ruining many of the film's twists before they are even set up.
Disney should think twice before making a movie about another attraction in their parks.
In order to survive, the carpenter reluctantly turns to crime, but is arrested and brought before a kindly, sympathetic judge (George Nichols).
This was Kahn's final performance before her death and was probably one of her very best.
I'd never really seen Dishy before, but his performance made me go look up what he's done because he was really great.
It is also the perfect role for Madeline Kahn, who the world lost too soon shortly before the film's release.
It was made a year before Godzilla 1984 as well as a year before 2010 came out-and this film bears some striking plot devices to that one, as well as some of the set and miniature designs.
The comment I posted about Sharpe's Battle before wasn't objective.
The plot was completely expected, you can see every dumb move that someone's going to make at least a minute or two before they make it, and you're left with this horrible feeling that you've wasted time that could have been spent...well, sleeping, if nothing else.
The exhumation based on the fact that a pill bottle was in his bathroom that wasn't there before?
When Victoria started to tell people about the pill bottle that had not been in the cabinet before, Tim just played cool.
The girl wants Marcus to confess what he did to the police but Marcus doesn't want this and sees no other option than to kill her too, before she talks.
It's not for everyone, but for those that like their comedy as dark and rowdy as possible, it's a sure winner and the story of how they made the movie (Jeff Anderson had for instance never acted before!)
But not all of it is bad, as I said before the idea is very original and some of the jokes really made me laugh.
It's also that fact that makes this movie so good, every aspiring director (including myself) sees this movie and if it weren't there before, now there is hope, hope that someday i will make it big time to.
They fixed it up and before you know it we have the best indie film ever made.
Clerks is one of those movies everyone knows everything about even before they've seen it.
Most of these people had never acted before, and although it does seem like they're just reciting their lines (there's almost no break in between the dialogue), they do a good job at it.
Unfortunately, it was all cut short by Keach's arrest in England on drug charges; but even before that the politically-correct brigade had managed to dilute it of most of the things we watched it for to begin with.
I must admit that seeing a 3.8/10 by IMDb users before I saw this film was not the most encouraging thing for me to read before seeing this movie, which was played for the Trenton (NJ) Film Society last night.
It would be another four years before he was able to convince someone to cast him in drama and RKO got a genuine hit in Murder My Sweet when they did.
One day, before returning home to her estranged husband Julien (Dominique Abel), she gets accidentally locked in the restaurant's room-sized freezer.
I highly recommend that families view it together before they are forced to make difficult decisions about the welfare of their aging relatives.
But, before he can get out of his car, there's a crash & there's a woman who has wrecked her car and is hanging out the door, so he puts her into his car, which will then not start.
As it happens, I ran across the "Jose Chung" episode of the X-Files, with Mr. Reilly in the title role, last week, just before he passed.
Well, before seeing this film, I feel into that category.
I didn't even realize until right before seeing the film that he has recently passed away.
They should make you watch Witness and that Jennifer Connelly movie with the double ended dildo and The Ice Storm before you hit puberty instead of crap like this.
I remembered Mr. Sewell vaguely from "Hamlet," and have longed to see Mr. Fiennes in a film since "Shakespeare in Love," but never remember seeing Ms. Potter in anything, and I am sure that I never seen Mr. Hollander before.
I remembered Mr. Sewell vaguely from "Hamlet," and have longed to see Mr. Fiennes in a film since "Shakespeare in Love," but never remember seeing Ms. Potter in anything, and I am sure that I never seen Mr. Hollander before.
AKA: The Very Thought Of You  This has been done many times before.
Of course it isn't long before he has to put his ideas to the test as a group of criminals hijack a Norwegian supply vessel, plant bombs on two rigs then demand a ransom of twenty five million pounds within twenty four hours.
Luckily for the British government, Lloyd's of London had already recruited ffolkes to devise a plan to overcome just this type of situation five months before the incident occurs.
The Prime Minister agrees to use him, and before you know it, Ffolkes is out on the oil platform ready to dispose of the extortionists.
His hatred for women and love of felines is something this critic has never seen before in a movie character.
McLaglen and Davis both know that superior thrillers follow a formula in which things go from bad to worse before the finale.
It made me think of the kinds of great films the Coen brothers used to make before people gave them a lot of money.
After seeing the 1960 color version on VHS, I kept saying I remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before.
I have seen this story before!
So Distubia was a pretty good movie, I would recommend it, although before you see it, I would highly recommend seeing Rear Window, but this was a good updated version that I'm sure you'll enjoy.
It actually thinks before it leaps.
So 'Clerks' would be a good film to see before 'Mallrats'.
Though, they got the likes of T.S' girlfriend's dad and that of a scummy store manager to overcome before winning back their girls.
but before there was Seth, there was Brodie.
I was not aware of Wild Man Fischer, or any Outsider Music for that matter before seeing this film.
To understand this movie in a multiple-timeline context, we have to back up to the beginning of the main character's adult life (before the movie starts), in which he made the decision to grow a moustache at all.
He takes a ferry from the city side to the airport side of a river, but before boarding the plane, changes his mind again and goes back on the ferry.
Perhaps this time the move is not so jarring because he has done it before.
I knew little of the film before seeing it and I was blown away by the premise and production quality.
This flusters the jewel thief enough to make him lose his edge and get captured though he manages to fire his gun before being rushed.
But he gets knocked out before he can answer "I do!"
Directed by Gordon Flemyng this late 60's crime heist action thriller is unfairly rather obscure but is worth the effort to track a copy down, although you can compare The Split to The Italian Job (1969) since they are both 60's heist films The Split was made & released a year before.
I have never before seen a film that was so elitist, so vapid, and so disrespectful of its audience in assuming it is more clever than they are.
When she and others are stranded on Pago Pago in the Samoa, they have to stay there before they can go anywhere else.
Two of the best scenes are when Huston repeatedly says the Lord's Prayer as Crawford becomes mesmerised and starts saying it herself and Huston's final scene as he says a silent prayer to himself before he changes his expression to one in which he seems about to lose self-control before he rushes to where Crawford resides.
*La Moustache SPOILERS*   Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), a middle-aged Parisian architect, decides one night, before going to some friends' house, to cut his mustache, but neither his wife AgnÃ¨s (Emmanuelle Devos) nor his friends notice anything, and AgnÃ¨s is especially adamant about his never having a mustache.
Carmonte has cultural pretensions, loving to whistle opera arias from MARTHA and other works, usually just before he has someone rubbed out.
We also believe Huston's face a moment later, as he prays alone, grimaces unreadably, and suddenly resolves into a look of predatory lust just before slipping into her room, the drums implacably beating in the background.
The interesting thing to me is that as the "reformed" Sadie, Joan Crawford is MUCH more beautiful (less makeup, more subdued clothing, softer-focus lighting) than as the lurid Sadie, yet the soldier sees she is much LESS than she was before.
Sadly, it's financial failure relegated Crawford to years of popular but light-weight "respectable" roles, before her Oscar-calibre performances of the 1940's and 50's.
Marc decides, before he and his wife Agnes go to dinner at friends, to shave his mustache.
This time, I said, I'm going to prove myself it's not gonna shock me as before.
It's a quite gruesome film, emotionally draining and heartless, an obvious comparison would be "Oliver Twist", or perhaps a dark fairytale from the brothers Grimm... At first, before the father arrives, I thought it was a Christian parable, where the mother represented the dead Jesus, and the children the acolytes and worshippers.
Well eventually, he finds out that this is really his old house where he and his fiancÃ© used to live before he killed her.
(And very much a pasty rip-off of Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys, as mentioned before.)
Then, quite classically, as we think we know the truth to this film, director Kasten gives us one last push of the unknown and before the screen our minds are shattered.
Seth Green, who I strongly disliked before this film, has made me a fan.
It goes back to wondering just how much can be perpetrated upon an audience before they are either too stumped to get it, or too mentally manipulated to care.
Kasten takes you to that point, but pulls back before going over the top, a point that he deserves much credit for.
(To see this, note that the earthly part wakes up from the implantation surgery just before the one nurse says that her shift is over, while the tormented half wakes up two or three seconds later, just after.)
But this was wartime and it would only be natural that world's most famous detective be called on to lend his services overseas when a British agent carrying a vital document disappears, but not before he passes it on to an unsuspecting Marjorie Lord on a train.
An attempt was made on there lives before they even entered America.
- riding the ferry before Devos shows up, or does she?
Holmes and Pettibone had worked together before on important cases so Holmes is ready to take on the task and travel with Watson to Washington when the British authorities tell him that his associate has disappeared, along with the document.
It's soon discovered by both Holmes and the Nazis that the young fiancÃ© has the document, or at least a knowledge of its whereabouts, so the bad guys kidnap her just before Holmes can get to her.
Parents might want to preview this film before showing it to their younger children or at the very least watch it with them.
After that I waited for 10 years before it came on TV and it still holds up today.
You have plenty of warning, they are in the crypt for a while before the open the coffin.
", just before the station blew up because of Don's cigar.
I caught it originally on HBO in the days BEFORE cable TV and that one scene where the two send off a carrier pigeon but forget to open the glass door before throwing it in the air makes me laugh even as I'm typing this.
Marc asks his girlfriend AgnÃ¨s (Emmanuelle Devos) before they visit some friends for dinner.
I saw this after Dead Man's Walk and before Lonesome Dove.
At the same time, Sisko must deal with his own nemesis, that of Picard (whom he associates with the death of his wife in the battle with the Borg 3 years before) who comes to the station.
Adding Michael Dorn was sheer brilliance on the part of the producers but the loss of Terry Ferral was just brutal (killed off final episode, season before the final season) Marc Alaimo , as Gul Dukat made it east to dislike the Cardassians while Aron Eisenberg made it easy to appreciate the Ferengi!
Let's just say that this is just the pilot, and it seems a little time passed before the shot the second episode because it has a completely different feel that will become the norm for the rest of the series.
On DS9 he suddenly becomes a non-commissioned officer Chief rank and loses the ability to give orders to anyone but the engineers- and later submits to Ensign Nog who was but a child a year before to him.
The ones they do have are decades old and from "The Occupation" or before.
The Crew struggle to move the station to location of the worn hole before the Cardassians can get there as whoever can control that space will be in charge of a staging post for exploration and trade with the Gamma Quadrant.
Being a fan of DS9 I'd seen the series a couple of times before I recently re-watched this episode; I think it did a very good job of introducing a cast of characters who with the exception of Chief O'Brien are new to the Star Trek world.
Based on a space station near a stable wormhole leading through an inhabited inter-dimensional gateway into a different quadrant of the galaxy millions of light years away, DS9's aliens were REALLY alien, it's stories ranged from near-universal to personal in scope, and its characters and their relationships to one another were more intimately explored than before or since.
Sisko's encounter with the prophets beat any alien encounters ever seen before in Star Trek history.
for starters the casting is excellent you have George Peppard before he entered further stardom with the A-team, complete with a southern accent( just wait till he utters the immortal line 'the town is full of Killa cockroaches!
Jan Michael Vincent before he became famous with air-wolf the wisecracking Token black guy Paul Winfield, who suffers a fate worse than death when runs afoul of 'said Killa cockroaches' French actress Dominque Sanda as a Vegas show girl along for the ride and a Pre -breaking away Jackie Earle Haley as a waif who is adept at throwing rocks at disgruntled hillbillies!
Seems that the two of them knew each other years before when she was 6.
I've long had an interest in exploring those halcyon days of science fiction film-making, before Star Wars and its ilk took over the genre almost completely, ending the wonderful decade before with its intelligent characters, thought-provoking story lines, and emphasis on speculation over laser blasts.
Even the fact that 30 minutes pass before the trip to Neverland without any action and you don 't get bored (and I have seen it several times) is a very positive sign .
The kid becomes an adult and must deal an old enemy  before leaving this fantasy world forever .
Like I said before, just pretend this movie is rated "7.5" and go RENT IT!
Hoffman extracts all the villainous comic potential possible from his performance, especially in a wonderfully wicked scene where he lectures the children on how much happier their parents were before they came along.
This has never been done before, and this is why the movie stands out: it isn't afraid to explore the unexplored.
His doomed relationship with Andrea Beaumont and the role it plays in his metamorphosis into the costumed vigilante further adds depth to the character, in ways we have never seen before, as we realise exactly what Bruce had to sacrifice to live the life he has chosen.
Realizing that Andrea comes back into town, he realizes that he will do everything to protect his love and try to reveal who the killer is before it's too late.
Also, The Joker (Star Wars' Mark Hamill) is trying to find 'Andi' to kill her before he is next.
Now I have been adding some Batman titles; I began with the Batman and Superman movie, a movie that I found just good by the way (later I will be writing on here a complete comment for that movie), and later I began to watch Batman Beyond, a series that I never watched before and that right now I'm enjoying a lot (soon I will be writing a full comment for Season 1).
This was my next step and I must "confess" that I had never watched this movie before, now I'm really glad I watched it.
The past will come back to Bruce's mind and with that we will watch a love story before the Batman days, a love story that for Bruce ended in a very surprising and painful way, ended in the Dark Knight.
That character is Andrea Beaumont, the girl of that love story before the Gotham Knight days.
As I said before, it is a graphic piece of animation, very dark too, it's not kiddie and doesn't play along the guidelines of a "Family film" although there is no cursing involved in it.
The best part of that music is around the 12 second mark she plays this wondering choir and brass right before the operatic choir kicks in.
Only here there's a catch: the running time is short (originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds), so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie, where his identity is being cross-checked all over as the killer of the gangsters, and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father.
the use of flashbacks to show Bruce Wayne's life before he took up the bat and the woman he was with.
And know him a little better before becoming Batman.
It has a great story that flashes back to just before Bruce took up the mantle of the bat and the woman he was involved with at the time, then skips forward to an unknown assassin killing Gotham City's mobsters, and we see how the 2 story's meet.
The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.
Cheadle has infiltrated these terrorists, lead by SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui, who also played a terrorist earlier in 2008 in Vantage Point, so deeply he's afraid that he'll have carried out attacks against the U.S. before Daniels gets what he wants.
Now before I get to ahead of myself I have to let you know that the story gets sort of confusing at times, at least for me.
Through the recommendation of a mutual acquaintance, Samir hooks up with a terrorist named Omar but before you know it they both wind up in prison after being captured by Yemeni government soldiers working in conjunction with the FBI.
Then because of his yeeaars of service as an air marshal his training kicks in and out of instinct he shoots before he thinks.
bad-first of all, i know that every film (must) introduce the characters before getting to the point of the film.
And this is a quality great actors share: always showing something new, something we haven't seen before.
That's a low that the Coens never reached before.
Consequently each shines in their given roles, relishing the word play and eking the maximum out of each situation.No scene is dwelled upon, and the occasional bloody outburst of violence, or titillating appearance of a Sybian machine , is shown then moved on from before you have time to work out exactly what is going on.
there have been many films before about white boys trying to act like the stereotype black gang banger rapper but they have mostly flopped until now.
I never heard of JK before & I hate rap/hip-hop/etc.
These cyborgs (or Dynamitards as they are later revealed to be known as) exhibit calculated and unsympathetic views of animals, at one point referring to a dog as being 'One of these lesser animals', before disposing of the poor canine in a dumpster!
and before she can say more, she's killed by another one of these robots.
The only flaw of the movie is that it completely ignores the sequel that was made before.
lol that's why we all need to read the title of a book and then flip it over and read the back of it before buying, or sometimes we open the book and read a page or we just decide to give it a shot and give the first chapter a read then when were done we are hooked or not.
I have to admit that before watching this one with my 2 year old daughter, it seemed virtually certain that I'd be doing a great deal of groaning and yawning for the next hour and fifteen minutes.
It's a bit disturbing to hear Lady Tremaine say "Bibbidi bobbidi boo" so much, but she does, and Stacy lets her talk her into all kinds of trickery before getting her lesson about true love (that it's the most powerful kind of magic there is, that her mom doesn't get it, bla bla.)
She disappears before the movie is half over, and doesn't interact with anyone but Cindy.
I can only say it was neat to see her in the castle before the time of the second movie.
I didn't expect any more character development in Twist, after all, it's before the point where she dances with him and we see that she's not exactly as she appears to be.
I certainly didn't expect them to be married and having kids or anything because again, this is before they actually hooked up.
I loved the twist at the almost end made it more dark.I also love the fact that Cinderella Got the princes love more harder then before not just cause of her looks and everything but cause of more she had to fight for love it was more realistic then a girl going to the ball and thats it.They showed more of the prince too we didn't really know him before and he talked a lot more which made it better.The 2nd movie was horrible made no sense and was not interesting to watch and way off story line.
Even Cinderella herself showed a courageous side that you didn't get to see before.
Although what follows seems a bit hokey when describing it (The magic of the wand is not as powerful as Cinderella and the prince's predestined love) it is handled maturely and time is given for the couple to get to know each other a bit more (in the first film they had said, what, four words) before getting married.
Personally, I can't get enough of "More Than a Dream," Cinderella's balled that sucked me into the story and told me that we'd be dealing with a much more pro-active Cinderella than ever before (somehow I cant' imagine the Cinderella from the first film singing "There's a better life that's waiting past the mountains I must climb.
And I think poor Karen Silkwood just shouldn't have eaten those 'ludes before driving.
And as I said before, the performances are about the best to be found.
However, as is the case with a good handful of Nichols's films after Silkwood, the ending comes before once is ready for it.
Too bad it turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen; the kind that gives me a new-found respect for movies that I thought were bad before.
I never turn off a movie before it is finished, even if it is really bad.
This is because there is always the possibility that the movie will suddenly get good, and I fall in love with it (which has happened before quite a few times).
**PERFORMANCES**  I don't remember seeing Meryl Streep in anything before this.
Silkwood didn't find hope, but she did get scared, and angry, and put her job (and those of her colleagues) at stake to uncover dangerous practices before dying a mysterious death.
I read the book long before I heard about the movie, and given past history with books being translated into movies, I expected NetForce to suck but hoped it didn't.
As wife to King Prasutagus of the Iceni tribe, she sees her fierce husband shamed before Rome's greedy onslaught.
I don't think it occupied his thoughts as much as they make out - he is even totally preoccupied with the Celts before the rebellion!
There would not have been an army of the great unwashed, at least not before the battle.
The Greeks visited Britain before the Romans, not to invade but just to trade, and there are some descriptions of their customs, looks and music.
It always comes on here in Chicago the Wednesday before Halloween from 4 in the morning to 6.
As expected the two persons whom Hammer got in contact with dancer Maria Garcia, Genie Coree, and the deft mute janitor Jane, Terrance De Morney, ended up being murdered before they can help Hammer in finding Red's killer or killers.
The quintessential Mike Hammer (Robert Bray), haggard, menacing, but essentially a decent guy in a dirty world inhabited by ruthless killers, gets involved in the murder of a young aspiring actress, who only the night before he had met at a lonely downtown diner, and had helped out with bus fare back to her native Nebraska.
And each moment is fleeing, dynamic, related to the moment before and the moment that follows.
When one person played it, the music brought back the memories of all those who had played it before.
Upon meeting the major characters we realize they're roles we've all seen before.
It would be a shame to know too much about this movie before watching it.
As the movie progressed, I began to suspect the fortune teller was speaking not of the life of the expectant woman sitting before her, but of the violin.
I really enjoyed Don Mcellars work before, and this is no different.
Another bloke is trying to move in on their claim and things get ugly, but not before there are a few laughs and punch-ups.
I've never seen White before, but he was fun to watch and seemed very into his character.
anyhow i remember watching this with a friend in high school right before Woodstock 2 came out that summer.
Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace And Music to me, is more then just an ordinary run of the mill music documentary, it was a record of the hippie culture of 1969, the youth of America trying to make a difference, a spectacular experience of one of America's greatest rock festivals before the days of the original MTV (Music Television) & VH1 before they became sleezy reality TV networks.
Woodstock showed us for a brief moment what life really always already is - before the decline of Altamont.
I was on my way to the original "Peace and Arts Festival" before the crush of traffic on Sullivan County's portion of Route 17 and my own youthful practicality decided against it.
There is a lot to enjoy, including the stuff between the music if you have never seen this before.
I have never seen this done before by another actress in the same sense.
When she is before the camera, all the problems behind it seem insignificant.
It just that we have seen it done before and done better.
All in all, Razzle Dazzle gave it a fair go but with the majority of the adult audience it didn't match the hype it received before the movie came out.
I watched Razzle Dazzle today not knowing much about it before hand, and therefore not having any great expectations.
I haven't known her before.
A little bit hestitate to read the book before finish watching the show.
All of them has well designed personalities but none that we haven't seen before as the insecure and family troubled Wendy (Brook Shields), a movie producer that despite her insecureness she makes right decisions in her work but it's kind hard for her to tie work and family; the self confident but unhappy Nico (Kim Raver), a magazine editor who is moved by challenges and is tired to be ignored by a husband that never gives her the attention she deserves; and the lovely and believer Victory Ford, a fashion designer that wants to conquer the world in her own impulsive and sentimental ways and is dealing for the first time with the downs of her career.
Just a warning: the pilot leaves a bit to be desired, so watch the next few episodes before you make a decision.
Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a widowed middle-aged detective stationed on the south coast of England at the outbreak of the Second World War; Foyle has a son Andrew who is a student at Oxford before volunteering with the Royal Air Force.
I could go on for pages and pages about the acting, writing and attention to period detail but I won't bother because by the looks of it many before me have done so already.
But the show belongs to Michael Kitchen and you wonder why you've never seen this actor before and when you will see him again.
Finally able to solve the case, they go out to try to catch the killer cat before it strikes again.
At mid-film, the local coast guard commander chooses to retire, to quit service before having to witness the death or imprisonment of his childhood friend.
I, the viewer, felt likewise - very much like abandoning the theater before the inevitable.
We are immediately taken into their world for a brief glimpse of their lives before the inevitable occurs.
Performances are solid, and Jacques Tourneur's crafty direction lets you see just enough before fading to black.
Quek grew up as the only child of well-meaning, middle-class parents in one of the world's wealthiest nations, where she attended some of the top schools before being granted the means to attend university in the UK.
It takes a long time for this movie to really get going, though part of this may stem from the fact I have been spoiled by other horror movies like "The Mist" and "Feast" that only take a short time before all hell breaks loose.
It was an excellent movie, much better than anything that came before or after it.
Yes this movie lets you know the characters lets you see what's inside of them before the zombies rip it out.
Who knew Tori Spelling could be an accomplished comic actor, with a major gift for impeccable timing and dead-pan delivery (actually, I've seen her do dead-pan delivery before, but never to such great and intentional comic effect).
It's scary, when you see these people faces and the way they act before they turn into rat people.
I actually quite liked this - it was nice to watch a horror movie where the characters were developed, allowing the audience to get to know them before the city fell into Hell.
Confession: I have never cried in a horror movie before and by the end I was bawling.
"Mulberry Street" is basically just another forgettable and mediocre creature-feature flick, but I'm rewarding it with at least two extra points because director Jim Mickle and his enthusiast cast & crew clearly went through several harsh ordeals before they could finish their ambitious project.
Everyone else above 12 should check there eyeballs before watching, as rolling them this much could cause permanent damage.
Hold on before I give away the big surprise let me explain a few things.
This film proves that labored, unfunny "comedies" were being produced long before the current spate of mindless garbage began spewing from our television and movie screens.
I wonder, how long will it be, before he starts to film a life of some low-life idiots in real-time and present it as "art"...
It should almost be mandatory for any Hollywood director to view a film of Todd Solondz before beginning a new project.
I was in high school at the time and every scene I was watching, I thought, "Yeah, no sh*t."  I mean, I know it's supposed to be a satire, but I felt too much like I was watching what I already knew and thought and what has been said too many times before.
It made my jaw drop and, in fact, I sat in front of the TV for a number of minutes before I regained my senses.
Worth watching, if only to see something you might not have see before (this type of match occurred only twice, I believe, and the other replaces Hart with Steve Blackman....who would YOU rather watch??)
It pretty much follows the book, unlike the scenes before it, but it has this mellow feeling to it that was not captured quite well in the book (no offense to the book fans)  Overall, the movie is NOT ALL BAD.
Now, two teenagers in a race against time, must search Ember for clues that will unlock the ancient mystery of the city's existence, and help the citizens escape before the lights go out forever.
This may be a film that succeeds in capturing the magic of the family film glory days of the 80's, (it took me right back to when I was ten years old and for the first time in years allowed me to become totally engrossed in the world that was portrayed before me) this does not mean you have to stay true to the 80's in your marketing campaign !!!
The suspense worked on two levels- will they find the way out before the City collapses- and will they find the way out before "the law" stops them?
I enjoyed the sets of the subterranean city and the teen kids were likable, but it took a little long before anything happened and when it did it was a little too far-fetched with poor special-effects.
The ending, as I stated, is a little underwhelming and all too brief, but it at least feels coherent and natural to that which comes before it.
Now it is up to two ambitious youths, Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) to solve the mystery behind the origins of their city and find a way out before their world is blanketed in darkness forever.
Telling a simple tale of Babe Ruth's life in his small hometown just before his rise to fame, the intertitles relating the story as it is supposedly known by an "oldtimer" from Babe Ruth's birthplace of Haverlock.
We as viewers no pretty soon, that it is not and hope that Hunter finds out before the deadline as well...
Some have the ability to confuse and bore you to death during most of the time, with just some good twist in the end, which "should" compensate for the "lentish", sacrificing hour before that.
Ever since being witness to this sleepfest, I've lost all faith in stuff on the Movie Network unless I've heard of it or sussed it out on this website before hand.
It was just a mishmash of boring scenes with the main character not going through any pronounced transformation beyond giving away a few of his possessions and voicing his desire to go on vacation before he dies.
The main character was trapped in a seduction that crossed so many lines for her that she breaks down near the end and bares the emotional scares before her comrades - describing the rape-like encounters.
As I said before, though, Lust, Caution is not about the love affair been characters played by the great Tony Leung and startling newcomer Wei Tang.
What we really have set before us is a tale of revolution, espionage, and maturing within the confines of a world at war.
I have never heard of her before, and I hope she will get to play in more film in the future.
Few of Lee's favorite classics can match the simple effectiveness of his final image here, of a sheet with slight depressions left by what rested on it shortly before: white on white, and yet meaningful and affecting.
The film's flashbacks are well crafted to introduce Mr. Yee and Jiazi and to focus on their persistent, strong and certainly up-to-no good, determined characteristics before they succumb to their sentimental temptations and passions.
Just right before the task seems about going to end, Wang Jiazhi memorized, from an innocent college girl to a highly skilled actress and patriot, this extremely dangerous ambition kept circling around her mind and couldn't possibly go away may because of her ideal of doing something big and important, may because of proving that she's not only a puppet, or may because of a man that she can't get him out of her head.
Even he has been through several villain characters, the devotion and outcome that he put in this role is never been seen before.
it's a cool story, and yes, the acting rules, but there's almost no music, and I've seen all of it before.
All three short films have a kind of twilight zone type feeling to them, the grainy 80's backdrop for me made it more eerie than the typical horror you see these days, of all the short films it was the second one 'Dreamhouse' that got me...a woman seeing horrific images of people being slaughtered before her eyes in her new home, even going as far as calling in a medium, her husband thinks shes crazy and it has a very intense bloody climax that had me grossed out as a 14 year old but not so much as a 30 year old!
The rose was to become the core of the curse, for before the last peddle falls, the prince must learn to love and be loved in return.
In order to break this spell, he must learn to love and be loved in return before the rose's last petal falls.
His 21st birthday is drawing near, and with Belle in his life, he finally has the chance try and break the spell before it's too late, but will he succeed?!
Everybody loves this Disney cartoon's humorous moments (Wardrobe landing on a villager for example, and a couple others to name a few), as well as touching scenes (at one point, for instance, before turning back into Prince's old self, Beast dies in Belle's arms before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls off) for many years to come just like the other Disney cartoons did.
When Maurice runs down the staircase of the cottage before the angry mob, the camera flies down following him, and yet Belle and Monsieur D'Arque remain completely visible.
The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.
Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts.
Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, "Beauty and the Beast" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along.
You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?
As mentioned before, the town that these three (and many others) reside is reminiscent of our American "Bedford Falls".
I had never seen,or heard, a film that used the music of Vaughn Williams before.
Let it Be is a look at how a great band can disintergrate before your eyes.
Albert Finney was memorable for his confused and determined (if strikingly unathletic) doctor trying to unravel the mystery before him.
John and Paul harmonizing at the beginning of "Across the Universe" and the rehearsal of "Two of Us" is what the public never saw before of the Beatles recording process.
It is wonderful to watch, but very sad to see them act this way together, because I had such a nice picture of them in my mind before i saw this.
For the last twenty minutes or so, all the bad vibes magically, mysteriously vanish and the Beatles are the Beatles again, charging through 'Get Back,' 'I've Got A Feeling,' 'Don't Let Me Down,' and 'One After 909', before reprising 'Get Back' as London police show up to wag their fingers and tell the Fab Four to turn that noise down.
I've lost count of the number of times over the decades I've heard a "new" piece of music and said to myself "I've heard that before somewhere Â ah yes, such and such by the Beatles".
And for-by much is made of Paul and George's spat (with John acting as unlikely peace-maker) and the at times tired and dishevelled appearance of the guys themselves, there are many other revealing and rewarding vignettes, even before director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, corrals the band for three assured in-studio video performances (all, significantly, of Macca tracks) and then the great idea (since aped by the Stones and U2) of playing their new stuff live on Apple's roof, on a biting cold Jamuary day.
It was also inspired of Lindsay-Hogg to intersperse the general public's comments before the group brings the "audition" to a close.
Favourite moments for me include Paul and Ringo's boogie-woogie piano run-through, George assisting Ringo with the writing of "Octopus's Garden" and of course that final run-through of "Get Back" on the roof, with Paul surprisingly getting in some improvised anti-Establishment digs before the police pulled the plug.
Having never seen any VHS copies of this last Beatles movie and since it will probably be a very long time before it gets on DVD, I was stoked when I found out YouTube had this uploaded since the later part of summer 2007 and it was still there.
The movie will also show you how they were playing some of their oldies as a warm up songs before starting with another take of their newer songs.
The high point of this film begins not at the famous rooftop concert, but right before it.
i think that this movie should be shown at schools but of course an edited version this movie showed me that you must help out friends and that you should be careful on who you let in to your life also you should also keep your eyes open on problems to stop them before they become worse.
when double d starts to become crazy puck only thinks about himself he should of realized the problem before he passed and i was so happy when puck put all the bad neo-nazi's to sleep because he was standing up for himself.
As Puck goes down the rabbit-hole, and the film turned from comedy to drama, I got a sneaking suspicion that I had seen something like this before.
Lenzi doesn't give you time to catch your breath before your off to the next action set-piece.
Like I wrote before, details like character motivation are secondary to the action.
I am a bit surprised that this show hasn't gone off the air, but I would imagine it will go the way of "Air America" before too long......
It is a story of an outsider living in the streets, drinking, helping out an addict whose he's in love with, stealing cars to sleep in them not to get cold in winter nights and cleaning them before driving them back to where he steals from.
It's possible that critics and/or viewers weren't so analytical back then but against that is the fact that less than a decade had passed before the Musical Queen of the Warner lot went up against the ex (just) Musical Queen of MGM.
On Moonlight Bay is the title of the film and one of several songs sung by Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Gordon's rival for Doris, Jack Smith all from the era before America's entry in World War I. Hollywood has done a lot to glamorize that era of Norman Rockwell and Grant Wood as America likes to see itself.
It had all happened half a century before this mid-20th Century production.
The film also has plenty of the rougher, even perverse sexuality that in one form or another is present in nearly all of Valentino's films (even "The Eagle," the closest to a family picture Valentino ever made, has that brief scene with the hero flourishing a whip before the frightened female lead).
It is about a courageous lad who faces the treachery of a mysterious black knight, who is scheming betrayal and murder...  James Mason portrays the shining knight Sir Brack who suffers the indignity of being challenged on the field of honor by a squire in the guise of a knight...  Janet Leigh plays the lovely damsel with one purpose, to answer love fully...  Robert Wagner plays the young hothead with one vow to fulfill before he can think of anything else...  Debra Paget plays the shy and charming dark-haired princess with a secret wish...  Sterling Hayden plays Sir Gawain, the perfect knight who knows that his duty is to find the Black Knight and destroy him before his treason ripens...  Victor McLaglen plays the Christian Viking hiding behind a red curtain with a long knife in his hand...  Donald Crisp plays the exiled King of Scandia who was overthrown by a Viking traitor and escapes with his wife and son across the North Sea to Britain...  Brian Aherne plays Arthur, King of the Britons, who assures Valiant that 'knighthood cannot be had for the asking...' It must be won!
Some of the special effects are very nice such as the various fish types they have made for the caves and the whole thing could easily pass as real if I hadn't been into 3D artistry from before.
All the elements are there ... actors, story and effects ... but everything seems like it could have used a couple of more rehearsals before they actually committed it to a permanent recording media.
I had seen Potter's "The Singing Detective" before viewing this.
It takes about 45 minutes before we get to see the shark, so until then the viewer is bored with mediocre acting, simple character- and story building and cheap SE.
For example, before giving Elmo magic clothes to wear to the ball, the Fairy Godperson tells Elmo that what matters is how a person behaves, who you are as a unique person, not what you wear.
For about the first half, one is engaged by the variety of characters coming before us, and the "slice of life" ruminations and quasi-philosophical discourses.
Long before the business of remaking old scare films became an industry unto itself, David Cronenberg (then-author of "The Brood" and "Scanners," among other low-budget shockers) took a 1950s B movie and (literally) transformed it into a relevant and compelling horror film.
While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes "the offspring of man and fly".
There never has been a movie like this before and there will never be one again, since the way of movie-making and story telling is so brilliantly unique of this movie.
Three years before that she even won an Oscar for her role in "The Accidental Tourist".
Cronenberg had already before this film succeeded in combining creepy biological horror with various social and/or political commentary, but here he also gives us the added aspect of a tragic love story.
Unfortunately, in the process of teleportation, his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly, and although not immediately transformed, as in the original, the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before Â and for damned good reasons.
Why is it this film that will always be his REAL 'breakout', and not any of the others before or since?
Like Frank Morgan and Walter Pidgeon before him, he is the guy who not only can, but will, sell refrigerators to the Eskimos.
Be prepared though for a Karloff you haven't seen before, all the while I just couldn't get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.
Boris Karloff acquits himself well as the troubled General Pherides, a man who has attempted to detach himself from aspects of his own past and that of his country but for whom spectres of both will arise to haunt him before he inevitably joins the soul of his long departed wife on their lonely island cemetery.
I can't think of any other films that have done that before or since.
Karloff gave another wonderful performance, before finally finishing ISLE OF THE DEAD.
Milla Jovovich was beautiful, more so than I have seen her before.
As an added bonus, you get to see Ewen McGregor before he went to the Dark Side!
Evidently this film was released overseas before it was seen locally.
I especially liked the opening scene which showed the power workout before breakfast.
Gable's behaviour before his execution is so over-the-top Subiraxian that it easily matches and rivals Cagney's behaviour in the similarly-premised "Angels With Dirty Faces" where Cagney also acts as if the electric chair is just a harmless Toys'R'Us plaything!
Very ironic that this is the movie Dillinger sneaked out (or in) to see before he got shot; to risk one's life for such a dumb movie...
William Powell, less than month before his first appearance as wealthy gumshoe Nick Charles in "The Thin Man," is the uncorruptible Manhattan DA who saved Gable's life when they were kids.
And Myrna Loy, less than a month before she first appeared as wealthy gumshoe-ette Nora Charles, is the Woman Who Loves Them Both.
Loy was a little more flexible (check out The Best Years of Our Lives), but here she is, Nora Charles before "Nora" was even born.
She was just a name, and someone who had been in films which one's parents had seen before one was born.
and children being turned to crows, and the bread, and...ok, I'm going to stop before I give away too many things.
For a hard edged movie, it failed to go anywhere, and I got tired of it long before the film ended.
It's sad to see a film like this get rated higher than a 3.1, for the only truth; If the Male leads character depicted in the movie was in fact was brought before the public in a real life scenario, we'd gather our pitch forks, and throw him to the jury yelling the sweet sounds of life imprisonment.
How far are you willing to bend before you break to another's will for .... Love or just the possibility of love.
The film's climax is like watching a hot pan of oil just before it falls off the edge of the stove.
A comedy before it's time - it's all about sustainable resources!
Linus suggests making one before going to Grandma's so Snoopy and Woodstock start getting the table and chairs.
Marcie apologizes on her friend's behalf before Patty also says she's sorry.
I read a few opinions on this website before watching Survive Style 5 and they were mostly misleading.
Although my initial cause to sought this movie out was because of Asano and the variety of comments proclaiming how this film excels over other successful features, I ended up enjoying this film simple for the reason that it was nothing like I've ever seen before.
But before wandering off, next fifteen minutes got right to the business of introducing me to more sane and insane characters and their functions in life.
He made highly successful commercials before, SS5+ is his debut film.
First, the set design and use of colour is as you have never seen before, lots of primary colours and wild, child like shapes and patterns, bit like a gingerbread house lit with neon.
I have never and you will have never seen a film like this before and I smiled happily through most of it.
The look of the movie alone was enough to blow me away: it features fanciful costumes that look nothing like any clothes I've ever seen before, sets crammed with all manner of curios, and a use of color which is simply outrageous.
before going nuts and stabbing people.
Why does the woman in commercial business run after her lost recordings, only to stop before she reaches it with a sigh: "I'm so stupid?"
Don't mind the soap-opera tag, something like this has never been done before and i doubt something to best it is to be done soon.
It's two completely absurd people who fall in love before ever meeting because they're both weirdos!!!
And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, "You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?"
I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself.
Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way.
To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared.
Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before.
Some people I spoke to before seeing "Amelie" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl.
For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us "Alien 4" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful "Delicatessen" in 1991.
Cinematographer Guy Green worked with Lean on the two Dickens adaptations before this film, and he once again shows absolute mastery of black-and-white images in this film.
L'Anglier doesn't return her letters, and after she purchases arsenic, he dies of arsenic poison, having become ill at her house once before.
The view of all the faces looking down before she starts the climb gives an idea of what it's like to be put on trial.
There's this ad in it for a movie called Shooting Fish with Kate Beckinsale in it (I love Kate Beckinsale... well did in the other two movies I'd seen her in before)with a soundtrack that's got music from Dubstar and Space and The Supernaturals and... Dionne Warwick.
Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought "Jaysis, there's something I need to see!"
Those who've read my comments before know that I dislike traditional reviews because they invariably give too much away.
I'd seen his work before (He was Ponsoldt's first choice, largely based on his performance in the indie classic "Mean Creek"), but he carries this film so confidently and easily that I left the theater shaking my head in wonderment.
As her flamboyantly traumatized and traumatizing son, Frank Langella gets to chew up the scenery, which he does with great relish (before "Dracula," after his memorable film debut in "Diary of a Mad Housewife" and Mel Brooks's adaptation of "The Twelve Chairs").
I think he could have waited until further into the film before Erin's identity were revealed and that would have helped maintain tension for longer.
Like I said before, I wish I could say I liked it, but I can't.
Somehow all three women end up at his house, when he trys to explain his situation, he falls out under a tranquilizer pill he took before.
One feels defenseless before so large aggression and single they are left desire to vomit later to see resemblance clown outfit.
I saw Sofia Vergara before in "Big Trouble," but she looks different in the movie and I might not have remembered from that previous film because well...I'm trying not to remember it period.
The first (Zaki) was previously known as a (Basha) a very well rich man before the Egyptian revolution & now he is a normal old citizen who has his teenage fantasies with many sexual relations with hookers & no job to do except avoiding his evil sister played by (Esad Younes) who kicked him out of his house & tries to send him to a psychyatric hospital at the end to vanquish him forever.
2- The streets of Cairo show the new transport green buses & minibuses which didn't exist before 2004 .
I didn't read the story before seeing that controversial movie, so I had low expectations.
When the Phone Company Rep comes to pick up the instrument (this was made long before we all owned our own phones!)
Although not up to the high standards of his previous work in "White Heat" the year before, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is still a worthy follow-up for James Cagney.
I woke up ten minutes before this movie started on TV, flicked the switch, and thought, OK cool, a James Cagney movie.
Better than those that came before, superior to those that came after.
I had been forewarned by those who have gone before into this unhallowed ground of what to expect, but I had no idea it would go as far as it did.
When he's within the abbey walls, he's seen in a rotted form(..his face is covered in a type of waxy substance)underneath his robe, watching as his brethren takes turns sexually molesting each female victim, serving their Prince of Darkness before plunging a dagger in them.
Shannon doesn't bring her A game but does enough to keep us interested, I recall years ago reading a couple of bad reviews for two of her movies at the time and I think this might have been one of them which might have put me off a little before viewing this?
The great Leslie Howard plays the genius designer, in what was to be his last 'appearance' before the camera.
Perhaps he is even more compelling in the touching solo scenes, with little or no dialogue, where, to William Walton's evocative music, he is found by his colleagues overworking himself deep into the night, trying to design the Spitfire before the imminent spread of Germanic imperialism, or, later on, close to death, scanning the skies for a sign of David Niven leading the way on the famous fighter plane.
My recollection is that he had to be up at crack of dawn and was seldom free before about 2200 hours.
If the bell went to scramble, filming would temporarily be halted while those airmen would run to their spitfires, go off and fight the war, before returning and carry on filming as though nothing had happened.
The two have never met before, and they come into contact through the hole.
This sci-fi/horror film is very unusual.I really don't want to spoil it but it has a slow beginning and middle but the climax is a long intense ending!If you haven't seen this movie before than give it a chance,it'll be a different experience for the sci-fi and horror film fan!
Having seen the movie before reading the book, however, I thought it was an interesting story.
You should always question everything before believing it, and that includes garbage like this.
now, being skeptical of the government is one thing, and it's good to be skeptical, it shows you're a human being with a mind and that your mind is smart enough to actually do research before you believe the truth.
And also many of the people that where on the plane didn't even decide to board the plane until few days before.
Schedule war games to confuse NORAD, have agents at the ready to confiscate evidence immediately following the attacks, cart away the thousands of pounds of steel as quickly as possible from ground zero and ship it overseas before it can be examined, publish photos of all 19 hijackers within days of the event, reinforcing hatred of the 'enemy' before it's even determined who the culprits are.
If you use the internet to find information, you will have to sort out the 98 percent junk you find before you can find rational thought on 9/11, yet you will find all this movie's information for free.
Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew.
So if you think about it, then the government would have to have tail all the passengers of flight 93 for several months before 9/11, if you take Dylan Avery's word.
Luke and his female officer friend seemed to have met before.
Meghan Ory steals the show as a potential girlfriend for Corey Sevier's protagonist, but when she is not in the frame, the weakness of the rest of the cast shines through like a desk lamp before the face.
Decoys was a very weird film, in fact my first impression, before I read the back, was that it had something to do with monsters or aliens roaming a snow covered forest, kind of like a Windego themed movie, but I was wrong.
So we follow our lead college male "Luke" played by Corey Sevier as he must prove to the others that Aliens do exist and they're taking over the campus before it's too late and his friends give in to sexual peer pressure.
If you get a chance give this one a watch, even though you may have seen this type of story before, it's more fun then you may think.
It's up to aimless slacker freshman Luke (winningly played by Corey Sevier) to stop them before they turn every last libidinous party hearty dude on campus into giant frosty popsicles.
There aren't any camera-angles that make you say 'wow, nobody thought of that before' either, so the end-result is very average.
She wasn't some dumb bunny who had to be hit over the head with a brick before she noticed something was up boyfriend/husband mom.
Because before that we just saw a perfectly normal guy with a nutty mom now we see a victim.
Well before all of this she finds out she is having a baby and they get married.
Oh before I forget mom hears Gwennie telling her son that she talked to his grandma and he should see her.
The makers of Kingpin and Big Lebowski should have seen this one before making a mockery of the game.
It has a whole string of good performances topped off by one of the last performances by Kirk Douglas before he had his stroke.
Saw it before, and watched it again last night, even though I normally don't watch films twice.
Incredibly, despite being co-financed by BSkyB and the Arts Council of England, and despite a warm reception at various festival screenings, LIGHTHOUSE remained on the shelf for three years before creeping into UK cinemas to lukewarm reviews and poor business.
It fared little better in the US, where the movie played briefly in theaters under a new title (DEAD OF NIGHT) before being consigned to video hell.
Please Simon (Writer & Director - so you have to take responsibility) think really long and hard before attempting another film.
It's all been done before and a million times better in loads of other straight to video slasher shockers.
The end credits roll, but does anyone believe a kid that tried to kill before won't try to do it again when he doesn't get his way?
With all this garbage they call horror coming out these days, you almost automatically become skeptic and negative-minded towards smaller productions before you've even seen them!
Heads will roll (a total of six, I believe) before the explosive ending.
So, by all means, grab your rowboats and head for the mainland before Leo Rook catches up with you.
What Conte's after is not just the killer but the source of an infectious but non-microbial malaise that will claim Nichol, too, the night before he was to marry.
Conte finds himself the prime suspect in his roommate's death and comes close to blowing his cover before his own superiors intervene.
The dog is bad, even before it dies.
"), laughs once again over great characters like Athelstone and Tuck and gets annoyed over how Ivanhoe can choose the boring Lady Rowena before foxy Olivia Hussey.
As That Certain Summer was done before the intrusion of AIDS, the film can only focus on homosexuality itself, not on the complexities of gay people reacting to crisis.
And finally, we have the biggest annoyance of all...why did Butt Chin still pull that fast one on J.K. and get poor Matt fired when all he had to do was time-travel back to before he gave the demo and tell his past self to never give it?
The muscle of Evil Co. is the assistant janitor who pounds the hell out of our hero before his girlfriend saves him with a gutter down pipe.
I am positive that this movie was meant to be thrown into a well and drowned before someone had the brilliant idea to show the entire world a movie so badly created that a scene that depicts the actual time period that they "chased" to had to shown via dates on coins.
And why is it that every time that a "INTO THE FUTURE" movie is made...does anyone not die before they get to that point in time?
There was actually a pretty complex plot, but it had been done before in Back to the Future.
Giancola was in his teens/early 20's; how many people can watch and laugh with a film they made themselves at an age before most of us moved out of the house?
