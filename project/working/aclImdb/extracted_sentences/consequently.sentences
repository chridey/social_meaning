Our cities, have consequently been designed and built (unlike most of those in Asia and much of the world, that pre-date the rise of oil) around an almost never-ending supply of cheap oil.
Unfortunately, the print quality left much to be desired: it seemed like a tenth-generation VHS copy, with the detail all soft and fuzzy and the picture excessively dark to boot; being a Paramount film, one hopes that Legend Films Â or, better still, Criterion Â will eventually get the opportunity to give this bizarre gem a decent release and, consequently, the exposure it greatly deservesÂsince Paramount themselves seem unwilling to do anything with it!
Furthermore, these characters are always self-sincere--they actually buy their own hype--and consequently, when they get caught in the act or if become aware of their own bluster and ruse, it becomes very awkward and it's really surprising how naturally the awkwardness keeps showing up.
who consequently pay with their lives for their doubts and unwillingness to really investigate, and in turn, making things worse for poor Ruby.
Of little interest to rational Fangoria or Starlog readers, it consequently killed the series dead.
It's sad Reb's real-life future did not include a Yor-2, or a Son of Yor, not even The Buns of Yor, and Reb (Mr. Brown) never again received an opportunity to demonstrate those well rounded talents so fully, consequently losing his reputation as the only actor in Hollywood who could up-stage himself by turning his back to the audience.
Dreams refer to the Freudian psychoanalytic theory of man with his desires and, consequently, German cinema partly contains the surreal.
But still what resonates most with me is an example of Chaplin's ideas that great art and, consequently great humour, comes more out of desperation and ignorance, if accompanied with a good heart, than talent and coldly calculated intellect.
Various entertainment media consequently milked the title and characters almost to death through the years, especially with a stillborn sequel and groaner TV series.
Acting, actor training and film are all open to exploitation of the gullible because so many people are desperate to be part of it; consequently it's an area ripe for satire.
Do yourself a favour on a rainy day and get out "co-ed call girl" on video - it has to be tori spellings most under acclaimed role to date -she just shines as the innocent college girl who falls into becoming a call-girl whilst starting a romance with a fellow student who wants to be a lawyer - consequently she is torn between her moral obligations and her feelings - very powerful stuff - I confound anyone who views this masterpiece not to be touched by her gritty performance.

i could see the passion and beauty that was given off by a form of dance i am not familiar with and consequently could write some better things about the heat of tango.
The DVD commentary, however, is really unfocused; the film itself is seldom talked about but it is interesting to hear the random things Christopher Lee comes out with and, consequently, it's never less than entertaining.
Being less than tepid - I've seen lawnmowers move quicker... and that's an insult to garden tools - the movie consequently stumbles sluggishly along as the 'menacing' motor hunts down the kids, who, 'frozen' (through fear of acting, no doubt) 'try' to flee, joggingly quiet, dumb through fear (or is it through shock of being cast in such a crap movie?)
There are two scenes which can more or less summaries the story: in the first one, we can see her right at the beginning in a rough quarrel with her Television supervisor, and we can consequently grasp the theme of the incessant conflict with the authority.
many years ago on Cable TV â in fact, back when I wasnât yet a Euro-Cult devotee and, consequently, ended up being rather lukewarm on it.
With the acting styles all over the map, GRAND HOTEL requires a modern viewer to make constant mental shifts; consequently, the film sometimes feels more than a little uphill.
This scene would have benefited if they had stayed closer to the novel, but for some reason they considerably shortened it and consequently that scene conveys next to none of the heartbreak and despair of the scene of the novel.
The end of the film proves just how little of a threat the Faceless Man really was to anyone, and consequently how stupid all his victims were.
The first rule of shooting a martial arts scene,especially when the actor is also a talented martial artist, is to pull the camera back and shoot it with a wide angle with longer takes and not to do so many close ups with excessively fast cutting of scenes to the point where the whole body cannot be seen and consequently the FUlL power, grace and the execution of the technique is lost to the audience.

It is no Welsh Trainspotting, only marketing people will say that and consequently only the foolish will believe that.
The two minor leads, Ed and Ein, are geniuses at what they do, but a child without a care in the world and a dog that cannot speak are wonderful comic relief and consequently very endearing.
Modern day movie makers insist on showing every little piece of crap they get on film - editing and dramatization has absolutely no meaning.. On a tangent here - look at old and new Don... the older director gives more credit to the Audience than the newer one... the new ones make it a point to spell out the subtleties consequently destroying the entire scene ( got that off my chest )  The 10 lines rule is quite painful.
Billie Holliday made some lovely records with the Teddy Wilson Orchestra in the 1930s.She made some good records for jazz impresario Norman Granz towards the end of her career,their merit largely due to her accompanying musicians as her voice was shot to pieces by then.What happened in between is the area covered by Sidney Furie's "Lady sings the blues"which uses the title if not much else of her 1958 ghosted autobiography.Like fellow 50s icons James Dean and Marilyn Monroe,Miss Holliday has achieved a post mortem fame far exceeding that she enjoyed whilst she was alive.She is repeatedly presented as a proto-lesbian,proto-bisexual,proto-feminist,proto-strong black woman or whatever label people who think it empowers them to attribute their beliefs to a dead person who is consequently unable to refute them choose to stick on her.

Magnificently-staged, the thrill meter hit climax Â consequently, it was all downhill from there.
David Yallop's "Let him have it" was riddled with inaccuracies and half - truths,consequently I approached "Chicago Joe" with some trepidation only to find that here he has got most of the facts right only for the entire movie to fall victim to the 1990's fad for faux 1940's retro,failing to grasp the most elementary fact that people during the second world war neither looked,spoke nor behaved anything like they would half a century in the future.Mr K.Sutherland is,brutally,nothing like a G.I deserter,rather he is a time - traveller visiting the past and trying to fit in to avoid discovery.Miss E.Lloyd, given the crutch of an accent to assume,does rather better as his moll/muse.

The acting is of a high standard although the actors are, in this light, pawns rather than agents and I find the film consequently weak.
And consequently, I felt all of those things.
This little softporn flick seems to have a lot going for it: especially, it has (unsurprisingly) a visibly bigger budget and consequently better production values than contemporary hard porn, and contrary to most straight-to-video erotic thrillers it spares us any connections of sex with violence.
Moroccan-born ,western educated novelist Laila Lalani points out the book (and consequently the movie) is full of prejudices against gays, resembles the old "large-scale melodramas" produced by Egypt's "huge film industry," with their "young idealists, desirable ingÃ©nues, old predators, and so on," and is crudely moralistic -- with almost every character forced to make choices that "ultimately result in either their downfall or redemption."
