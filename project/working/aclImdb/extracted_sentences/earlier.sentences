Then again, the movie claims to have been made in 1994, but it looks -- and sounds -- like it was produced at least ten years earlier, so maybe they achieved time-travel after all.
In her earlier musicals, Day was an energising presence, but slightly overstated and eager as a comedienne.
Distraught, she seeks the advice of a mysterious woman, Lisle von Rhuman whom she was referred to earlier, and she gives her what seems an innocent potion to drink which will restore her looks.
About the only negatives at all are the ending (I would have just ended the film a minute or two earlier without the unnecessary final scene) and a mistake in the film about how deep the lab was under the earth.
Through flashback it is learned these others came to arrest Boris for murder ten years earlier and they all wound up being gassed and frozen.
An earlier film I saw him in is called The Premonition, where he portrayed a rather creepy carny; also a fascinating film.
This excellent film is one of William Holden's best earlier roles...not all that far from the major stardom that was to come.
"Turks fruit" and "Keetje Tippel" (and in a way also Verhoeven's earlier movie "Wat zien ik") show some similarities in the way the story is told but it are in fact of course two totally different movies.
It then goes back twenty years earlier to a poor, Southern farmer, Jackson Fentry.
I agree with the earlier reviewer - save this for a Worst Films Night with some good friends after a few stiff drinks are had by all, and hope no friendships are ruined in the process.
I truly loved "Endgame," fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier.
But of course the Captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties.
I like the way Ella is far from perfect how she struggles and kind of fails and keep trying and fails again etc.. and how minor characters from earlier get bigger roles, especially Roxanne and Leon.
As I watched this on Fox Movie Channel earlier tonight I wasn't laughing -- because my mouth was hanging open too wide.
Note like the earlier Sesame Street movie this is a rare live movie to get a G rating from the MPAA.
It has elements of both of them, and adds quite a lot(and far more than aforementioned earlier sequel).
The level design is perhaps the tiniest step down from earlier in these, here and there, but overall it remains at the high quality of them.
The attitude towards nudity in this is the same as the earlier two, but it does somehow seem less provocative.
Of all the Hollywood studios, Warners were the most efficient at cannibalising their own material: the American 'They Drive by Night' is partially a warmed-over remake of the earlier Warners film 'Bordertown'.
A good editor would've suggested they drop some kind of hint earlier on.
The trip sequence is comprised of censored scenes from earlier Coffin Joe films and new footage.
De Lestrade's earlier cinematic critique of the US justice system, "Un Coupable Ideal," won the 2002 Academy Award for best documentary feature.
Unless you've never seen any of them, this is a retread of several tropes from earlier films in the series.
We get shots of Yakima Canutt jumping on a horse, and plunging off a cliff into a river, among many shots repeated from earlier films in the series.
It's clearly a Corman knock-off of earlier brother avenges brother efforts, but it's head and shoulders above most of the crumby video fodder that was being fed to the hungry market at the time.
That is, by the time that we have been subjected to the asininity of all the supporting characters in the dialogue sections of the film, we really do not want to see them partake in the fights--and more than once I found myself wishing that the screenwriters had done away with these characters earlier in the story so as to not involve them in any but one or two of the action sequences.
If you want a innovative and exciting shooter, go play Half-Life 2 (again), or the new Portal-mod I mentioned earlier.
Pulled from an earlier release date because of 9/11, this film couldn't have made you feel more at home in New York than actually being there in person.
Certainly, he is one gifted movie maker, as evidenced by his earlier films, including The Brothers McMullen and She's the One.
In Sidewalks, he again probes relationships in the modern era, when sex can be around every corner and the more traditional marriage of an earlier age is absent.
Also, it was nice to see Raul Julia, Demond Wilson and Ron O'Neal in one of their earlier films.
And Helen Shaver, in one of her earlier roles, is ideal as the friend who is accepting of people for who they are, embellishing their positive traits.

Oxygen is one of those great little surprises that will have you saying, "Gee, why didn't I give this one a try earlier?"
He made a better ham in the RE-ANIMATOR series and the injecting of the green fluid into his neck is a silly cue from those earlier films.
This frisson of mortality undercuts the film's essential conservatism, and differentiates it from the sinister surveillance of the earlier 'Sortie d'Usine'.
Daniel Auteil who usually plays hapless contemporary men at first looks as out of place in a period costume drama as Harvey Keitel does, but he brings the intellectual and moral sensibility of the 20th century to a true story from an earlier one.
An earlier writer was right - this IS cinema de qualite, fifty years after.
Ashoka was born of one of Bindusara's Indian wives, which makes Ashoka at least one quarter Greek -- he was the very fusion of the Greco-Indian classical tradition, snd it was he who caused to be erected the collossal Buddhas at Bamiyan, destroyed earlier this year by the Taliban government in Afghanistan.
Three years earlier famous polar explorer Roal Amundsen had flown over the Pole using another of Nobile's airships, the 'Norge', and it was the subsequent fight for who deserved the most credit (engineer, explorer or airship pilot) that led to Nobile's fateful expedition with 'Italia'.
However, far from having to be persuaded to join the rescue attempts, Amundsen had immediately volunteered only for Mussolini to specifically insist he be excluded because of his earlier public disputes with Nobile in the aftermath of their previous expedition, leaving Amundsen to finance his rescue attempt privately.
Directed by Clint's protÃ©gÃ© Richard Tuggle (who wrote the screenplay to the earlier Siegel-Eastwood classic ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ (1979), the film's first half is uncertain and suffers from clichÃ©d (albeit well staged and visualised) New Orleans locations - shady whorehouse dives, red light tinged bars and over officious police procedural rooms and locker-room banter.
I caught myself at wanting this to finish, much earlier than it actually did.
I had read about something at the end of the movie which I was curious to see, otherwise I would have left the theater much earlier.
Guillermin handles the huge cast with such ease, you can easily see the likeness in his earlier film "THE TOWERING INFERNO" in which he gracefully directed more than 15 major stars and their roles and made the audience care about each and every one of them.
This was the second of Agatha Christie's novels featuring Hercule Poirot to be filmed, after the success of 'Murder On The Orient Express' a few years earlier.
But the best parts of the film, has to be scenes set during Curtis' classes (the visuals I mentioned earlier).
Real Time, the second feature of writer/director Randall Cole (19 Months) made its Canadian debut at the Toronto International Film Festival after being the opening night feature at the Slamdance Festival earlier this year.
She performs "Gone With the Wind" a tawdry nightclub act shown earlier in the film, where the gimmick is that the "wind" blows up the woman's dress Then she screams, "DON'T ANYBODY LEAVE THE ROOM.
In these later scenes, in another of the movie's nice compositional touches, she does a reprise of a hoochie musical number performed earlier by a girlfriend of her husband's, and then falls into her husband's arms, apparently drunk.
The one thing I would have allowed for earlier in the story would be showing Peppard's character and his prowess with a knife.
This particular body is that of a secret agent that succumbed twenty years earlier to self injection of a blood sample from a...werewolf.
Forest Whitaker, as said earlier, gives the best performance of the movie, and one of the better supporting performances of the year.
From there the story rewinds to 23 minutes earlier at 12:00.
But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!
Anyway, he does an OK job & he integrates Harryhausen's effects & monsters into the action quite well although no one set piece really stands out as being brilliant, they're all very good but not as memorable as some of the other monsters & fights Harryhausen created for some of his earlier films.
The curious class decided to take a trip to the countryside and look for the pig, only to discover that the pig had been eaten up earlier on the same day (it was just a convenient excuse for Young-ju, as there was in reality no such intelligent pig).
As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot of parts that I found so funny that I was either finding myself almost lightheaded from laughing so hard, or finding myself obnoxious because I would struggle to recoup in order to read the subtitles in time to not miss anything.
After the token black fifth wheel is snuffed out, the survivors (plus a young woman who escaped an earlier sacrifice attempt) stumble onto a very small town inhabited by (surprise!)
It's really interesting to see him in an earlier incarnation on screen rather than onstage.
Some so-called (they call themselves) RGV fans have given comments earlier about the movie which are only distracting the RGV fans (may be they will review Ramu's Sarkar in the same way), I request them not to do this and go for traditional Bollywwod masala flicks.
If I compare this movie to Verma's earlier movie 'satya', 'D' depicted a more realistic transition of a individual turning in to a gangster.
However as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the movie is about an assassination on General Patton instead and the movie turns into a whole different movie entirely, almost more in the same style as "The Day of the Jackal", which was made 5 years earlier.
Max is initially suspicious when Jay appears and takes sides with the downtrodden citizens, especially a crusading journalist that Kirby had earlier beaten up.
The detective investigating the earlier murder, Joe Vitucci (Joe Grifasi), points up evidence that may indicate Brooke is actually the killer.
These performances are masterful, Penn really departs from his trouble maker persona in so many of his earlier movies and shows depth that I really didn't expect from him.
In its crummy look (the sets consist of the railroad siding, the boarding house, and a back-lot park) and creepy story, as well as in its ultimate surrender to an all-powerful and malevolent Fate, Inner Sanctum most resembles Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour of three years earlier.
I wrote an earlier review for "The Good Woman of Bangkok" and I found Bangkok Girl far less contrived and more up to date.
Thus, I cannot compare this to the earlier ones.
But aside from that, the cast is strong and the film is well directed by Lew Landers, who also directed Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff in The Raven some years earlier.
This is a "Biblical" account as seen through the eyes of black people during the earlier days of the 20th century.
First of all, I have to agree with one of the earlier comments that the show is just a lame a rip off of Jim Henson's "Muppet Babies" (without the funny fantasy segments).
Personally, I prefer the simpler plot and tighter pacing of the earlier film.
Frankly i went in expecting another average fare from Nagesh, cos i havent liked his earlier films.
It is pulled into a supernatural time warp that sends it to the same place, but 39 years earlier.
Through a very amusing incident, they are able to afford a much-needed housekeeper to help them, Liva, the prostitute we met a short time earlier in Copenhagen.
I saw her in High Fidelity earlier in 2000, and thought she was good.
In many respects "Two-Lane Blacktop" holds up better than the much more celebrated "Easy Rider" released a year or two earlier.
Even though "Easy Rider" came earlier and was much more successful, "Two Lane Blacktop" is a far superior film.
Gracie had to make decisions for everyone, basically she put her life on hold, And as mentioned earlier, her boyfriend came across as stupid, one moment he's in love and admiring her strength and the next he's urging her to chuck it in and throw her lot with him and "his nouveau riche" family.
The Warners team do a great job in creating a fresh new swashbuckler for more cynical Post-War audiences (Flynn character is more knowing and sarcastic, but in a good way), whilst being an affectionate tribute AND send-up to the earlier great classics.
Yes, it was a parody of the secret-agent genre of the 1960s that peaked several years earlier, but I guess the picture is so disappointing because it seems to be built instead around the person of Dean Martin, and his real life image as that of a heavy drinking swinger.
This,the fourth and last of the Matt Helm movies has a lot to recommend it and has serious credentials to be one of the most interesting films of the 60s and that is for a variety of reasons.One of these is the appearance of the late Sharon Tate who gives a very appealing comic performance in her final movie.The attractive 60s star Dahlia Lavi makes a good villainess and is a fine foil for Nigel Greene a respected English actor (who was later to die tragically) as the evil Count Contini.He had played a similar role in the earlier British spy thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE.Nancy Kwan also appears and so does Chuck Norris in a "blink and you'll miss him"screen debut.The reason Norris was in it at all was because of the movies' fight choreographer,none other than the legendary Bruce Lee himself and he does sterling work giving the many hand to hand combat scenes in THE WRECKING CREW a zest that was rare in action movies of the period that featured martial arts.
From the opening shot of over thirty trumpeters heralding the start of major work of art producer David O. Selznick wanted to top A TALE OF TWO CITIES made just two years earlier and also starring Ronald Colman, and he does.
Considering that this is a bit of a silly clichÃ© and that he did THE MASQUERADER several years earlier, this makes THE PRISONER OF ZENDA a bit less original than I'd earlier thought, so I am now scoring the movie with a 9 instead of a 10.
Dumas had some stories set in "modern Europe" ("The Count Of Monte Cristo" is set in the period of 1815 - 1830, and was written in 1844 - 1845), but most were in earlier periods, such as the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries.
The crown prince's predilection for the bottle recalls Colman's earlier portrayal of the dark side of Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities.
Jamie disappeared a few years earlier, and hints begin to emerge that he may have been carried off by the many seals that haunt the island where he lived.
While things should have been wrapped up a couple of scenes earlier, no real harm was done.
When I happened to catch Le Secret (probably 1982) I was stunned that I had never heard of it and had no memory of its release in the U.S. eight years earlier.
Fortunately, someone decided to tape a live performance of this newer version, capturing much more of the energy and audience response which was missing from the earlier film.
In true Topper fashion, her ghost finds the next-door neighbor who had given them both a lift earlier, one Cosmo Topper.
From earlier days, and continuing today, two of the cornerstone attractions in the Branson area are Silver Dollar City theme park (modeled after an 1880's silver mining complex, but with 21st-century New York City or Hollywood pricing) and The Shepherd of the Hills farm, the original cabin, the large outdoor amphitheater which presents a lavish production of the story, a restaurant, gift shop, etc.
In fact Hathaway had directed the first outdoor technicolor film in the same Ozark area for Paramount five years earlier in The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.
The heir apparent (Saif Ali Khan), who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives, is summoned home for her funeral.
I recommend it highly to horror fans, along with the same director's earlier "Paperhouse".
There's a lot more to the movie than this--including a REASON for the plague that did this to the people and explained why he was immune (something forgotten in the earlier version of this film that starred Vincent Price).
This film is rare in that it's a remake of an earlier film AND it's actually better than the original!
An earlier comment about the quality of the movie on tape was accurate.
PS--On a sad note, you might want to compare the Errol Flynn in this film to the same man in movies from just three or so years earlier.
John Galsworthy's sometimes ponderous but very interesting social drama "The Forsyte Saga" has been attempted as a TV-mini series since this production of a feature film, based on the earlier books of the series, was issued by MGM Studios' heads.
I noticed bean's acting limitation here; I always made allowances for him in earlier episodes given his social background etc., but here he just seems constantly numb.
So, I give Sharpe's Challenge a 7 out of 10, primarily because I liked the 14 earlier Sharpe movies so much.
For me, what made the earlier Sharpe movies so wonderful was that epic story lines were taken and woven into an intimate scale.
But still it's hard to forget all those memorable characters from the earlier movies, such as Hagman, Harris, and Frederickson, whose story lines were often as or more interesting than even Sharpe's.
(For instance, a lot more extras are used in battle scenes than we're used to seeing in earlier installments.)
Of course, I realize there were many changes made in the earlier episodes, but here are a couple of reasons why:   1.
We miss the wonderful situations involving the young(er) Hakeswill, played so marvelously by Pete Postlethwaite in earlier episodes.
Reminiscent of the film "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", this feature takes aspects of several of the earlier Sharpe novels and combines them to create a new plot/storyline.
At the same time, it addresses the earlier (chronologically in the series, if not in order of publishing) exploits of Private/Sergeant/Lieutenant Sharpe during the Indian campaigns.
Â although I must say I prefer the much cheesier video title "Carquake" Â is brought to us by the same team that made the brilliant and unequaled "Death Race 2000" one year earlier, and it many ways it feels as if writer/director Paul Bartel injected all the silly comedy that he couldn't put in "Death Race" into this film instead.
Has I said earlier, try to see it like a Nietzsche statement about how fake and hypocrite our whole society his.
There was an earlier film which interviewed gay male Holocaust survivors.
E: The already-mentioned axe-boomerang scene, and a terribly edited spear-throwing scene a few seconds earlier.
Andrew had been in love with Little Miss when she married 50 or so years earlier, but as just an android could do nothing about it.
The story opens with a duel between the two in a dusty Mexican village and the whole movie is a flashback that leads us to the events at the start of the movie, again as in The Mercenary two years earlier.
Vascos is sent to accompany him, having already suffered much humiliation as a result of an earlier confrontation with the Swede.
Like most Corbucci westerns there is a political undertone to the film and the plot revolves around the Mexican revolution (similar to A Professional Gun which Corbucci directed 2 years earlier).
Rocky has a more diplomatic approach that seems to have been more effective back in earlier times around when the group was founded.
Jean Gabin would go on to appear as Inspector Maigret in 2 subsequent films - MAIGRET ET L' AFFAIRE SAINT-FIACRE (1959; which I've caught up with a couple of years ago) and MAIGRET VOIS ROUGE (1963) - and work a further 5 times with director Delannoy (including the afore-mentioned second Maigret film); interestingly enough, Delannoy himself would abandon his own artistic aspirations shown earlier in two major French films of the 1940s - L'ETERNEL RETOUR (1943) and LA SYMPHONIE PASTORALE (1946) - to concentrate on modest genre offerings (of which MAIGRET SETS A TRAP is the best-known and probably best overall as well) for the rest of his career.
To reiterate the point made earlier, fast-forward to the sex or don't watch this one.
The fact that he falls in love with Christine in no way makes up for his earlier actions.
Thus, Yamashita's failure to express his yearning for Keiko is set against Dojima's earlier lovemaking with her, and a fellow ex-convict's attempted rape.
But screenwriters John Lee Mahin (can this really be the same guy who wrote the lively, bawdy "Red Dust" 20 years earlier?)
As I said in my review of the earlier and lesser straight 1940 version, the plot is much more elaborate this time around â not only do we get an attempt to evacuate the community to make way for A-Bomb tests (a nice touch of topicality) but Abner, Marryinâ Sam (Stubby Kaye) and later many of the people of Dogpatch go to Washington to present the Government with an essential homegrown product (the town had been deemed âthe most useless in the U.S.A.â) and then to save the naÃ¯ve Abner from the clutches of megalomaniac General Bullmoose (Howard St. John).
Peter Palmer had he come along even 10 years earlier might have given folks like Howard Keel and Gordon MacRae competition for musical leads in film.
She is raped under odd circumstances by an earlier flame.
I always found the movie vague, as you can read in an earlier comment on the movie, although this has changed recently because I decided to watch it again for a report I had to make for religion class (I recommend you to also watch this movie if you need to make a similar report).
The hero and heroine are regular folk caught in the maelstrom of old Europe and its cryptic wickedness, not that far from the two earlier breakthrough films.
Imagine Raven a little earlier than when he met up with Veronica Lake and got into the home of a couple like Bickford and Royle and you have a pretty good idea of what Ladd's character Choya is like in Branded.
He becomes involved in a scheme to bilk a wealthy cattle rancher by posing as the long lost son who was kidnapped by bandits some 25 years earlier.
Clever tricks abound - we see a grisly horror film being enjoyed by Hartwin reflected on his eyeball in an extreme close up, while in an earlier flashback the camera travels under the sheets to watch him reading under his bedclothes as a child.
As is probably obvious by the lurid title, Massimo Dallamano returns to the same teenagers in peril themes he explored two years earlier in his giallo What Have You Done to Solange.
The first of the two scenes comes when Jenny attempts some everyday tasks as a blind person--she tries to set the clock, as I mentioned earlier, and she also tries to make a phone call.
His character is an engineer and architect and is given the name -- Poelzig -- of a famous expressionist German architect and film set designer of the time, who was a colleague of the director on an earlier film.
An undeserved BOMB of 1967, directed by A. Litvak co-starring the golden boys of five years earlier in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (GREAT FILM), with a great supporting cast - Pleasance, J. Pettet, Tom Courtenay, Charles Gray..etc., it was the wrong year to talk about NAZI officers being private pervert/murderers in a world that was concerned about MODERN issues...like who was Robert Wagner dating that Summer?
As stated earlier by others the movie was interesting till the end.
The crimes are being investigated by Major Grau (Omar Sharif), who is as determined to solve this case as Inspector Javert was to capture Jean Valjean a century earlier.
The film stars Vincent Price in one of his earlier starring roles.
I loved the special appearance by Gulshan Grover, him doing kind of a parody of his earlier "bad man"-character, though i'm not so sure if it was intentional or not.
This gives the Suttons and the investigating detective enough time to arrive at the crime scene where they eventually confront Korvo, who drops dead from blood loss (apparently his hypnotic suggestions are not powerful enough to stanch the bleedingÂcomplications from his surgery earlier that afternoon).
Well, as a follow up to Preminger's "Laura" of a few years earlier, this doesn't quite clear the bar.
But it's now four years after the end of prohibition and the real gangsters of earlier Warner Brothers films (including Bogart as a thug, along with Davis, appearing briefly in the great pre-code 1932 film, Three on a Match) are mostly gone from real life.
The result was almost bound for success, and though the movie is known now mostly as Bogart's breakthrough movie (his earlier films had him typecast as a second-string villain), it is really not Bogart who dominates it, but Howard.
As much as I love the early, raw films of Martin Scorsese- who reputedly thought up this tale with Cassavetes a few years earlier, no film I've ever seen so perfectly captures the mid-1970s Underworld as I knew it as a child.
He owns a rather ratty strip club/cabaret joint on the Sunset Strip that fronts production values and performers of the qualities mentioned earlier, does middling business, and spends nearly every dime he makes "living the high life" or the "the image" of what someone in his profession should espouse.
That scene does make up a little for the flaws I grumbled about earlier, though definitely not entirely.
Add to that are the many interior scenes in run-down tenements and so forth, all evocative of the spooky corridors of those earlier films.
There are some awkward changes to the plot and I agree with the earlier reviewer who points out the impossible time differences that ensue - not well thought out.
It takes me to an earlier time of innocence.
Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.
One reason why the film wasn't so popular is that just a few years earlier, the first Emmannuelle film, based on a supposedly true book by Ammanuelle Arson, was released with much hoopla - and seen by many people, most of whom did not particularly like it, myself included.
Its all about patriotism and what not, just like some movies i watched earlier, Mission Kashmir?
Just seconds earlier we see a shark destroying the energy and radio-cables and we learn that the ship on the surface can't contact the base and obviously no one knows what's going on below them.
A film version with a more substantial script (including some reference to her earlier life) and two standout lead performances would be a dish to be relished, unfortunately currently only in anticipation.
My only complaint is that I would have liked to have seen more about her earlier life, how she managed to throw fabulous dinner parties despite World War 2 rationing by catching and cooking whatever unfortunate wildlife strayed into her garden, why she abandoned her children and just what made her tick.
It came out a year earlier.
Now that Proyas is getting a larger budget for I, Robot this year, I felt that it would be time to credit Proyas' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that I, Robot would only live up to this film.
Which leads me to....drumroll.....  As such, IMHO, the best execution on the concept of reality and perception was already explored in a much more unbelievably visual opus, one year earlier, the grossly overlooked, criminally under-rated,  "Dark City".
It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics.
Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between "Air Force One" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller "Das Boot"/"The Boat" (1981).
It is also inhabited by the sole survivor of an earlier expedition, Henry Brandon.
At least this one is somewhat watchable, unlike his earlier epic "Totally Blonde."
Thsi is one of those movies that was at some point in my earlier childhood that i was obsessed with.I mean this was my favorite movie at the times.Now ill go back and look at this, and obviously I don't love it as much as I did, but I still like it a lot.This film is just so good, and so enjoyable that I can see why I liked it the way I did.Well, now that i understand the film more, i realize that there was some stuff that was not really necessary, and it was a bit to long, but its still a good movie.This movie is just so much fun, and good that its very lovable that anyone could find at least something they liked.Every now and then ill watch this, and remember why I fell in love with this great and funny movie.Overall its a good movie that can be enjoyed by anybody, and is worth a viewing from.
I couldn't understand why the leading man did what he did -- until I read some of the other film comments and found out about the "promise" made from earlier on in the movie.
Legendary costume designer Edith Head did her final work on this film, which is fitting since she did many of the costumes on the earlier films.
Steinbeck caught most of the heat for this, as he had for an earlier screenplay, "The Moon is Down," that humanized a German soldier.
I have seen it numerous times, and can not wait for it to be put on DVD, like Hitch's earlier works...from the 30s.
I can't say that I agree with the earlier poster who claims the film doesn't represent gay men's films.
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) tells nostalgic and emotional stories about his National Service (which had been abolished for almost two decades when this film was made) and how he began his career as a street urchin An hour earlier, he had been proclaiming his glorious vision of 1980s Britain while Â in a rather unsubtle piece of direction Â framed by Tower Bridge.
Santoni actually played a character based on the young Carl Reiner in the semi-autobiographical "Enter Laughing" fifteen years earlier.
A young Seth Rogen provides some dry humor for most of the earlier episodes, and shows some genuine dramatic talent during the latter ones.
Much later I received a phone call from my girlfriend telling me that she wanted to discuss a rumour that she heard about a 'gentleman's only' weekend in Amsterdam, which I thought I'd got away with a few months earlier.
Well now I'm sure I've uncovered an earlier example of this bizarre phenomenon.
The following day, the couple head out to interview the locals and ask them for their opinions on the tragedy that happened only a week earlier.
came out one year earlier.
Somebody wrote in an earlier review that Gerry didn't do his own singing.
Paulette Goddard, in the role of Southern belle Loxi, conjured up images of what would have been if she had been cast as Scarlett in Gone With the Wind four years earlier, instead of Vivien Leigh.
One of the earlier reviews was talking about how all of the bad things that happen to Natty are inappropriate for a disney movie, but I think that those are the things that make this film so great.
This film outdoes his earlier Scarface in nearly every way - namely, the actors have more of an opportunity to act, the score is better, the action is less drawn-out, etc.
Tomas Milian plays Interpol officer Tomas Ravelli, who finds himself on the trail of a gang of crooks after a botched robbery which left a police officer dead reveals that one of them is using the same gun that was used to kill his wife years earlier.
His earlier, frequent collaborations with Edwige Fenech are almost legendary and produced some of the best films this genre has to offer.
Like the earlier Giallo, The Dead Are Alive, this film focuses on the ancient 'Etruscan' civilisation.
Whitney and English direct in fine style.The primitive musical score [used in earlier serials],detracts.
William Powell was hit on the head nine years earlier and has had amnesia.
It seems that nine years earlier, Carey received a blow to the head, which turned him into Wilson.
William Powell is bonked on the head and suddenly he's a completely different person--one who apparently disappeared nine years earlier.
On a small cruise ship, Leonor Silveira, playing a young attractive school teacher traveling with her daughter, points out and comments on sites as they retrace Vasco da Gama's year-long voyage from Lisbon to India some five hundred years earlier -- this time sailing through the Mediterranean Sea and Suez.
The story of her final year, told in this film by Nick Broomfield (who had made another film earlier during her journey through the U.S. legal system), makes highly disturbing viewing.
Broomfield's earlier film centred on the grotesque way almost everyone involved in the case tried to sell their story to the media.
He already killed one, and the other was killed in a Mexican shootout earlier in the film.
They were doomed from the day the teenage princess arrived at Versailles (no mention of Fountainbleu), through the childless years of their marriage and near annulment of same; the extravagant lifestyle of Marie from boredom, the betrayal of the French court; the totally fictional "diamond necklace" hoax; their hopeless attempt to rule wisely as good parents; their attempted escape and capture; their separate imprisonment, with Louis XVI's execution much earlier than Marie's; her hoax of a trial including fictional accusation of incest with her son; and her eventual execution.
He goes to Soho to visit, late at night, an odd girl he just met in a coffee shop earlier that day.
It takes place in NYC, and its dark scary streets come directly from Scorsese's earlier masterpieces, "Mean Streets" (the streets after hours are even meaner, are they not?)
Mick Travis wanted to succeed in life while Paul Hacket only wanted some fun night and perhaps to get close to a beautiful woman he'd met earlier (Rosanna Arquette).
The movie came in the WB Box Set released with Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and a few other of the filmmakers lesser known, earlier films.
Our film deals with a mild-mannered Manhattan office worker taking a late night trip to the Soho district to meet up with a beautiful woman he first encountered earlier in the evening.
Griffin Dunne plays Paul Hackett, who is bound and determined to hook up with Marcy (Rosanne Arquette) whom he met in a restaurant earlier that evening.
I encourage those who get caught up with the flashy title to instead search for something meaningful, like John Woo's earlier films.
After victory, the earlier Godzilla would walk off to the sea.
If you stop the frame where the killer is standing outside the building after doing the deed you can clearly see the man is definitely older and shorter than Sean Connery is and he is not dressed as well, he also is not carrying the cane that Connery was holding earlier in the tavern scene.
Also, it was just a little surprising to see the Hercules character riding off with the heroine at the end (having the opposite thing happen seems like almost as much of a Peplum tradition as a tradition of earlier westerns).
The best news tho is that the new DVD edition of "There's Nothing.." not only has a MUCH better transfer than the earlier video release (and is letterboxed), but also a bunch of fun extras and commentary.
I saw this on TCM and had read in several review books that this was a bomb remake of an earlier picture with Elizabeth Bergner,but I was charmed by this film and like Ida Lupino and Errol Flynn's chemistry a lot.
I'll admit, I wasn't expecting too much when this appeared on CBC earlier tonight, but I was pleasantly surprised.
In an earlier review, written back in my naive, less-educated-in-Cinema-days, I stated that "Captain America" was the greatest super-hero film ever made.
If I was only able to get in earlier, it would have been nice to meet Robert Plant and Jimmy Page.
No pulled punches and not a speck of self-referential wit here, just classic stalker/slasher mayhem, presented by Hooper in a style that skillfully evokes the low-budget, grainy realism of such earlier fright flicks as his own '74 classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
"Toolbox Murders", while being interpreted as a "remake" of an earlier film with the same name, is given a powerful upgrade and the story shines thanks to the duties of fright master Tobe Hooper.
An earlier review chastises the Robert's character for "poisoning" her husband.
Charming, touching story of a very lively 9 yr old Mexican boy who goes on an interesting road trip in search of his mother who sneaked across the border four years earlier with the dream of providing a better life for her son.
Rosario (Kate del Castillo) is a single mother who crossed the border four years earlier in order to support her young son Carlitos (a superb young actor, Adrian Alonso) and her ailing mother by working double jobs as a housekeeper in Los Angeles.
While I like the extreme silliness of these earlier starring films, I also see this as a welcome change and his most personally engaging film--it really has a lot of heart.
Made 34 years ago, "Play It Again, Sam" holds up very well and I would call it my favorite earlier Woody's film and the best Woody's film that he has not directed.
In the end the killer is predictable from the characters actions earlier in the movie and the final chase scene is pretty dull compared to others.
Sadly, I didn't recognize this great show until earlier this week, only to hear it was canceled with only 5 seasons?
Less blonde than in some earlier films, and far more subdued, she plays the indispensable, smart, and efficient secretary of Clark Gable.
Unlike Morris's earlier documentaries on an animal cemetery or a Texas murder case, none of the speakers really holds the camera in thrall.
All in all, it is hard to believe that this flick was made in the late 60s (1968) and I agree with another contributor here that it seems to be the sort of film that they made twenty-five years earlier, i.e.
Make sure you get the more recent Kino Video release (VHS or DVD) -- there was an earlier VHS version that was all but unwatchable.
And don't forget the ending with Anna (Alida Valli) walking along the road a second time just like an earlier scene.
Added bonus: Jarrod Barkley from Big Valley in his first role (he looks exactly the same 20 years earlier).
American forces haven't been fully deployed into the Vietnamese jungles yet, but Major Asa Barker is assigned to set up a barricade at an abandoned post at Muc Wa (where 10 years earlier 302 French soldiers were massacred by the Viet Cong), but at his disposal is only a few American soldiers and ragtag bunch of Vietnamese volunteer soldiers.
The Americans find themselves falling into the same trap that the French fell into just a few years earlier.
My advice is to stick with Woo's later material such as "Face/Off" or his earlier Hong Kong career such as the gritty cop film "Lashou Shentan" ("Hard Boiled").
Director Woo knows how to turn in a decent action flick & he doesn't disappoint here, while the unmistakable style of his earlier Hong Kong films may have been slightly sterilised by Hollywood the set-pieces in his films still remain very impressive.
I haven't seen much of her earlier work, and always thought of her as the Mother Superior in "The Trouble With Angels".
A remake of an earlier film (THE FRONT PAGE, 1931), itself a film version of a 1928 play, HIS GIRL Friday was remade again as THE FRONT PAGE in 1976 and yet again in 1988 as SWITCHING CHANNELS, with Kathleen Turner nicely holding up in her portrayal of the role that cemented Rosalind Russell as a skilled comedienne, this time set in media TV.
There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE, starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns, and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson.
(I've got the 2002 edition, and from what I've heard you should beware of earlier DVD issues).
This movie more focuses on the action of the movie instead of the sadness involved, but in most respects as said earlier, it is a step up.
In conclusion, across the board, all parts of this film work together to produce quite a challenging and fascinating piece well worth watching, but bear in mind the warning of offense mentioned earlier.
This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.
If you look carefully, you can see that many of the boys have struggled to turn their 70s hairstyle to match those over a decade earlier.
It's this fact that made Star Wars work so well, and it's nice to see the same effort transplanted into an earlier film that doesn't have the special effects and grandiose that Star Wars had.
Perheaps Hans Weingartner is the man to change that, his earlier film Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei was a great comedy/drama.
As a soon-to-be-wed New York nabob of indistinguishable profession, she is confronted by a ten-year-old boy claiming to be the man who widowed her ten years earlier, reincarnated.
All of the art work is first rate and much more impressive than in the earlier Disney shorts from '33 and onward.
His last film role was earlier that year, playing Jesse James in 'A Time for Dying.'
There are characters that resemble the ones from Fellini's earlier films.
The symbolism on display throughout is typically oblique, but it's effortlessly played for laughs in a way that few of his earlier films managed.
A director who was capable of describing such a multiplicity of viewpoints (in his earlier film, Traffic) or bringing a real character to life on screen with emotional force (as in Erin Brockovich) was giving me something rather bland and unquestioning (Oliver Stone's insipid Comandante was already coming to mind).
In terms of performance, the earlier part of the movie is spoiled by the horrid acting of Winston Chao.
Like Ritchie's earlier SMILE, TBNBs pokes fun not so much at an American institution (in this case little league baseball), but at the frequent nitwits who run this type of thing.
Displaying the same wise-ass mien that won her an Oscar three years earlier (with more generous outpourings of profanity), she more than holds her own against the veteran Matthau, even teaching his character a lesson or two about team spirit and sportsmanship, while evoking sympathy on her own as she is forced to confront more personal, off-the-field problems.
It's nice to see his parents once again, as in several of the earlier films, playing such important roles in his life.
The sets and costumes and even the special effects were actually rather good but not more impressive than UFO four or five years earlier.
The local TV station aired the first season Fridays at 7 pm, the same time slot that it had used for Star Trek a decade earlier.
The rest of the film is exactly the kind of glossy soap opera that starred the likes of Lana Turner a decade earlier, but overlaid with grimy layer of smut.
Not quite on par with Mattei's earlier work, like my favorite, Hell Of The Living Dead, and not quite as real as the ones from the golden era (minus Cannibal Terror), but a rare treat, no matter how you look at it.
Each actor contributed in their minor roles, - nice to see Stephen Boyd in an earlier role - Lloyd Nolan seen rather briefly, and Mai Zetterling as the nurse who was supportive throughout.
Beverly Hills Cop 2 was released in May of 1987, and so came just after things like Top Gun, Police Academy 3, The Color of Money, To Live and Die in L.A. (which was sort of an anti-buddy cop movie with a mean streak that is clearly reflected in Cop 2), Eddie Murphy's own The Golden Child, and the original Lethal Weapon, which was released just a few months earlier and may have been sharing theaters with it.
If you're going to be in New York, don't miss this increasingly meaningful piece of sculpture - but first see its setting as it looked 70 years earlier in delightful PENGUIN POOL MURDERS!
As crazy as Jim Carrey got in some of his earlier movies (Ace Ventura, Liar, Liar, etc) he's actually lower-key than in some of the other stupid-guy roles he played, one reason because he's doesn't shout in here.
In the context of Fredi Murer's career, this film address themes that he explored in earlier works such as Alpine Fire and Full Moon, but here with a lighter, less moralistic tone.
The movie's what could've been only redeeming factor namely the action scenes besides the one I've spoken of earlier aren't really all that good.
See No Retreat, No Surrender 2 (Loren Avedon) and Carter Wong's earlier work like, Hapkido, Kids of Shaolin or even Big Trouble In Little China.
But it's hardly the equal of several comedies from the 70's, especially the early years of MASH, or Bob Newhart, let alone classic earlier shows like Van Dyke or Andy Griffith.
And then that ugly "Russian" woman,she looks awful,why couldn't she die earlier?
With this short as her introduction, Red was the sexy distraction for the oversexed, lusting "Wolf" character that was introduced earlier in the 1942 short "Blitz Wolf."
Also, it is no mystery why Colin Firth got type cast as Darcy Â he appeared earlier in the costume drama Valmont, but he seems to be most remembered for this `Darcy'; he seems to be made for this role (wasn't it amusing that his character's name in `Bridget Jones Diary' was `Darcy'?)
This has amazing music, if there may be more lyrics than earlier in the series; then again, they are fantastic, and like the second, this does, as it needs to, distinguish itself(without deviating so much that we get alienated), they can't all be carbon-copies, they have to do something new.
I saw Shake Hands with the Devil not long ago, on Radio-Canada, and it was a very strong counter to Hotel Rwanda, which I had seen just days earlier.
A Quiet Place to Kill is not be confused with the earlier Orgasmo, though unfortunately confusing the pair is very easy as they're from the same director, both feature American actress Carroll Baker and they were both released under the title 'Paranoia'!
Like Lenzi's earlier 'So Sweet, So Perverse', it would appear that the plot has been lifted from the French classic 'Les Diaboliques', and focuses on a love triangle.
A few earlier comments express the concern that the film does not "let the GAY man be gay".
Features that were missed earlier(such as a "move *and* attack" command...
The effects are considerably more realistic-looking than in earlier efforts, with smoke, fire, the works.
The three sides are remarkable in how even they are(though it should be noted that the way they are set up is essentially an idea from earlier RTS titles, including StarCraft), and all have some interesting stuff to play around with, as well as an arsenal that makes them formidable foes, and satisfying to play as.
Takeshi Miike is probably the biggest name in the Asian horror biz, but I have to say that I miss the style of his earlier work, like Audition and Happiness of the Katakuri's.
What I like about the ending of these earlier 'Dirty Harry' films, was how they weren't afraid to end on such an powerful note involving something represented visually to express the mindset, as the camera slowly zooms out and the harrowing score cues in.
Grant, believing his wife (Dunne) to have drowned 7 years earlier in a shipwreck, remarries.
When I said earlier that homosexuality was taken seriously, I meant it.
Randolph Scott is good too in one of his freewheeling earlier roles.
It was only moments earlier that she had been pulling strange faces at herself in the mirror; - the kind of thing that you would do if you had been in swallowing LSD for the past twenty-four hours.
The classic series "Julia" was groundbreaking for its time in 1968,some three years earlier before Bill Cosby broke color barriers for his work(and won the Emmy for Best Actor) on the series "I Spy".
The film makes a fine, though essentially unpleasant, companion piece to the more literate and subtle THE BODY SNATCHER (1945); the theme was again handled (by another horror veteran, Freddie Francis) a quarter of a century later in THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS (1985) - while Gilling himself had contributed to the script of an earlier variation, THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART (1948), starring Tod Slaughter!
The cinematographic style of the film is often compared to earlier Horror classics of the 1940s rather than to those of the late 50s and early 60s, and one can see why.
Unlike Waters' earlier films, which were meant for a niche audience (i.e., weird people--and I don't mean that derogatorily).
However, this is NOT to say that SERIAL MOM is normal--just a lot more normal than these earlier flicks.
This is the film where director John Waters returns to the more aggressive and violent universe of his earlier movies.
The Eighteenth Angel has some stylistic resemblance to The Omen (1976), which shouldn't be surprising because David Seltzer, the scripter, also wrote that earlier staple of the genre.
of State are killed when a building collapses, and the Vice President had had a stroke a month earlier, so the Oval office falls to a token black staffmember (played by James Earl Jones).
The war had ended 3 years earlier, but "Kate" could not come to terms with the truth that her son was never coming back home, ever again.
The macabre stories take their cues from earlier and equally good children's cartoons, such as "The Real Ghostbusters" and "Ahh!
"Don Q, Son of Zorro" is a tremendous sequel, from Fairbanks and company, who wisely viewed follow-ups as a chance to equal, or improve upon, earlier hits.
Not surprisingly, it lacks the spontaneity of the earlier film, and it is, perhaps, a little too long.
Then and now, it is considered to be a better film than the original, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1920), which made star and producer Douglas Fairbanks the personification of the Swashbuckler five years earlier.
But I had noticed that within the last few months, many of these films were being sold off to make room for DVD's like I mentioned earlier.
Steele plays the character much like the chilling Canino in the earlier "The Big Sleep" (1946).
Like the Charlie Chan films of an earlier era, I found that keeping a scorecard for the colorful cast of characters is helpful to keep track of the action.
One of Bogie's last films, it holds up well, even though certain elements mentioned earlier mark it as a period piece.
In this tight and well made crime drama Bogart plays a district attorney with the same grip and conviction as he did earlier in numerous roles at the wrong side of the law.
now CTHD has been mentioned in an earlier review here and while i can (just) see that you can link the two, if nothing else it has opened up more main-stream audiences to subtitles, to compare them is really very, very pointless.
Mentioned earlier, this is a post-modern parody.
While not exactly the same plot (it doesn't mention the transition from James II to William of Orange during the revolution, as it was set about 40 years earlier in history) and also a bit graphic, it is about an evil judge who delights in torture and rape to deal with witches...or pretty much anyone who doesn't do his bidding.
Just forget the earlier two films, and just turn your brain on auto-pilot, and you'll enjoy this film just fine.
The climactic tightrope walk is a bit of a letdown next to the earlier, funnier bits (like the opening funhouse chase), but that is a small detraction.
The first thing the struck my is how much better looking the film is, and the second thing that struck me is that, other than the length and thickness of the plot and story, it is remarkably similar to his earlier films.
McQueen gives a pretty good performance and it's fun to see Levar Burton in one of his earlier roles.
As with the earlier film, Lessons either captures viewers or leaves them confused and bored within the first few minutes.
After seeing "Bullworth" I felt compelled to revisit some of Beatty's earlier work as an actor or producer or director.
The movie was edited down from an earlier movie with lots of wildlife film and "Jungle exploitation" footage of topless native women thrown in with the usual patronizing narration.
Bickford's lawyer paints her as a grasping, money-loving woman and even her earlier savings are used against her as "proof" of her love of money (quite oblivious to the fact that this money was the means to build Bickford's fortune.)
Not as explicit as the novel or as films of today, Peyton Place nevertheless is an intriguing, dramatic and watchable movie that definitely captures an earlier time, and it remains an interesting example of how art can imitate life.
Joining him in the show are three washed up WWII vets: Palmer from Great Britain, piloting a Supermarine Spitfire (beautiful airplane); Leichman from Germany, piloting an Me-109 (the P-51B I mentioned earlier, but still magnificent looking none the less); and Hirokoshi, piloting the Zero.
Even the special effects in the first movie, filmed 4 years earlier, were better than these ones.
Was worse in the earlier centuries in America.
As the second-billed good guy, Fess Parker, fresh from his triumph as Davy Crockett a few years earlier, was attempting a mainstream, post-Disney career.
But compared to those earlier works, it isn't inspired; it doesn't grab you with its efforts to lampoon; and the performances of the actors - always uniformly of a high caliber in most of their movies Â is highly variable in this new movie.
Tom Welling did not act his part as well as he usually does; he seemed restricted because he had to portray a side of Clark (aka Lana-obsessed) that was the exact same five years earlier.
Casting these two beautiful, experienced young men as lovers in a violent true-crime drama could not have been more fortuitous: Their devotions are rarely consummated on-screen (all of the aforementioned sex scenes are heterosexual), except for a chaste kiss at the end of the film, and an earlier, erotically-charged sequence in which Nene tends to a wound on Ãngel's shoulder and initiates a sexual advance, only to be rebuffed because of Ãngel's mental condition.
The revolvers Cooper and everyone else uses are 1870s era Colts with brass cartridges not the earlier era ones with paper cartridges and caps.
The three principals give first rate performances, Middler best in the scene when her son dies, and Caan earlier, when he witnesses the death of a boy soldier in Korea (his first witnessing of such a tragedy in a war).
By the end when she goes to Vietnam she is a vulgar, disgusting, embittered slob who harbors some anger that the GIs no longer swoon over her as they did a quarter of a century or so earlier.
This show was a really good nick show and like i said earlier it ran from 1998-2004.
Jack's quest does not end with finding his father, as he wanted it to, although he does find the water that the camp needs, and he steps up and becomes the leader despite failing to save Joanna's life earlier that day.
I worked three or four days a week, and since I usually arrived for my shift hours earlier than I needed to...well.
I had tried to watch it a few weeks earlier, but gave up after the scene where the beds can be hidden in the wall or floors.
This is not as funny as their earlier films, Duck Soup and A Night At The Opera, but this is totally worth a rating of ten stars!
If I were to be critical at the age I am today, I would say, the film doesn't come close to what the Marx Brothers films intended from earlier works...but just see it again through the eyes and heart of the child I was, and you'll agree that, gee; what a funny film the Big Store really was.
It also in a way is more or less a sequel to "Columbo: Ãtude in Black", of one year earlier.
Just saw Goal 2 earlier today, opening day across the UK.
Fox is doing a great job in the lead, just like he always does.It was while filming this movie when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's.He was only thirty and one year earlier he was still playing a teenager in a movie.That movie was the third part of Back to the Future, where Mike was of course Marty McFly.Now he's doing much less acting, but still he is doing something.Recently I saw him in two parts of Scrubs, where he played Dr. Kevin Casey.He is great playing doctors and whatever.
This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.
Look for James Gandolfini in an earlier role as a shy lover.. .The premise is very believable.
And another thing: My fiancee and I both turned to each other during the "climactic" scene and wondered why the hell the kids, who had been so nosy earlier in the movie on almost every occasion, hadn't stuck their heads out of the car to see what the hell Mom was going on and on and on and on and on about ....
Robert Siodmak's "Son of Dracula", an alternative sequel (it doesn't make any reference to the earlier "Dracula's Daughter") to Browning's classic, is probably the last classic in the long line of films Universal produced about the monsters they gave life in the 30s.
George O'Brien, best known today for the silent classic SUNRISE and for his work in John Ford films, can play an upper-class polo-playing young man, but he is also genuinely tough (not a surprise, considering he was a boxing champ earlier in his life), has a keen sense of humor, and has a warm screen presence.
These themes meld well with the earlier levels, but probably won't hold the film together on their own.
Yoshino's doubtful earlier movie career must have brightened considerably on the release of this movie.
Please try their earlier show Rock Profiles instead, it is far superior.
From there, the pace picks up, and we're transported to some 30 years back into the Cultural Revolution, and rewinds a little bit to the earlier generation.
I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did.
He is more laid back, and a lot less goofy than in some of his earlier comedies.
And in his earlier effort, "Anger Managemenet", he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen (including that utterly stupid Gilligan) but, this time (thankfully!)
but his earlier like "Billy Madison" had ten times more laughs than this.
Just a year earlier, Barry Shear had made the film Across 110th Street, regarded as the most violent movie ever made up to that point, so it's perhaps no surprise that this film emphasises the gore and brutality to the extent it does.
Like "Home Alone," four years earlier it was slammed by the critics,and admired by the fans.
I am very upset with an earlier reviewer who basically said if you felt like these people did that you weren't human... How dare he or she just discount something experienced in real life by the person who wrote the story.
As I mentioned earlier, there's a scene where they walk into a courthouse... Well, this movie is so dumb that the 'saints/nazis' kill the accused BEFORE the verdict is even read!!
What was that, 15 years earlier?).
The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture.
Seems that Yolanda killed a man a couple of years earlier who tried to attack her while she showered.
Carey, a columnist whose curiously broad beat includes night clubs and crime in the night, grows intrigued, and stumbles onto the fact that both Ekberg and an earlier victim possessed strange statuettes called Screaming Mimis....
The movie shares a restive, oneiric quality with certain low-budget noirs from a decade earlier, that again compelled more attention than they deserved.
Grant, believing his wife (Dunne) to have drowned 7 years earlier in a shipwreck, remarries.
When I said earlier that homosexuality was taken seriously, I meant it.
Randolph Scott is good too in one of his freewheeling earlier roles.
Late 30's independent serial that feels like Poverty Row feature from several years earlier.
First off the serial is constructed like one of the annoying horror mystery films from a few years earlier when sound was just coming in.
This is also an earlier cartoon too.
The story reminded me a bit of the Lion King, the cartoon by Disney two years earlier .. also it was about a (sort of) king-to-be which goes away to another place, only to return to the hometown sometime later with a lot of vengeance towards a lot of people.
"BSW" (and I like the acronym because it emphasizes the nature of this mess of a film) has none of the vigor or playfulness of his earlier films.
well i just end up seeing this 3 part of the eye franchise.i start liking this pang brothers and i get some of theme earlier movies,the eye was really surprising me for the power of scaring you and after giving you chill-out feeling.but the eye 10 make me disappointed but be cause of the willing to get scared.it was making sense until it start turning to looks like scary movie ,so if you like parodies this is your movie and if you wanna scare your self try french HIGH TENSION.i hope so they will go back to were they start , with the next movie.but don't call it the eye don't know witch number.give it other name so don't make the first eye be refused by those who never seen it.i give 3 of 10 for the break dance and for the good looking girls.make me remind me of the 80'is.
The first vignette "Breakfast" seems to be a slight repeat of his earlier movie "Et Cetera".
As with "Antz," released earlier this year, DreamWorks has successfully resisted the temptation to populate this film with characters that can be turned into further revenue through toy sales.
The acting really is great and as a huge James Van Der Beek fan you get to see one of his earlier films.
Joan Crawford shines as George Kelly's Craig's Wife, which had been made as a film some years earlier with Rosalind Russell, hence the title change.
The propaganda in the film is mercifully minuscule; it has none of the protracted speeches that popped up in the earlier Lone Wolf film Counter-Espionage.
At one point Hulk is even trying to be emotional, thinking of his "pals" who died in earlier operations.
Lemmon and Peter Falk (so good together in the earlier "Great Race") make no music together, and Elaine May struggles for dignity.
I agree with one of the earlier posts that ppl must be getting offended 'cause he's officially made fun of everyone and if he hadn't yet, then this routine touched that last nerve on the so-called "hard-core" supporters that think that his best yrs are behind him.
Carlin also does something in this special that I liked that he rarely does: he referenced a joke from an earlier concert because he got mail from people who didn't understand it and chose to explain it here.
More depth, and 20 years earlier than "An Inconvenient Truth" warning.
For anyone who's seen "An Inconvenient Truth", you'll recognize the same theories, evidence and message in this much earlier work.
Rothrock plays an almost identical role to that of the earlier genre classic 'Yes, Madam'.
Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an "Indian giver" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier.
In better screenplays, moments of sympathy for the protagonists come much earlier (usually at the beginning of the story).
Schwartzman is already Jack, though the film was completed a year earlier.
I have enjoyed Anderson's earlier efforts.
I went to The Darjeeling Limited with reasonably high expectations having enjoyed Anderson's earlier films and given that my family were originally from Gujerat (not far from the film's locations in Rajasthan).
Features that were missed earlier(such as a "move *and* attack" command...
The effects are considerably more realistic-looking than in earlier efforts, with smoke, fire, the works.
The three sides are remarkable in how even they are(though it should be noted that the way they are set up is essentially an idea from earlier RTS titles, including StarCraft), and all have some interesting stuff to play around with, as well as an arsenal that makes them formidable foes, and satisfying to play as.
Compared to Carrie White in the 1976 film "Carrie," Sadako is far nastier, and just like in that earlier film, all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout.
it wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical "entertainment" value.
It doesn't fit with the earlier tension and Kendall never becomes anything more than a well acted cameo.
I didn't find it very convincing, and I'm grateful to rrichr for pointing out that heavy-handed editing leading to the cutting of an earlier scene didn't help:   "Segundo has entered Tanner's parlor to inform him that a certain Bob Valdez desires an audience ... Tanner turns to Segundo and smirks, 'I don't know any BOBE Valdez', mocking Segundo's densely-accented English.
"Rabid Grannies" will most likely rank among the favorites of undemanding Troma-groupies, but it's even good enough to recommend it to fans of Peter Jackson's earlier work ("Bad Taste", "Meet the Feebles").
When dinner is finished and present time comes the two aunts open a package that was delivered by an old lady earlier that night.
His father hears it then, 30 years earlier.
Supposedly the 1980's ushered in the "me" generation, but after watching this film, one has to wonder if it didn't begin earlier.
The best material featuring Sadako in the earlier part of the film resembles something of a cross between a Hitchcockian thriller and Brian De Palma's Carrie (1976).
This is an update of an earlier comment.
Given his incredible acting ability as shown in the earlier Burn After Reading movie, Pitt relies on the special effects and make up to carry his role.
The irony is that Van Wilder is very similar to Bob McGraw from 20 years earlier.
Tony Leung's first meeting with arms dealer Johnny (Anthony Wong) is exceptionally well staged and scored (by Michael Gibbs), as is an earlier scene where Leung meets the older arms dealer who has become a surrogate father to him and his colleagues.
Like his earlier film, `The Killer,' which also starred Yun-Fat, `Hard Boiled' pushes the envelope and will keep you on the edge, right along with the characters in the film, right until the very end.
If this game had been released a little earlier in the United States it most likely would have faired better, but by the year 2000 the 3D graphics were quite dated.
This is kind of a typical Buster Keaton story, except in reverse: the girl comes along earlier in the movie, the men are impressed with him earlier on, everything works out for him earlier on, and then the rest of the movie is him trying to maintain his luck versus trying to get the girl against all the forces of bad luck.
She is unexpectedly kind to him despite his earlier rejection, and they profess their love for one other.
This was one of Scorcese's earlier works,, and well i just had a very hard time following this one,, for the most part it was well kinda weird,, some of the music is great like the end by the doors,, the you had this god awful chanting music that was horrible,, Martin what were you thinking,, this movie follows a character named J.R. who falls for this girl,, and well that's about as much as i gather,, story say's she was raped,, they show that scene,, there are very few outside shots,, the movie is in all b/w.
There's a touch of quasi-incest when a deeply disturbed Teresa Wright and an equally deranged Robert Mitchum pledge their love only to have it turned on its head when Mitchum shoots her brother in self defense after he returns from active duty, having lost the toss of a coin, an earlier version of the draft ballot.
The character's in the show are a great example of how character interaction alone can make a show 100 times better, and in this we see such a wide range of character's, lead and co starring that make this show great on its own even without all the other dimensions (This was, as I said earlier most of what the first 2 or 3 seasons were like).
And it is beyond me why faint-hearted Rachel would hack Travis to death bashing him hard so many times with a shovel if earlier in the movie she was clearly disgusted at the way Carla killed Holden.
When viewing this film pay close attention to the earlier years when Gleason is a boy and the expressions used by his father around the house and in treating his mother.
Heck, you can even download more tools to customize, if you want to do something that the regular editor, that comes with the game, won't let you(though there is precious little that fits into that category... it's incredibly open and, as stated earlier, jam-packed with features).
I just saw this film earlier this evening at the Florida Film Festival, & in my 4 years of attending the festival this was one of the best I've ever seen.
I would like to see this earlier work.
This movie is a little more updated than the earlier version.
There's Karen (Freaks & Geek's/Dawson's Creek's Busy Phillips), a scholarship girl who is as irritating but not quite as sexy as Shelley Winters in "The Poseidon Adventure", and Lisa (Keri Lynn Pratt who was Miss New Hampshire a couple years earlier), and Jefferson (Ms. Swain-everyone's favorite "Lolita").
It's nowhere near as bad as the earlier Natural City, where I seriously didn't care about anybody in the entire cast, but the main female lead is really bland, and consistently out-shined by the other key female character May, who is preposterously killed off in a frustratingly stupid fashion in the final sequences, almost like Wash in Serenity.
While not as bad as the 20th Century Fox Laurel and Hardy pictures or Atoll K, this movie just isn't up the quality of their earlier pictures.
version of this one but like suggested earlier before, this movie got more complexity, originality & layers - thus more enjoyable.
A more mature and rounded work than the Director's earlier "Lovers of the Arctic Circle", Sex and Lucia combines wonderful acting, a great story, innovative cinema and spine-tingly beautiful photography.
The earlier film by Julio MÃ©dem (Lovers of the Arctic Circle) is a prelude to the kind of cinematography that this Spanish film director/writer presents here.
Like someone said in an earlier review, this is destined to be a desi post modern cult classic!
Christopher Lloyd plays, or maybe barely animates, the brother (the one who pushed him off the sled 28 years earlier) who is a cross between Scrooge and Atilla the Hun.
Particularly effective is Harry Andrews, as a wealthy elderly eccentric who fell in love with Dame Wendy's character decades earlier, though they met only fleetingly.
My wife and I simply echo the earlier comments - this is so superbly acted and filmed that we immediately wanted to watch it all again.
What is not generally known, however, is that Jolson actually made his talkie debut the year earlier, in 1926, in a short entitled A PLANTATION ACT.
She loved that little girl so much that she died earlier than she had to.
As I saw in a post earlier, this is the kind of cop show that cops watch!
And occasionally interesting story-telling by reshowing the same scene using different vantage points to add information withheld earlier in the film.
In fact, TV would have been a part of the American lifestyle much earlier had it not been for World War Two.
Andrew feels that he owes him at least that since he holds himself responsible for the violent life that Nick had chosen years earlier.
For instance, a sarangi player in india could play to the grooves laid down a week earlier by Ugandan drummers.
Yeah, I get that it's supposed to be a parody of earlier television variety shows, but parodies are also supposed to be funny.
The second one is of a tremendous dark humor, and I do not know whether the intention of the director / writer Thom Fitzgerald is to criticize the earlier cash of life insurance.
It's interesting to compare "The Girl Next Door" with an earlier documentary about porn actress Grace Quek, "Sex: The Annabel Chong Story."
Some of the most poignant scenes involve SV visiting her mother and having an honest talk about her settling down (both of them end up teary), visiting a hypnotist to try to improve her self-esteem, talking about her on-again, off-again relationship with her boyfriend (also in the industry), leaving an Adult Entertainment Awards ceremony by herself, with no award, in the dress she was so excitied about wearing earlier that day, and petting her cat, saying since she doesn't have a special man in her life, there's always her cat for affection.
True, this is not an out-and-out romp like Mae's earlier films but it does have a more subtle comic line about a movie star in small-town America.
It's a bit more subtle than Mae's earlier films but it has a certain maturity and a low-key humour as a gentle poke at country folks.
Apparently the savior of the project was an unheralded screenwriter named Jack Cunningham, then known primarily for his earlier work on Westerns such as THE COVERED WAGON and a couple of Douglas Fairbanks vehicles.
Taking elements of the Robin Hood saga, both from longtime legends and screen treatments like an earlier Douglas Fairbanks Sr. silent film, the scenarists manage to create an upbeat story of wit and pace fully in tune with the merry cast and score.
It has been pointed out that later in its run it began to unravel, and this is non unusual for any series, but this affectionate homage to both the characters and the earlier series is a fun romp that still holds up fairly well 15 years later.
I had taped the show off cable years earlier so I've been able to reacquaint myself with the whole series.
Like I said earlier, an entertaining affair with Mysterio coming out on top after coming in at number 2 and going all the way.
When I first saw Robert Duvall's earlier "The Apostle" (1997), I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt being that it was his first effort as both lead actor and director.
In "Assassination Tango" he not only repeats all his earlier mistakes, but adds to and compounds them in the process.
...as I watched it one night earlier this week on cable TV.
However, this short is more than an excellent gimmick, as what makes "The Man with the Rubber Head" different from his earlier films (and the similar movies of his competitors) is the care MÃ©liÃ¨s put to create a "story" to his trick.
I was lucky enough to catch this one during a visit to Manhattan earlier this year.
Jhabvala imagines a charismatic experimentalist Svengali (Robert Powell) pitted against a socially well-connected aging actress whom he had used and abandoned earlier (Anne Baxter in her last big-screen role paying off the sins of Eve Harrington?).
While Will is facing an instability relationship with Liv and her autistic daughter Bea, he tracks down Miro, and discovered that Amira was the mother of Miro, and also the woman whom Will met earlier on.
SPOILERS  But plausibility isn't something this film seems to want to care much about -- for example, the Luke character leaves a crime scene or shows up at the "West Hollywood Police Department" in a motorcycle, sans helmet without hearing word one about it from a "WH" cop; the Chaz character get not only sliced but decapitated on a crowded dance floor and no one notices, hears about it, or stumbles on him; Eddie ends up at the crime scene where his younger brother (whom he was earlier so concerned over and about) was killed, gets attacked there himself, goes to the "WHPD," runs into his sister and yet no one (not even the sister) mentions to him that his brother was the victim at that crime scene.
I disagree with earlier posters who see this as an AIDS allegory and question, "Haven't we gotten beyond that by now?"
The girls all each savor a little growing up, unique and personal to themselves while the parents become lost in failed expectation and guilt about the loss of a child years earlier.
He brought Dinosaurs to life in an earlier Silent Movie Short called "The Ghost Of Slumber Mountain" (1917).
His earlier Silent Movie Shorts when he first conceived the idea were corky & primitive but still entertaining today.
Sometimes the animation of the monsters is smooth, (most notably with the Brontosaurus running amok in London) but in earlier scenes it is obvious much of the stop motion was shot using two or even three frame exposures between moving the models.
There is more footage of the dinosaur stampede, and it appears some of the existing animation was replaced by a different `take' of the same scene featured in earlier releases.
Two of earlier cinema's suspense and ghoul masters are in fine form in this traveling circus story about an armless knife thrower and the woman he made the ultimate sacrifice for.
A young and beautiful Joan Crawford in one of her earlier film appearances played Nanon.
Fried egg looking blobs notwithstanding, the film, as mentioned earlier does have some strengths.
Unknown to Frankie, Angela and Jeff know each other and had an affair some time earlier.
Warned by their estranged father not to go to the place, they ignore him and decide to make a weekend out of going up to see the place, bringing along some friends - albeit one of the sisters, who heads up to the motel earlier than the rest and vanishes.
It's well photographed, and I liked when the guy beat one of the killers over the head with a wooden chair while he was still tied to it, and a couple of other scenes, but as soon as the movie would come to life, it would quickly fall back into a familiar predictable pattern of said earlier movies in the very next scene.
You'll also see that this movie was influence by some earlier movies that had the same premise.
It might be useful to compare it with earlier versions if they can be found.
In fact, his character was taken from an earlier DC character named Black Steel.
Thus these dead beings wander and wonder around in a suspense-less environment, dramatically pursued by an incompetent 'menace' (ahem) of a ghost (ahem) whose role is to be hellbent on avenging his death 40-50 years earlier.
One small correction on an earlier review -- the person doesn't travel around the world spreading the disease (that's the plot line of "12 Monkeys").
It isn't 8 Diagram Pole Fighter, but Drunken Monkey is an entertaining film, but not up to the standards of Lau Kar's earlier Shaw Bros works.
However, as I mentioned earlier, the action scenes themselves are stunning.
In an earlier comment I read that the lodger was a bit overacting.
This is probably largely due to the fact that the earlier movie (including some very incongruous and never explained plot elements) was planned as a showcase for its star, matinÃ©e idol Ivor Novello, who plays the title role.
Roberto Benigni, despite all his efforts, is left to aping Sellers in what is basically weak imitations of the well known gags from earlier films, and quite frankly, it just doesnÂ´t work.
But if you have seen this movie and were disapointed, did you really think it was going to be as funny or enjoyable as earlier entries in the Pink Panther series?
The name De Mille evokes big sets, big costumes and bigger action and Crusades was his follow up to his earlier take on Christian oration from the scandalous - in a good way - Sign of the cross.
), it develops into one that borders on amour fou Â which could jeopardize the outcome of the whole crusade (it's actually comparable to the bond-to-the-death between Roman centurion Fredric March and Christian slave Elissa Landi in the earlier THE SIGN OF THE CROSS)!
In fact, technically and narratively, this film is even more ambitious that its earlier counterpart and could be said to be something like Zhang Yimou experimenting on the gangster genre.
Most of us probably knew it would end like this 90 minutes earlier, but hoped the script would be more surprising.
I didn't have chance to see this show earlier so i'm watching it now 25 years later and it still doesn't seem old at all, it's even greater now as you look back at the mid 80's.
It never really get's really scary, that might be it ... Not the worst movie ever then (not close to that), but still not something you have to watch (unless you're a fan, as I said earlier)
Karachi was a modern city by every means in recent past but today go anywhere in this city, it may be a posh area, middle class locality or a slums you will find bearded men and burqa clad women in such a huge numbers that no one could even imagine some years earlier.
It touched the epic proportions of earlier masterpieces Garam Hawa and Tamas, based on partition issues.
And there are sequences here that you have NOT witnessed before, speaking of that originality I mentioned earlier.
He has one emotion and it is the same as he exhibited in that leaked internet tape earlier this year.
Winterbottom's earlier film 'Butterfly Kiss' has the same feel too.
As a drama, Carandiru could have benefited from a bit of tightening in its earlier stretches, for the film feels a trifle unfocused and meandering at times.
The ballad is evocative of earlier, hazy days in the country.
I found fault with Villon's earlier escape, as it was too easy, and with the casting of Ellen Drew in the role of one of the wenches at the Fir Cone tavern, and who loves Villon.
Why didn't I think of that earlier!
In that the killer finally reveals himself, due to process of elimination, since almost everyone who were murdered in the film had earlier ended up murdering somebody else making the point of the film being a whodunit totally moot.
Around seven years earlier, he had single handedly invented the Giallo thriller with "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" and the seminal "Blood and Black Lace".
It's ashame that he didn't make more like this, but I think his talent was actually the old school horror pieces like "Blood and Black Lace," which was actually an even earlier slasher from Bava.
The mostly unknown cast and bootleg/homespun feel of K+C only enhances its authenticity, bringing to mind some of the earlier works of indie pioneers like Robert Rodriguez and John Waters.
In fact it was Gates who lead sheriff Deegan and a posse of local citizens to the Dogmen's camp but only in his attempt to save the chief's son's, who was earlier shot by one of the escaped convicts, life.
As stated earlier, I was holding back tears throughout the film.
So Steve and Jessica confront Jason and after cutting the bodies head open Jason's heart that has sprouted a head, arms and tail crawls out and is thrown into the basement where he finds the body of his sister that he killed earlier on.
All you ever wanted to know about Jason is revealed, and once you know the dark secret, it will haunt you- except for a small matter of cosmetics, the "dark secret" is the same as the lemon revealed a short time earlier in New Line's bad "finale" to the Nightmare movies.
Then we see one of the better Chan fights amongst all his earlier films.
This is a good chance to see Chan in one of his earlier efforts where he has a central role, unlike many of the films where he has a smaller supporting role.
MacTavish (Donald Crisp) suggests digging up the earlier buried treasure for a wedding gift.
You can see how it out-steps a lot of earlier swordplay films and influenced the style in films that would follow.
I recently saw a restored print from TOLL OF THE SEA (1922) and it was in fact made using this process four years earlier than THE BLACK PIRATE.
Here we see the low ambition that i mentioned earlier.
The undead are four prisoners/murderers that were slaughtered while working on a road crew several years earlier.
also one of the earlier comments was that the movies ending was bad script saying that why would the captain go up to poachers armed with a single rifle, knowing that these poachers have killed one of his men earlier.
The outsider reporter/photographer Ga Yu from Beijing echoes "Yellow Earth" character Brother Gu, of the Eighth Route Army, who is a visitor to the impoverished peasant family in that earlier film.
I had thought that I might miss the music in this earlier version, but I found after having watched it that I didn't miss it at all.
Having not seen any of Shane Meadows' earlier efforts before seeing this, I cannot compare it to them, but I certainly understand all the hype about this young filmmaker from this film alone.
Mario Landi's "Patrick Still Lives" has to be one of the sleaziest exploitation sickies ever made in Italy.It's filled with incredible amount of nudity and masturbation.Gianni Dei plays Patrick,a young man who is sent into coma as the result of the random act of violence.He lies in his bed looking into space for the most part and killing people with his telekinetic powers.The script is pretty bad,but the gore is mildly shocking.Still the scene where Maria Angela Giordano has a long metal pole pushed into her vagina is a real jaw dropper...Another offensive murder scene involves a lovely black-haired woman killed by her own dogs:they chase her all over the grounds before biting,licking and chewing her around the genitals,eventually killing her.The masturbation scene of stunningly beautiful Anna Venziano is also worth mentioning.Like earlier Mario Landi's sleazefest "Giallo a Venezia"(1979),"Patrick Still Lives" is cheap,shoddy,misogynistic and gleefully disgusting.It's just a pure exploitation film,so you should enjoy it as such.Highly recommended,if you like sleaze and extreme gore.
A biker-outfitted clad, hearse driving killer searches for the construction workers (and those associated with them) who gang-raped a girl earlier in the film.
The 2003 DVD release is sadly a retread of the much earlier full-screen laserdisc release, but still very watchable.
As for length issues, the native villager sequence runs too long (though the nudity will no doubt entertain some), and trimming of some earlier scenes may have helped.
Brutal treatment in a penal colony has been explored on the screen before in such earlier films as I WAS A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, but never has there been a more graphic expose of the sort of conditions prisoners faced under the worst sort of environment.
I had mentioned earlier that I was waiting for the show to come into it's own.
Kaley's character, Ali (based on an actual person), is a pretty, popular, "jock", who needs a scholarship to be able to go to college, due to her mother getting ill six years earlier.
And even late in life, he was still a good singer, having been a great one earlier.
I have not yet seen The Red Shoes, so I was not shocked or disappointed how much the sequence resembled the earlier film.
I also enjoyed hearing the Paganini theme; I had loved it in Somewhere in Time as well, so I was surprised to hear it in another earlier film as well.
And it is still better, as stated earlier, than the same director's "Rush of Fear" - which I sincerely hope BBC1 doesn't show in the same slot that this TV movie was in; it would hurt us Rosanna Arquette fans a lot if it was scheduled after little sister Patricia in "Medium" as well...
Mabel receives a card from an earlier boyfriend, Jack, and she invites him home to dinner, which makes Roscoe jealous, but not in the usual Keystone-way; he feels serious bitterness and his feelings are powerfully expressed through very small gestures.
As said earlier, the genteel humour is delightful, the Edwardian costumes are dazzling to look at, and Marilyn Monroe Â overshadowing the unimaginative performance of Olivier Â is simply white hot.
Though Mexican influence (earlier Teotehuican and Mixtec, and later Aztec) was felt in Chichen Itza in the Classic and Post Classic Period, it is unlikely that sacrifice on the Aztec scale ever occurred on the Yucatan peninsula.
this is a great murder mystery/psychological suspense thriller.this time it's Richard Gere who owns film.just a year earlier,Gere was in a movie called "primal fear,in which he played opposite Edward Norton.Norton owned that film,with his performance,and Gere does the same with this film.the film takes place in China,where an America lawyer(Gere) is on business.one morning,his world is turned upside down,as he finds himself accused of murder,with what seems an ironclad case against him.
I have earlier seen Modern Times (which actually god dialog and singing in it) and City Lights (which had melodies in it), both were great (I need to rewatch City Lights though.
I have watched this movie in the earlier DVD version, and frankly it put me to sleep.
Despite this, the princess is head-over-heels in love with him--thanks to his fulfilling a prophecy made earlier in the film about the identity of her beloved.
I have watched this movie in the earlier DVD version, and frankly it put me to sleep.
While this is not quite as strong as the earlier series, it still has some great moments.
When you're first billed, doesn't this mean you'll show up earlier in the film?
Also for the fact that it makes us look at ourselves,much like the elephant man did 5 years earlier.
It is implied very heavily that Beowulf was a liar and braggart in his earlier exploits, including the race with Breca: As with many of the other changes, it seems to be part of a deliberate campaign by Gaiman and Avary to strip away the heroic nature of the source material, turning Beowulf into just another trendy 21st-century flawed anti-hero.
But 'Stop, Look and Hasten' isn't just a classic combination of elements from earlier cartoons.
An interesting point is the actor who links these three films - charismatic Gerard Butler.He was fiery yet also sensitive as King Leonidas and the earlier Beowulf and made the roles his own.
I think the failure of "Popular" was the advertising I referred to earlier for the show...it was going after kids in high school for ratings.
It was a close run thing as the Duke of Wellington said about another battle a century earlier.
The film had world premiered earlier during the fest on Sept 9 at the Isabel Bader Theatre.
Director Bahman Ghobadi was an enthusiastic show-up for the 3rd screening and gave many interesting tidbits during his Q&A such as info on the banning of female singing and musicians in present day Iran for the past 28 years, that his self-censorship on the film did not help it to get past Irani censors so that he may re-cut the film for the later general international release now anyway (restoring more scenes of female singing & playing) and that the whole 7 months of seeking for travel permits subplot in this film was a nod to the struggles he had to get his earlier "Turtles Can Fly" film made.
One would have to go back to his earlier work in Hong Kong for that.
At no time are the guests asked anything more searching than what they had for lunch earlier.
In contrast with the earlier screen adaptation of Aleksandar Petrovic in 1972, director Vladimire Bortko (Â° Moscow, 1946) followed the book meticulously.
The reason it just doesn't work is because 8 Days and 100 Girls did this earlier, better and more believably.
Her father answers the door, and to his dismay, it is the druggist from earlier, and the look on the fathers face is priceless as well, as here stands the young man he'd made the sale to earlier LOL.
It also includes some more obscure French ones (Gondry's earlier work).
I wish to first disagree with the earlier poster who said John Hurt was one dimensional in his performance.
If you payed attention earlier on, you saw Jeremy's stepfather Allen in a bumped up Mercedes.
This is odd, because earlier in the film someone gets killed too and nobody seemed that worked up over it...oh wait...it must have been because she was some short, old woman.
Betty had already helped launch the Popeye series a year earlier, so by 1934 the Fleischers had their distinctly urban stamp firmly planted under two cartoon banners aimed as much, if not more, at adults as the kids.
A solid ending to a rather weak movie featuring one of the most ridiculous opening-sequences ever in horror history (which I failed to mention earlier in this review).
I agree with the earlier reviewer that there is 20+ minutes of footage that could've been axed like her singing in the gay club and the side story with the old lesbian lover which never truly developed.
Add a local mysterious (but not evil, no matter what the earlier poster thought) tribe.
I only wonder why it didn't happen even earlier.
Those who miss the earlier, lighter, more fun-for-the-whole-family seasons of shows like Smallville or Buffy, should check this out.
They've struck the right balance between humor, camp, and drama as to be reminiscent of earlier seasons of SG-1.
I don't have any knowledge of the Flash Gordon franchise beyond the fact that it exists and that earlier works are apparently very different from this new series, so my opinion of the new series is based solely on what's presented there and not on the body of knowledge from the Flash Gordon universe at large.
Paul Hogan was very effective in the earlier films, but in this one he seems tired of the role.
Without the novelty available to the earlier films, the only thing that would have saved this one was a vibrant Mick Dundee, and, unfortunately, Hogan could not pull it off.
Some of Hunter's earlier superiors reminded me of Dirty Harry's superior, Captain Briggs (Bradford Dillman of 'The Enforcer & 'Sudden Impact') who was on a single-minded crusade to get rid of Harry.
However, unlike the earlier cartoons, he is a teenager in a family of five here.
You can't help but think this guy would have been a hero, probably much unappreciated, in his earlier journeys!
How, exactly, did the "director" expect his audience wouldn't notice repeated reverse shots from lines earlier in the film?
I think had the monster been changed or better handled this would have had a reputation beyond the earlier Beast.
All are directed by EugÃ¨ne LouriÃ© and here he proves to be a dab hand with the material, bringing a sincerity and sense of creepy intrigue that not only sustains the film nicely during its slower earlier stages but giving it a frisson of actual shock and disturbance.
Also, the monster sometimes induces chuckles, whilst some of the earlier ideas of the film aren't best explored.
The energy and originality is equal to his earlier efforts (Assault on Precinct 13 and Dark Star).
An earlier comment mentioned that the stories are weird, but that doesn't matter, it makes the movie well worth watching!!!
One of the first great scenes of the movie is when, after abusing his wife a few days earlier, he's crying on her lap and looking for comfort and she's reluctant to console him.
Though only fragments of the film now remain, the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) have done a remarkable job of compiling and digitally restoring the surviving scenes, with the DVD released earlier this year.
If Davey had said something earlier the abuse would not have reached the level it did and it is wholly inexplicable and unreasonable for the movie to expect viewers to swallow the concept that Davey would not have said anything to anyone.
There was an earlier film starring Robert Ryan and Rhonda Fleming (circa 1950's) which I believe was a similar theme.
I'm in the earlier stages of film history and I'm sure I'll develop more perspective and see more of Fields along with his other contemporaries.
As in many of Loach's earlier films, It's a Free World has a strong feeling for those who live on the margins in a society that does not care and, uncharacteristically for Loach, is surprisingly even-handed, showing the viewpoint of both the victim and the victimizer.
Though It's a Free World is far less impactful than some of the earlier Loach-Laverty collaborations, it is a strong film that does not pull its punches and did not deserve a one-day U.K. opening and a direct-to-DVD treatment.
The other one (William Somerset/Morgan Freeman) is an earlier generation who had all the goodness and rationality.
On limited budgets, with practically no-name casts (at least in his earlier work), he created some of the nastiest little gems a horror hound could ever hope to skid across!
Kurosawa further develops his style in what was the beginning of his greatest area, aided by another great performance from leading man Toshiro Mifune that tops his part in the earlier Drunken Angel.
Following the credits, the director delivers a clinic on the art of montage, utilizing quick nonlinear cutting that makes the narrative get straight to the point: ashamed rookie cop (an impossibly young Toshiro Mifune) explaining to his boss that he lost his gun; then a jump back to earlier in the day during target practice; then a quick cut to a scene on a crowded city bus in which the Colt gets lifted.
During the trip, one of the singers takes an unreasoning dislike to the sailor, picks one childish fight after another with him, rummages through his possessions, and comes up with a theory that he killed the person on the earlier voyage because of a love triangle of some sort.
There was a legal dispute caused by the original title, "Sound of Fury" which some felt was too close to Fritz Lang's "Fury" filmed earlier.
The scene at the end with the mother explains the earlier comment by the photographer, "My mother taught me to see."
As I mentioned earlier, the two main actresses are good, but the rest of the cast comes off like a bad high school play.
Renoir had made a "southern" film earlier -- SWAMP WATER, in 1941 -- and perhaps he found the region interesting.
Although the main characters and the setting remain unnamed throughout (lending it a pretentious air of political allegory also missing from the earlier film), the controversial subject of THE PRISONER got it banned from participating in both the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals Â although it did get nominated for 5 BAFTAs and, eventually, won a couple of other international awards.
And director Peter Glenville would have his greatest screen triumph in Becket, the story of another troublesome priest several centuries earlier.
"Night of the Scarecrow" is a typical horror movie from 90's.The production is slick and polished,the acting ranks from acceptable to lame and the special effects are mostly cool.There are some graphic gore scenes,so the gore-hounds will not be disappointed.It's a decent movie however I prefer earlier "Scarecrows"(1988,William Wesley),which is not only gory,but also creepy as hell.In conclusion,this is sometimes nonsensical,but quite enjoyable picture so you should give it a chance.
Jeff Burr is definitely one of the most talented horror directors ever.I really enjoyed his earlier horror films like "The Offspring"(1986)and "Leatherface-Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3"(1990).
I only have a couple complaints:  **When the lion is lying dead on the concrete slab, and Lucy and Susan go up to him, I don't understand why Lucy was so easily talked out of using the injury healing potion she was given by...Santa Claus earlier.
I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed.
The third part showcases mostly scenes which were cut from Chaplin's final edit of his films influences some of his earlier silent pictures had on his later, more famous films.
What I liked in particular was how they took two of his earlier non-Keystone comedies and analyzed the many, many changes the film underwent thanks to Chaplin's obsessive-compulsive film style.
It is a typical 1970s production insofar as that it is grim, bleak and more depressing than any production you would have seen on the screen a decade earlier Â but it's an admirable feat.
Spin offs, copy cats clones, Three Secrets is easily compared to its earlier & far better film A Letter To 3 Wives Basically both plots involve 3 women in a quandry.or a dilemma..in 3 Wives .one of their husbands has run away with another woman (Miss Addie Ross).. who which ?
She had been a successful concert pianist before her death a few years earlier, and Tom himself learned piano under her influence.
My hopes going in were high because of Jacques Audiard's earlier highly suspenseful films, "Read My Lips" (2001) and "A Self Made Hero" (1996).
Cooper, the nominal lead, had just had a career resurgence with his Oscar-winning performance in another genre outing â the classic HIGH NOON (1952); as I said in my review of YELLOW SKY (1948), which Iâve just watched, Widmarkâs role here was kind of similar to the one he played in that earlier Western â though, by now, he had begun to stretch effectively from outright villain types.
Main character's thrust not very well explained other than generic "leaving the farm" type of moment at the beginning, not enough tie-ins to previous reinforcing principles and moments earlier in the story.
The humor is not as sharp as earlier entries.
5) Saw this feature film at a festival in CA earlier this year.
Probably the greatest since Columbus, nearly 500 years earlier.
View the movie again and see how many times the screenwriter and director took the trouble to set up a later event or comment with an earlier reference.
Two years earlier, these three men collaborated on one of the best 1980s dramas, "The Stone Boy".
Although all the factors of that earlier film are present here, it's a very much different experience.
To those who feel revulsion towards Seita and feel that the war scenes were pointless: As mentioned earlier, all the the war scenes do is place the story in context.
The movie is amusing, I liked it, but people expecting an exceptional movie, like "Ko to tamo peva" or "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", director's earlier works, will be disappointed.
The film itself is a remake of an earlier German film so I guess turn about is fair play.
The script also features various lapses of logic, at the end I just couldn't stop thinking that it was a bit of a coincidence that a bunch of kids would just happen to hold a sÃ©ance & summon the exact same demon that their landlord & one of their Father's did years earlier, a fact which they only discover later on in the film.
The rest of the film however is in a minor key when compared with the earlier sound version with Allan Jones and Irene Dunne.
I hadn't seen any of his earlier movies in years.
This earlier adaptation, however, stands as a prime example of the genre from the more innocent pre-war era; in fact, starting from the year after Â with William A. Wellman's THE OX-BOX INCIDENT (1943), to be exact Â the Western achieved sudden maturity that would lead to any number of masterworks in various veins (noir, psychological, elegiac, revisionist) till it died out towards the late 1970s.
The sets are quite good, and at times quite fancy; and the streets are muddy, though I seem to remember the earlier films as having a more realistic, dirty look, as Alaska here is cleaner and at least physically less forbidding than one might expect.
just when you think the storyline is going to pick up they start showing you flashbacks of scenes earlier in the movie which you've already scene a thousand times !
Shades of Conrad Veidt of an earlier generation.
True, I do prefer the earlier episodes, and it wasn't the same without Compo, but that doesn't deter me from putting on the television and relaxing for 45 or so minutes.
Any viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released.
She seems to be have been involved with some potent set pieces earlier (the flowers to be cut, representing tenants; the meat to be cut, representing the subtlety of seduction).
from `Faust' by Charles Gounod did not appear in the Paris Opera in its final grand opera form until March 1869, making its dÃ©but in the Metropolitan a few years later; using the same recording as that used by Tony Richardson in `The Phantom of the Opera' three years earlier is not merely an unhappy coincidence; and some thirty seconds of Enya during a scene of hundreds of men hanging on to their bowler hats in the driving wind was a laughable misfit at best.
The script makes no effort to describe what makes Blue Sunshine different or how Goddard got a hold of it ten years earlier.
The idea of switching the races from the earlier movie -- a white guy being introduced to a black family -- is a good one, and the movie tackles racial issues much more head-on and with an immediacy that affected me.
Went to the local film festival earlier tonight, or at least the kick-off for the local film festival.
There were probably many ways the show could have been made, but in the end, its writer chose a very straightforward tale which tries to cram as many Doctors, companions, concepts, monsters and enemies into the same story and, like I said earlier, it succeeds in part.
I would have thought Charlie would have attempted to undermine Mich earlier in the film, rather than passively sulking and accepting this man's total illegitimacy as a college student.
The studio was undoubtedly hoping that baby-faced Marshall Thompson would be just as ironically chilling playing a killer as Alan Ladd was a few years earlier in "This Gun For Hire".
The police lieutenant who had bragged earlier, "the last priest was shot 6 months ago", has a child with a woman that helped Fonda, who baptized the child.
Pinkett, who gave a bravura performance (along with Queen Latifah) in the earlier "Set It Off," is no less than brilliant as "Lyric," sought after by the hard-working "Jason," played by another neglected thespian, Alan Payne.
That film (based on an earlier book by Ray Bradbury) seemed dated, even by the 70s, but is more topical than ever now.
That it was made only a year after the Taliban were ousted gives it an authentic documentary feel, but it would still be as effective if the events were years earlier.
I recently viewed the movie and my earlier impressions were correct.
The cast is OK (Roy Dupuis was almost a star here in the early 90s, the VFX impressive (for the most of them), and - as some viewers wrote earlier - the first part very promising.
As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one.
The attention to detail as I mentioned earlier is prominent with the real time aspect of the show.
With a few notable exeptions, I wouldn't really associate this type of music with a Sonic game, it is generally too serious and is some way of the classic cartoony, bouncy tunes that were found in the earlier games.
"Times Square" suffered the same fate that Orson Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons" did 40 years earlier.
At the station Nikki is screaming "Pammy" over and over as they agreed to do earlier in the film in moments of total despair.
Slater was pretty good in this film; his performance here worked from his first seconds on screen, his character of office drone Bob Maconel combining elements of the main characters from the films I mentioned earlier and hitting all the right emotive notes.
Two years earlier Chris met and fell in love with Romain.
Through a flashback sequence, it's learned that two years earlier Chris became pregnant by the much-older Vic.
Ahh Grace's line from earlier, "only blue tomorrows," from the movie script as she resisted the prospects of having an affair.
That number was a cue from earlier.
He, and Dario argento(his earlier films), I consider to be the best directors.
But the movie belongs to Peter O'Toole, and, as in The Stunt Man (made a few years earlier), when he's on screen you can barely take your eyes off him.
But one of the major plots twists in the film was when Smith tells Gill that Jonathan was acquitted for an earlier murder when he claimed that he killed in self-defense.
So why, one wonders, does Hitchcock settle for a cheap double-exposure shot of Dietrich in closeup in the foreground while Richard Todd is at the window in the background, when Gregg Toland had already achieved such "deep focus" shots without "trick photography" nine years earlier in "Citizen Kane?"
This one does, mostly, but as soon as we realize we've been tricked, just as happens at the end of The Sixth Sense, a very good film otherwise, we begin to go over the earlier events to see if there was any cheating.
In AMERICAN GRAFFITI, my other favorite, but many years earlier, another film about friendship, and friends getting older and going apart, Ford played the race driver, too.
Linda Kozlowski again teams up with Hogan {after the earlier Crocodile Dundee pairing}, here she has very little to do but she slots in very nicely, even if a pre-end credits sequence does her and everyone else no favours at all.
He finally was granted his earlier request to join the Army Medical Corps.
I've only seen a few other of Dolph's earlier films and I think he's a solid actor, but he's just barely adequate as a director.
), the newly unfrustrated protÃ©gÃ© (who earlier is dismayed by revelations of his mentor's murderous behavior) adopts the same style of sexual duplicity for himself.
His family killed dead by the Mafia in a drug deal gone bad, Dolph returns to Russia from a stateside sabbatical to finish the job he failed six years earlier.
I don't watch a lot of his movie usually but I decided to watch this one earlier today (my boyfriend works in a video store and got me it a day early!).
Like I said earlier this might not be your cup of tea.
That guy should have been a bigger star, a really good actor if anyone's seen his earlier work.
20 years earlier, her mother and father were brutally murdered by the evil clown, and the daughter died under mysterious circumstances.
Fifty years earlier a classroom of students was asked to draw pictures of how they pictured the future and to place their pictures in this time capsule.
I was glad to see the end of the annoying daughter of the spooky kid who wrote the predictions 50 years earlier.
He is desperately trying to locate his six-year-old daughter, abducted some months earlier from the terminal.
One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
Those who have seen it and enjoyed it should check out his earlier film "Play Dead".
And yes there are several stereotypes on show but that clever script I mentioned earlier throws up surprise after surprise.
Lang explored similar themes in Fury (with Sidney in a similar role to this), made a year earlier, but this one is better, not marred by the melodrama and overacting of the earlier film.
Spielberg got a then up-and-coming screenwriter named Chris Columbus to write the script (Columbus would go on to become the director of the first two "Harry Potter" movies as well as the first two "Home Alone" pictures), and Roger Corman protege Joe Dante to direct the picture (Dante directed 1978's "Piranha", a witty spoof of Spielberg's first smash hit "Jaws", and a segment of Spielberg's "Twilight Zone: The Movie" a year earlier).
While this film is not as sleazy as SLAVES IN BONDAGE or GAMBLING WITH SOULS, two earlier films that featured star Wheeler Oakman as a pimp, ESCORT GIRL is slickly made and well-acted by a wonderful cast, and while it doesn't "show anything", it does have a seedy, dirty feel to it, even though it's not unlike a studio-bound, low-budget Grand National crime drama.
shares some themes in common with that earlier film.
Here's how: A white male architect built a project some years earlier.
Her 5-year-old son was depressed and stepped off a building to his death years earlier.
I saw The Architect at the Tribeca Film festival earlier this year, and it has really stuck with me.
The half hour format makes these a bit lighter than Freaks and Geeks - and when this show was canceled they weren't quite as able to still wrap things up as with the earlier show.
Ironically Lance Kerwin played a bed wetter in an earlier TV movie called "The Loneliest Runner" so maybe he gave some pointers to Scott on how to play the scene.
In this short-film, Castro is grilled specifically on dissidents, and the moment of truth comes earlier on, when questioned on the 'closed trials' and why Castro did not allow the prisoners to see their families, Castro, in his unique orator voice asked of Stone, "Why is it that over 800 prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay have not been allowed to see their families for over two years?"
I think these inconsistencies and his father's difficulty with expressing normal human emotions lead to Bergman's earlier works (such as the professor in Wild Strawberries and the persistent theme of living in the barren wilds in movies such as The Passion of Anna and Shame).
There are a couple of nice action set pieces ranging from full scale war with the clashing of two opposing sides (the elephants were a great bonus, trust me), to a duel which turns out to be a courtship ritual, something not new since both Hrithik and Aishwarya challenged each other before (though on the basketball court), with the latter quite well versed in swordplay given her earlier role in The Last Legion, and one featuring what I thought took a leaf out of the battle between Hector and Achilles in Troy.
It's also something of a gamble: Gowariker has never treaded the historical epic in his earlier features, especially one about India's first attempt at religious pluralism.
With Katheine, who Charlie earlier slammed down a flight of stairs, coming to Emily's rescue in a spine-tingling and deadly confrontation with Charlie at a deserted cave.
It features the same adventurous elements and humor, that were also always featured in his earlier movies.
In conclusion, I earlier stated that I do not care for most children's movies.
One earlier reviewer cited Sandra Dee and James Dean parallels, etc, no need to repeat it.
One of the earlier reviewers talked about losing virginity as a must based on this movie.
The funny thing is, I liked this film, even though I had watched Twelve Monkeys just a couple hours earlier (I did a little theater hopping).
That's the main reason that this film, despite being nearly 30 years old and set 20 years earlier than that, still manages to appeal to young people of today who laugh and have fun with it, and of course, sing those timeless songs.
I'm a big fan of Olivia Newton-John and her (earlier) music, think she's lovely in this picture and a lovely lady still.
So 'Au coeur du mensonge' belongs to a relatively marginalised (and recent) position in Chabrol's filmography; its most famous predecessors are 'Cop au vin' and 'Inspecteur Lavardin' (although there are important echoes of earlier Chabrol classics like 'Que le bete meure' and 'Le Boucher').
himself, his criminal go-between, and Rene's friend, Regis, even, as the coroner cheerfully suggests, a woman with strong hands and gloves - an exact description of Vivianne earlier.
Unlike the Sixth Sense with its slick execution, script and delivery, Art of the Devil 2 had a rather satisfactory ending, but with the final stroke of the pen in creating the finale, it presented itself with a major loophole that seemed to have glossed over what transpired earlier, which is a big no-no in trying to force audiences to accept the "new truth".
Several moments in the film are inspired directly from Malory and earlier Medieval codices.
3/10  FIFTH MATCH- ROB VAN DAM & KANE VS. DUDLEY BOYS FOR THE WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP SPECIAL GUEST REFEREE: CHIEF MORLIEY {VAL VENIS} Just like the Smackdown tag team match earlier in the night.
So this would be a fairly unmediated labour of love from the man who penned Casablanca 40 years earlier, and damn if I don't like it better than Casablanca - if there's one thing I wanted to see it's a portrait of the lapsed poet as an old womanizing souse.
The two earlier films merit a place of honor for trying to achieve cinematic beauty.
The main white character's daughter (Rochelle Hudson in 1934, Sandra Dee in 1959) works better in the earlier version, as Hudson is a better actress than Dee.
A moment earlier on in the movie is particularly offensive when she is asked to hold a goggle eyed, smiling "darkie" pose to model the sign for the pancake business.
My motivation for responding is due to an earlier opinion on this movie, specifically: "the central character of Delilah is the worst kind of racial stereotype; a relentlessly cheerful mammy, perfectly satisfied to spend her life tending to the needs of her white employer".
Some of the earlier parts of this film are beautifully done, and somewhat fun and exhilarating, but it bogs down a bit toward the end with the seemingly endless shoot-out.
When a Hong Kong magnate sets out on an expedition to find a prehistoric ape in India, he and the others find not only the ape but also a scantily clad woman (Evelyne Kraft) who's known the big guy ever since her plane crashed in the jungle many years earlier.
The action is a lot more visceral than most disaster films, with lots of people being caught up and crushed in Mighty Peking Man's rampage, or other events in the earlier part of the film.
But the ending is too abrupt and, as I said earlier, there is not enough story fill the space with.
Furthermore, everyone is guilty of giving lazy performances, especially Chamberlain and Stone who merely trot out the characteristics they built in the earlier film without trying to find a way to develop their characters further.
The films are full of the clichÃ© scenes that filled Tarzan and earlier jungle films, clichÃ©s that have since become attached to the Indiana Jones films by those unfamiliar with the earlier genre.
Some of the earlier jungle films were produced under extraordinary duress, and attempts here to produce tongue in cheek replicas of the earlier works can certainly be missed by those whose only familiarity with film is through the post 70s media.
When campers and staff members mysteriously become victims of frying, burning and skinning Ronnie can't help but think of the grisly murders two decades earlier at Camp Arawak.
Of course, many of the supporting characters in these films were jerks who got what they had coming to them, but the earlier movies were somewhat grounded by having at least a couple of normal and somewhat sympathetic people in lead roles.
As I said earlier, the bad guys are essentially idiots, so its just possible that they have not got their heads round the technicalities of hijacking.
I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man.
Why not years earlier in her life while she was still vulnerable before she had fully developed her personality & career?
They run afoul of a local brat after feeding his grandfather acid (oh, it was his sister that they molested earlier by the by).
Using interviews with scholars, statesmen and the mothers of murdered Black Panthers along with members of the community, this earlier film provides an intellectual context that explains the emergence of gangs from the ashes of militancy, whereas the Pearlta doc shows little more than a litany of anger and self-pity.
Marins' HALLUCINATIONS is a brilliant collage consisting of many disturbing, bizarre, and imaginatively perverse scenes which were censored from his earlier films.
), this feature is cobbled together from material censored out of Marins' earlier "Coffin Joe" films.
A medium that kills because you watch it (in 'The Ring' a videotape, here an internet-site), a little girl that is probably the key to solve the problem, a woman and a guy searching for the answer, both saw the site and therefor they both have to hurry, and why they have to hurry has something to do with earlier events.
- apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene earlier in the film - some real in-depth character development going on here.)
Indeed, he uses a pool cue in the bar fight, but he never wields a club either like the Rock or much earlier as Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did in the previous theatrical releases.
Incidentally, the crypt appeared to have dry-stone walls; dry-stone walls do not remain intact for 200 years without maintenance, so I think Lucy's remains would have been found at least 150 years earlier!
Stewart seems to think that simply communing with sharks (which in an earlier scene includes grabbing hold of one and lovingly stroking its flank) is helpful to their cause.
I saw the oldest boy wearing Nikes and jeans in one scene, yet when they finally left the house they were wearing clothes that have been outdated 50 years earlier than 1987 when the film was made.
But there's a catch; her marriage had been earlier disapproved by the old man and he won't let her a penny if he finds out she has children.
The film could and should have ended much earlier.
"Event Horizon": Another movie about a ship, but this time a different kind; a search and rescue space shuttle searching for an abandon vessel that disappeared seven years earlier.
I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually, and fight!
He snips out all developments, abandons all his characters, fails to release tension that he builds up unnecessarily, meanders like a schizophrenic tunnel rat in a maze, throws random scenes at the viewer in a barrage of images that might as well have been edited together using an aleatory computer program or an astrological chart... and finally, he repeats and repeats and repeats the same stupid mistakes of his earlier movies as if self-criticism and self-learning were signs of weakness.
He's also convinced that his girlfriend, who was sacrificed three years earlier, might still be alive somehow.
Another maddening element are certain jumps in the time line that make it even harder to follow the already chaotic "storyline" I found also utterly unrealistic that a concerned father would leave his terminally ill wive and his deranged son who, as he notes earlier is "not very good with strange people".
),and dialogue from earlier in the film overlapping inside someone's head with extra reverb all just stank of mid-nineties college movie to me.
This film is very much a political message and what a shame these films were not made earlier when the actual war was taking place.
They got their whole lives ahead of them, but earlier than they've bargained for, they have to realize that in a game like this there's only losers but no winners.
I disliked this as much as I enjoyed the earlier, London, released in 1994.
Baby Boy not only lacks a conscious, it also lacks the realism that John Singleton's earlier movies had.
I'll admit that I laughed at the scene where Jody and Sweetpea beat the hell out of a bunch of teenage punks that jumped Jody earlier but the laughter turned to disgust as soon as Sweetpea pulls out his belt and starts whipping the final victim for showing no fear.
If you want see better movies from John Singleton see his earlier works like the movies I mentioned earlier in this review and forget that this overtly preachy joke exists if you can.
The plot has been explained by many others but (Spoiler alert) most missed the fact that Fonda had fathered a child years earlier when he and his "clean-cut" pals gang raped Holden's daughter and got away Scot-free.
Most disappointing is the film's ending, where the two 'surprise twists' are that obvious you've earlier dismissed them as being too blatant!
They interview Susan who tells them of a date Jenny had been on that night with a man named Charlie (Turk Chekovsky) who had been in the office where they work earlier in the day looking for a job, and that they should question her boss Donald Andrews (Bob Winters).
A group of friends buy and move into an old Long Island house, where 12 years earlier, a priest was brutally murdered by a teenager who hanged himself before he could be tried by the police.
"The Were-wolf of London" and "The Wolf-man" did this much better--several decades earlier.
It's very clear that the relationship between little Bobby and big Babe was inspired by earlier Chaplin films, in which the Little Tramp was bullied by huge Mack Swain or burly Eric Campbell.
Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.
The dynamite should have been used a hour earlier.
Now I have compared this film to earlier low-budget sci-fi films, but this isn't totally fair.
Altman tries to instill the same sort of divine chaos on his massive ensemble that he did in "Nashville" to such tremendous effect, but without the strong narrative threads that anchored the earlier movie, this one flounders around without going anywhere.
He promptly moves in on Nelson's intended love interest Polly Durant (Alice Day) who he had met earlier in a failed pickup.
Which is not to mention the assault he puts on two white guys at a bar earlier in the movie, again not getting pursued at all.
Sorry about writing in CAPS earlier, I just thought it might be funny if the director saw that and got excited, then was let down when he read the rest.
The notion of 'real robots' once so central to earlier incarnations of Gundam effectively fades away with the introduction of inexplicably godlike mecha for most of the major characters, reaching the apotheosis of absurdity with the one Kira receives.
At a later date she is apparently ready to "screw the rich" (as discussed earlier in a tender moment) via Eurabic alliances bolstered by her Christian mother's money.
he can't get it up until, under her direct orders, he fantasizes about this girl they saw earlier in the day at which point he does just fine.
Though I found Pixar's earlier work to be more enjoyable and humorous, such as their shorts from Toy Story 1 and A Bugs Life, it still was fun to watch and suitable for all ages.
I believe something like that really happened, but there's so little hint of it earlier in the movie that it's just confusing when it happens.
When you look at what people like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan were doing over 20 years earlier it makes you wonder how these people have the face to make such rubbish.
In many ways it's a bit reminiscent of Robert Taylor's earlier film, CAMILLE, as both are about fated romances.
Even more disturbing is that Jerusalema premiered at the Berlin Film Festival earlier this year, and has already been raking in the awards.
It doesn't build (except a viewers annoyance) and when the final twist arrives, the movie finally offers viewers some mercy and arbitrarily ends it there; but calling it quits forty minutes earlier would have been just dandy.
The finale is a big disappointment in all respects... hardly touching on some of the more interesting elements introduced earlier in the movie.
Gary Cole plays a nearly suicidal attorney whose best friend, played by William Petersen, takes on as his rescue project, having been through his own nervous breakdown earlier.
This is one of a host of films which in the 1970s revived the atomic mutant animal genre popular two decades earlier (exemplified by THEM!
Her plans fall apart when the group discovers the area is populated by dangerous ants who have apparently come into contact with the nuclear waste mentioned earlier.
It could be forgiven if it had been made 20 years earlier but it wasn't.
And as mentioned by someone earlier, Donner has "ring rust".
Now this may well have been somewhat shocking to the viewer if it were not for one problem; the writers had already drawn attention to said cigarette case earlier in the episode by having Lois steal it from the crime scene.
A Few years ago, I found this at a Flea Market, after catching the trailer on the VHS of The Wizard Of Gore years earlier.
I'm not sure if its the dinner I ate earlier, but I suspect it has more to do with the movie.
Yet as it came out in 1975, a year earlier than that movie, it clearly cannot be an "Omen" rip-off.
Â	John Drew Barrymore had just taken up his middle name to distance himself from his legendary father; in earlier roles (The Big Night, While the City Sleeps), he was billed as John Barrymore, Jr.
The former top comedian had been banned from the screen almost ten years earlier but was making a decent living directing comedies for other performers under the name of William Goodrich.
Old men tend to make art that is shallow, imitative of their earlier, better works, and which would never garner an ounce of praise were it not for their backlog of greater works somehow letting their patina still rub off.
In it, one can see many pastiches from earlier Fellini films, much as Ingmar Bergman cribbed ideas and scenes from his earlier masterpieces for his disastrously bad last film Saraband, the way Akira Kurosawa tossed random ideas together for Dreams, and the way Woody Allen has constantly reworked themes from his 1970s and 1980s great films into his last decade's worth of mostly mediocrities.
Having become a b movie fan earlier this year, I made it my goal to watch a majority of the "bad" films that exist.
This not included garbage made today, I'm talking about 90's and earlier.
Perhaps it was filmed years earlier and released after she became popular.
I beg to differ with an earlier poster who thought this movie was a 'wonderful little flick'.
Just a couple years earlier, Pam Grier starred in COFFEY--one of the best of the so-called blaxploitation films.
Now, by 1975, she was making lousy films like SHEBA BABY and Friday FOSTER--films that were just pale imitations of these earlier successes.
Well done, that man....  Can't help but agree with an earlier post -I am SHOCKED to see so many people give positive reviews to this inane drivel and felt I needed to redress the balance somewhat.
Had this movie been made 50 years earlier, this costume might have been borderline-acceptable.
Because she is moronic and didn't flee to Hong Kong earlier.
Directed by Alexander Gruszynski this was actually a sequel to Seagal's terrible earlier straight-to-video/DVD action thriller The Foreigner (2003) a couple of years previous in which he played CIA agent Jonathan Cold racing across Europe with a deadly package, so Black Dawn which is titled The Foreigner 2 in some countries moves the story to the US & is the sequel no-one wanted.
After going to such lengths to make her the success his wife wasn't able to be, he suddenly changes his mind for no apparent reason and wants to keep her "safe" while the vicious Prima Donna he earlier drove away COMES BACK.
), he decides to cut the chandelier loose (a bit predicted much, much earlier in the film in one of the worst and most awkward bits of foreshadowing I have ever seen).
This is a very-much copied western which belongs technically to the category of Randolph Scott westerns; this large and interesting body of work itself should be divided I suggest into the 1940s B/W series, and the 1950s color series; this is one of the earlier color efforts, an expensive-looking production but with somewhat inconsistent color.
I found this new series by Pax entirely dependent on the earlier season with Kellie Martin.
If you hadn't seen earlier episodes, you wouldn't know what the devil was going on!
The chief culprits here are the scriptwriters, who seem to have based their scenario on earlier Custer movies instead of serious historical research.
As pointed out earlier they do mention the shuttle.
If it's any consolation, you'll be remembered for earlier films a lot more.
Like his earlier Bowling for Columbine the film is very much a set up, especially in the second half where Moore's antics or at least his camera crew and presence result in some staged scenes-the whole Cuba thing.
And that Chris Morris didn't pen Nathan Barley earlier.
In which case, you won't care--you and your friends will be more geeked about having scored that six-pack earlier in the evening than anything that happens in any video you might be renting tonight.
The sequel, "More Sex..." had begun, and about a half-hour into it, I noticed the former lover who had impregnated her, and had earlier announced his returning to his wife (but only after "messing-up" the bed clothes with her in their hotel room) appeared at her door, announcing a now impending divorce.
Jack King's 'Hollywood Capers' is a very early Looney Tune which stars several of the characters who were introduced as potential new stars in earlier short 'I Haven't Got a Hat'.
It simply exploits a spurious association and in so doing drags down the earlier work.
The original play was also the source of two earlier and better screen versions.
Having recently watched both earlier versions prior to watching this film I'm left wondering if it wouldn't have been easier to just make something up rather than pay royalties for a source that the filmmakers were going to ignore anyway.
Keep in mind a single piece of paper was sent through time a couple of days earlier, and it knocked out a whole city's power!
All of a sudden the main characters start disappearing from the "story" and start entering some kind of green lit "killing room" where they get tortured to death by some demonic person who has a short cameo earlier in the film.
Perhaps Hooper thought he could capture lightning in a bottle for a second time, like he did with "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" a couple years earlier (even going so far as to bring back Marilyn Burns to play the part of a victim once more).
The abrupt high-pitched finale recalls both Hooper's own earlier film and Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977) which, coincidentally, I watched the very same day as this one; as far as I'm aware, Michael Reeves' WITCHFINDER GENERAL (1968) was the first to use this highly effective practice Â concluding events on a downbeat tone despite the inherent happy endingÂ
Before M. Night Shamaylan started making horribly inadequate movies after the superior "Sixth Sense" Tobe Hooper twenty years earlier was following up his cult masterpiece "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" with the dull and moronic "Eaten Alive".
(Didn't she tell him that earlier?)
In a throwback to an earlier Jason sequel, he bundles a babe into a sleeping bag and smokes her to death over a fire.
I didn't feel right just taking it without giving him anything in return, so, being the modest person that he was, he told me simply to buy this movie for him as he had noticed it at Suncoast a few days earlier.
Almost immediately, Cher gives Walt a job, but their relationship is soon tested as they continue to live in L.A.  As I said earlier, the Farrellys don't know what to do with all of their material that isn't offensive, and since the essence of them is in their ability to offend people, they don't have anything up their sleeves to show us.
I know this was way before CG animation and special effects, but good lord, the effects on Star Trek TOS 10 years plus earlier looked better than this!
as someone noted earlier, the movie does not look poorly made.
The director has actors portraying characters from the earlier part of his life, and interacting with him as he "plays" himself.
It's also obvious that Lenny was the guy who attacked Lou earlier in the film in New York City that left her almost dead and that this time, in secluded Shealter Island, he was going to finish the job that he started back there.
There was also the local Shealter Island Sheriff Deluca, Chris Penn, who also got into the act later in the movie, after you forgot all about him and thought that his brainless actions earlier were just comic relief.
Even though mom arrived minutes after the tornado hit (and had to evade a police roadblock to do so) the daughter -- who had, by the way, ignored an earlier cellphone message from weather-guru mom warning of the impending twister -- tears a strip off mom, apparently for not being there with her while the school was being torn apart ("Where were you?
It's also confusing to see some sequences that were obviously meant original for mainly "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" and "Revenge of the Pink Panther" incorporated into this movie as part of the story but however these different sequences obviously don't really connect with each other also because most of those sequences are basically the same, though less good, ones that got eventually used in those earlier mentioned movies.
This second half of the film mixes Lumley's interviews with Clouseau's contemporaries with heavy doses of flashback footage (from earlier Panthers), all of it so much better that the new stuff.
Even when it attempts to be funny on its own, Edwards resorts to stealing these gags (as opposed to the footage) from earlier triumphs.
You know, where you're watching for 10 minutes, the character wakes up, takes a couple steps forward, then wakes up again 10 minutes earlier.
I'm going to be fair and say I enjoyed director Ulf Malmros's earlier outing, "Den BÃ¤sta Sommaren" from 2000, but this just wasn't up to par.
and the twist at the end with ghost was just brilliant, because you always believed Tatiana her role, but there are a lot of clues earlier.
Years earlier a series of accidental deaths caused the park to close and for people to stay away.
A bit like the traffic accident I mentioned earlier.
Return to an earlier time while viewing this comedy-that-never-was, and please don't expect to walk away with a moral, or inspired.
By the way at the time this was being filmed, Howard Hughes was panting after Janet Leigh the same way he'd earlier panted after Ava Gardner.
It is incredibly poorly written (even for an RKO picture) and makes his earlier Republic Films look like masterpieces by comparison (and a few actually were).
This film, 35 years later, sticks more or less to the same narrative path, based as it is on the novel and the earlier screenplay, but is louder, splashier, and gorier.
The narrative flow of the book and earlier film are replaced by a disjointed mess of unrelated scenes.
It does compare favorably to that version; I think the situation works better in an older, black and white film from ten years earlierÂ and, this version is a re-make of an even earlier version, "It Happened One Night".
**SPOILERS** (If you've never seen a horror film before)  The victims turn out to be the children of lynch mob members who hung a man outside the asylum 15 years earlier, who've been lured there and trapped inside.
This powerful and well-made Korean War drama is not quite in the same league as Milestone's earlier classic, but it still paints a vivid picture of the harsh realities of combat, and conveys a palpable sense of the pointlessness of war.
He gives his best performance since Twelve O'Clock High a decade earlier.
1st watched 2/19/2007 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Sherman Scott): Over-the-top marijuana educational film goes way beyond it's earlier predecessor's with an obvious bigger budget but having the same results.
There are some special effects thrown in on this movie but otherwise it's very similar to it's earlier exploitation movies about the horrors of the drug.
The star of the film is Lila Leeds, a promising starlet who had very minor roles in earlier films, but achieved worldwide notoriety when she was arrested along with Robert Mitchum and other for smoking pot in 1948.
The big thuds for me were the victims' inability to get away from attacking puppets and the leap of insight which allowed Jane to find some evidence of earlier activities.
Directed by David DeCoteau under the name Victoria Sloan one of his many pseudonym's he had actually directed Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) but there's no repeat of his earlier magic & Curse of the Puppet Master is pretty dire stuff & even at a paltry 75 odd minutes in length the script feels padded & uneventful.
There's no continuity to the earlier films at all, there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films.
Reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore, I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci's earlier "giallo" period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but, even on the latter, his commitment was arguably unquestionable.
Coincidentally, the maniac responsible escaped from the asylum two weeks earlier, and he naturally will be waiting for a fresh shipment of teenagers to kill.
I read an earlier review that hit the nail on the head.
I tried to watch it earlier tonight but it's so horrifically dated.
END OF SPOILERS  I was lucky enough to win free passes to see this movie two days earlier than everyone else, and boy am I glad.
Hungarian film-making had glorious times about 50 years earlier, but it is just struggling now.
If the Ice Man really did come from a much earlier civilization, what happened to all those buildings in that civilization?
FIST OF THE NORTH STAR   Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Sound format: Ultra-Stereo  Low-budget Americanization of the Japanese manga 'Hokuto no Ken' - already the subject of an earlier anime feature and TV series - in which a mystical warrior (British-born martial arts expert Gary Daniels) defends the survivors of an unspecified global holocaust from an evil warlord (Costas Mandylor) who intends to rebuild the planet in his own image.
As noted earlier, Tweed attempts to make use of every "neat" shot in Requiem for a Dream, and misses the mark completely, his reasoning being that such shots will add "depth" and "meaning" to the picture, when instead they come off as merely baffling.
The ending is shocking when you put all the pieces together of what he has done earlier in the film leading up to this, even involving his children screaming to see how far it travels!
One of the significant differences is the use of a slow build-up of complications and tension over a period of time in the average thriller; horror movies tend to deliver the scares much earlier, and often feature some element of the supernatural.
Williams who brought much charisma to earlier roles such as Things To Do In Denver When You Are Dead and Once Upon a Time In America (Even in Substitute 2) is surprisingly flat here.
Plus, his character is even more stereotypical than these earlier roles.
In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (that means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.).
In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show.
The Dr who was being nice to the children earlier on in the film gets the worst death ever, and I mean worst, luckily he gets a lolly straight after.
I read a comment earlier about this movie being great because it was realistic and did not make up some crazy fantastical ending.
It also seems that all the new students that lives in the "asylum" has had some issues in their earlier lives, and now the doctor has come back to "cure" them.
Someone earlier said that this movie "must be seen and not analyzed."
The big thuds for me were the victims' inability to get away from attacking puppets and the leap of insight which allowed Jane to find some evidence of earlier activities.
Directed by David DeCoteau under the name Victoria Sloan one of his many pseudonym's he had actually directed Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) but there's no repeat of his earlier magic & Curse of the Puppet Master is pretty dire stuff & even at a paltry 75 odd minutes in length the script feels padded & uneventful.
There's no continuity to the earlier films at all, there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films.
An earlier reviewer said his friend thought this was the worst movie he'd ever seen.
There was an attempt, I think, to try and pull away from some of the traditions of the earlier entries and add some new things (like the man-eating mailbox) but the filmmakers seemed to miss the fact that most fans of the Addams Family want to see the old clichÃ©s and traditions.
Geoffreys plays his role WAY too nerdy and is even lousy when he's killing--and he was so good in "Fright Night" four years earlier!
I have not seen the Renegade Edition, so my review is based on the earlier version.
As I stated earlier, randomness can be funny when it's done correctly (examples are Stella, Aqua Teen, and of course Monty Python, etc).
Jesse (Arye Gross) & his girlfriend Kate (Lar Park-Lincoln) move in, the two people shot & killed earlier in the film just happen to be Jesse's parents.
This House tale has nothing to do with the first "House" of a couple of years earlier and doesn't really qualify as a sequel even as it tries to capture some of that same wry humor, but it doesn't stand well on its own, being mostly non-sensical.
Some ghost or demon has been after a special skull for unknown reasons, killing the main character's parents 25 years earlier.
When you get experienced enough as a filmmaker and you learned most of the tricks of the trade, you realise that the best thing to do for an art-house director is to stick mindlessly to whatever made you successful with the festival-going crowd and the film critics earlier.
But as I said earlier the worst part of this deal is not the quality itself rather than the abandoned promises... Looks like they promised us the stars but left us dangling in the gutter, instead.
Sometimes you wondered why they did not use powerful objects from earlier episodes.
Once again, as in the earlier film two years before, we have babes in bikinis toting machine guns, killing people while saying 'poor little man' and smirking and simpering and wiggling their busts.
The saying "sequels ain't equals" is definitely demonstrated in this completely lackluster follow-up to the earlier brilliantly witty "Fritz the Cat".
While both films portray an anthropomorphic view of 70s counterculture using animals, and both use the shock value of drugs, sex and cursing to stir up a reaction; this movie by a totally different production team completely lacks any of the charm, personality, or essential feeling that made the earlier film so appealing.
I think I'll stick to the ToeTag's earlier work.
This movie will be liked best by fans of the makers earlier work.
It really does a disservice to the earlier film of the same title if it is not a remake.
Some of the earlier reviewers have called "Clockwatchers" dull, pointless and have asked why it was made.
Ravi Chopra has made Baghban before 3 years earlier than Baabul.they have the same problem at all.BORING BORING BORING BORING ... Do i recommend Salman Khan to accept himself as a 41 years old man.he is not Prem Choudhary of Maine Pyar Kiya no more.maybe he is Aditya Sekhri at Lucky: No Time for Love,that's all with the film.boring fast food.
When he tells his teammates at the beginning of the second half `forget what I said earlier' it's no problem for the audience since we didn't hear this kid make any speech.
When the ad break finished I was somewhat bemused to find out that it actually was Neighbours, it was a repeat of an earlier episode.
But the later seasons were better than the earlier ones.
Most especially why after being taught several lessons about trusting strangers earlier in the film?
Some people complain about Araki's earlier films not having much character development.
Hapless has-beens Curtis, Starr and Hamilton play a few of her earlier grooms.
Adding insult to injury is the fact that again, at 85, Mae West delivers all her lines in basically the same delivery: basically a parody of her earlier self.
This mentality was a radical departure from the earlier, vastly more entertaining Roach/McGowan entries; unfortunately these later MGM installments are what most people have seen.
An earlier reviewer said his friend thought this was the worst movie he'd ever seen.
To make matters worse, the footage editors didn't even bother to remove the original on-screen text from US Navy Seals in the carrier scene...the text that says "Off The Coast of Lebanon" does not match the on screen text used earlier and for the rest of "Stealth Fighter" - it's like comparing italic Times New Roman to Arial font.
The only other commando left, who couldn't even shoot straight with a well aimed pistol earlier on, kills the baddie with a machine gun fired from the hip.
Also that earlier film deals with Shakepeare and interpreting the Bard, things are put into a context.
And even with this chronological sorting, they seemed to actually forget scenes and had to tack them on later as additional flashbacks that had little to do with the scene, but desperately needed introduction earlier.
Also, as another reviewer pointed out earlier, he belabored to death the fact that he was "too little" to do pretty much anything, which became irritating.
Her telling adds no insight or additional perspective to the earlier scene; I guess it's there for people who showed up late (helpfully, footage from the scene is shown over her shoulder, as if she's Katie Couric or something).
It's instructive to compare 'The Big Combo' with another detective film, 'Mystery Street', filmed earlier in 1950.
As I mentioned earlier, all the actors are real pros and deliver solid performances.
The Box listed a cast that included Pat O'Brien and Jack Elam in addition to the folks I discussed earlier.
One can't say that Jia has lost the complexity of environment he achieved in his earlier films; he's just limited its focus.
I was intrigued to see this movie after I found out that it was one of Keanu's earlier film debuts.
When a film this dull runs over two hours, all the earlier irritants become even more noticeable.
As I alluded to earlier, the scope and breadth of the film is not conducive to a feature-length film.
What might stand for a defending factor for 'The Conrad Boys' is the fact that it was released in one year earlier which might have helped the makers of 'Shelter'.
While this film is radically different from Jia's earlier films it still packs the same cultural criticism wallop.
A commentary on the urbanization of modern day China, Jia has moved into the slick world of government approved film-making without losing touch with the direction of his earlier films.
"Captain Pirate" qualifies as a mediocre 85-minute sequel of sorts to actor Louis Hayward's earlier epic "Fortunes of Captain Blood."
Like Medina, several of these thespians appeared earlier in "Fortunes of Captain Blood."
Don't worry if you missed it--the entire FIRST HALF of the film are scenes from the earlier movie!
For starters literally the whole first half are scenes from the earlier movie.
The old actors (Rosewood and Serge) are embarrassing parodies of their earlier roles, and I do mean embarrassing.
The life and joy of the earlier films is replaced with a lethargic laziness in all areas - acting, story, action, even the predictable romance with the park attendant (Theresa Randle) feels tacked on at the last minute.
All it does is make you wish you were watching the earlier films or maybe something like "Bad Boys".
Whereas "Bad Boys" is the true successor to the earlier "Beverly Hills Cop" films due to its heavily stylish look and comedic approach to the cop genre, this is tired and rehashed filler.
Just a year earlier, Barry Shear had made the film Across 110th Street, regarded as the most violent movie ever made up to that point, so it's perhaps no surprise that this film emphasises the gore and brutality to the extent it does.
As I said earlier, the fights seem to just happen for no reason.
He seemed utterly unaware that the Hey Hey of 1991 onwards and the Hey Hey from 1983 to 1990, probably earlier, were two utterly different shows.
Everybody's performance was weak and unconvincing in light of earlier treatments of the same subject.
The Portuguese had only fled Angola and Mozambique 6 years earlier when Portugal and Spain threw off the fascist yoke themselves.
You might like Fliegauf's "Dealer" maybe if you haven't seen his earlier films.
She insisted that she wanted to fool Germany of the money as payment for some furs she earlier had lost due to the involvement of that nation, and that she never gathered any intelligence for them.
My brother convinced me to sit and watch moving target and in the end i was pleased i did.It wasn't the god awful acting or the laughable dialogue that brought a smile to my face it was the fact that this movie was basically a remake of an earlier film of wilsons.By changing a few names,filming in a new location (uk) and mixing around a few scenarios they tried to pass this one off as a fresh idea.If you have seen bloodfist4-die trying there is no need to waste 90 minutes on this movie because if you've seen die trying your watching the same story...same ending... same man...just on a different continent,the only reason i kept watching was the constant laughter prevented me from being able to reach for the remote
At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk, for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real, real good reason for him to hate doing it, and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough.
If the Ice Man really did come from a much earlier civilization, what happened to all those buildings in that civilization?
This is one of the weakest of Randolph Scott's earlier westerns.
Still it's an earlier weepy for Shirley.
Of course, earlier he mumbles something about the laws of physics not applying within the sun itself, and I guess he's the expert so he ought to know, but I can't help but wonder silly things like how the sun can burn right through the wall of the bomb housing (which bomb, for some reason, requires a crew of nuts to run it right up to the sun-- I guess there's a real danger of missing a target as tiny as Old Sol) without burning right on through him, too.
Sure, Mace earlier may have been feeling piqued and petty, Capa having pulled a bit of a careless dumb with regard to their window for sending messages home, but the fact here is that it's not my job to make Mace's excuses.
Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) also used to be Countess Bathory's loyal servant when they were executed several hundred years earlier for their gruesome crimes.
In one scene, when Donny is pointing out to Marie someone who might have been one of the criminals chasing them in an earlier scene, she says she can't see them because she's not wearing her glasses?
Joe Dalessandro and Sylvia Krystel were top sex symbols at the time "La marge" was made; the former still had the infamous Warhol trilogy stamped all over him , while the latter had found stardom a couple of years earlier with the legendary "Emanuelle".
Today I went to the movies to see "Funny Games," an apparent shot for shot remake of an Austrian film produced ten years or so earlier which I also didn't see.
Consistency and continuity have been tossed overboard, not just in regard to previous season, but even with things established just an episode earlier.
After the opening, the film goes around and shows the story of the "stranger" from earlier in the film, who has now been released from prison and wants to start his life over again.
According to earlier exposition the police had 'torn the place apart' looking for clues so why not find that severed hand only a few feet away from a murder victim?
Most earlier games, like Zork and Adventure, were solely text-based.
One of the earlier scenes where they are talking about giving a press conference and Dean goes, "The press has a victim, now they need a villain."
How does it stack up against his earlier films?
This is a bit more "arty" than earlier Tsukamoto films, but well worth seeing and very unsettling.
He must have felt his career was going backwards as the production values here are second rate even by the marginal standards of his earlier films.
I also admit that this Ron Marchini film is far, far better than an earlier film I saw that that he "starred" in ("Death Machines") because he actually has dialog to deliver in this one (in "DM" he was a silent zombie killing machine) and he gets to kick people in the face on a regular basis (where in DM, the actual fights were few and dully staged).
Incidentally, Roberto Rossellini had already made a film out of Arthur Honneggerâs opera JOAN OF ARC AT THE STAKE (1954; which has, thankfully, just been released as a SE DVD in Italy) featuring the directorâs then-wife Ingrid Bergman; I havenât watched this yet but did recently acquire the latterâs earlier 1948 film about the famous inspirational but misunderstood warrior-saint.
Mikels certainly has improved his style since the 60's in that his newer films are much more briskly-paced, more entertaining, and action-packed (he has a funny cameo which cleverly incorporates his earlier cameos).
Just to correct some earlier posts.
Stunning cinematography, moments of serene bliss cutting effortlessly to shocking scenes more akin to his earlier Tetsuo imagery.
The story ends with both the Men of Goona and Women of Wongo falling in love with each other as the Women of Goona and Men of Wongo did earlier.
Then again, as has been intimated by an earlier poster, perhaps not that much lower.
I was mostly familiar with Scott for his Tarzan portrayals of several years earlier, some of which were quite good; of course, he is also well known for his roles in Italian musclemen epics, playing mythical heroes named Goliath or Maciste.
My theory is that they just needed a reason to have a man diving into a mirage that is really just hot sand to add to the sight gag of the kids plowing a wooden shack to the ground because they thought it was a mirage, just like the cavernous mansion that disappeared before their eyes earlier.
They just sit there emotionless...probably because it happened a month earlier and the "fans" couldn't recreate the raw feelings they had that October night.
The plane is hijacked quite early in the film and even after the passengers decide that they must act they spent another half hour making calls, you can't help but think that if they had organised themselves earlier that they might have had more success retaking the plane.
They watch a film (this one) that shows a hijacker wearing a bomb-belt, when he was earlier shown going through X-ray security at Newark airport.
He bemoans this by scolding the portrait he had apparently painted of the man earlier on and then getting drunk and angry in a bar, tossing out patrons.
As someone said earlier, Travolta debuting is just plain weird, and the fact that Anton LaVey hisself has a cameo just makes this a cheesy scream queen classic.
Watching that film might also lead you to the same query as posited earlier, but at least WWoW had a campy flavor and didn't take itself as seriously as this one.
The basic plot has a white ninja battling a dark ninja group because the bad ninjas want to take the land where they think their secret wealth was hidden after it was stolen many years earlier (this doesn't take into account the fact the bad ninjas kill the good ninja's wife because she can't tell them where he is).
If the movie had finished 40 minutes earlier, I would give a rating of 9 for its stunning music & lyrics, original presentation and the brilliant performance of Anil Kapoor.
  After Seeing the other works of the directors (Coneheads & The Last Unicorn) I didn't really expect much in this movie, since its older and the directors might not have done better earlier in their career.
Only the professor notices, so he reverses the switch yet again... demonstrates to his disbelieving colleague, jerking everybody on and off... the world 'compensates' by being cranked extra fast, Keystone-fashion... and the whole thing descends into slapdash tedium of a fairly primitive kind, which has ceased some time earlier to be entertaining.
Bing Crosby stars in his second big screen version of the Cole Porter Broadway smash, although this plot has been modified slightly and brought up to date 50' style..it therefore tells a completely different story to Crosby's first version twenty years earlier.
But the earlier episodes don't come off too well either.
It confirmed - from Haley's own notes - earlier claims that the alleged history of the book was a near-total invention.
Interestingly, the Traveler had earlier discussed with Picard Wesley's future would be an interesting one leaving the viewer to wonder what would become of this throughout the rest of the series run...
But, trust me, if you see the earlier version, you'll see where I'm coming from.)
Said travel includes flashbacks for The Hero to an earlier time when he suffered heavily at the hands of the same savage gang.
And she didn't reach for a coat hangar earlier because why?
But earlier, the camera does engage.
It was one of the changes that completely negated the earlier, excellent episodes.
These things are bad by themselves but also taint all the earlier episodes.
Not only that, but by trying to write himself out of his corner, Moore's writing turned most of the events in the earlier seasons totally unnecessary, ruining the series as a whole.
Else I can only agree with earlier downbeats by adding a few of my own.
I was brought up in an English village during the same period (the Fifties) in which this production was set (although the book was written about 20 years earlier), but I didn't "recognise" any of the characters.
One man (who had earlier been injured in an explosion) is tasked with tracking down Nicole Kidman alone.
You'd think that in a pressure situation where you had bitched and moaned earlier about possibly not getting any protection, you'd be a LITTLE more cooperative with the people who are now PROTECTING YOU!
2) After the horrible things Gwen has to say about Kyle at the end, Caleb (who earlier professed how much he cares for Kyle) doesn't even bat an eye and still wants to be with Gwen.
I consider myself a fan of Bob Dylan within moderation, and I thoroughly enjoyed the previous documentary about his earlier European tour, DON'T LOOK BACK.
"The Claim" begins with the brownish look of some of the earlier Clint Eastwood westerns and seems to almost attempt to emulate some of that feeling.
They should've gotten the point across earlier in the movie, to keep the viewers attention.
The lines of good and evil are as stark as in any of his earlier adventures.
This version has sacrificed everything--everything--that made the novel and the earlier version so wonderful, so human.
In spite of being light on effects and budget the earlier PBS production makes much better use of its resources to communicate LeGuinn's apocalyptic drama to the viewer.
This movie wimped out in several places by watering down the script to avoid any racial overtones, so well handled in both the book and the earlier film.
Some of his earlier directorial projects were good, but what possessed him to make this film is beyond me.
Beginning at Tahiti, its thriving commerce and tourist aspects of the day contrast with the reception that had greeted the arrival of the Bounty, shown earlier.
With football violence being a common theme for films nowadays, and with the release of new film The Firm, it's good I got a chance to see this film again that was one of the earlier films to deal with the matter (aside, of course, from the original The Firm.)
The special effects were surpassed in movies made thirty years earlier.
A re-run of 'Went The Day Well' in the middle does not match the earlier wartime movie.
He was probably remembering what had happened three years earlier to his Captain Clark character in "The Eagle Has Landed" -- defeated by hoakum even as he assumes command after Larry Hagman (doing a Yank version of a Pythonesque/John Cleese kind of military idiot) gets a slug in the head by a tea and bisquit matron.
As an earlier comment posted, the words "based upon" always gives the authors of a script a lot of creative options.
The director, a tenth degree black-bekt and Undefeated Florida Full-Contact Heavyweight Karate Champion, has made some absolutely hideous films (The Watchers http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096425/ being the worst example), but Mars is a big improvement over his earlier works.
Now that demand is being extended to earlier American losses.
Well, as a fan of earlier 007 movies I was hoping for a restoration of the standard that was set with Sean and Roger.
Here, although Ferrell's character felt like a retread of earlier, better performances, he appeared to try his best.
Another dampener is that there is no one intelligent enough to stretch L's mental abilities to the last point (as Kira did earlier) rather here L acts more like anyone secret service agents (he even throws something to save the lil kid in the movie).
Unlike the earlier Death Notes :   * there is hardly a plot   * no brilliant moment at all in the movie  * it goes a little sentimental at times   * lines of L are very often useless   * there is no Ryuk   * there is no Light Yagami   * emotional side of L is seen as he gets along with 2 children  In fact, I am going to stop talking about this movie at all.
In many ways, this film is highly reminiscent of the earlier film, THE GREAT RACE.
The protagonist, Simon, wakes up from a car-crash induced coma in a hospital into which he was admitted two years earlier.
If Gerry wasn't in it, I probably either done one of two things: fell asleep or turned it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as he is with most of his earlier movies.
What happens when you go to the cinema to watch "Just My Luck" but it is sold out, and so is "RV" and "United 93", and "The Ant Bully" and, believe it or not, "Curious George" where films you could see earlier?
The studio was trying to introduce another new generation of child actors to the series during this time period, but the originality of the characters seen in the earlier films just wasn't there.
The best examples of the earlier films (1930's era) featured the gang doing their thing without any adult presence in evidence.
Many of the prison scenes of riots and shoot-outs are in fact left over footage from an earlier film, "The Big House".
There's nothing new here and certainly nothing scary with scenes that are obviously inspired by earlier films and nothing but gore to keep it afloat.
Even though it has clear stylistic and thematic precursors, The I Inside is a gem of a film that should have had a theatrical release at an earlier date.
Although it was released in 1967, it represented a simplistic, juvenile 'take' that had pretty-well run its course 10 years earlier.
In the beginning a mother and son arrive at the hippie community, apparently due to some problems earlier.
Whether the original film was any good is a matter of conjecture: though John Steiner is excellent as a British doctor, Orson Welles mumbles his way through his performance as a Mexican colonel and Ennio Morricone's score is cribbed from his earlier work.
Robert Walker, Jr. (who looked a lot like his ill-fated father) plays Charlie--a horny and misunderstood young man who is supposedly discovered alone on a planet--the lone survivor of an earlier expedition.
Many other viewers have noted the similarity between this picture and another PRC effort, "The Devil Bat," a Bela Lugosi vehicle released five years earlier.
By the time the movie grinds to a halt, with a final "shock effect" scene at a hospital (as much of a tacked-on gimmick as an earlier scene of a figure's silhouette in a wheelchair), you could not care less.
He had demonstrated a keen ability for the murder method earlier in the year and numerous trips to the table would have furnished him with almost as much aortic experience as his crack team of cardiovascular surgeons.
On the flight, he meets Shalini (Preity Zinta), who he had briefly known earlier.
The first movie by an unknown young guy Farhan Akhtar (may be known earlier because of his famous parents Javed Akhtar - lyricist in this movie - and Honey Irani) and what a fantastic job he did both in direction and script writing.
It's a small-town murder mystery with a back story which might have come from a Playboy or Penthouse fiction piece; the type no major studio would have looked at just three years earlier (it was made in 1972), let alone in MGM's heyday.
Secondly, it reunited two of its top stars of the not-so-distant past, Peter Lawford and June Allyson, who starred in the memorable musical classic "Good News" filmed on that same lot 25 years earlier.
This might have been excusable in an earlier season, but the 3:4 WS issue was well known by this time.
Surely there are goofs, like the motor bike helmet back on the bike after the kids threw it earlier, and the teacher being a crack shooter loading a shotgun with bullets inside the sheriffs office.
they blew it up earlier than arranged.
As I said earlier this film has no life and no originality.
So basically it's made in the same way as those other successful earlier Pink Panther movies but never does this movie work out as good as any other Pink Panther movie and it also is definitely the worst out of the long running series of movies.
This - number seven in the popular series - is a feeble comedy in which the plot is poorly contrived, the actors look totally indifferent, and the comic moments are tired rehashes of scenes from the earlier films.
However, Dreyfuss has no intention of helping in the hunt for Clouseau (you may remember from earlier films that Clouseau drove Dreyfuss to the brink of insanity).
Along the way he crosses swords with various characters from earlier Pink Panther films, before it is finally revealed to the audience (though not to Clifton Sleigh) what actually became of the hapless Inspector Clouseau.
I just see a spoiled little runt that rocket scientists would envy, yet for some reason we are supposed to care that this adorable little sandy haired genius is doomed to the dark side (which I determined earlier is much more agreeable than all that good Jedi stuff).
Bullets over Broadway is of course dangerously close to being a direct copy of the film Mistress, released a couple of years or so earlier, the stories are almost identical, except that the locale has been changed from Hollywood to New York and the film being produced has become a stage play.
This choppy mess is held together by the flashbacks mentioned earlier, and ends with a "huh?"
Maybe Om Puri's parts were filmed earlier and at least attempted a Bengali accent, while the others simply had no clue their characters are Bengali!!!
After a few more mishaps, they finally make it to their same hotel destination with their luggage brought back earlier, thanks to the airport in Boston, but George can't get his suitcase unlocked due to the fact that the scam guy from the night before has his key in his wallet, then George goes to his interview, making it on time, in spite of his disheveled appearance (and he thought he wasn't going to make it due to the strike).
As mentioned in an earlier review the story line sounded very promising.
Also stated in an earlier review too bad MST300 is not on this would have perfect for it.
There had been reformers, notably the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens.
It seems that ten years earlier he was engaged to the prima donna singer at the theater, and they were to get married.
I would, however, advise people to see HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE because I believe the director did a much better job on this earlier effort.
The story is set earlier, in the 50's; but you can see that even then, people had more semblance of civilization that the dismal one-step-up-from-HeeHaw that "Harlan County War" portrays.
I will not be watching any more "24" and will be happy with the show on DVD of all earlier seasons, maybe I can forget I started to watch the new season altogether.
The concierge and the retired policeman clearly remember the Countess from her visit, 20 years earlier - but that's never fleshed out, either.
She's still a frigid little virgin, as he suddenly realizes when he tries to kiss her (just as Joe had earlier in the movie).
Like I wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after viewing, what has possibly taken place in the film.
At the conclusion of the movie, Coldyron utilizes a technique Shoeboogie spoke of earlier to kill ROTOR, as if to tie everything together in some sort of nice neat way.
As I intimated earlier, the surfeit of comic incident (not to mention the endless, dull chatter in which various parties, including Hinds' brother Paul Cavanaugh, try to talk Knowles out of taking on the case) Â far outweighs the film's horror elements which are puzzlingly relegated to the last five minutes of the 66-minute movie Â as if the screenwriter suddenly realized which genre he was supposed to be working in!
The appearance of Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies and then Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon piqued my interest in the lady's earlier films and when this one came up cheap on DVD, I jumped at the chance to acquire it.
I hear tell that Shannon Doherty was pretty good in the earlier episodes (I'll bet she was, since she's a witch in real life too).
Now, this was not as much of a problem in the earlier seasons.
Leprichauns, as I said earlier, were simply as every leprechaun has ever been portrayed.
The senility is pushed to the extreme, in spite of this series earlier attempts at joking with that topic having been right on the mark and quite successful.
In an earlier review I remarked how the worlds of Carry On and On The Buses were poles apart.
Opening with a cheesy cartoon of animated bottoms, the meaningless title ("Camping" had already been done six years earlier) is illustrated in the most literal way.
Still, CARRY ON BEHIND amounts to a fair imitation of the 'real thing', putting its game cast of veterans and newcomers through a free-form remake of CARRY ON CAMPING (1969), minus the flying bras and hilarious hippies of that earlier outing!
It has none of the innocent,cheery, Music Hall quality of the earlier movies,here we see unpleasant sneering jokes that demean women.Even a performer like Mr Kenneth Williams - a master at transforming poor material - can do nothing with this trash.He looks tired and dispirited.
Touches that made earlier versions entertaining are botched in 1989.
Except lethal ninja was a lot earlier, and a LOT worse.
At the end of the movie the "bad man" comes back, very predictably, and he starts doing the EXACT SAME thing he did a year earlier - this being one of Kennedy's numerous attempts to inject symbolism into this dreary mess of a movie.
Someone commented earlier about they would have liked to see a black girl try to be white instead.
someone earlier said that it was a "sleeper".
At the end I was totally hoping they would fall in a close vote to the Varsity squad making the Rocky comment earlier in the movie warranted and the movie in general more believable, but no they will.
)acts poorly also,usually having a rant then remembering he should be angry so suddenly starting screaming...I could go on and on about how pants this film is but ill summarise:  -Cardboard characters -Very disappointing storyline dealt with by earlier movies (eg: The Crow) -Diabolical Dialogue -Very amateur looking  Id recommended Romper Stomper if you want a skinhead bashing-fest or American History X,which is thousands of years ahead of this film,despite being made earlier.
However, somewhat like most of the Lips earlier records, the film lacks direction and focus and becomes very vignette like.
Had it have been made earlier I would have forgiven its amateurish feel and, to be frank, embarrassing handling of the plot and story line.
Other really bad parts include the trimmed border and visible hinges around the "secret" trap door and, my favorite, a hidden CD picked up in a different location than where it was hidden in an earlier scene.
This is a far glossier presentation than Talaat Captan's earlier work such as Digital Man and A.P.E.X., but it's still glaringly low budget.
Glossier and more violent, certainly, but definitely not as enjoyable as Captan's earlier work.
That Bow's earlier sound films were disappointing shows up in everyone trying very hard to adjust the diction levels.
When I found out it was a sequel to the earlier films I was happy to shell out a few bucks for it...I should have known better.
As I have mentioned earlier, the idea of the story is interesting but the storyline in the movie just sucks.
If they'd have just done what was required earlier, I wouldn't have wasted slightly better than an hour and a half of my life.
The bad acting and poor direction are extremely disappointing, considering the brief glimpse of genius Director Bartlett showed in earlier efforts-"The Silent Raiders"(1954) and "Silver Star"(1955).
And boy, do they milk those clips from the earlier films; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again.
this 1997 film of an earlier play is the proof.
First of all, as I mentioned earlier, the action scenes in the film were excellently constructed.
Oh he had the tough talk down pat, but as someone said earlier he was better in Ride The Pink Horse.
Perhaps it was her reaction to a camera instead of an actor that made Audrey Totter seem chilled in their "scenes" together rather than Claire Trevor's cold hearted user and Lauren Bacall's cool cynic in the earlier Marlowe incantations.
This film was more of an earlier "Raging Bull"-type tale in that it concentrated on the friends, family, freeloaders, criminals and women surrounding the main male character.
More than halfway through, unable to re-shoot their earlier scenes, they suddenly realize their mistake and start calling him 'Your Majesty', but it is too late.
When I saw the movie earlier this week, I thought it had been made in 1980, so poor were the technical details.
It's a shame that hit hadn't happened earlier, it would have saved everyone involved a good deal of time.
Tarantino has done so much better in his earlier movies than he did with Kill Bill.
What Tarantino was most praised for was the high-energy, witty dialogue that pervaded his earlier efforts, unfortunately in Kill Bill, the dialogue, when there is dialogue, downright sucks.
This has quite clearly been filmed over Idaho: firstly, Nevada is not that green; and secondly it involves F-15s and F-16s from Mountain Home in Idaho, and A-10s from the Idaho Air National Guard (neither the A-10s or F-16s were seen at Nellis earlier).
Anyway, when a movie includes flashbacks to earlier films and lengthy closing credits that replay many of the "best" scenes we just saw and STILL runs only about 77 minutes, you know something's wrong.
The story's setting in an earlier period can hardly be detrimental either.
Kind Hearts and Coronets stands easily as one of the best British comedies, yet it was set in the same historical period as Three Men in a Boat, was released six years earlier and was filmed in black and white.
The clerk at the travel agency (Helen Hunt) who wouldn't give him a refund for his trip earlier in the evening coincidentally shows up there too, on a freelance photography gig (seriously, these people must be traveling on supersonic rockets to get from Chicago to the beachside resort so quickly).
The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano, and their earlier roles.
The characters are uninteresting, but fortunately don't over-act too much, the plot is nothing too special (but could have been interesting if made by Fulci ten years earlier) and every single element in the piece screams in tired pain as does the viewer too.
They are quite sadistic and graphic at times, the "body splitting" and tongue impaling, being the most memorable examples, but still they are not as haunting as in the earlier films that were also effected by the soundtrack and visuals.
Is this the same Steven we saw 6 months earlier from Exit Wounds?The Raspy voice.Sudden Weight gain.There is not even a decent fight scene in the whole movie?I did not buy the Zen style he talked up.I suspect it is not all his fault here though.
And speaking of Lazenby, he looks like he lost a lot of weight here compared to his 007 days from a couple of years earlier.
I wonder what happens when you wipe out your Doppleganger... One annoying character down, a man we couldn't forgive anyway because of an earlier scene in which he threw his own urine onto a passing 'villager'.
Apparently everyone there can see her and Divine once again spasms and overacts like she did earlier.
By the time the end sequence came around I was rather bored, and the ending, although good, couldn't make up for the earlier scenes.
As in an earlier comment, the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, (known as "Final Sacrifice" is a hilarious spoof of this Canadian made movie!
After seven years of credits, we see a boy visiting a grave that one has to assume is that of the man who was shot in the scene earlier.
He earlier made a shocking thriller set in the opera world named OPERA and his film SUSPIRIA must be one of the best horror movies ever made!
Fans of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and the earlier Phantom movies from Lon Cheney's classic performance to Claude Rains, Herbert Lom and Charles Dance, this film is entirely on a different level.
Picard's overly harsh treatment of Data quite set me up as well as the latter one's relapse to an earlier state of development.
I saw this film earlier this year at a film festival and I found it to be dull, uninspired and unoriginal.
'The Van' represented a slight change of direction for Doyle, a weighter piece of fiction than his earlier efforts; but it's still fun, and a sensitive portrait of male friendship.
I agree with the earlier comment that Pat Barrington (belly dancer hussy) is something to watch and must be seen.
This movie is strictly for those people who have not seen the earlier Umraao Jaan.
I won't bother to write a whole synopsis since that has been covered by earlier posts.
The consequence is that neither of their stories is fully told with any objectivity, especially what could have happened in Crawford's earlier years that would have led to such excessive behavior.
Lexi goes wandering and sees a small boy, Timmy, who was earlier in the film.
The handyman from next door decides that he has to get home, no matter what the risk, despite his earlier stoicism in the face of this episode - implausible.
Why then were we shown, in earlier scenes, cops taking people off streets by handcuffing them and bundling them into vans, but now find out that they're ignoring everyone gathered outside the hospitals?
All three girls attend science class, where their hunky professor Dr. Xander (ugh, kill it with the "Buffy" references already...) talks about death and claims he has a vial of zombie blood he acquired on a trip to Haiti two years earlier.
OK, that is not even a joke, it's a serious line not played for laughs, as earlier that character told mena he is in fact a vegetarian, and if that was meant as a joke, the direction was SO bad it certainly didn't come across that way.
Nathan's mother (Deirdre O'Kane) finds his lifeless body in his room and remembers the handy book of resurrection spells that she'd found just days earlier in the bowels of the church that she works at.
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
it hits a cliff not knowing what they did they made their parents break up the brothers cry now this is THE WORST CRYING I HAVE EVER SEEN and I have seen Muriel's Wedding and that scene in Charlies Angels 2 where Drew Barrymore thinks her friends have died the mother says it's not their fault but the father snaps some logic in them and say it is their fault and anyway Ferrel bury's John C Reilly alive and how he got past the broken up parents I don't know and Reilly gets out and they decide to grow up (they decide to stop acting like overgrown 4-year-olds and get a life) and Ferrel works with his brother and he does some festival or some crap and Reilly's the chef and the band doesn't show up so what does the father do he says go and act like overgrown 4-year-olds and do that band and Ferrel's voice changes everything in the movie (except thee quality) and the younger brother who his co-workers chant something extremely disturbing until that voice came on he decides to make peace with the brother so the movie changes from some 40-year-old losers acting like 4-year-olds to a gay finale like in High School Musical and Hairspray oh and Ferrel entered Therapy earlier in the movie and that stupid voice made the therapist in love with him but we change from a Gay finale to Ferrel and Reilly beating the crap out of little kids who earlier in the movie forced them to lick dog crap which I don't want to know how it became white.
The earlier one was knight rider 2000... from 1991... equally crappy, this one starred David Hasselhoff and yes... had a silly cameo appearance y James Doohan as himself.
Not to be confused with the earlier and slightly better The Slumber Party Massacre, with which it shares several similarities (a house full of teenage girls, a psycho killer, a virginal heroine, the word 'Massacre' in its title), Sorority House Massacre is yet another routine 80s stalk 'n' slash thriller, with a little Nightmare on Elm Street dream nonsense thrown in to try and spice things up a little.
All are pretty much knockoffs of Halloween, the godfather of modern slasher flicks (I don't think Psycho was, for it was of an earlier generation).
There's nothing unique here that hasn't been done to death on numerous "Moore-watching" boards or the earlier film "Fahrenhype 911".
Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture.
Next time, however, I think I'll stick with one of the earlier ones.
DD earlier made remarkable comedies though illogical yet funny  This is a weird film by him, he tried the MASTI formula and brought an identical story of 3 guys who hav 3 wives and search for love outside even the characters are similar  The comedy scenes are so cringe worthy, it looks like we are watching a stage play, the dialogues too are damn stage like  The spiderman jokes are so bizarre while the Sanju angle and all other stuff is contrived  The ending is the worst part of the film  Direction by DD is bad Music is ordinary  Camera-work is only saving grace  Amongst actors Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan shout too loud and act artificially mostly Sharman excels in his part, though this isn't a patch of his best works Amongst girls Esha overacts, Ayesha is just there and the rest are all bad Sanjay is plain horrible, he hams it up badly
I was at university when I saw this film in the cinema in 1981, having left school two years earlier.
At age 60, director and writer Kazan really really thinks he is saying something deep and profound about the emptiness of The American Dream, and attempts to do it with a candor he was not afforded in his earlier (better made) films like "A Streetcar Named Desire " and "Splendor in the Grass."
The climax is totally implausible since it contradicts with everything the script attempted to make us believe earlier on, but hey, at least the VHS cover art wasn't a lie.
the story is good, the set is so so, an earlier review mentions the lawn furniture and cheese display in the planes upper deck, that got a good laugh from us as well.
However, doing so by having characters say and do things that openly contradict earlier scenes is not excusable.
Johnnie's (Joanne) young husband (no doubt a latent-homosexual) abandons her to go to sea with a pal that joined the Navy four months earlier.
Different, incoherent Spanish film about a Caribbean mummy aboard a cruise ship killing people that remind him of those that killed him thousands of years earlier.
Single mom Rosemary Zoltanne (Markie Post) and her smart-ass teen daughter Sarah (Sarah Chalke) move from L.A. to a big house in Massachusetts where a witch was burned at the stake 300 years earlier.
The film opens with the same-old row-call: Paul Newman is an oil drill foreman who falls for advertising exec Jacqueline Bisset, who was offered an engaging ring earlier by millionaire William Holden; James Franciscus is the owner of the island's hotel who refuses to believe the upcoming threat, while not exactly being faithful to his clueless (read: foolish) wife Veronica Hamel.
There must have been a conspiracy within the Costume Design branch of the Academy Awards for nominating this and "The Swarm" two years earlier for the bland clothing right off the store shelves from Sears or K-Mart (or whatever store that was close to the Warner Brothers' Burbank studios lot or on location in Hawaii).
Lacking the star power of the original (Ursula Andress, Peter Cushing and Bernard Cribbens are noticeable by their absence), the film is a dreary retread of events from the earlier movie, albeit with the roles reversed: this time around, it is the immortal Killikrates (John Richardson) who is pining for his long-dead love Ayeesha.
There are a few laughs, but you're best advised to stick with the comedy team's earlier output.
Karachi was a modern city by every means in recent past but today go anywhere in this city, it may be a posh area, middle class locality or a slums you will find bearded men and burqa clad women in such a huge numbers that no one could even imagine some years earlier.
He glances around, slyly opens the coffin an inch, and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they'd had half an hour earlier, then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction.
like having an enema or perhaps experimenting on the strength of the enamel of your teeth with a toenail clipper or testing the limits of your hearing on flea farts or listening to a gulp of water make its way from your mouth to your bladder, or to your anus, depending on what you ate earlier that day.
Not to be confused with the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle with the same name, although released just a few years earlier and clearly featuring a couple of common themes, this "Red Heat" is actually a 'Women in Prison' exploitation movie starring Linda Blair (the amount of trashy B-movies she starred in during the eighties is nearly endless) and Sylvia Kristel; the one and only original starlet to depict the legendary soft-core film character Emmanuelle.
The maniac is apparently in the mental hospital because years earlier he took a group of folks into the desert and allowed them to die due to exposure--a slow, lingering death.
Knowing the aliens were not dead, and knowing they had easily tracked the family earlier, it was no surprise they found the family again.
I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.
Having seen the Ed Wood movie (with Johhny Depp) a couple of nights earlier, I was mildly surprised to see that the rubber Octopus that Ed Wood used was more realistic than the vinyl Centipede that was used in this movie.
Featuring a brief cameo from Laurel and Hardy (repaying a debt to star Chase, who had appeared in some of their earlier pictures), ON THE WRONG TREK follows its protagonists through Depression-era California, where itinerant workmen are dismissed as 'bums' by law enforcement officers and refused permission to cross state boundaries, and where desperate criminals stage fake traffic accidents to ensnare unwitting victims.
The premise of the movie, a woman coming into the police station and confesses to crime which occurred two years earlier.
6) The madman builds a Frankenstein machine that's powered by electricity to turn the women into wax, apparently forgetting that the pond water was sufficient enough for his needs only a few minutes earlier.
14) The stalker accidentally steps in the bear-trap that he randomly planted in the forest earlier.
I also enjoyed seeing him take on something he is actually known for taking on in an earlier set of films.
Just a few minutes earlier in the film, promotion was not important, it was a transfer to a dead end quiet job in Beverly Hills!
Voice-over narration states that a connection has been made between the alien artifact and a meteor explosion that took place there in 1908, some seventy eight years earlier.
Big Shiny Haired scientist is reunited with someone who was cut out of the earlier part of the film.
The Lady doctor consoles someone else who was cut out of the earlier part of the film.
Barbara Stanwyck, a good and sexy actress ten or fifteen years earlier, looks steely.
I can't say what, as it might give something away, but let me say it might remind you of a notorious scene from Campbell's earlier film, the original "Evil Dead".
Nagging realistic questions, raised by the nagging "realistic" backdrop of the film and all the earlier nagging "realistic" tearjerker sequences - such as, how's our reallife cop going to avoid the statutory consequences of going over the edge, no matter how much one may sympathize with him - are then disposed of in a coda-quickie (maybe two minutes) with the Detective Chief simply *summarizing* the wrap-ups to his "one good cop".
Some sex'n'language stuck in with the episodic violence, but nothing unexpected there, and as we said earlier, production values are the usual 'best that money can buy' in spite of the sickly script; so we give it an IMDb "2", and no more.  
ALong with some of their first promotional films for earlier songs, this is more a collection of MTV-videos than a movie.
I was just passing out of the target demographic when I saw this, so perhaps I'm more blasÃ© about it than I might have been if I had seen it a few years earlier.
The school is surrounded by thick woodland, and the girls there tell stories about it which revolve round a coven of witches that decided to take the school by force many years earlier.
It could've finished about 1 hour earlier but I thought it was painfully draggy!
At no time are the guests asked anything more searching than what they had for lunch earlier.
Basically this film is a very clichÃ© action film that is not in anyway stylish or well scripted but it is funny, notably the bad Russian accents and the puns, one of which had me in stitches when Dolphs sergeant is briefing him on his mission saying "have you ever heard of agent red" and Dolph replies " it sounds like a bad action movie", so at least the makers of this new they were not making a classic, overall this is not horrendous but is still pretty bad,you could quite easily stomach the full ninety minutes on a good day, if only for the hilariously cheesy dialogue but if you have a choice between this and an earlier Dolph flick theplace this nicely back on the shelf.
(Perhaps it was explained earlier in the film somehow?
But most importantly, it stars a real horror triumvirate of greatness:- Vincent Price, John Carradine and Donald Pleasence - along with veterans from past Amicus films Britt Ekland and Geoffrey Bayldon (here reprising an earlier role as an asylum keeper).
A few days earlier I did a review of another aviation picture Ceiling Zero and commented how Warner Brothers played on the cheap with the special effects.
Finally, this (and the great earlier City on the Edge of Forever)is one of the first episodes to exploit the (unfortunately largely overlooked and unrecognized) subtlety of William Shatner's acting ability by placing Kirk's personal life in the way of his professional practice.
Speaking of "Dr. Strangelove," one of the crew members from that earlier movie returns in this one: James Earl Jones.
To be fair, this isn't Wishman's worst film; that remarkable honour would go to her next film, a remake of her earlier flick Satan Was A Lady (And they say Van Sant's Psycho was unnecessary)!
I'm a really big fan of Adam Sandler, but this movie didn't do it for me the way his earlier films did.
I can't say I've seen too many of these sorts of movies, and this one isn't even as good as the earlier eighties film.
These films, of course, don't quite have the depth of his earlier, more personal works - namely and especially, Annie Hall and Manhattan.
Two flashbacks tell the story, the second being set earlier in time than the first.
This film by Jim Sotos (the director of the surprisingly decent eighties slasher 'Sweet 16') is apparently a remake of the earlier infamous film of the same title by Shaun Costello and starring Harry Reems.
The only reason that this misshapen mess of a film was made was because Ray was something of an idol to Wenders, and dying of cancer, not long after the two men met filming The American Friend a few years earlier.
For one, it doesn't prove Wade was "moral", just a schizo because he's yapping about escaping in the hotel a few minutes earlier.
With a similar plot engine to Coogan's earlier The Parole Officer Â man suspected of a crime he didn't commit has to use his clients to save him Â it's the kind of US film Peter Sellers might have made during the early 70s lull in his career and which you'd expect to see on an airplane.
They showed no curiosity, and immediately drew weapons, then were easily facehugged, and quickly spawned aliens, faster than in any earlier Alien film, literally within minutes of being impregnated there was an embryo bursting from the victims chest...which begs the question, why the hell would you bring weapons to a remote location in Antarctica, and not bring exploration or excavation equipment of any kind?
And things just went from cheesy to outright goofy when Lex and the 'hero' Predator(who, without hesitation, murdered about 4 people a few minutes earlier) became friends and teamed up against the Queen...I thought they might even kiss at one point.
The Purple Rose of Cairo really does rate up there with Woody's best - from Annie Hall, Manhattan to the earlier, more slapstick efforts, such as Love and Death and Sleeper.
Yet earlier in the film they said, "I hope it kills every fÂing one of them!".
Why did they decide to put the F word in earlier when it wasn't necessary, yet cut it out later when it was?!
Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year.
I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.
(Even after he's left for dead in an earlier battle.)
The list of possible suspects is pretty ridiculous, especially the peeping tom next-door-neighbor, who spies on the girls dancing topless with his telescope, and "The Weirdo," a mute voyeuristic albino who earlier in the day was caught staring at the girls during their beach volleyball game.
With its sub-Gerry Anderson gadgets, its rousing 'Thunderbirds' style anthems, and its hokey un-special effects' this movie's production standards seem to hail from at least a decade earlier.
the Russians and Americans having to pool their nuclear resources to ward off a threat from outside,a conceit that was hardly original twenty years earlier and which had become very threadbare by the end of the seventies.
Now watch Underground made a few years earlier with many of the same actors.
See it for the acting (which is top notch), but as with earlier comments, if U need a feel good and less tragic movie see Frank Whaley in "The Pursuit of Happiness" .
Second, the female co-star Colleen Camp very ably sang the final song in the film but when they show her singing earlier in the movie, she's obviously out of sync with the music.
I had seen the four main Lee films (Chinese Connection, Way of the Dragon, Big Boss and Enter the Dragon) a bunch of times, and wondered why this guy hadn't been mentioned to me earlier.
All of this is laced with Bruce Lee footage from his earlier movies.
It may be filthy, but it's also extremely boring, which is especially disheartening considering the fact that at least two of Cronenberg's earlier films --- THE BROOD and THE FLY --- are masterpieces of modern horror.
Sally's boyfriend Jerry had earlier participated in a payroll robbery with Nick where he and a security guard were shot and killed.
Two guys and a girl go to the forbidden Cat Island (oooooo, spooky name) as the superbly mustachioed property developer (who earlier gets nasty with two ho's) wants to erect (pun intended) a hotel there.
I beg to differ with the fussy earlier reviewer who lamented that the racing scenes were over edited.
I found Toback's earlier film Black and White mildly diverting, so gave this one a whirl.
Jack gets Jackie to help him investigate his death from 15 years earlier.
What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman's husband in "Casablanca" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis.
Most of the fight scenes I found to be very entertaining making you follow each swing of the blade/axe, and they were carried through the film by the rock music I mentioned earlier.
Barrymore fared much better than Lange in both the documentary imitation and earlier years.
After John Carpenter's Halloween kicked off the boom years two decades earlier, the majority of the bandwagon jumping genre entries were American, British or Italian productions.
Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!
why could they not start the carnage earlier .. pathetic movie .. sushmita can act and she does a good job but the direction and the story is just nonsense .. "bhoot" was so much better ..
But as Im watching this, I noticed a glaringly ridiculous scene (mentioned briefly by someone else in an earlier review).
Years earlier a series of accidental deaths caused the park to close and for people to stay away.
The funny part is that I hired this because it was based on a game I'd played years earlier that had a great story and great characters!
This film also has some flashy camera work, but on the whole is more straightforward than the earlier film.
The films are related because of Malcolm McDowell, who figures prominently in both films, by the way that the young Gangster 55 is photographed glaring into the camera in a very similar manner to McDowell's Alex in the earlier film, and by the general level of violence.
Nolte was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city's chief police investigator!
The twist should have been suggested a little earlier in order to hold the audience's attention because honestly I think that was the only slightly interesting thing out of the entire film.
In this movie (I think the "brawling two" is still working here, but it's not that great as in the earlier years, decades.
Here they use guns many times, not something we got used to in the earlier movies.
The movie holds together like an artfully composed opus, returning to hints given earlier on and embellishing on them.
It comes before his great films 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' and 'Hable Con Ella', both more mature than his earlier films, and this film is the beginning of the grown-up AlmodÃ³var.
VÃ­ctor is released from jail and he has not forgotten about the events years earlier.
'Carne TrÃ©mula' is a film that plays with genres, like AlmodÃ³var's earlier films such as 'Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios' and 'Tacones Lejanos'.
By the end (Poverty Row having learned the lessons MGM taught a couple of decades earlier in the titles cited above), there's tragedy and heartache, reappraisals and reconciliations.
In his earlier days, going way back to "Candid Microphone" before TV, the emphasis was always on human interaction.
Especially when in an earlier episode, at his funeral, the same boy ghost shows up all happy, and at peace.
John Heard is an underrated actor who adds a somewhat mischievous, ominous and sometimes comical overtone to his roles (You may want to watch him in the earlier 1970's film "Chilly Scenes of Winter", and there was also a film short wherein he portrayed Fortunato, in Edgar Allen Poe's "Cask of Amontillado".
Lillard built upon his earlier "Scream" success playing a crazy.
Sadly, although the themes of insightful portrayal into class-ridden British society are present, 'All Or Nothing' lacks any of the vitality or wit of the earlier films.
I'm quite surprised it hasn't happened earlier.
It looks like they borrowed that effect from 'Rush' earlier in the season.
I won't compare Forsyth's earlier works with his best known or "finest" moments.
One of his earlier films, "El Dia De La Bestia" aka.
If films like Cappuccino (an earlier quality film from this same writer/director) and Blue Hill Ave. can't make it to theaters and the previously mentioned vapid works are able to, why should intelligent Black folks pay $8.
However, from what I've seen this show is nothing but a rip off on Dead Like Me which was made five years earlier.
Bear is prosperous as ever, running his huge store despite earlier being upset at "living like an inlander".
horror cinema, Tinnell turned his earlier Frankenstein and Me (1996) into a touching homage to growing up with monster movies.
And, herein, lies perhaps this film's ultimate dilemma: while certainly not a perfunctory or redundant effort, one is not likely to forsake the earlier cinematic rendition because of itÂ
Maureen O'Sullivan carries off the role of the young, college girl love interest with the same innocence she displayed when she broke into films 9 years and 39 films earlier.
As I stated earlier, don't spend too much time thinking about this one, it will only make your head hurt.
It is also a sequel of sorts to the earlier "City of God," an award-winning movie directed by Fernando Meirelles.
"City of Men" is a companion piece to Fernando Meirelles' 2002 film "City of God," but it's a much different animal from the earlier film.
But whereas "City of God" was kinetic, angry and immediate, "City of Men" is more reflective and conventional, and it comes to a much more hopeful conclusion than the earlier film.
Maybe the earlier film fails to take a sufficiently clear moral stand, or too much reflects the viewpoints of the young favela males it depicts.
While it lacks the earlier work's kinetic energy, it is more emotionally satisfying and has characters that we care about.
Sure, it's not a patch on 48 hours, but it does stand as a perfect example of ne plus ultra 90s sequelitis as tougher, simpler movies are retooled into flash bang gee whizz action paintings with money flushed into entourages and re-doing the same things they did almost a decade earlier on the cheap, only this time they all actually get paid (rather than the studio running off with the money and leaving everyone to wonder why a major success still isn't in profit).
Gone entirely is his ex-girlfriend Ingrid, gone is the eerie recognition everyone around Claire has for Henry since he resembles the man she was occasionally seen with years earlier.
He clearly gave much thought to this portrayal which on the whole is better than the misplaced Method emoting of Marlon Brando's Antony, some seventeen years earlier.
This is because it was an older version of him that travelled back to her childhood and earlier years.
If you want Hollywood-type entertainment, go for the earlier but flashier Brando version.
There are certainly some things from the novel that are left out of the movie with good reason, such as this scene where the narrative goes into the thoughts of the robins, which can only be disorienting and awkward unless it was done much earlier in the novel (and even then it would not have fit too well with the rest of the story).
I watched this film in Poland, the fatherland of Agnieszka Holland, after being attacked and robbed in a dark alley earlier that holiday-trip.
Overall, this is a very good movie version that doesn't take a backseat to the earlier Mason/Brando version.
Much better than the earlier Julius Caesar, which starred Marlon Brando as Mark Antony and James Mason as Brutus.
Oddly enough in that earlier version James Mason as Brutus was the best one in the film.
We as an audience however know something is amiss having witnessed a coffin earlier floating ashore following the flute-playing of a most unusual looking black man who we later see arrive at the castle-like house in which the hippies seem to be squatting now acting as something of a servant/follower to Khorda.
After seeing this movie I better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier.
Although it's more explicit than earlier Franco movies, it still contains some of his trademarks:  - Out-of-focus camera work.
For starters this appears to have been released months earlier and the screenplay,comic timing,and acting are easily in the same league as the best of the so-called 'screwball comedies'.
We go from nonsense like The Voice of The Violin and What Drink Did earlier in the year, to this simple yet stylish piece of storytelling.
I agree with earlier comments about the new scoring.
With echoes of his earlier film 'Knife in the Water', Bitter Moon is a story of lust, revenge, betrayal, dependency and most of all; love, wrapped tightly around a coil of taboos and sexual perversions.
He had his moments of kindness, he genuinely was remorseful over the death of Bartlow's wife and in an earlier scene, he speaks of how he wanted to make a star out of someone Hollywood had thrown onto the Ash pile.
Film producer John Houseman and director Vincent Minnelli convinced MGM production chief Dore Schary to switch the story to Hollywood partly because the film ALL ABOUT EVE had covered Broadway territory so well just two years earlier.
(made just two years earlier), SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (made the same year as The Bad And The Beautiful), WHAT PRICE Hollywood (1932), SHOW PEOPLE (1928), A STAR IS BORN (1937, 1954 & 1976) and mostly recently Robert Altman's THE PLAYER (1992).
Despite her unmistakable sexy grandiosity and childlike enthusiasm, his award was clearly for her earlier work, as she hardly gets to do anything here but babble on in a Southern accent in the periphery of a few shots in the latter half of the film.
In 1950 Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD showed how the world had forgotten it's celebrities and stars of the late silent period a generation earlier.
DaSica's movie is a slow-moving lyrical poem which differs from his earlier Neo-Realist work, and captures in its running time this illusionary reality as if all this were a dream that the Finzi-Continis were having.
Much like in "The Bicycle Thief" over 20 years earlier, Vittorio De Sica shows the desperate existences of a few people, surrounded by what many incorrectly assumed to be a joyful world.
Not meant for the pretentious art-house regulars but, as I said earlier, an honest viewer.
As I said earlier, the acting (not to mention the soundtrack) is great.
It is true that, after parts of the mystery are revealed, some parts that you learned earlier don't make much sense.
Sanders come up with the shocking conclusion that Michael's murder was the result of something that he did earlier that evening.
The scene on the beach with the guys in the sumo ring bouncing around like the paper cutouts in the earlier scene is hysterical.
"Roger Maris died 6 years earlier, never knowing that the record belonged to him."
Monk is an ex-cop whose wife died about 5 or 6 years earlier, in a car bombing.
I believe I've now seen nearly all of the earlier episodes via reruns, but for some reason had never seen this initial episode before.
First, the film could not have been made some 10 to 20 years earlier.
As was mentioned earlier in the site, this film went fairly well in the UK, Italy and France.
Besides the fact the story is hardly anything original and is something that has been done a lot better in earlier genre movies, the movie also has some real problems with its build up and logic.
Unfortunately for Dreamworks, Pixar is once again raising the bar in animation with the incredible Ratatouille earlier this summer.
As I mentioned earlier the premise doesn't break any new ground, and is rather slight.
But better writing and directing (Steven H. Berman and Tibor Takacs respectively) would have helped, with the amusing earlier scenes at the North Pole wiped out by the poorly handled climax; decent special effects - Kathy's sleigh ride makes "Superboy" look good - and child actors who can actually act wouldn't have gone amiss either.
I think I enjoyed the earlier part of the film more than the second half that focused on the tournament.
There's certainly no real style or visual flair here that Gordon showed in his earlier films, there's a pretty nasty down beat atmosphere running through the film & it certainly isn't a feel good flick as there are no happy endings on show.
When she is knocking at the door of the guy who abused her earlier and he starts to get nervous she asks him "Aren't you a tough guy?"
I wonder if people who had trouble watching She's So Lovely would have trouble with the earlier movie?
Surely the excesses earlier might be excessive.
Because it's a newer version of a classic horror movie (and it went directly to video), I have been putting off watching Stuart Gordon's take on Edgar Allen Poe's classic story, but after finally catching it; I can honestly say that I don't know why I didn't see it earlier!
Both films are populated chiefly by grotesques; the difference with the earlier one is that we're allowed to see the human beings underneath, without being invited to laugh ironically.
sort of mad max (see the prisoners and the atlantean first cities ) meets sinbad (SFX would still be poor if dated 20 years earlier ) meets cable TV tripe, like those "lost/treasure island" short telepictures from the 1960-70s for a young audience.
They also try to add the victorian element, so well done and fitting in the earlier Dracula movies, yet with poor results here.
Another notable name on the cast list is Cyd Charisse who earlier in her career had appeared in Singing In The Rain and Brigadoon.
Although it isn't breaking new ground, for most american viewers it will seem a little odd that the vampires in the movie are more corpse like than you expect to see, but in most if not all accounts of vampirism in the middle ages and earlier periods vampires were refered to as animated corpses, not strikingly beautiful creatures with tragic stories.
I mentioned acting earlier and find myself asking, "How far did these actors go?"
This is one of those TV series you remember fondly from earlier days, due to its two stars and the gentle humour which honestly reflects the actions of two awkward people, each looking for companionship and never expecting to find it.
Until the fatal end Judy Garland wasn't simply a survivor, she was a hugely talented and ambitious woman who, like water, carved out a new course when an earlier one was blocked.
"The House of Usher" is called "the modern re-telling of Edgar Allen Poe's story from a female perspective".Yeah right,and I'm an alien invader from Pluto.First of all,the film fails as a thriller as it's extremely boring and lacks tension.Like so many earlier adaptations of Poe's work,this latest interpretation bears little resemblance to the source material.The cast is pretty terrible,albeit it's nice to see Polish beauty Izabella Miko in the main role.On the plus side the cinematography is great and the last 15 minutes are actually quite interesting to say the least.It's a shame that the rest of the film is so painfully dull.If you want a proper Poe's adaptations rent or buy a couple of Roger Corman's flicks.3 out of 10.
Ollie's cry to Stan of "Give it a little dignity" briefly recalls some of the glory days, as does Stan's earlier self-parodying [We haven't eaten for three days] "Yesterday, today and tomorrow."
In their earlier films, you had Stan with his endless Malaprops, prompting Ollie's looks of disgust into the camera; the physical comedy was brilliant, and often led off by the duo selecting the most illogical and idiotic course of action possible for the bizarre circumstances in which they found themselves.
It's simply not very funny, and very little like the earlier films they'd made.
There are quick run-throughs of earlier cons, and in a brief speeded- up sequence the film shows us Penelope's dazzling accomplishment level at her various "hobbies."
With the involvement of the young boy, old man rips the calendar pages off deciding to execute his plan earlier.
The film recalls the spirit of a Niculescu earlier film: Ultima Noapte de Dragoste, shot in 1979.
The movies this big communist era leftover makes today are of even worse quality than his earlier communist ideology infested flicks.
As someone said earlier, somebody should lose their gig for not picking up on this gem!
Judging by the plot and the fact that it's directed by Silvio Amandio, I feared that this Giallo would be a lot like the director's earlier success 'Amuck!
', but despite similarities between the pair; Smile Before Death is a lot more than merely a retread of the earlier work.
This film adheres more closely to the Giallo tradition of stylish and bloody murders than the earlier movie, but still finds time to ensure that the plot always revolves around the central situation.
The first half moves on relatively slow (similar to Silvio Amadio's above mentioned earlier Giallo), but the viewer already gets enough information to know that the plot isn't as simple as it seems.
In the second half the film becomes a roller coaster ride of red herrings, plot twists and other surprises, which makes it decisively superior to Amadio's earlier effort.
"Beneath" is a horror flick released straight to video and marks the directorial debut of Dagen Merrill, co-written with Kevin Burke (who also wrote 2003's "Tahiti", an indie drama that earned some critical praise).Christy Wescot (Nora Zehetner, "Brick") is a 20-year-old pre-med student who cannot fully live her own life since her older sister Vanessa (Carly Pope, "Sandra Goes to Whistler") was killed in a car accident six years earlier, in which Christy was driving.
Despite her condition and the fact that she had a miscarriage less than a year earlier, Lydie agrees to take on the case of a teenaged girl named Stephanie Daley (Amber Tamblyn) who is accused of killing her newborn at childbirth.
I had read a few print reviews of "Brooklyn Lobster" earlier, so I was aware that some critics had been rather unenthusiastic.
However, this fact is even more disturbing than the earlier film because the girl involved in this case is not yet 12-years old!
However, despite all the problems, somehow, eventually, a finished product was deliveredÂonly to suffer from some hasty re-editing when some bright spark commented that the original ending bore too much resemblance to that of an earlier Hammer movie, Scars of Dracula.
A party is thrown at a haunted house where a man was murdered in the "blue room" 20 years earlier.
The plot synopsis was given earlier, but i'd like to give my personal comments on it.
In an old mansion there is a mysterious bedroom, "the blue room," where a man died 20 years earlier,and now, anyone who spends the night in the room disappears!
Exposition, conflict, resolution, and possibly an occasional flashback or revisiting of an earlier moment---these are all staples of visual story telling.
While Asin peps up the scenes in the earlier part with her vivaciousness, Kaniha gets the performing role as the older Ajit's pair.
One of the great work of A.R.Rehman, Director K S Ravikumar, who had struck the right chord with the actor (in a dual role) in 'Villain' earlier, has done it yet again here too.
However, while Griffith has clearly moved on in his direction and arrangement of actors, it lacks the dynamism of the earlier film.
And it was nice to see a film of this nature done in black and white for once...and done so just because black and white can be as beautiful as color (though it's clearly not up to the standards of earlier Hollywood films), not because it's attempting to be some kind of pseudo-noir film.
In some parts definitely smarter than the latter (nb: and made one year earlier).
Apart from this fusion of past and present Â not to mention, leading lady Rita Calderoni Â the two also share the doppelganger motif and, as I said earlier, an absolute (deliberate?)
The film is (as mentioned earlier) full of nudity from hot Italian babes, stylishly psychedelic touches, Satanic orgies, and an overall lack of any remote coherency.
Most of all, the movie depends on Roger Moore, and he delivers a dynamic and amusing performance of a man of action who'd be much happier in an earlier age.
We had earlier met Mary, his tortoiseshell tabby.
It's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn't even show up in the IMDb listings when you put "Peter Pan" into the search engine!
It's his third run in with the law since his father died in a car accident a year earlier.
But, later that day, he asks Agnes to cancel a lunch with his parents - and she replies that his father died a year earlier!
I said earlier that I would only partially agree with someone if they said that it only becomes clear in the end.
Ben having lost his wife, Jennifer at the battle of Wolf 359, explaining Sisko's earlier angst with Picard.
Planet of the Apes - another post-apocalypse flick - was filmed almost a decade earlier yet looked infinitely better.
Sort of like "Enemy Mine" made years earlier.
Cheadle has infiltrated these terrorists, lead by SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui, who also played a terrorist earlier in 2008 in Vantage Point, so deeply he's afraid that he'll have carried out attacks against the U.S. before Daniels gets what he wants.
I've greatly enjoyed their earlier comedic efforts.
I had seen this movie years and years earlier, and I didn't remember the ending.
Apparently, when "Silkwood" came out, Mike Nichols hadn't released a notable movie since "The Fortune" nearly killed his career eight years earlier.
I would agree with the author of the earlier comment who stated that Hollywood films rarely focus on the lives of modern working-class people, and that 'Silkwood' is one of the rare exceptions.
It is probably one of the better low budget detective yarns of the late 50s and is improved by having a producer (Victor Saville) very familiar with his material having produced two earlier Spillane/Hammer films.
It's not quite the same town where earlier gumshoes Dick Powell and Humphrey Bogart and Robert Montgomery plied their trade.
As in the memorable Mike Hammer movie Kiss Me Deadly of two years earlier, it's the late-Eisenhower L.A. of freeways and oil derricks and strip clubs, a changing landscape where the Mexican presence can no longer be ignored.
This completely develops the death card story which was foreshadowed earlier in the film.
Just like Val Lewton's earlier and later productions, The Leopard Man is notable for it's breathtaking atmosphere, which is once again up there with the greatest ever seen in cinema.
In an earlier review the booby trap with the paint-tin and town clock was mentioned as not being seen.
Like I said earlier, it's just sad when you see such a good movie go to waste when people don't watch it and forget about it.
The actual fact of the matter is that production was so fast and furious for Warners, "Termite Terrace" animators, that they decided to do it as a parody of the Tom and Jerry cartoon, Concerto Cat" that had won the academy award earlier that year.
Tommy also murdered a young girl Chole, Kim Schraner, earlier that evening when she aggressively come on to him by the deserted railroad cars not knowing what kind of monster the shy sweet and good looking Tommy really is.
Hilarious yet quiet, the film uses old home movie projections on different sources of water to show Benjamin's earlier memories.
With the acts of excruciation and execution of spies brought off screen, Lee keeps violence to the minimum despite the blood shedding sequence in the Hong Kong apartment in an earlier plot.
When he comes to Naples, where he has worked earlier, the local criminal underworld, above all the Camorra, the Mafia of Naples, are already getting nervous, as they know that the Comissario, who has no mercy for criminals, is dedicated to clean up... Merli is once again great as the mustached and unorthodox copper Betti, who treats criminals in a way that makes Dirty Harry look like a social worker.
However, when it comes to crime films; Lenzi comes into his own, and just like Almost Human a couple of years earlier, Violent Naples is an entertaining and nasty little crime thriller.
By the mid-'50s, a new generation of mature audiences could approach an actor as something other than face for a type, but there's no doubt that earlier audiences expected their stars to be pretty much true to the characters they most usually played.
Cronenberg rewrote the script and turned the earlier film on its ear.
Amongst the revolting sights on offer are a very painful looking broken arm inflicted by Seth during a show of strength in a bar, a quivering inside-out baboon (one of Seth's earlier mistakes), and the Brundlefly vomiting corrosive liquid onto Stathis' hand and foot.
Everything seems fine at first, until a cut he got earlier starts to have tough hair Ronnie notices.
Karloff, having just given the performance of his career in the earlier THE BODY SNATCHER, now gives what may be his weakest performance of the 1940s with this film--and frankly he looks incredibly ridiculous with curly hair.
There they meet the St. Aubyns, British diplomats (Alan Napier, Katherine Emery), a young girl, whose voice was heard earlier, Thea (Ellen Drew) and a mysterious old lady named Madame Kyra (Helene Thimig).
This one isn't as well-written as the earlier films in the series, and the isolation, while nicely suggested psychologically, fails to cast the spell of hopelessness and despair it ought to.
The greatness of "San Francisco" now dwarfs this earlier one.
The fact is, Myrna Loy was someone one knew had been a big movie star earlier on, but one had never actually seen her on screen.
Like the earlier film, Bad Guy is a tale of obsession between lovers who exist on the edge of human relations, and features some disturbing scenes.
The overall impression however is of quite an achievement, and one which is perhaps more mature about the unpredictable nature of love and attraction than the director has been earlier.
"Bad Guy (Nabbeun namja)" is an earlier film of Ki-duk Kim that is probably being released now in the U.S. due to the success of "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom)," but fans of that visually entrancing parable should be warned how very different this exploration of the depths of human nature is.
As said earlier, this movie is not for everyone, however if the concept sounds like something that interests you, then you should enjoy this film.
Franklin explains to Marcie and Peppermint Patty that dinner at Charlie Brown's will be a little earlier.
I can relate to some of the scenes in the movie from my earlier days  at High School ( the toilette paper in the trees etc.)
Overall, as mentioned earlier, I thought that this has the potential to be a fabulous series of movies, but all thrown together, it leaves something to be desired.
I wonder though, if an earlier line uttered by an off screen elevator operator was meant to reference Cotter's ultimate fate when he asked - "Going down?"
The film all boils down to the scenes at the end where we get to see the lead have his way with the murderess he witnessed earlier on and these are the best parts of the film.
I am great fan of Jess Franco (especially of his earlier works), and had "Mansion of the Living Dead" been directed by someone else, it might not have its certain undeniable charm - then again, it is not really imaginable for anyone else to come up with an outrageously nonsensical production such as this one.
Scenes in pre-war Germany are handled with a light touch that distinguishes the German pilots and designers from the politicians responsible for their deployment, and with an ironic comedy that recalls "Pimpernel Smith", Leslie Howard's earlier potent propaganda vehicle.
As I have hinted earlier, some of the problems with Decoys were corrected in Decoys 2.
Obviously no-one believes Luke but when Bobby Johnson (Mark Trottier) is found dead under mysterious circumstances Luke is convinced the alien babes are behind it & since he is blamed for Bobby's murder after having a fight with him earlier in the evening Luke has even more reason to expose the alien menace on campus....
This movie is a hidden gem and as I said earlier, I highly recommend it and it is great from start to finish and boy what an ending it has.
