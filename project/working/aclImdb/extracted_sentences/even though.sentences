The actors play off of each other and even though the script is lacking (and gives these characters very little to work with), it's these inspired performances that carry "Death".
I do not recommend this movie, even though Bruce Willis does good acting it does not save the movie, at all.
I guess it was a big hit in its time even though it's not as well known today, but my advice is to watch it if you ever get the chance.
This is the kind of film that you just end up counting among your favorites even though it's likely that no one you know has ever seen it.
throughout the movie we see that even though the Jesuits could communicate with the Natives and vice versa there was still a great amount of misunderstanding.
It is significant that AbbÃ© Laforgue himself is perceptive enough to realise that fact, even though their intelligence is one that he can never understand.
The episode plots also had their relevance in war, and there were also some good settings, even though there were certain anachronisms.
After saying this, even though in my mind this is possibly the best haunted house film I've ever seen it is still just that, meaning do not expect to watch this film and see it completely redefine horror because it doesn't.
But even though you realise this while watching it, the knowledge that your watching a 'haunted house' film washes away and the film completely draws you into its story and world.
Like in a comedy where the joke is built up to the punch line, the scare is given enough support before scream moment and even though a lot of them have been done before, these ones actually genuinely scare.
But Scorpion's revenge ain't against the system, baby, even though she does manage to fuck it up a bit on her way out; it's with the people who killed her man and sent her away, and when she breaks out with another fish in tow, a blind girl looking for her own justice against the sleazeballs who offed her Latino guitar-picker boyfriend, and discovers in a staggering revelation that her husband faked his own death in order to kill a bunch of shyster lawyers who were suing his company (not a spoiler!
What also fascinates me is that even though the movie was realistic it was magical .
And even though I believe that his teaching methods should be classified as child abuse and should be thrown in prison, the idea worked.
I didn't particularly see Azazeal as truly evil, even though he was supposed to be.
I think that the producers of the show should make another 5 to 6 series because at the end they just left you hanging with the characters, because almost anything could happen to them even though Malacky(sorry about my spelling) has taken over the school.
Notice how neither Guy nor Vera - the main characters - ever fully manage to reach this state of total cynicism even though they both try.
I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict .
The shake was the only decent special effects they even had in it so they just HAD to show it again even though the completely ignored that it doesn't make sense.
The female FBI agent gets hold of Astin's time machine device (which looks like a hand-held clear plastic cellphone/compass), realizes its power, and then..even though she knows there's going to be a takeover bank robbery in seconds, proceeds to... arrest Sean Astin??
and end up crashing the van even though they are not being chased!
They survive a tumbling crash without a single broken bone, even though they weren't wearing their seat belts.
Unusually for an action film you do care about the characters, especially Stuart, even though they themselves seem to care little about the carnage around them, and want them to survive.
Each resident takes on their own personality and even though they later turn murderous the viewer finds themselves not only sympathizing with Duane, his brother and the rest of the freaks, but you will actually find yourself rooting them on as they seek revenge against several reporters from a sleazy tabloid who threaten to expose the Bradleys as well as a sleazy old man who runs a 'freak show' and falsely claims to have captured Belail.
Hache apparently is resigned to being a nuisance for his parents, but he wants to escape this situation by living alone, even though he's not ready yet.
The role of young MartÃ­n (Hache), perfect and tender Juan Diego Botto, as the real survivor of the script, turning sour into sweetness, and insecurity into strenght, even though he's lost in hesitations, is a message of faith in life.
I liked it also because even though the family cast may not be the best of actors and actresses, they put together a family type of feeling that makes it seem like they are a family, even though they are not.
), this is som much better than all of those, I even thought it was better than Foul Play.
So even though many of the images may seem random, everything from the toe to the lighting was very thought out.
I had some fun times with this film, even though it does not come close to any of the great werewolf pictures.
Of course, even though the group unwisely mock the locals, they don't quite deserve what happens to them once they begin their hunting trip proper.
The most 'innovative' part of this game are the portals, and even though Valve's Portal-mod does a far much better job at this today then Prey, it is a cool effect (at least for sight).
Instead, it's the design that matters, even though Prey boils down to another corridor crawl when all's said and done.
Some of the content may be a bit "politically incorrect" in this post 9/11 society: Robin's actions at the carnival were triggered by what happened in Israel, even though these guys had nothing to do with what happened.
i enjoyed this Brian De Palma paranormal thriller/horror.it.may seem tame by today's standards,but back then,i'm sure it was probably pretty terrifying to some people.i thought it was also revolutionary.there are some pretty graphic images that i found a bit disturbing,even though i've seen a lot of horror/thrillers.but this is not just some slice'n dicer.there's a story in here,and the gory parts are part of the story.John Farris wrote the screenplay adapted from his novel.and he has quite a few excellent novels that in the right hands would make good films.
This is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies, even though it's so light and fluffy it seems ready to just float off into thin air at any moment.
This film really sparked my interest and even though I did not agree with some choices that were made in the end, I really liked this movie.
But even though wr/dir Richard Benner was apparently far more interested in this theme than in the gay scene, and even though Benner seriously does not know how to point a camera, this actually does end up giving a pretty good time capsule of Toronto's 70s gay scene - and not just the hairstyles!
A little longer than it should be, but it doesn't drag, and the situation is a hook even though contrived.
It used to scare the crap outta me when I was young, and even though its not that scary now I still love it.
There is a somewhat good amount of gore and violence, and the creatures look great for a low-budget flick, even though they do sound a little bit like elephants when they scream.
Altman DOES show us that TV can be fascinating and uplifting, even though he got curtailed, which will keep us wondering how that 12th episode that was never shot would be like.
='( Tyra Banks proves to be a very lovable character, and even though she seems clueless at the beginning, at the end she is the one who learns it all and finally understands to be yourself, to love yourself, to remember those things important, and to live life to the fullest!!
corinna looks hot in it, but i honestly am mad at myself for buying this off of amazon, even though i only spent $1.
Every section of the island not actively occupied by civilisation feels as though it doesn't belong to civilisation - even though it's so desolate it doesn't belong to anything else, either.
That sucks because this movie was so good, but that flaw always interferes whenever I see the movie (even though the movie states it is not a true story).
I was interested in the plot, even though it did tend to drag on at times, mostly the beginning.
I watched it last night even though it has not been released yet (it plays on the Sci Fi channel on Oct 8th) and well... it was great!
Less character development than in some commercials, even though this is a fairly long movie.
I saw it recently amongst friends (we were having a contest as to who could rent the worst movie) and it felt really dated, even though it wasn't made THAT long ago.
Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera.
This latter one, in all actuality, isn't even the story with more interest, even though that's the one most fans of Eastwood and of serial killer movies will want to see.
I am devastated that this film didn't do better because I would have loved to see a sequel even though it never would have matched this one.
My other friend was also a DD and even though we didn't get the same "feeling" from it as our drunken friends, we did really enjoy the music and watching some people get sick and in a few cases pee on themselves.
Gulzar's recent movies have been very politically opinionated but Aandhi even though it is set in a political setting is not much about about politics itself.
But that's not a bad thing, and it's a credit to Brest the writer that he has managed to make his film fairly easy to comprehend, even though there's an awful lot going on.
Jann Wenner deserves special mention even though he's probably playing himself considering he was then the editor and now owner of Rolling Stone Magazine.
This is an important period in the Danish - and Scandinavian - history (with the 2nd Worl War; the occupation of Denmark) and even though I'm not Danish I really enjoy learning more about Denmarks national and local history in this way as well.
This movie doesn't have a terribly complicated plot--a man and woman are divorcing even though down deep they are still in love.
The solution is unpredictable, even though it is based on the kind of double-deception that Christie has used quite a few other times in her stories.
Instead he's playing Uncle Creepy to a young blonde girl, who apparently has no friends or family even though she lives in a charming house with perfectly blooming flowers.
It is worth one's time to watch these masters of the art at work, even though the vehicle is so shabby.
What I will say is that even though I read a couple of good reviews about this movie, I wasn't prepared for what a wonderful experience sitting through this movie would give me.
I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater, it held my interest all the way to the end.
Oh well, even though I signed on to be in a quaint little comedy I wound up being in a schlocky horror movie.
In the end both Wally and Andre even though they have different opinions on how man can find his way back to nature as well as recovering his long lost sense of reality.
Music is used marvelously throughout the film (even though covers of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" -no, it's not Jeff Buckley's version, it's Lucky Jim- have been way overused in films lately, the words actually are meaningful in a climactic scene here).
As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.
You get more than two... let's call them species, even though it doesn't apply as well here as in a lot of other titles.
It's a complete different atmosphere, that doesn't really seem suiting for a Columbo movie, even though most of this movie got filmed back in California.
I have watched my share of Looney Toons shows even though I was born in 1993, and I know enough to know, that these feminine characters only appear once in a great while on the Looney Toons.
The acting is considerably good, even though the hero screams like a little girl and the heroine looks like Meryl Streep's younger sister.
I sure did not expect the climax, even though once it started unfolding, I started getting the whole thing.
Unfortunately even though there is plenty of air action, one is left flat with this film.
I'm thinking that most people can relate to at least one of the characters in the movie and even though it is similar to an after school special, it's so much better than that due to the acting of both Richard Pryor and Cicely Tyson.
The sexuality in the film is very real, even though it is fleeting.
As the story develops these people manage to realize that even though they cannot change the harshness of their life, relying on each other's empathy and love can make things easier.
I really got the feeling that I got to know them better, even though their lives are sometimes completely different from mine.
at the 50 minute mark  It can in no way scare or shock, as the corpses in every case are obviously fake, and even though a legless 1 armed girl is sexually exploited and then snuffed, shes slutty, bitchy, and doesn't exist as a character but has the on screen presence of a self aware plot device.
The problem is that even though they are free, they don't seem to realize it.
Cats and Dogs is more than puppets meet Muppets; it is more than that, even though just as entertaining, it has progressed to greater levels.
Besides, I'm still pretty young at heart even though I'm past 40 (not immature, mind you!
It was a very good continuation of what I can understand, even though I've never seen the first one and this was my first time watching the second one.
It ranks as one of the cinema's finest duels and Flynn will always be remembered for it even though that amazing leap with the knife was performed by stuntman and B picture actor Jock Mahoney.
John Cromwell's direction sparks this entry into " The Prisoner of Zenda" This film redone by MGM with James Mason as Black Michael and in colour( Color)  This version has more wit and sweep even though its in black and white.
Monica has had it with him and leaves him for good and even though he doesn't want her to leave there isn't anything he can say to change her mind.
Glenda Jackson starred in a film called "Stevie" in the 1970's and she had to carry that film herself also and even though I thought she succeeded this is a task that's practically impossible even for the best actors.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
Madonna has proved that age simply made her get better,and that even though she may be under the radar sometimes, she is still very relevant.
A Horror-fan and avid lover of Japanese cinema, especially from the 70s, I had high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed, even though the film was totally different than what I had expected.
And what really bothers me is that in the post-screening discussion... even though no one could accurately explain or make sense of what they just watched... even though half the audience was making fun of it the entire time... even though it was an absolute goofy mess, NOT ONE PERSON SAID IT WAS BAD.
I like some of the editing, even though it is crazy.
I liked seeing the various cars competing and even though the movie is a bit predictable, and sometimes the actors' lines seem cheesy, it is an enjoyable movie for a gearhead, a racing fan, or just someone who likes cars.
I know it's not one of the great comedies of the century, but I laughed out loud several times, even though I was watching alone.
Eklavya transports you to the vivid land of Rajasthan, where the Local Rana (Boman Irani, splendid) still considers himself the king even though democracy prevails.
It's like the split of their friends gave proof to their inner fear and they start to break up even thought they have all the reason to be happy!
Indeed the entire rape issue in the novel was totally played down in the film (MGM brass could not bring up the idea of rape with Flynn, even though he had won the 1944 case brought against him on that charge).
The supporting characters are pretty well done - even though some of them are a bit wacky.
Although I'll admit that even though I was worried that this would be the case, it didn't bother me all that much, because the story had good forward propulsion and a resolution that was emotionally satisfying although not intellectually so.
It's a good family film which I oddly enjoyed (even though it's certainly not my style of film).
I saw this movie as I had seen a good review from IMDb itself....moreover I was compelled to see this film as Dakota Fanning was in this movie........even though Kurt Russell was in this movie..........I expected it to be her movie and it was..........She is an amazing talent whom we had seen in I am sam,Hide and seek,war of the worlds,push,winged creatures............without much effort she delivers the beautiful performances and it makes me wonder..............The story has inspired me and has made me realise that to achieve anything we must believe.............even when odds are against us..............this film brings out true value of relationship and will to uphold the most thing in which you believe.................
As with other "truth-based" films, I came away curious to know more, even though I suspect much of it is far-fetched.
As written by Luc Besson and as played by Anne Parillaud , Nikita is a whiney, drug addicted psychopath who murders a police officer in cold blood, even though she has virtually no chance of escape.
Of all the movies about cross country road races (Cannonball 1 and 2, Gumball Rally, et all) I always thought this was easily the best, even though you tend to hear about it the least.
I guess teaming up is the right word even though Mifune has actually sworn to kill Bronson if he doesn't work with him.
You could call it an experiment and it's an interesting blend, even though the story seems familiar, it does keep to its strengths and never wanders off onto pointless sub-plots.
I figured out most of the story even though I don't speak much Spanish.
You follow a few parallel stories from a fixed point of view, sort of similar to Scola's "La cena", but kind of lighter, even though I wouldn't call this a comedy.
I actually liked this--even though reality be damned!
It's fun, lightweight (even though it gets heavy for the characters) entertainment and a decent entering place into the world of Corean dramas.
".As proof of this, that I don't have anything against the Mormon religion,I'd have to say that I saw Salingrad (even though the film's made by "zie Germans" about "zie Germans", fuhrer and Nazi stuff mentioned in there, Sven Hassle style) and absolutely loved it, and I gave you another example with another Mormon film I really enjoyed in the last paragraph.So don't throw any rocks at me please.Just because I didn't like this movie doesn't mean that I don't like Mormons...I just don't like this film.
The female lead never loses her shirt even though everyone else ends up with torn clothes.
If you can sit through it, even though I don't even recommend putting it in the player, feel free to experience the most boring 90 minutes or so of your life, and hate yourself for never being able to have them back.
The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells, since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere.
Don't expect to come out with a smile after this one, even though it is an interesting experience.
When I was really young, even though I saw the caricatures of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and Edward G. Robinson - plus the scenes from "The Jazz Singer" and "It Happened One Night" - I couldn't interpret anything from them, but of course now I can.
For even though it is not a fancy movie and may not be put on a list of the 100 best movies of all time ( even though it'll go on mine)It is a heartfelt and a heart warming movie till the end.
Seeing Robin Williams in a robotic role such as this,gave a point of view on the world even though he did not realize it in the first place.
I think Corbucci was vastly underrated because he happened to make movies in the same vicinity as Leone who seemed more likely to pick and choose from various American westerns (even though he's been orally serviced by too many people, I still do like his stuff) whereas Sergio Deuce pounded out some westerns that I think truly compete with the best of Mr. Leone.
In the end the you know what hits the fan with Bob, even though he's dying from an incurable and unnamed illness, getting elected governor of the state.
Benicio del Toro's performance was all right, even though (or: because) he seemed to think he was in a remake to the 'Usual Suspects'.
The gloves take away a lot of the blow, so no cats got harmed during the making of this motion picture and actually seeing cats fight on the streets with their claws is of course something far more violent and violent looking, even though it's just nature, unlike obviously putting gloves on a couple of cats and let them fight in a small boxing ring.
The two leads are very good actors and even though it has a somewhat unbelievable ending, I liked it.
Basically, there are only three females in the movie and even though Christine (deaf girl) occupies quite a lot of screen time, she is just a filler.
I mean he gets Howard, a weaker man to go along with his ruthless scheme even though it is quite obvious that he really doesn't want to.
They handled the Reality-TV show aspect quite well actually, and even though it was rather straight-forward, it was still good.
Andy Lau also gives a very note-worthy performance, as Chow Yun Fats sidekick (even though this is a much younger Andy Lau).
This was shown on channel 5 in england on 5/9/03 and channel 5 not normally being a very good channel i was going to skip this movie, even though it sounded quite 'interesting'.
So it was appalling to me that even though there was no basis in law for granting custody to Jody Ann's appalling mother, simply because of a judge's personal bias custody was granted.
They are determined to kill the Graf Spee, even though they only have 6-inch and 8- inch guns.
Bela Lugosi, so often underrated as a performer (even though he played none other than Jesus Christ on stage to some acclaim), manages, here, to convey a sense of loss that is almost palpable.
for whatever reason, pieces of the theme song are still clear in my head, even though i haven't seen this show since about 1981. being a huge simpsons fan, i delight in all of their pop culture references and this show was referenced close to a half dozen times.
The Marines, however, *were* covered even though they were inside since they were carrying arms on duty, hence coming to attention as well as the salute.
But it will in fact go down as one of my favorite episodes, even though it was so sad.
The violence in this film is every bit as brutal as anything in a modern "gangsta" flick, even though some of it takes place off-camera.
We're asked to believe that because Mike Wilding as Tye Graham can't "see" his hot blonde fellow musician (because he lost his sight in WWII), that he could never love her (even though she's younger, prettier, sweeter and a BILLION times better for him than "Jenny").
And to add an extra cherry on top of the sundae, we're asked to believe that even though he was a journalist, went to war, then came back blind, now he is suddenly a brilliant pianist who knows every note of every song Jenny is going to (lip-synch) sing, even though it's a new show with new songs that the public hasn't heard yet -- songs that he already has memorized (because Jenny's former MD, who could not STAND her, "teaches" Mike the songs).
I think even though the budget was low and the overall quality of the film was rather primitive by today's standards, the "feel" of the movie is what made such an impact on me and everyone else who has watched it!
Even though it's old and creaky, even though it's mannered and any violence happens discretely off-camera, THE BLACK CAT somehow has the power to make me feel uneasy.
Her character has changed while the girlfriend of Tom behaves very much like Barbara of the original, even though in the original the girlfriend acts totally different.
This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected).
I think you'll be refreshingly surprised at Lugosi playing the sympathetic character, even though it's not entirely clear early on in the movie.
And of course it has Omar Sharif as Grau, a genuinely admirable character, even though he's too reckless about his own safety (as in the last 1944 scene).
And even though some people say that Peter O'Toole is miscast, he really draws you completely into the Tanz character.
But the including of the bomb-plot not only serves to tie together the storyline, but provides real excitement (even though we know it's going to fail).
I even thought, that I had a wrong film handed to me... Fortunately, things arranged quite fast and I started watched... My interest grew fast...
As for the plot, despite the facts that so much of the script is wrong, it still is a very captivating movie and at least it captures the essence of who Reavis was--even though the details are more than a little wrong.
Many of the characters add a great deal to the story itself,even though at times one gets the impression that some of them are there for continuity more than realism.HIGHLY recommended.
The plotting lets this film down, as after a good opening half hour - the film descends into boredom as we try to discover who really was behind the killing, even though there only ever is one suspect.
this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.
I had just finished reading a long, thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe (all wars usually are, but this one especially), one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape.
Peter, the driver that picks Dina up in the beginning, states the theme through dialog even though the action in the past works as subtext to show us what the theme is.
And yet, at the end, there is no absolute clarity, even though the identity is obvious.
In a way, it even tops both American movies, even though it's not really comparable to them, because the story goes in another direction as the movie proceeds.
This is a great episode, fine the conclusion is nothing too amazing, even though I didn't guess it.
I guess we are to just go by faith that she had some real breakdowns back in the day even though it is never seen or mentioned.
Anyways, this show is a complete waste of time, I don't like people who compare this show to the daily show, because that would be a huge insult to the Daily show and Jon Stewart, even though its obvious the stupid correspondents on pop cultured are trying to emulate the correspondents on the Daily Show, but they promptly fall flat on their face every time they try.
I have ordered all three of the books even though I have heard they are a hard read.
Anyhow, it one of my favorite movies and it made me laugh even though it is dated it is true to how people would react in that situation, I loved the ending also.
Sherilyn Fenn has one of the best roles of her career, even though it may not be much of a stretch (an actress playing an actress).
#1: In one scene Lazarus #1 or #2 you don't know which has a goatee that goes from thick to thin #2: The dilithium crystal assemblies fit into Lazarus's ship like they were designed for it #3: He falls off cliffs even though he is disoriented and off balance.
3 of 10 even though it's Trek, it's a pain to watch and I won't be next time I see it on.
McCoy treats him for a head injury, and even though he is clearly unbalanced and dangerous, turns him loose to wander the ship and steal a couple of dilithium crystals.
because even though Dean is tough he is no match against a possible 'demoniac Sam'.
Fanny became a much more human personality after watching this play/comedy/drama and I felt very sympathetic to her even though she was obviously an extremely difficult person to live with.
It was heart-warming to see just how much he cared for V, even though he knew what she did for a living.
I predicted how the ending would play out (and i was right) even though I did not want it to.
There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still an ugly, sordid story and not always fun to watch even though it keeps your attention and - at least with me - draws you back for multiple viewings.
But in several scenes, even though I know what's going to happen I jump every time!
There is nothing special, but for a film from 1997, this has good effects even though there are few.
Sheffer is shot from the underbrush, their canoe overturns, and they just decide to saunter through the rainforest in a random direction, even though night is approaching, they are soaking wet, and Sheffer has a gunshot wound.
First let me say that even though Azema and Arditi are forcedly advertised as main characters, Arditi has probably a maximum of 10 minutes of screen time and Azema hardly says any word during the whole movie.
However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.
The late Brandon Tardicoff (I think that's how you spell it) President of NBC, saved Seinfeld when it was in the same situation as F&G: he kept it on the air, even though it was getting low ratings.
There were issues of drug use and teenage sex which some might not have found ideal for the younger viewers of this show (people in their very early teens as this show tended to sometimes celebrate drug use...even though there was one episode that was clearly anti-drug).
But due mostly to the casts ability to make it so real, so authentic, and so alive and feel so current even though the movie is filmed twenty years ago and set over sixty years ago.
So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to find wooden acting and poor writing in this film, even though Mr. Costner is nowhere to be found.
It is a "catastrophe" movie, even though it has nothing to do with the typical western idea of such a happening.
Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an excellent performance as a young woman traumatized by some mysterious events in her childhood, even though no one will be surprised by what that trauma is when it's revealed.
Sure, familiar elements are there, but even though the setting is modern for the period, it has a bit of a Gothic feel to it.
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
I just bought this on dvd the other day allthough i must admit i wasn't looking for it as i wanted to buy ghost world but the shop didn't have it(DAMM YOU WOOLWORTHS IT'S A GREAT MOVIE NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO VIRGIN IN CARDIFF)anyway i went across to w.h smith and even though they didn't have it, they did have this gem on the shelf, so i bought this instead.
I remember seeing this when i was a young kid and even though i didn't totaly understand it at the time, i thought it was so cool.
All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables.
Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in.
even though he is tough, he loves the kids very much.
I specially liked when the little girl asked her mother for the meaning of some words that, even though we use a lot in every day conversation, almost no one knows its precise meaning.
And even though Rondo wasn't the world's greatest actor, there's something oddly compelling about his performance and The Brute Man in general.
Still, Romola Garai and Rose Byrne were lovely as Cassandra and Rose, even though the central romances in the story were subverted by the performances of Thomas and Blucas.
The proprietor doesn't care if this happens, even though it could cost him his business.
I first found out about R. Crumb through "Fritz The Cat" even though he was opposed to the movie (which I must say I thoroughly enjoyed!)
That said, he does an adequate job providing the love interest for Ms. Shearer, even though that subplot mostly gets in the way of the historical aspects of the film.
Louis XVI (Robert Morley in his film debut practically stole the show and earned the nomination for the Best Supporting Actor), the grandson of Louis XV, was swept away in the French Revolution--even though he himself was relatively modest, unassuming, and moral.
It's one of his best, even though many critics did not like it when it came out.
Well even though this movie was predictable, lacked the hotties that i come to expect in good teen comedies and most of the jokes were very creative but badly executed i really didn't dislike the movie.
I also love the new look of Godzilla he looks meaner and more destructive even though he's a bit smaller.
I once liked the 2nd series of Godzilla movies (1984-1995), even though I found something annoying about those movies (as either the bad or good guy, Godzilla was so sympathetic that the human characters came off as obnoxious).
Also, they kind of ignore the movie Godzilla vs. Destroyah even though they show Godzilla's son taking over the reigns this fact is ignored and all the characters from the 90 films are ignored as well.
I saw "Godzilla 2000" at the theater and wasn't disappointed, even though a lot has changed since Toho killed off their iconic monster at the end of 1995's "Godzilla Vs.
Though it's evident with this production that Godzilla is the bad guy (pending on your view), this was one of the things that really struck me as unique about the previous generation of kaiju-eiga films - in that you never really knew if he was the bad guy or not - this movie makes that pretty clear to you, even though the new monster Orga is clearly the bigger problem for the people of Japan.
He had the best lines, and even though at times he was a little too winy, he was the most likable of the bunch.
Donna D'Errico does her best to perform well in such an ineptly written and totally dull role and one does start to take some enjoyment from her performance even though it is only that of a B-Movie actress.
It opens well,but it rapidly descends into the worst Candyman film of the series.The first and foremost problem is that it is just not scary at all,ever.It's pretty gory here and there (much like it's predecessors) but at no point does it ever jolt you or put any sense of dread into you.Another thing is that the performances are absolutely rubbish.D,Errico is okay in the lead role,even though she kept reminding me of Midlands glamour model Jakki Degg (she looks about ten years younger than she actually is,too),but Todd,as the Candyman,is here unable to liven up the proceedings,just robotically churns out his lines much less effectively than in his last two outings as the titular monster and even appears slightly bored,like he popped a valium or two before filming began.The supporting cast are what really weigh the film down,the most witless,inept bunch of hopeless nobodies who'd probably have trouble getting work in a daytime TV show (except maybe the one who played Caroline's mum!)
And even though Joe is perplexed by this, he is drawn into Jed's tantalising web, the essence of which destroys the cosy veneer of heterosexual normalcy Joe takes for granted.
The script at times seems confusing, even though its mostly 2 or 3 people talking.
I was very excited to find out there was a movie based on the novel, even though I stayed cautious, not wanting to be too disappointed.
Not hateful nor whiney about his lot, he simply keeps trying at life, even though his combination of intelligence, appreciation of subtlety and unfortunate odd looks keep him from the mainstream life connections that might fulfill him.
The superb Helen McCrory, as Watson's American fiancÃ©e, initially appears brash and pushy (she calls Holmes "Sherlock" throughout, even though his best friend Watson invariably calls him by his last name), an often-observed trait of American women in British film/TV productions, but she is too good an actress to keep to that one-note character.
Offered a big budget and a 35-day shooting schedule if he made it with Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, de Toth held out for Sterling Hayden even though it mean a fraction of the budget and a 15-day shooting schedule Â and still managed to come in ahead and shoot the film in only 13 days.
The storyline is simple, even though it is multilayered.
A sadly boring spectacle of a biblical film, even though almost all the production values are of a high quality (except that special effect vulture).
Remarkably the film still holds up well even though it's a movie primarily aimed at children, however the film is really brought down by the third act.
Shakespeare may have beamed well-pleased at this chosen Richard, a fellow thespian who, according to an interview reproduced on the DVD, had to mouth the words to fully capture the role even though no sound would survive the flowing decades.
I was truly moved by this movie even though there are many parts that are simply unbelievable.
I think this movie did not get as much credit as it should have for the simple fact that it was filmed by a Mexican production company even though it was released by 20th Century Fox.
However, when his grandmother dies, Carlitos decides to cross the US/Mexican border with the help of two young Chicanos (America Ferrara and Jesse GarcÃ­a), since doÃ±a Carmen, la coyote (Carmen Salinas), refuses to help him, due to a promise made to Rosario, Carlito's mother, even though she handles an illegal crossing business.
Eventually I'm pretty sure nothing happens at the end but even though I just finished a couple of hours ago I can't remember much other than feeling very grateful.
This is a pretty decent movie (Magnolia Pictures always seem to do excellent work), with great acting, a superior story and deep insight into the lives of people most don't understand - those who wish to be handicapped even though they're not.
The characters alone make the movie funny, even though they are not aiming to make you laugh.
This isn't a mobster film even though the main character, Vinnie (Steve Martin) is a rat.
it was also strange that even though Dick knew that Allen was with Linda all the time he was away from her and that she even mentioned his name in her sleep Dick for the life of him couldn't put two and two together.
Dr. Zoidberg: a big blobby crab, obviously the group's own doctor, even though he knows as much about medicine as much as Fry knows about...anything.
The show manages to have several guest stars even though it is set centuries in the future by having the technology to keep people's heads preserved in jars, strangely this even works for people who are long dead in the present.
Everything else is a blur and I'm guessing that I repressed the rest of the movie, even though I watched it a few more times in simple shock that it was so bad, even by my lax standards.
Laughton was also responsible for the casting of O'Hara, even though Hitchcock had not wanted to use her after a poor screen test.
Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable -- Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the "gentleman" who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty.
Furthermore, even though The Third Man is a British film, its view on Old Europe is distinctively American.
Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short.
The acting is terrible, and even though the film is only 1hr 15 mins long they keep reminding you with awful pieces of dialogue about what happened a few minutes ago.
And even though there are some CGIs used for some of the scenes where the two main characters meet, I still think this is a sick tale to put on screen.
Now for the bad parts let me start off with the acting I'll tell You one thing these people do not know how to act everyone is either going over-the-top or just giving a Dead-Pan Performance.the worst acting comes from Cam'ron.For example the scene where his cousin dies he can't even cry or show real emotion.just fake and bad.the only good acting comes from Funkmaster Flex who disses cam'ron in one scene which was the only funny scene that had me laughing and he ain't even an actor.Juelz Santana who plays Bandana is Bad as well who gives a over-the top performance even though his character is so underdeveloped.
1-He cheated on his loving wife with psycho (anne heche) 2-He wouldn't leave anna alone even though he knew all he could do was hurt her 3-He was creepy
I liked the idea of using the local haunt - Mel's Drive-in - as the focal point for the gang's fun even though they actually spend very little time inside it during that night.
In fact I felt a connection with all of these people even though we come from two different worlds.
Also they have not shown anything happening in the outside world even though policeman in first scene is killed and these 4 friends disappears.
Also all 4 friends looks energetic throughout the life of their characters even though they do not eat or drink anything after their accident...It is one more goof in the film.
Watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago.
A Rhodesian by birth, Swansey is determined to support the whites as they struggle to retain control in Rhodesia, even though the rest of the world has imposed crippling sanctions on his nation.
La CittÃ  Delle Donne is not a grotesque film even though it is rightly considered by many as a crazy little tale of a hapless philanderer.In this film,Italian superstar Marcello Mastroianni appears as if he is more of a morbid widower than one of the resourceful male chauvinists who would do everything in order to prevent weak women from usurping power.Feelini freely talks about the never ending confusion of male female relationships especially in the context of transfer of power.He has made a film which will surely have problems in getting understood by all.It can be surmised that even regular,loyal Fellini fans will have problems trying to figure out the hidden message of this film.
This movie worms its way into your own psyche in time - as with other Fellini movies, it seems to reveal scenes that are totally new and surprising, yet strangely familiar to me even though I've never seen them before.
He gets to the emotional core of human experience, which means that even though I was never a young man who went to a brothel in 1930s Italy, as he has, there is something of the experience that I can relate to, as if it were universal.
As the movie progressed, even though I longed to find out something about this guy, I wasn't getting much at all.
Pretty accurate account of the both greatly admired and violently despised, depending on which side of the fence your sitting on, legendary Cuban, even though he's from Argentina, revolutionary leader Commandante Ernesto Che Guevara, Benicio Del Toro.
Perhaps it's due to Soderbergh and screenwriter Peter Buchman's decision not to show any of our title characters' negative traits whatsoever and only paint him as an heroic figure fighting for the good of the people Â like a Robin Hood figure, so to speak, even though that this is something of a distortion.
Corbucci maintains a furious pace throughout "The Mercenary," even though it starts up with a flashback and sacrifices some suspenseÂbecause you know the principals cannot die until the flashback ends.
The classical music that goes along with movie is wonderful, even though that might seem to be an odd choice of music for a movie like this.
Let me start out by saying that I grew up with Final Fantasy and (even though I dislike most of the games, especially FFVII) the PS1.
Saving Marriage shows the passion these people have for this 'cause' even though it shouldn't be an issue, it was truly heartfelt and is just what we need in our fight for equality.
The always reliable Stockard Channing is also featured as her snobbish sister and Sam Waterston is charming as a man Alley gets involved with but this is Alley's movie and she forsakes any pretense of glamor to realistically portray an unsympathetic character in a difficult situation who somehow still manages to make us feel for her even though we know that a lot of what this woman does and feels is just wrong.
In one, the doctor treats a gunshot victim and doesn't disclose this to the police--even though this violated the law and should have resulted in either criminal prosecution or loss of license or both.
In two others, Kildare behaves like a psychiatrist, even though he has no training in the field and once again, he's right and everyone else is wrong.

Meanwhile back home she has been notified of this tragic news and manages to deal with it bravely even though she is going to have his child.
The twins are well cast even though they are from illinois and Errol Flynn is always entertaining as the swashbuckling hero.
Now, even though this stuff if supposed to kill him (and was probably supposed to kill everyone they shot it into), one of the thugs says that he's heard some 'bad' stuff about the drug, that it can make you really strong.
A drug that's been made to kill people has supposedly made people strong, even though it's made to kill them.
Notice that in a series of death scenes in the same room all take place in a curiously clean space, even though someone died brutally in the same spot not five minutes before.
Sure the CGI in the climax is kind of laughable by today even though back then it was a little cheap and the storyline is very compelling as well as the old school type of animation here.
It was scary with the kills even though it had slasher movie kills the plot kept you guessing who it was instead of knowing it's some guy from a lake with a hockey mask and no life.
"Beverly Hills Cop II" tries to be stylish but can't even though it's in the hands of Tony Scott, director of 1986's "Top Gun".
The music is especially good even though I can't understand what the words are.
Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked Dennis' (Mason Gamble) the best.
The 2 main villains are very menacing, even though we hardly see Jurgen Prochnow, he was still very menacing when on screen.
And even though Orson Welles rarely played the romantic lead, he's wonderful.
I have not succeeded but even though I have viewed many bad films some of which would of been to bad even for the crew of The Satellite of Love.
Years later they teamed up with Carrey again to film "Me Myself and Irene," which was a great movie, but even though the movie was nastier, even though it contained a chicken up a filthy pig's ass, it still couldn't match the wonderful grossness Peter, Bobby, Jim & Jeff provided in one of the funniest films in cinema history.
Unlike Rick, he can neither reveal his identity or his love for the woman he left behind -- even though she may know it.
The flight attendant caught in all the fighting acted quite well, even though her role was quite irritating at times.
Helen's character Mary could GET on the audience's nerves as well, even though she was a good person & meant well.
Black Cat fails to be great even though it is made in Hong Kong, where action films are usually unmatchable.
They can't cram everything into one final hour, even though the audience expects them too.
But even though she wants to be an adult it is just like a game for her, because actually she behaves like a kid because she IS a kid.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
So powerful to me, at least, that I have only watched it one other time and have little desire to see it again.....even though it's a fine movie.
It's also quite remarkable how the script never reverts to being gratuitous exploitation, even though all the themes hint towards that direction.
It was also cool to see Thomas F. Wilson (who played Biff Tannen in the "Back To The Future" trilogy) playing one of the good guys for a change, even though his character, Lt. Todd "Maniac" Marshall, and Col. Blair are rivals, and only sometimes friends with each other.
In conclusion, even though it can also be seen on Nick at Nite now, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.
Then August, whose only been in NYC for a little while is able to run through subway systems, find his way to Central Park and get access to back stage where they have a tux and tails waiting for him even though he was not supposed to show.
Are you saying she gave birth to a baby in a US hospital, did not have to sign one form to have it given away even though she is over 18, not one nurse or doctor said anything about the baby's health or showed it to her and there was no funeral for a supposed dead baby???
The one nice person in the film is a daughter who defends her father even though (unknown to her) he tries to sell her into prostitution.
there is a little swearing in the film, which somehow warranted an 'r' rating even though there is much less swearing and less objectionable material than most 'pg-13' flicks (if you let your kids watch pg-13, let 'em watch this.)
"Let's declare a vendetta against the supergator even though I have no stated reason for so doing!"
I like how even though it has SO much slapstick, there is always a teeny bit of wit to top it off!
So even though this movie gets pretty gory and violent, visually Id say its very elegant.
For she comes to see her real challenge is that she cannot relate to Ned even though she loves him very much.
I caught this on City TV last night (Feb 16th, 2008) when flipping through the channels, and even though I had missed the first 30 minutes of this film, I was compelled to stop on that channel and watch it!
Also, when the film cuts to the final scene, where Julie's pregnancy is obviously going along nicely, and even though their son's death is imminent, they appear to be a reunited, happy family again.
But, even though I seem to prefer a film that "spells it all out" for me, I loved this film BECAUSE it begged all of those questions, BECAUSE it left me pondering, wondering, thinking, worrying...
Since then, I have seen it three more times, and have concluded that even though it does not have a technically typical or logical resolution and plot, it is so rife with talented performances, excellent directing and powerful messages that the seemingly empty conclusion must be overlooked.
The second story, "Cut", also straight-forward, might be the weaker of the three even though it has some very tense moments: a director finds himself hostage to a situation with an actor who was little more than an extra, his wife attached to a piano like a puppet, and a child strapped against a sofa.
Almost as important as the case against the terrorists is the city politics where the mayor and chief of police wish to talk up Harry and Kate's role just to further their equal opportunities policies even though they had no role in the arrest they are getting the credit for.
It's interesting that even though Randolph Scott makes the obligatory declaration that, despite being on an island alone with Irene Dunne for 7 years, nothing happened, Dunne never validates this.
It's a well written story that offers plenty of surprises with its moments and main plot-line, even though of course the movie in a sense is mostly predictable, just like any other genre movie.
The scene moves so damn slow, even though it is supposed to be scary.
The characters are fun, and even though they've been done a million times, you still like them, plus they're very real.
I've seen some obscure horror films too, like Blood Beach, The Company Of Wolves and even seen The Last House On the left (even though I didn't like it that much).
The small cast works well together, even though the acting gets appropriately too theatrical at times for my taste.
So even though the ending is a bit too tame (Fleming's torture from the book would never have reached TV audiences from 1954), the mini-movie makes up for it with a tense battle at the card table, some good acting, and a great espionage feel throughout.
It all goes to show that Williams, like good wine, travels well, even though in this case it was from planet to planet.
It's rather straightforward, even though the script does throw around many scientific exchanges but counterpointing that is many trashy dialogues.
My parents got me a Julia "Barbie" doll, even though I did not have any regular Barbie dolls.
He can take a man's pocket watch, even though newly cleaned, and determine that the owner was poor but had come from a well-off family, that he had periods of income but they never lasted, that he was an alcoholic and that he was descending into madness.
Cushing plays out that moment brilliantly by providing us that even though he's an honourable man that can take it on the chin, but that moment he gives us a small glimpse of remorse and to question his own actions, which makes you feel for him a bit.
This spate of murders doesn't seem to concern Knox too much, even though he suspects that Burke and Hare are the culprits.... so engrossed is he in his experiments that he is happy to turn a blind eye.
Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before.
Although this movie is in French and dubbed in English, the most important thing required to enjoy this movie is using the English subtitles even though the speech is in English...the voice over seems to be competing with the background movie sound (rain, music) so it is difficult to make out the conversations without it.
Still technically being Joe's lawyer Abe feels that he can't betray his client even though his client betrayed him.
I could go on forever about the movie and even though the movie was low budget, poorly edited, complimented with sub par acting, it is the memories that are evoked that makes me like it.
In Emperor's Club, Prof Hundert loses his spot as headmaster to a young, politically-connected upstart, even though he taught there for 30 years.
The only thing stopping me from giving it a full 10, was the fact that I didn't like the ending very much, even though the suicide was a shock, the whole thing about Mr Keating getting kicked out didn't entertain me at all.
A few hours ago I felt lonely and depressed.I decided to watch it without the scenes that evoke sadness.And even though I watched it so many times before I found it restorative and heart lifting.
That was one of the credibility defying scenes that seemed a little over the top, even though done in understated fashion.
One of Bogie's last films, it holds up well, even though certain elements mentioned earlier mark it as a period piece.
The opening sequence remains a riveting case study in wild-eyed fear, as Rico (de Corsia) sweats a bucket load even though he's safely behind police walls.
"The Bloody Judge" is definitely one of his better films (even though, in my opinion, not one of his masterpieces), and a more than decent historical horror film.
Eventually the real duke shows up and even though he knows she is not the same woman he had a fling with he still wants Mae.
A mysterious military officer (Boxleitner) with a pistol and a lunchbox is strangely uninterested in working with the others even though he appears to know much he isn't telling.
I won't say anything about the plot (even though there is not one) but I will say something about the dazzling, state-of-the-art special effects, the only thing that salvages the movie.
Marsh (John Forsythe) and abetted by Texan belle Carla Forester (Eleanor Parker), Roper is forced to follow the fugitives...even though the path leads straight into the country of the bloodthirsty Mescalero Apaches.
You feel drawn to him in almost the same way you feel drawn to Hopkins, even though Willy is in a dark place for most of the film and is hardly in control.
Looks like a big budget film, even though it wasn't a Hollywood film.
For some reason I still haven't figured out but already deeply regret, I decided to watch it after all even though I'd knew it would have the same painful effect as poking my own eyes out with a rusty spoon and pour sour vinegar in the badly infected eye-sockets.
I enjoyed the first HSM even though I thought I wouldn't since my kids are in college and the Disney Channel is something I rarely watch.
True, we should remember to keep our friends close even though the future might cause us to go our separate ways, but I felt that the movie didn't communicate this message in a realistic context.
I recommend "Upperworld" for fans of 1930s cinema, even though I was extremely disappointed with the abrupt ending.
But more than anything - in my opinion - it shows how, even though the USSR clearly betrayed its ideals, Joan maintains hers.
It was just so unseemly that Allison McKenzie and Little Norman Page were under suspicion of skinny dipping even though they did no such thing.
I love movie's that include vintage war planes in the plot, and this is no exception- even though the ME-109 and Japanese Zero were substituted by a repainted P-51B and a T-6 Texan.
Great obscure little made for TV movie, something like a hybrid between "The Thing" and "The Shining" (even though that movie was still several years away from being made).
Leonardo DeCaprio played a convincing tough guy even though he is skinnier than most of the girls I've dated.
In amongst this diversion there's something of a plot hole since Bill takes the young Amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is .
You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you don't need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.
Joe, Drew's roommate, willingly puts up with being denied access to his room every time there is a `sock on the doorknob' and the two boys are actually good friends even though Joe is the polar opposite of Drew.
Tightly plotted (there's always something happening, but the complications never get too confusing) and smoothly directed, it's a movie that knows how to keep you absorbed, even though its nihilistic ending is slightly cliched.
It proudly carries on the tradition started by Forbidden Planet and This Island Earth, even though its not as exciting.
Incredibly enough the majority of characters in the story are clueless about what the internet is or how it operates even though the story seemingly takes place in 2006 (strike two).
But that's a lot of the fun with his films, even though his newest is easily the most structured of the bunch.
It was very entertaining, fast-moving and the best of the Fields movies, I think, even though Edgar and Charlie steal the show.
Don't expect too many visual effects here : the suspense is intensely psychological and the cast does deliver, even though the screenplay sometimes doesn't (to be honest, the story is not always clear).
I thought that was beautiful because even though Rosie was the maid, her and Aurora were like family and when Aurora was carrying Rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life, that was truly beautiful.
If you intend to purchase or rent this film be warned that even though it will be in the horror section and the title, box art and description on the box will lead you to belive it is a horror movie, IT IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE.
He is very blatant in his attempts to put the moves on her even though she has a boyfriend.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
The scenes with Jean-Claude Van Dame is beautiful, even though this actor is sometimes laugh at, he appears as an angel in this film.
I will admit though that the avalanche scene is quite well done even though it steals footage from the film Avalanche (1999) so I can't give it that much credit since the best sequence in the film was at least in part stolen from another film.
The Seminoles look great even though they did not look like that in 1840.
Unlike the Ringu and Ring 2 this has a slower pace even though the movie was short it felt long because of the pacing.
Eddie Sparks is a complex part and Caan mastered all the subtleties even though he's not my idea of a song and dance man.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
I don't recommend this film to anyone... even though it is beautifully filmed and at the highest quality... you have to have the stomach to watch it.
So did I - even though I had to look up a couple of period references.
I am admittedly not fond of the dubbing, even though it's a lot better than some I've heard.
She's claims that she's doing her father's will even though her father gave his life to maintain peace for the colonies and earth.
Anne Hathaway is a great movie star, because she can play the buddy thing... i mean to say that she is not trying to take over the movie, even though she could, and i loved that.
I thought 27 Dresses had a pretty good plot, even though it was way way way predictable, the characters were likable and different.
The story isn't the most clever or ingenious ones, at least not when being compared to the best and most memorable Columbo movies but it's a story that doesn't bore and still provides plenty of surprises and entertainment, even though this movie doesn't feature as much comical relief as was the case in some other Columbo movies, which in my opinion is a positive thing.
This is the first vampire film to show a bat to vampiric man transformation and has good performances even though Lou Chaney Jr. isn't too bad as a vampire as much as he is as The Wolf Man, it's not as excellent as the first one but it's a great sequel.
There's one particular citizen played by Julie Warner who wants to offer the ultimate in hospitality even though her ever present steady boyfriend Woody Harrelson is around.
In the french one there are a lot more stuns than in the American version of Taxi even though the American version had a lot more funds.
The film imagines Washington D.C. 50 years from now, and that very prediction of our lifestyle is ambitious indeed; cars which drive themselves, home appliances which operate on voice command, holograms and highways which even run vertically Â the most wild and imaginative concepts are placed together into one single movie, and even though it eventually builds to disappointing level of cynicism and implausibility, it's still wonderful to look at and experience.
This 1954 film was clearly a vehicle for an aging Barbara Stanwyck, even though the woman in the story must have been in her twenties.
Louise, in the beginnings of her confusion, isn't sure which), Louise decides to marry the lonely widower even though she tells him she's not in love with him and even though his daughter Carol (played so well by Gerladine Brooks) dislikes her intensely.
i have watched this film several years back and when i finally landed in a place where there are millions of ofws, i felt compelled to write a review of it even though i believe no one would even bother reading it.
I would like to say at the outset that even though I was disappointed that Cynthia Rothrock doesn't do more of her martial arts stuff in this film and I did think it a bit preposterous how indestructible Dakota Smith, played by Fred Williamson, appears to be, I enjoyed NIGHT VISION and am glad that it is a part of my DVD collection.
You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given.
There's not much of a background to the witch Misa in this story, as she's pretty much thrown right into this one and we got to accept it, even though this vagueness could frustrate.
Everyone who thinks Little Britain sucks, have no sense of humour/ humor, and can't accept that Little Britain is funny even though it's not from the USA!!!
Electric Shadows has a bit of everything, even though some might like to compare it to Cinema Paradiso, I thought that this film had merits to stand on its own two feet despite the obvious comparison.
Against this backdrop, Ling Ling leads quite an eventful life, where the pace catapults with the introduction of Mao Xiaobing (Wang Zhengjia), a scruffy kid from out of town whose mischievousness brings trouble, but for their love of movies which brought them together to be best frien uds forever, even though he prefers the action genre where he can make-belief he's the star of the show.
I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did.
He tries to provoke Sandler in some kind of pseudo mental health treatment but how is it that Sandler follows his advice even though he knows pretty early on that he is dealing with a nutball.
I saw this movie in the theater with my father and I have to say even though Sandler can annoy me most of the time, this is one of his better comedies.
As soon as I heard it, I hearkened back to my childhood watching those old Warner Brothers cartoons, and even though I can't remember which one it was, I can clearly hear in my mind the words "Which way did he go George, which way did he go?"
He made a promise to do that, and, by golly, he's going to stick with it, even though he has to live with the often dire results.
She even tries her 'charms' on Lenny and even though George warned him to stay away.
Aladdin, even though he lives in the palace, still cannot dress respectibly for most of the film and is still chased by Razoul.
Anyway, Genie returns from his trip and brings back the laughs (even though he is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, even in "Kingdom Hearts", he is still funny).
They get attacked (including Genie, disguised as Aladdin LOL), and just when things get hopeless, Iago grabs Jafar's lamp, and even though he's hurt by Jafar, he lets go of the lamp, which falls into the lava, destroying Jafar for good.
Aladdin and Jasmine are not married in this film, (even though they married at the end of the first movie) and the only really memorable scene is a brief goof, where the Sultan loses his eyebrows for a split second.
As rare as it is, Disney will have good sequels that will come out and one of those is Return of Jafar, even though this one you can tell the animation isn't as great as the original and Robin Williams skipped out on this one, I still really enjoyed this Disney sequel.
It's about Irish-Catholic violence in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays this theme more powerfully).
The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture.
I could not really find a plot in this movie (even though I was forced to watch it twice).
His extendedly depicted agony is still horrifying, even though the make-up effects are cheap and very cheesy.
Julie London and Joanne Dru are also effective in somewhat understated roles, even though important to the story.
It's interesting that even though Randolph Scott makes the obligatory declaration that, despite being on an island alone with Irene Dunne for 7 years, nothing happened, Dunne never validates this.
It's a well written story that offers plenty of surprises with its moments and main plot-line, even though of course the movie in a sense is mostly predictable, just like any other genre movie.
People commenting on this list seem eager to use "worst movie of all time" to describe anything they happen to dislike, but I hesitate to use the phrase here, even though I am sorely tempted.
Though not as extravagantly dressed as Crawford, the other actors always look like they're ready for an elegant dinner party, even though they never seem to leave the house.
I prefer the first one, even though I like Henrikson as an actor.
There's some decent gore here, there's some really cool looking rotting zombies, there are decapitated heads & severed limbs, the main villain like to rip peoples heads in half, someone chest bursts open, someone saws their own legs & hand off & there are also various other minor bits of blood & gore throughout although the murder of Luis seemed cut as there are noticeable jumps in the audio & too many 'reaction' shots of Teresa & Dan even though seemingly nothing has happened.
That said, even though a lot of people have totally slated this movie for other aspects of it, I have to say that I still really enjoyed this as a movie!
I guess it's like a gruesome car-crash where you cannot divert your eyes away even though you should.
Sure thereÂ´s been recently a fuss over mexican cinema, and even though there are some excellent films like Amores perros or Y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n, this one has nothing to do side to side with them.
Unlike other teen movies this one seem to show everyone's side of high school life, even though the two main character's are "outcast" they're not really nerds.
The story itself goes more in depth, even though of course lots of things are still left unexplained, like in this type of movies almost always is the case.
An effective thriller, even though it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Yukie deserves high accolades for this movie, and even though she never won an award for it, she won one from me.
It's difficult to find a purely entertaining movie that not only has no flaws whatsoever, but whose virtues are almost consistently wonderful, but InnerSpace might be the one; Dennis Quaid never quite made it as a big A-list star, but here's he wonderfully likable, despite of (actually, maybe because of) his cockiness and smart attitude, and he manages to register a consistent strong presence throughout the film, even though he spends most of the time trapped in his tiny ship, thanks to his performance and his excellent chemistry with Martin Short, who never quite hit the jackpot in another film quite the way he does here.
During two hours you can enjoy lovely Joseph (with Donny Osmond, of course), clever Variations (very artistically played by Julian Lloyd Webber), dramatic Evita (only Paige's unique voice can reveal full splendor of Don't cry for me Argentina, and Antonio Banderas is the best Che ever), dynamic Starlight Express, solemn Requiem, passionate Jesus Christ Superstar (even though this musical is not among my favourite Webber's works I couldn't but admire Michael Ball singing Gethsemane), beautiful and mysterious The Phantom of the Opera with exquisite Sarah Brightman as Christine and Banderas proving that he can act Eric (AND HE CAN!
Now even though the terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE computer graphics bothered me, the plot of this movie is even worse.
They play off each other very well & even though Sellick used this as a springboard for his entire career, Hillerman is most often remembered for this show.
The lead (Yukie Nakama as a shy Sadako) is very good, even though it's obvious she's a Japanese version of Carrie White; misunderstood, creepy and with gifts she never wanted.
And I said that no matter what I have to see some of his movies even though their titles gave me quite a clear idea what they were all about and the total of 187 and growing number of movies meant that they were a very sloppy job.
I am a fan of Wes Anderson, even though his movies generally leave me with a feeling of numbness on first viewing, and a sense of uncertainty as to whether or not I thought the film was any good from a plot and character standpoint.
Strange and mildly bloody Belgian-French-Dutch horror comedy romp that was distributed by Troma Pictures has black comedy and some gore even though some of the gore was heavily cut out to avoid an "X" rating here in America.
Pretty stirring in places, with some good live music thrown in, MM is an excellent orator - let's just hope he never becomes a politician - even though he's got the chops for it - because he is the living proof that to hope is to be an American.
I was about to go to sleep as it was about 00-40 in the morning and I flicked over to the movie and even though I was falling asleep as I flicked over to it, within five minutes I was wide awake and totally captivated.
even though you will certainly be immersed the entire way through.
Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk.
Charles Grodin does a performance of a lifetime as Lenny.Same thing with Jeannie Berlin as Lila, who's Elaine May's daughter.Cybill Shepherd portrays Kelly Corcoran in a memorable way.And so does Eddie Albert as her father.Audra Lindley is wonderful as her mother.Doris Roberts does a small role as Mrs.Cantrow.Grodin's character is somewhat likable even though he acts like a real jerk.You can't help but feel sorry for this man.I mean, this gorgeous college girl wants him!
But the way the film progresses from one brilliantly written scene to another, we can't wait to see what will transpire next, and we somehow end up caring so much for everyone in the film (even though they often don't care all that much for each other!)
While the story is a bit convoluted about her actual prison record, she is sentenced to 5 years, even though I doubt this would occur, as she had minor non-violent crime (apparently).
even though this contains a spoiler alert I can't bring myself to describe the ending - you simply must see it.
Both fall in love and spend all their time together--even though their love is fated to end before its time.
I saw this Fellini film on TV, in pan and scan, and even though SATYRICON has to be seen on widescreen format, the cropped version was still mighty impressive to look at.
The film even though long moves well with it's journey of drama and life discovery for Benjamin as it's memorable for his working and making a living on a tugboat.
There's a sadness to this story, especially near the end but overall, even though it's central theme seems to be "death," I don't think it's a depressing film.
But, this movie is just not funny; even though the script keeps telling you how side-splitting it is, and how you're enjoying it more than you did "Animal House" or "Porky's".
If you're the average IMDB reader, you probably enjoy a good action movie every now and then, but you approach action films with a certain caution and skepticism (I can't blame you, even though I am an action junkie myself).
She's first billed in this picture even though the film is really about Mitchum.
It's almost frustrating, seeing everyone chase after Robert Mitchum even though the man has nothing wrong!
There are a number of plot points that must be gotten through and which are better indicated in Frances Marion's script than in the 1937 version ... even though some points seem to be skipped over, they are butchered worse in the sound version.
I enjoyed watching Tick Tock even though it has some flaws, the ending being the major one.
It was pointed out on this thread, in another review, that the film seems like a "B" feature, even though Sterling Hayden plays the sheriff, and James Gleason plays a retired Secret Service Agent.
The worse part of the show are the birthday girls, if the slight possibility of the party being too expensive and it having to be made cheaper arises, even though it is still 10 times more than most people could afford, they cry a bloody river until they get their way.
They should start showing normal families who maybe only have a few thousand dollars saved up for their kid's sweet 16, and how even though they had a limited budget, it was still a night to remember.
It's a real shame, because these kids are very ungrateful, even though their family has more money than just about most other families in the entire world.
James Franciscus was likable as the police chief even though he was copying Roy Scheider's character.
And like I said, even thought the initial thirty minutes is also mimicking Spielberg's film, it did have a kind of respectful sweetness and was kind of fun.
The shark itself is an engaging creation, even though it's over-the-top gigantic and a little too robotic-looking when it pops out of the water.
The film only features three performers, but it never gets boring even though the film runs for over 110 minutes.
Not saying they weren't nuts before, but I'm guessing father wouldn't have approved of everything they're now doing....even though father was a murderer.
THe location of the movie offered great colors and excellent views even though i still don't know where it was filmed!!!
Overall even though I might have expected a little too much from "Steel Trap" it nevertheless is pretty mediocre, so would I truly recommend it?
If you really want to see a good movie staring Denise Richards, see "Starship Troopers" or "The World Is Not Enough" (even though most people didn't like her in the latter).
As far as (1) goes, even though it seems pretty obvious to me why ID shouldn't be taught in science class, the film doesn't do much to explain why it's so obvious.
Overall, it was unbearable to watch even though the runtime is only 70 minutes.
Try some Leguizamo or catch some "slam jam" poetry or old "Robin" (or new "Old Robin") and don't worry, we won't tell your mom that you laughed your _ _ _- off even though "that language" was used.
Thinking about the loss of Richard Pryor makes me want to cry because i feel like he was someone i knew personally,thats the effect Richard Pryor had on everyone that watched him pro-form on stage,he broke the color line,even thought he is clearly a African American man,Richard Pryor made people of other races so comfortable listening to jokes revolving around race and social status.
There's another classic cameo by Begum Para who binds her granddaughter Sakina to herself, with a safety-pin whenever she sleeps and watches Mughal-e-Azam even though she's almost blind.
He rents an apartment above O's to observe him and rents his favorite films from the neighborhood video rental store even though he doesn't own a VCR.
Needless to say, when the entire top of a building blows up, you can expect that Ms. Porcupine did not even get singed even though she was standing about a foot away from the Giant Spider.
this movie is full of action and suspense from the beggining, it has special effects like you expect to see in big blockbuster hits and even though the acting is a little on the over the top side its made up for by the brilliant gore and spider special effects.
He freely ad-libs dialogue between the songs & appears to be enjoying himself immensely - even though the restrictions of the microphone and the static camera require him to keep still & not move about.
The movie could have been executed better even though a novel idea.
It's determined that Houghland was murdered, even though there wasn't a mark on him, and the police are called in and seal off the mansion where this TV demonstration was taking place to prevent the murderer from escaping.
This is a nice little horror/mystery, even though a little short at under an hour.
Ahead of it's time, even though very dated now, "Knock on any Door" gets into the background of it's accused killer like a scalpel used by a neurosurgeon goes into the brain of his patient.
And the third shows us that there is hope even though those who provide it -- especially one nun -- has to turn her back on God to save his children.
Therefore when she gets a chance to go to another school to coach football she grabs it, even though the players are less than refined and practically stink at the game.
He looks like he was only 38 even though, at the time, he was actually 68!
Okay, the film gets a 3 even though it's duller than dust because back in 1898, ALL the films were duller than dust--having NOT AN OUNCE OF PLOT--consisting of people doing mundane stuff that thrilled audiences at the time but would hopelessly bore people today because films are so omnipresent.
When I was a teen, there was a moment when I "got it" that the Japanese people and their culture were worthy of respect, even though the Japanese "think weird."
Notice that Dean Cain's hairstyle as Superman is swept back just as George Reeve's was, even though the character never wore it that way in the comics.
It was a great rumble match as usual, a bit better then last year, mostly because i was so shocked Mysterio won, even though there were rumours he would, i didn't believe it, then when he was left with Orton i was sure Orton would win, but it was Rey!
6/10 Once again i was quite at surprise with the result, even though there were rumours Cena would win it back so soon, i just couldn't see it happening.
Really now, and did anyone notice that security was so tight, even though Levy's character had a police badge that he couldn't get it, but Jane got in no problem and the security lifted her right on to the stage?
During the bizarre chase, Jane accepts a ride from the limo driver because she can't wait 3 hours for the next train, even though she has more than 6 hours to get to her speech.
Tanguy made me laugh even though my understanding of French is far from perfect.
In real life Will could not say no when Amira is begging him because (1) he does want to help the boy, (2) she still has the power to embarrass Will and his wife even though she has given him the incriminating photo negatives, (3) it is totally out of character for him to suddenly care so much about the affair coming out, and (4) he immediately confesses it to his wife anyway.
And that is exactly what Breaking and Entering is, and this time around I truly enjoyed the film even though it's far from being great.
Against any common sense, I decided to watch another family comedy starring Eddie Murphy.On my defense, I had two excuses to do that.The first one is that Imagine That is co-written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, responsibles for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and its sequel.The second excuse is my continuous apology for Murphy, who I keep considering to be a great comedian, even though he keeps wasting his talent on atrocities like Norbit and Daddy Day Care.Well, unfortunately, Imagine That is another atrocity in his career.
Filmed on location during West Hollywood's annual gay Halloween parade, this gives the film a freaky feeling of even though you are surrounded by lots of people, you are still very much alone when a crazed psychopath is on the loose!!
The music was fantastic and I wish there was a soundtrack.I have never heard of most of the artists but like their music.I really like how it has a Halloween theme.The costumes were outrageous and the party blew me away and looked like a lot of fun.This is a nice alternative to watching Halloween on Halloween night(even though i'm a huge fan of J.Carpenter's film)because it gives you a choice between them.Of course I will watch them both personally.
He dies, thank God, and then, (even though when she said "There's a giant crocodile behind you!
Ladies, don't turn off the TV too quickly; even though the beginning may appear to be a "guy flick", this is a very moving film.
I've seen many documentries on Vlad Dracula, and even though this movie hits on some real points in the impailer's life I think it is more of a prequil to 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" because it focuses on the love story between him and his queen almost mirroring in 90min the short prologue of Dracula '92.
When I saw it I then watched "Bram Stoker's Dracula" skiping the prologue and it worked well as one movie even though the filming style is different.
The casting was good, everyone played their character well (mostly), except I sort of agree with the other reviewer when they said that you really don't 'dislike' the father, even though his acts can sometimes be inappropriate.
Chaney's performance, and maybe our instinctive support of the underdog, has the odd effect of making you hope that he wins in the end, even though he's a murderer and he plots to have Malabar's arms ripped from his body by horses.
But he's the one who ends up coming out ahead, even though he never quite knows what is going on.
Plot is very simple, Amitabh is a cop who believes in the constitution of India even though his son Armaan was killed by terrorist.
I consider Phantasm IV to be a little better than the disappointing (but still good) third entry of the series, but my issue with this one is that even though you are entertained throughout and your eyes will probably be glued to the screen, nothing really happens when you think about it.
Terence Fisher's direction is solid and efficient and he handles the film's most awkward moment, the attempted rape scene, with considerable bravery even though an understandable element of reticence, discernible also in a similar moment in Fisher's 'Frankenstein Must be Destroyed' (1969), is apparent, but works well in what I would argue is a surprisingly non misogynistic movie.
The Northern island of Fara is experiencing very warm temperatures even though it is the middle of Winter while the rest of the UK is seeing the usual Winter weather.
I couldn't help but notice that Cushing's character keeps his suit and jacket on even though it suppose to be about 100 degrees!
While we Americans(I say we, since I'm American even though I'm landed in Canada) tend to think of Monty Python when we think of British humor, there's also a satirical type of humor that seems to be unique to Britain.
The cast is excellent, with a great merit of young LÃ¡zaro Ramos, performing a character that has everything to lead to exageration or to a ridiculous acting; even though, LÃ¡zaro manages to bring to life in a realistic way someone who is a homosexual with feminine behaviour in some times and in other times is a scary fighter, who could deal with 3 or 4 opponents bare handed.
We can understand why Francisco,later called "Madame SatÃ£" lived that way (even though we may not agree with it) , having in one hand the fascination for a fairy tale world of fantasy, with songs in French and taking care of a baby and in the other hand dealt with streetfights, robbery and eventual imprisonments in jail.
... even though many people complain that the role should have gone to Cagney.
Woody Allen here remembers his childhood, and his narration is involving, funny and moving at the same time, making you say "past times were better", even though you've never been there.
But something tells me that in this politically correct era in which we live, that would have been unthinkable --even though al-Qaeda would cheerfully wipe us off the map with any weapon they could field.
The Belgian as well as the Dutch actors all did a very good job, even though I never expected to see some of them in this kind of movie (for instance Kurt Rogiers an Peter Van den Begin).
Again, even though there is a lot more heavier stuff coming from Hollywood, for dutch standards, its pretty wild.
It's also nowhere near being Hitch's best silent film, even though it tends to be remembered over more polished works like The Ring and The Manxman.
Zhang Yimou is always about politics, even though the politics are sometimes "just" domestic politics, as in Raise the Red Lantern.
Best of all, even though were in 2006 I don't feel this film is out of date even though it's set in 1985.
They soon meet again, when Barrymore is making plans for her own wedding (to a total jerk), even though deep inside she feels that she's "settling" for security without true love.
I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next, but even though it's a predictable ride; trust me, it's a ride you want to be on.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
Bruce Willis does what he does best; that is to say, he's annoying to the point where I was hoping someone would kill him and put us all out of our misery, even though I thoroughly enjoyed his character when he wasn't being mean to his wife.
After Jimmy's funeral it seems that Joyce never returns to the beauty shop that she owns and Cynthia and Cookie never work another day in their lives, even though all three women depend on the income from their jobs.
For example, near the end Colbert marries George Reeves (yes, Superman) even though she admits she knows almost nothing about the man!!.
Uma desperately wants to have a man and goes home with one and is instantly crazy about him even though he treats her as what she was - a one night stand.
I've watched this film twice and even though the I knew what was going to happen, seeing it a second time was just as heart-wrenching and touching.
The bad: The writing is horrible even though I can safely say that the source material that provided it was fairly entertaining.
Unfortunately, these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity, even though many of them mean no harm.
It was never really the story telling that made it classic even though it was good.
Thanks to his uncanny use with an assassin's gun(..there was a reason why he didn't have a gun on his person even though he is a skilled marksman), Smith evades his pursuers sending a great many villains to early graves(..or, as chief businessman Hammerson, played by a scarily skinny Stephen McHattie, would say, a "dirt nap").
My cousins and I almost didn't get to see it because the nim-witted box office staff decided ticket stubs would be needed to get into the theater even though we had Shoot 'Em Up passes directly from New Line Cinema reps. Because ticket stub holder got in first, we ended up sitting in the top seats of the theater, which turned out to be a blessing.
His character is the most complex in the film; and even though his actions are extreme, they are justified and Steiger manages to make the role believable; which is testament to his acting talent.
The performances are brave and heartfelt in all cases, and even though the drama takes place over one weekend, the characters really do evolve.
2) For some reason, John Connor was (a) unable to trust a terminator even though he found out in part 2 that they can be trusted if programmed correctly and (b) totally stunned to find out that a terminator had flesh and blood and organs, even though that's the first type he ever encountered.
Delpy's wonderful touch with these delicate moments makes the movie a winner, even though the ending feels like it could have gone either way and probably came off the editing room floor.
Neil manages to ooze sex and allure even though he is just trying to ease the pain of his past by embracing it and letting it control who he is.
I enjoyed all the performances and believed the characters, even though I had seen all the actors before on TV.
He ruins what could have been a decent relationship with his boss(played by Anne Marie Johnson) to be a pig and is constantly running back to that gold-digging self-centered trollop Monica, even though her love for him was only on a financial level.
The acting is atrocious; the music is lousy even though it is Grieg.
maybe it is because this meeting even though it is for some hours is more important than the rest of the every days.
The best part of this movie is that even though they had all the eye candy that every independent film should have, they had a good moral to the story.
I love the scenery and even though it was not filmed in the USA it could have been.
Although I think it will most appeal to film buffs, there is no denying the thing has power, even though that power has become somewhat obscured by the passing years.
And even though her beauty is far from conventional, it is truly undeniable.
We are used to seeing this now; (think Altman, in particular) where characters are all somehow connected, even though they may not even know each other.
He teams up with Crawford, enjoys a dance with her and falls for her even though she's much too young.
He seemed inexplicably convinced that the wheel of the "Friday" series needed to be drastically reinvented, even though fans had lined up for basically the same plot eight times prior.
Very good overall, but Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin is better (even though it has an awkward title) if you're looking for something from this era.
This is a rare treat (even though we only see browns, reds and blues and even though the water is sometimes red, sometimes blue) and along with the original score re-recorded and 19 minutes of outtakes following the 90 minute feature, it is somewhat of an event.
All this having been said, it was astonishing to me that this film tells us almost nothing about Holmes' professional life, even though he spent over 30 years as a Supreme Court Associate Justice.
The plot jumped around non-stop, and it was practically impossible to follow, even though it was incredibly simplistic.
I have alway envisioned Snapphanar as the ultimate freedom-fighters even though I'm a Swede to the death.
The historical angle (even though a bit resculpted) works fine, but the dialog is absolutely horrible.
The camera work are very good, the mis-en-scene works fine as well even though the budget was low.
A number of things quickly drew me in, even though they do not directly have an impact on the quality of Route 666.
Ironically he has to even sell the pelts to raise funds even though this is an illegal act.
I tried to watch this piece of trash late one night, and even though I have a profound phobia about alien abduction (no, I'm not lying) I didn't think this was scary and I didn't think it was suspenseful.
She is totally believable even though we never even see her take an acting class, much less see her waiting tables to help herself.
Oddly, the trial drags on for many days even though there are no witnesses.
There's this odd sub-plot about some guy who has to copy a disk for some reason but we never find out why even though he knocks the cleaner out so he isn't seen & it seems to be quite important to him, the disk or it's contents are never followed up or even mentioned again.
Sorcha Cusack conveys Jane's determination and intelligence very well, even though she looks too old for the part, and Michael Jayston is the best Rochester ever.
Rochester is most aptly portrayed herein, even though I love Ciaran Hinds!
Now, even though these are legitimate researchers, Green Peace has an agenda and they want complete protection of the environment.
The supernatural phenomenon seems to have passed her by even though she's Mexican.
I lived in California for 23 years and having Mexican people around is a way of life, they're just other people, they have lives and feelings and YES they do a hell of a lot of the work, so I get the idea behind this film, very well, even though that a lot of the work that is portrayed is work that no one else will do.
People literally die even though they've only had nails fired into their arms or legs.
It was originally written by a French playwriter way back in the late 1960's..............no mention of him at all,........ even though the American version(Birdcage) and the Italo-French version are identical even in the dialogue !
It is so well done I was glued to the set even though all they show are clips and the remaining scenes to Lee's last movie: "Game of Death."
I have seen both sound and silent versions of this movie and I actually prefer the silent one--even though it was based on a musical!
I immediately liked it even though it was a bit bleak.
Looking back at this film feels like looking back towards the end of a very long tunnel - even though it was made as late as '92.
This movie is really cool even though there are to much early 90's reminders in it.
I even thought maybe he's hallucinating or something.
Well even though some of these sorority girls *are* big snobs, more concerned with how much money a girl's family has than her character - our Alice still HOPES she will be invited to join one of these sororities.
even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear.
When husband and wife decide to split, the only ones who get hurt are the children, and even though Joan and Bernard Berkman are in the center of their nasty divorce, their two sons -- Frank and Walt -- are the ones going through the trauma.
Every member of the family is brilliantly brought to life and even though they are acting in their own flawed, selfish, self-annihilating and myopic ways, they still endear themselves to the audience like they are our own family.
The isn't exactly for children either even though it looks like it.
The film is dedicated to the lives lost at Columbine even though we barely spend any time thinking about it and we don't even seem to care about Lauren until the film is more than half over.
Although far too soft in its final scenes, this debut movie for director Herbert Ross changes speeds enough to keep things bubbling, even though his bumpy rhythm may put some viewers off.
The ending veers sharply away from comedy into deep melodramatic territory, and even though it is diffused quite handily, the film almost drowns in TV-movie-of-the-week sap before the mood lightens again.
But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved (even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice) and got let-off with minor sentences, none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did.
But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.
It's not just the actors, but Gene and William's characters, I wanted to be just like them, they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.
But the movie insists that the white one is actually an albino negro, even though Sunshine, who is played by the amazing Chris Robinson, is so obviously a white man.
But it seems to be just a flash of light, even though the makers insist there was nothing that could produce that light!
She started off liking her second housekeeper Mrs Dimmick, even thought she would make a good companion as well as a good housekeeper, but soon found out that Mrs Dimmick was crossing her by trying to find out information about the former maid.
It is interesting that a number of films set during the 1900s and early 1910s, both comedies such as 'The Assassination Bureau' and serious dramas such as 'The Riddle of the Sands' and the Robert Powell version of 'The 39 Steps', focus on diplomatic attempts to prevent the outbreak of a European war, even though we know that in real life such attempts were to end in failure.
even though lame-os will whine about the name not making any sense, that's part of why it's so awesome.
Clarkson plays the housewife who still has a job even though she could easily live off of her husband's wealth, and she's not as clueless as many other movie housewives are.
The film also leaves a few questions open-ended even though doing so serves no purpose.
I really liked Grendel's mother, I must admit, even though creative license took her far beyond the original character in the poem.
Nick is a store security guard who sees Emily stealing and lets her get away with it because he's inexplicably captivated by her, even though he's actually prettier than she is.
Getting sent to prison for having a second baby even though the first one died?
Fortress was his first entry to non-horror oriented field, even though Fortress still has many horror elements, too.
These issues are over population and alarming/scary development of technology, and even though the film is not too deep or philosophical, it has these aspects of commentary about society and our everyday world, and what it should not be.
The acting is very good, even though I haven't heard of them apart from Lambert.
For my generation, this was fun for its time - even though re-watching it NOW, as an adult...I can see what my parents were talking about.
Rocky also falls in love with a blind girl who even though she is blind,she loves rocky for who he is.
At first he's just a confused foreigner who knows nothing about America, but then we discover that, even though he is, he's also a smart, happy guy who just loves being who he is.
I hate how they canceled the show right at that point, it drives me nuts thinking about it.I wish they had of even starting filming the 3 series with those actors now, even though most of them are in their thirties and a few of the older actors are dead, but it would still be interesting.
The first time it almost frustrated me too much for an immediate response, even though I did like certain parts.
I'm a New Zealander, and even though I have a fairly good handle on my country's history, I found what I watched to be quite believable.
Even the tone of the film isn't actually very funny, even thought there are some things in it that are so absurd, that they make you laugh.
even though it was made many years ago, it stands up as a great film, wonderfully acted and directed.
I found this movie quite interesting, even though I'm not Swedish and I don't know a lot about Swedish politics.
All in all an interesting treatment of an ancient theme, but not one of Bunuel's best, even though it was his last at age 77.
So why does Flags of our Fathers still get 3 Â½ stars even though the comments seem so negative?
The three men did not believe they were heroes, even though the American public did.
Clint Eastwood directed the film, and he didn't pull any punches in the battle scenes, even though the battle for Iwo Jima was considered one of the bloodiest against the Japanese in the Pacific.
As I said, the plot is really not the core of the film, even though it was written by Luc Besson.
Those two fights in particular even though they are choreographed, look very REAL and are as hardcore as they come!
I like this setting even though it has been used before.
I watch it every time it's on tv even though I own it on video.
If you're a fan of British humor, you should definitely enjoy this one, even though it may take more than one viewing to catch all the subtleties.
The special effects are weak, actually, even though this movie falsely raises the impression of being gory and trashy.
With the existing technologies it could have been done better, but after all I can only conclude that, even though it is "only" TV, this series doesn't disenchant and its main merit is probably the the fact that Bulgakov now found a much bigger audience than he ever could have had with his books.
It might be good if you're about 11 years old, even though I doubt it.
Its not an issue of "accuracy" (even though an acquaintances mother who is a teacher of literature in Russia and read this 20 times cover to cover was very satisfied) it is an issue of originality.
Journey to Mars is a great TV-movie, even though it has quite a few scientific errors (as how they conquered the speed of light - which is necessary to send instant transmition from Earth to Mars - which takes 4 hours each way with today's radio-technology - maybe they use some kind of Tachyon-beams?
Jeff Bridges also comes up a winner as Tucker even though he does not have a golden statuette to prove it.
Boy, what a frustrating film to watch....even though it is very good and has been a part of my collection for a number of years now.
If you are a fan of William Hellfire, Joey Smack, Misty Mundae, or E.I./Alternative Cinema (even though this isnt an e.i.
Brian Blessed's Augustus is comic relief, but one that carries a big stick even though his wife is paving the way.
Then the mockumentary melts away into a horror movie where you *think* you know exactly what's going to happen even though every time you think you know what's going to happen you're wrong, then every time you guess and you're still wrong.
Hey one thing I couldn't knock though, even though it looks cheap however the CGI was competently executed and never overdone in any way.
I had to keep watching this movie, even though some of the acting was cringe worthy.
So everyone is not naked, and no one uses four letter words, and the lead heroine is a virgin even though she is engaged - to the wrong guy of course.
Hey Flash the princess is here, shes got a gun and can recognize the I-mex immediately, even though its disguised and she doesn't know what a TV remote is or what the I-mex looks like.
There is not a single unfunny moment from the beginning to the end, even though the last act gets serious and suspenseful.
I may have even thought it was funnier and more exciting this time around than when I first watched the film as a teen.
They had trouble following the story, even though they have been dissecting Sophocles' words for weeks.
And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature.
To get the money fast, she signs up with a shady wrestling organization (even though she was courted by a rival promoter).
The dopey premise isn't quite played to it's campy potential..in fact the direction is rather subdued(..as are the cast, even though there are some emotional fireworks as the bickering between family members gets sometimes heated) though the kills themselves are often quite laughable.
Director George McCowan, cinematographer Mario Tosi, and editor Fred R Feitshans Jr make sure to establish the presence of frogs, even though they are merely ribbeting and hopping around, en masse, aggravating those attending Milland's gettogether.
So, even though they're simple frogs they look a bit ominous!
Demi Moore as Marina is in earnest even though she gets off to a wrong start by marrying a man she "thinks" is the right one, but her feelings aren't based on solid ground as it turns out.
The film has a few problems, its slight and a bit tricky to care about proceedings, it could have done with more havoc, more personality and more of the monster bringing death to individuals, preferably by eating, since the radiation effect looks a little weak in practice even though the burn effects are good.
But as I already said before, even though I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies or of the man's work, I must say that I'm glad to make an exception when it comes to this movie.
In 1996, Carpenter also made "Escape from L.A." and even though it's good entertainment, it can't compete with "NY".
It is interesting to see people's real personalities come out among strangers--sometimes people are sneaky, other times they are very noble and allow others to stay on and compete against them even though they pose a greater threat.
The delivery and execution of classic lines are very good, and even though you know exactly what to expect, they still make you smile when they are delivered.
Niller and his very edgy and controlling wife are in the process of adopting a little african girl, when Niller meets the kitchen craving Sus (played with a lot of spirit by actress Sidse Babette Knudsen), a woman who is very hard to forget just like that---even though she has this hip italian boy friend.
Sure Sandler still plays a goof ball with a annoying voice but "Happy Gilmore" makes me laugh even though it doesn't force me to do so.
After Christopher McDonald says "Yeah Right, and Grizzley Adams had a beard", after he walks away the screen goes to the green where all the people are and the car that hits Happy Gilmore later is already crashed even though the seen has not happened yet.
At what cost you may sayÂ Well, lucky for us, both Fallon and Veil seem to love the art of horror and even though this is not a horror film per se, the images portrayed definitely feel horrific in mood and for such a limited budget, really shine here.
If I bought this movie, I would've thrown it away feeling so sorry that I bought it, avoid this at cost and look for better inspirational movie like Matilda even though it might be a little overrated and silly but still worth watching.
It was a good choice to make this movie in English, rather than Danish, and the result is an excellent drama which will apply to most people even though they, like me, may not be much for that sort of movies.
But Alice does not waiver in her love for Harbour, and even though they /can/ hurt him, neither she nor Wilbur is willing to go that far.
This was not that type of movie and I am upset that it was on this station even though it is one of the most horrifying movies out there.
As obvious as the storyline was, and as overwrought the acting was, I was sucked in nonetheless, to see how it ended, even though you could see it coming from miles and miles away.
It certainly seemed uncut, even though it wasn't.
Originally a play by Spike Milligan, I have a feeling that on paper the movie would seem hilarious and though a couple of scenes translate well (the tube train that keeps running even though no one needs it and the wedding) most of the skits fall flat.
Watched it recently, and still laughed out loud, even though nuclear annihilation is not much of a hot topic.
The script is amazing, and even though it may really be too over the top once in a while, it doesn't distract from the overall picture.
From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over.
I rented this at blockbuster because it had professional looking packaging and even though I figured it was a "B" grade horror movie, I at least thought it was done professionally.
(For example, he did come to Willie's aid when he was thrown out of the party by the bigots, even though it meant giving up a chance with one of the few women in the movie who didn't flat out ignore his come-ons.)
As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, provides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much center stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs.
In general, the serious episodes of the show are rated much higher than the comedic episodes--even though I think that the occasionally funny episodes are a great relief from a constant barrage of overly serious themes.
Just saw this "classic" on AMC and even though it's very hard to make me laugh, there are 2 EXTREMELY funny lines (won't spoil them for you) regarding things that are written in letters penned by the Carole Lombard character.
The lovable Lombard makes Hazel a sublime comic creation even though the character is basically a selfish charlatan.
If this sort of thing, even though MEANT to show hypocricy, bothers you, skip this one, I mean it.
In this respect, the film doesn't "preach" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.
You will like this movie if you are open minded, or dealing with sexuality in itself - for me this movie provided a sense of homage, to know that I'm not alone, even though I know I"m not but this is a step for diverse sexualities and its acceptance.
Sato sees that his young partner is going through the stages of exhaustion and tries to get Murakami on the right track and brings up the film's key symbolism, a rabid stray dog (even though rabies are extremely rare in Japan).
I enjoyed this film, even though I didn't expect to.
Quel maledetto treno blindato (aka Inglorious Bastards) has risen from the ranks of the rest of the obscure Italian made, American acted cheapies first of all because of Quentin Tarantino's reverence for the film and the fact that he plans to a remake of sorts under the same title; second of all even though Tarantino's word is enough PR to get any obscure film to raise from the depths of the unknown into popular culture, it wouldn't work if the film wasn't any good.
The Italian industry from the 50's to the late 70's thrived by imitating big Hollywood box office hits and even though The Inglorious Bastards came a good 10 years after the WWII action cycle of the 60's, it's still a welcome addition to the genre.
I am a more aware man for having seen this film, and it allows my to deal with bullies I have encountered in real life who on buses will try to play the inquisitor in a menacing fashion, even though here in America we are supposed to be free of this interaction.
She so enjoyed all the actors even though Polly Bergen tore a tiara off her head in the wardrobe trailer, citing that "she is supposed to be a floozie, not a princess!!!"
He blames refugees for taking people's jobs (even though he doesn't think it below him to use them when he sees fit).
I saw it once more last night on late TV and couldnÂ´t stop watching even though IÂ´ve seen it 2 or 3 times already.
As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really relate to the characters' situations.
It's a movie I can watch repeatedly and enjoy even though it is pretty bad.
I loved this film even though im not familiar with the first two.
Most of the characters are played by competent to even talented actors, even though most of them never became stars.
Seemed lame, middling and far- fetched for the most part even though I like the cast.
Daryl Hannah was much better than Merial Hemmingway as an agent even though they are both good actresses.Doug Savant returns as river guide Grant Carlson, who is on the verge of proposing to his girlfriend Agent Alex McGregor, but it's always a bad timing thing so he doesn't get the chance.
The early part of their relationship is played out fully with the stars' wit and charm as Roger attempts to pick up Julie by buying a pile of records at the store in which she works (even though he doesn't have a record player).
They are lucky in that the kind head of the agency, Miss Oliver, realizes they have all it takes to be good parents, even though their finances don't add up.
To this day, this movie will hold your attention even though you will find no vulgarity, nudity or violence.
The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).
And even though the series borrows from easily identifiable sources such as 2001 Space Oddessey and The Good the Bad and The Ugly, it does it with enough finesse not to undermine itself.
Although the story has promise, and the ending is somewhat of an improvement, even though it never rises above the clichÃ©, Long Time Dead is too burdened with severe flaws in direction, cinematography (the film is frequently far too dark) and performances to merit a recommendation.
Daniels' obviously prodigious abilities in the martial arts make his level of activity in dispatching the bad guys very believable (even though the extent, circumstances and numbers of adversaries involved may stretch this believability a tad).
The concept of freedom just fades away behind those curtains even though they are bragged about all the time.
You need someone like Scott around because even though John Wayne's the good guy, he's just a little too sure of himself where Dietrich is concerned.
Beware, even though I saw this on USA cable network edited, it is still a pretty violent flick w/ suggested sex & f-bombs ( I could tell what they just said even though it was bleeped out on regular T.V.)
Every street or boulevard was in a different part of the city, even though the scene looked like the streets came one after another.
I don't think Miike has ever made a movie for everyone, even though he's made almost 70 in under 20 years.
You really have to be a fan of the genres it imitates to understand it fully, even though the plot is simple.
The acting worked for the genre, even though most of it is terrible and hard to understand.
The other guy says "...about a week"--even though the bodies showed no evidence of critters nibbling on the corpses, putrification or discoloration at all and there was fresh blood all about the bodies.
Modern romance has been beaten to a pulp, but even though the same conventions of romance movies exist in The Bodyguard, I'm not one of those people who hated it.
Whilst sunbathing topless, three men approach them in the hope to score a bit of random and casual sex and they do; even though two of them are old and downright hideous looking.
( even though you know it will all work out).
even though it is somewhat cheesy its not cheesy enough to bring down the episode.
The non-original music included some good pieces, even though `Alerte!
I even thought that some scenes, particularly the dinners, were slightly reminiscent of Kubrick.
However, I did not find the characters to be as developed as I would have liked, so the film loses steam, even though it is a fairly short film, much less than ninety minutes.
Goober from The Andy Griffith show did an imitation of Cary Grant where he just yells "Judy, Judy, Judy" again and again (even though Grant never actually uttered the lines)--this is about the same quality as Petrillo's performance.
Okay, if you can look past the fact that the "comedy team" (a term used very loosely here)is just a rip off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and the fact that Lugosi is only here because he was taking any and every role he was offered at this point, it's actually almost funny on it's own, even though most of the time I laughed at the parts that weren't supposed to be funny, and groaned at the parts that were trying to be funny, but were ultimately just embarrassing.
I have been trying to find this show in all the "Complete Directory to Prime Time and Network Shows," but failed to find it in there even though I had some of the stars right.
One final note: I'm pretty sure that's Barbara Billingsley from "Leave it to Beaver" there towards the end, even though this is not listed as being among her films on this site.
I NEVER saw or heard of nice women doing ANYTHING like this even though it was 10 years old when I saw it for the first time.
I expected a good adaptation of the book in this movie even though the rating was below 6.
It has been said that, of all the masterpieces he created with Henry Fonda and others, and there were many, The Fugitive was one of his all-time personal favorites, even though it was never a popular, nor critical success.
For some reason the drivers are paired with sexy women to navigate, even though they have a pit crew to do that.
hi,  This was my first experience of an Afghani Film, and even though my family is not too keen about the movies i watch, they all gathered and watched this, at various points expressing shock and emotion at what they saw.
And secondly, even though the movie mainly focuses on the miserable life of its characters in such surrealistic-to-the-western-eye settings, it does show tiny glimpses of the beauty of life: the lullaby that the grandma sings to put the little girl to sleep, or the joyful, threatening Espandi (the boy with the smoking bucket of wild rue [Epand in Persian or Dari]) who turns into a supporter of the little girl when she's overwhelmed by the aggressive, intrusive boys in the Taliban's Quranic school.
This film was written by him, longtime Fellini collaborator Tonino Guerra, Petros Markaris, and Giorgio Silvagni, and even though- like the other films of his I've seen, this one is spare in dialogue, the story coheres because of the way the scenes are written to allow the actors' expressions convey what words need not.
another thing i liked about this is i never got bored even though there isn't that much action it keeps at a good pace all the time.
As it was, the primary plot elements were so unoriginal and timeworn that Â even though previously unfamiliar with either this Dickens original book or other filmed adaptations of it Â I found no suspense whatsoever to one of the two main plot lines to the story.
Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.
Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous "Trainspotting".
Maybe he didn't because he was a perfectionist, even though the character portrayed is not a native French speaker   There are just two further points I should like to make that nobody else has touched on thus far:  First, the story for the script is from the pen of Danish raconteuse Karen Blixen, magnificently portrayed by Meryl Streep in "Out of Africa", who, Sheherezade-like, beguiled her lover and his friend with her fluent and fascinating tales.
Now I must admit, even though the violence is brutal and gory, the filmmakers don't glamorize it.
It draws you in with a mediocre beginning with a mediocre start (even though it includes Sam Rockwell, a fledgling actor back then who's moved onto greater things - Charlie's Angels not withstanding).
"Underground" is probably one of the shortest pieces, but it's very expressive - even though you're left to wonder at the end if anything illegal actually took place.
"Puzzle" is already available in France (or at least in the French speaking part of Belgium; where I got it), even though the transfer to disc is fairly rudimentary and inconspicuous.
This fine Giallo tells an unusual story in an unusual way, and even though not much happens in the first half of the film, director Tessari manages to grip the viewer's attention from the beginning through stylish directing and really thrilling and creepy moments.
But, most importantly, even though the plot is a quite complicated net of strings that has to be lead together to the climax, the story remains plausible until the end, which isn't always the case in films of this genre.
The scenes with both Nicky and Pamala even though corny were touching in that they seemed to come straight from the heart not the script.
But I do give credit to the movie for having the guts to have an overweight semi-main character (even though she was very stereotyped), and especially that they showed her naked.
What is bad are the tiresome shots of darkened hallways, the constant entering into darkened rooms while the crappy electronic score kicks in (I guess we're supposed to feel a troubling eeriness in the air) in the background, and subtexted stage acts (in this case humans with fake rabbit heads) that don't enrich the story line, even though they are meant to thematize the breakdown in marital relations by showing how the language of married couples ceases to be communicative (gee, didn't T. S. Eliot already do this?).
I understand that the O'Toole character was based on Errol Flynn, even though he had died before this movie supposedly is set.
Richard Benjiman show great skill as a director even though this one of his earliest films.
I do however have a place in my heart for this film, even though the script was downright terrible, some moments in this film are just a must to commit to memory and are undeniably funny.
The other son hates snowboarders and will do anything to get rid of them--even though this makes zero economic sense.
The only gripe is that even though the create-a-spell system was interesting concept, but the characters had no special abillities of their own.
Great use of silent sequences, close ups, slow motion, black humor, and mood lighting, Hitch's most underrated talkie (Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film), this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools.
The main characters are likable, the viewer can relate to them within a few minutes, even though only very basic informations concerning their backgrounds are given.
This does not change the fact that it is trafficking too heavily in stereotypes and Hallmark staples such as "Don't ever let anybody tell you that you can't do something" (yes, Will Smith actually says this at one point) or that it rigorously rubs Chris' misery in our faces in every step of the way, even though we clearly got the gist of his miserable conditions early on in the film.
Not even though it is cheap and rough-made but BECAUSE of it.
The effects are very bad, even though there is some gore, and the story is stupid.
I kind of knew Zohan would be bad inside but I still wanted to see it, I loved Little Nicky even though critics trashed that.
Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances in years, and even though a lot of what he does ends up being futile, I really felt for all the characters.
When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so.
The beginning is really hard to watch, even though I like indie movies, with a lack of background music, but it is just that the character Keane is extremely unappealing in his madness, or supposed madness.
We feel sad because even though we already knew it, we know this little girl can't save him, she can't help him.
After watching the Brooklynite Jamie Hector play out his part as the strong and silent Marlo opposite Wood Harris in The Wire, It was the straw that broke the camel's back in making me consider this movie even though I was pretty sold on the title itself.
I consider the cinematography above average in Moon 44 because the director, even though on a short budget was able to create some neat scenery, of futuristic earth, space ships, fighter planes, the base itself and etc.
Sorry all, but even though I overall LOVED the movie the author MISSED on the history.
And this is especially true for Ah Tu, even though he's with someone who resembles, and not with the actual person.
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
'The Descent' managed to show the monster's faces and they were pretty ugly.In this movie, You can only see their whole face either near the end of the middle or in the end.I must admit that I had some fun with this movie.I will plan on seeing the sequels even though they did not get as good reviews as this one.
I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original.
The performances are realistic, the action and thrills are intense, and, even though the budget is obviously very small, the director does a great job of keeping the aliens out of view.
If you were watching her carefully, you would have seen her drawing aliens, even though she never saw them (correct me if I am wrong, as I said I missed the first 20 minutes).
Perhaps it is because of this that I found the film so convincing, but it is well worth watching even though you have seen that it is not a record of an actual alien abduction.
The answer is equally basic, but not less relevant for that: the leading trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy (even though they weren't acknowledged in that way until the start of Season 2: up to that point, only Shatner and Nimoy are credited in the title sequence; everyone else is listed in the closing credits).
And the human equation is delineated in McCoy's story in this one: he's reunited with his old girlfriend, so he's charmingly nervous as all hell, but in quick order, finds out she's been dead and her imitator must be killed, even though she's the last of her kind.
While this film is not as sleazy as SLAVES IN BONDAGE or GAMBLING WITH SOULS, two earlier films that featured star Wheeler Oakman as a pimp, ESCORT GIRL is slickly made and well-acted by a wonderful cast, and while it doesn't "show anything", it does have a seedy, dirty feel to it, even though it's not unlike a studio-bound, low-budget Grand National crime drama.
So it's a film told in flashback, even though it's not a process we're aware of until towards the end.
But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny.
Boy spends the run up to the wedding trying to win the heart of the girl, even though she thinks he's an idiot.
None of the gang members bother them, even though they've been threatening others.
Perhaps the very best of the, "Alfred Hitchcock Hour," series, the ending has a lasting impact; even though I haven't seen it in years.
But if you have half-a-brain then you're probably anticipating that the box is exactly what it turns out to be: bull that hopes to get people to watch it even though it's vintage Bergman.
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
Conclusion: This movie has all the ingredients to become a classic, epic movie in the future, even though it is three and a half hours in duration.
Have you ever turned on the TV and found that there was a film on and even though you've missed the first twenty minutes you decide to keep watching?
The main reason I remember this film to this very day, even though I have not seen it since today, is that I fell totally in love with Sophie Ward.
However, Joan is aware of John's way of living and she manages to trick him into marrying her, even though she does not love him and he has the exact same feelings towards her.
Joan is meanwhile busy pressing her husband to work on making his business a success and give up the polo (even though he's not very ambitious and has stated he prefers the life of leisure).
Everyone in this movie is fabulously wealthy by the standards of the day, even though their interests are under pressure from the economic turbulence of 1931-1932.
It really appeals to younger mystery fans, even though it is rated PG-13, for violence.
Jiro Manio's character (as Magnifico) is one of the amazing characters on this film even though his character is the lead of this film.
I'd say, this movie is a 10/10 even though it's a really sad film to watch.
This was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.It was very easy to get caught up in the story.The children captured my heart,even though at times they were dreadful little monsters.
The movie wants us to believe that the woman he really ought to marry is his young scullery maid (Kelly MacDonald) even though the chemistry between the two is somewhat less than bristling.
Even in the most disjointed of marriages (such as the second of my two marriages) there is generally some sort of attachment between the two even though they may both be in the divorce court!
Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland, I have often thought that even though I am in my 50's and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago, it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her.
I gave it a 7 because even though it lacks in some departments some of the torture scenes were new and ones i've never seen presented on film before.
Being familiar with miss Lohan's personal struggles much more than I am with her movies, I bought my ticket with a somewhat open-mind, even though after seeing the trailer (maybe the only bad element of the movie), I admit that I was basically expecting a teenage slasher movie.
This was so horrid...  Let me try it this way....  "You can't quit playing piano now, the BIG COMPETITION is coming up"  "But I don't want to play piano like Mozart anymore, even though I am amazingly talented on it, and my writing skills are just above a 5th grader, I know I am destined to be a writer!"
The funny thing is, I liked this film, even though I had watched Twelve Monkeys just a couple hours earlier (I did a little theater hopping).
For Claude Chabrol,a cinÃ©aste who has made over 50 films,this film must be like one of his loving children.However,his admirers might view it in a different light as it might appear as a minor work for them but many serious viewers would nevertheless feel that there are some nice things to observe in this film.Au coeur du mensonge is a film about people who are grappling with truths and lies in their lives.This film is more of a character study even though it is true that there are two crimes depicted in the film.These vile acts are merely a pretext for small town people to talk of pretentiousness and infidelity.Au coeur du mensonge is also a story about two artists;one of them is a fake and other one is not so sure of his inherent abilities.There is also a woman in their midst who is torn between these two men.The message of this film is simple:To understand a lie,one has to go to its heart.When we watch Sandrine Bonnaire and Jacques Gamblin, we realize that the truth is not so complicated as it is always visible on surface level.
Also, even though this movie didn't exactly scream for nudity, it would've elevated my grading of it by a point.
It just keeps getting worse and worse, and in the end I was supporting the bad guys, even though they weren't exactly the most charismatic bunch of people I've witnessed.
Patrick Stewart (Captain of the Enterprise on Star Trek) is doing a superb performance as is Liam Neeson even though their roles are minor as knights of the Table.
I really liked the old Quatermass films and even though I discovered them belatedly, being from the US, I got some enjoyment out of the TV series.
Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood.
Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck.
I think that the team behind this had a success with The Hobbit, even though the animation was horrible.
When I was very young, I had seen these films and could enjoy Tolkien's story through them even though I was too young to appreciate the books.
Gee, what a cast Woody Allen was (and still is) able to muster for his movies, even though none of them is paid blockbuster wages since Allen's movies tend to draw in a selective audience.
Some times it's refreshing to just go back to Allen's early, silly films like Sleeper and Take The Money And Run, even though the man has gone onto important funny films with deep dramatic throughlines: Crimes & Misdemeanors, Deconstructing Harry and Husbands & Wives.
The film is entirely about sexual perversions, even though it is not technically eroticÂ Allen has taken some of the most popular clinical treatments of sexual fetishes and has placed them into very unusual situationsÂ   Gene Wilder, for example, falls in love with a sheep; Woody Allen plays a medieval court jester who gets his lance stuck in his lady's chastity belt while the king is off fighting in the Crusades; a giant breast is released upon the countryside; an Italian couple can only find happiness in public sex; and we are taken into the inner labors of a male human body as it tries to seduce a woman in a carÂ  Each individual scene is quite well doneÂ The tales are rapid filled with irony about the overly exaggerated importance of sex in our cultureÂ
The soundtrack was fantastic and added so much value to the movie (especially the transition to the last scene on the train), even though it contained really only 2 songs.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
Audiences knew Bob from his Grammy winning comedy album, guest appearances on every variety show of the day and his two sitcoms: the first being a standard gentle comedy from the early sixties and the more famous and beloved one from the 1970s filled with winking innuendo, and was pretty racy by television standards, even though Dr. Robert Hartley and his beautiful wife Emily were married.
Unfortunately the film is really bad and extremely boring, even though the two main characters seem to be quite good actors (but due to the "script" they are not allowed to show their talents).
People felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society.
An organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier.
Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
the mouse.that's right,i said mouse.there's a mouse in the movie,and even though it has the briefest of cameos,it was the best actor in the(alleged)movie.for some reason,i watched this right to the bitter end.
So even though it's basically a rip-off gone bad of Stripes, Police Academy has SOME funny moments, at least enough for a friday night viewing.
SECRETS has an entirely different feel to it , in many ways it feels neither like a cynical marketing excersise nor a feature film but more like a theater play , and even though I haven`t bothered to check I`m probably right in saying SECRETS started life off as a play .
The 'recupero,' as the Italian film industry dubbed it, was one of the most forlornly hopeful forms of film-making: offsetting part of the cost of the film you wanted to make by filming another on the cheap back-to-back with as many of the same cast, crew and locations as possible in the hope that at least one of them would be a hit even though just about the only recorded case of that ever happening was when Il Magnifico Straniero, shot back-to-back with Bullets Don't Argue to 'use up waste materials,' became a surprise hit after changing its title to Fistful of Dollars.
even though the two sequels were even cheesier they were watchable movies and the second one is way underrated in my opinion.
I enjoyed most of the murders and even though some of them were a little bit far-fetched, I still think they were good enough for the slasher sub-genre.
and even though I had fallen asleep, it was like I had watched the whole thing, very apt there is torture in this film as it was torture for me to watch it.
and its so true but sad how even though her mom treated her soo bad she still loved her and felt bad for --what happened-.
Annoying full-length shots of women being overpowered and strangled without any real sexual violation, even though the killer(s?)
I want them to be a bit more serious than that even though they don't have to be "good".
You DON'T have to be Norwegian to understand subtleties of this movie (maybe you just need to be a kid, even though grown up :)  This piece was superbly translated into Russian and I remember some of them till now.
Suddenly, a cloud flys into their face, and even though everybody is only a foot away, they looked like they were taking the opportunity to catch their breath before finishing those last twelve inches.
The zombies in this aren't a bad lot really, they still have their human personalities & even though some like to eat human flesh most don't.
Danny offends the speakers and walks out prematurely even though the instructor warns him that he will be resentenced if he leaves.
Of course every character in the movie logged onto the website even though they knew damn well it would kill them.
Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times.
Which stays at the same length the whole film, even though the film covers quite a few days (it was hard tell, nothing was very coherent) And guess what!
The acting is all fine, particularly the lead man and the voice on the phone (you'll know what I mean when you see it, it really is a lead role even though you never meet him) but there are so many wholes in the story that it never came together for me.
That meant I had some expectations for this one, even though a guy I had never heard of before, Kevin Sorbo, had taken over the lead.
More disturbing than this fact alone, they can actually cause an individual to hear voices within their own mind (even though the movie depicted the use of cell phones).
In this film, even though he starts out to be a businessman who doesn't take no for an answer, he turns out to be a wimp.
This film was so dull, that for the first time, IMDb has said my comments were too brief even though I can't think of what else to say.
Davis's boyfriend (John Hodiak) is uncomfortable with the attention Davis is giving to Milland, even though there is no romantic angle to it.
After traveling the world and gaining great fame, Irene is determined to go back to Australia, as she knows she loves him and must marry him--even though they barely know each other and he is currently on the run again.
I LOVE James Dean even though I was born 15 years after his death.
Please do not waste your time w/this even though you can watch it free online if you have a Netflix membership, please don't let that fool you.
Death Touch later has sex with another prostitute, Jessie, but when he starts to hurt her (well, she is apparently supposed to be in pain even though she is smiling), the hotel manager comes running and Death Touch attacks him.
The only thing is, it is done so well you are impelled to watch some more, the characters so convincingly portrayed that even though a great deal of fictional license is taken in portraying historical figures, the feel and sense of the place and the people who lived there seem real.
And I gotta admit that even though I'm quite a huge fan of Uwe Boll's work, I personally wasn't 100% sure either what to expect from a project like this...
They all go, even though it's unclear who invited them, and end up in an isolated mansion in the middle of nowhere.
PLOT: 95 pound weakling gets a hold of a magic staff and needs to return it to it's rightful owner - a martial arts master, along the way he befriends people that magically speak English even though they are Chinese that have never seen a white guy.. and that's just one of a long list of groaners that will make you go.. please kill me I can't stand this anymore.
Which is why I gave it a "5", even though it's one of the worst movie experiences I've had in years - to separate it from the more spectacularly junky experience of a "sub-3" movie.
Boll is just the director and a film is a sum of its parts, even though Boll directed this film, there were dozens of earnest and hardworking actors and crew members putting in their all to make this film.
This is one of Leslie Nielsen's worst movies ever, even though he's not really the main character.
Also, the movie didn't go by all the facts, even though these things were small in nature - for example, Billy Flynn was not a blond guy, he has brown hair and certain things in the film were altered from the true facts that were reported on national television when Pamela Smart was on trial for the murder of her husband, Greg Smart.
Likewise, a very warm-hearted series of relationships bud between Kincaid and his elderly friends (showing that this kid is goodhearted -- even though he's a bada**).
Yashraj films are normally considered the best production house even though they have done worst copies(compared to Bhatt who give at least better films though copies) And have made trash films  The film is a lame copy of NINE MONTHS  The comedy scenes are puerile except Jaaved's scenes rest are nothing great, the shouting scenes are lame  The twist is well handled but then nothing much happens and the film ends in a very bad manner  Siddharth Anand handles only few scenes well, many scenes are over the top Music is good  Saif repeats his DCH act and acts well though he often cribs and gets boring Preity is good in serious scenes but overdoes many parts Jaaved is funny Abhishek hams Jugal is okay
I'd recommend the soundtrack, even though I absolutely abhor the movie.
Why does she help Dial even though he's a wanted fugitive ?
Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a "worst case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... Don't waist your time this movie Ã­snt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...
However, "To All a Good Night" is a cut above most derivative slashers, even though it starts out with the mandatory sex-obsessed sorority girls (plus one cute wallflower) and assembly-line violence, it gets progressively better as it goes alongÂcreating an adequate atmosphere of dread and giving its surviving characters a bit of personality and humanity.
I was amused as I watched this flick how characters are blunt and honest about others giggling and insulting them while they are still in the room(..such as gardener Ralph who seems to be the butt of everyone's jokes, even though he moves about, saying little, without really warranting such constant ridicule, despite the fact that he's a wee bit creepy).
But even though it's full of child imagination in it (robot friend in school, entering game's world, be friend with a cute girl friend...), the story is to typical towards the end.
My advise watch this if you really and even really bored, but overall the film was not to my liking and I'd say to any of my friends not to bother with it, even though it's got good actors in it.
First off, even though the run-time is listed as 94 minutes, this thing dragged on forever.
'Mark' ('Happy Harry') never quite does the right thing, as he continues to transmit even though he knows he should stop.
It felt rushed as well, even though it was quit close to the original story.
Dressed in a two-piece bathing suit, Megghy has a figure that recalls Michelle Johnson in Stanley Donen's "Blame it on Rio", but Stefania lets it go, even though her niece is properly attired for a "porn star convention".
That is the real lesson, even though it promises to be a sad one.
Banek objects to such forgery on ethical grounds, even though his own behaviour towards Gipson is just as illegal and could be regarded as even more immoral.
But, the acting was terrific even though the performances didn't relate to everything else going on.
Nobody believes him, even though he is, in fact, correct.
And even though The Monkey Hustle gets lumped in with the blaxploitation movies of the period, it lacks the sex, violence, and emotional charge necessary to be considered as such.
And of course, even though the name of the movie is Nautilus and is about a sub, there is zero connection between it, and the writings of Jules Verne.
The most silly part is where Viktor runs after a beggar(even though the beggar is half of the creatures size and obviously human)can conveniently walk through a door and kill her without breaking a sweat.
I felt sad for the white chick (grilfriend), not because of her colour, but as a women I could relate, when you think you know somebody but and realising that you don't and in such a matter is just so painful....., but on another hand....there was that element for me, of our black brothers going for white chicks... when they are loaded....even though in this movie that wasn't what brought them together.... interesting story indeed...
For instance, Duchovny's character starts to have an affair even though it's so clear that he's in love with his wife.
In "Ark," her hair was long, even though they had made it clear in previous episodes that Air Force policy required her hair to be short.
And overall, the movie isn't very scary (even though we're lead to believe it IS by the trailer): there's a lot of unnecessary gore, and some jump scares that once it's revealed what made you jump, you get mad at the movie for startling you for nothing.
This movie never gets boring even though at the end it starts to feel a little long.
The good thing about the movie though is that the story moves along quite nicely, even though there's a lot of conversation things actually do happen in it at times.
I had a lot of problems with this episode, but one thing I did like was the Spike and Buffy scene (even though I never wanted them together, esp after he turned stalker-y and built a mannequin and a sex-bot, sniffing her undies...etc) I didn't understand why the spell had to turn all potentials worldwide into all out slayers when the major battle was in the school.
First of all, I'd like to establish that even though Rodney Dangerfield has top billing--he only appears in about 20 percent of the film.
Victor inherits her, along with the house, and keeps her around even though she can't cook.
I even said to myself "I wonder how they would escape since the old couple could barely walk much less run even though they always kept within seeing distance of the others".
Journey To The Center of the Earth: I liked this, even though it had Pat Boone in it.
There's an ex-boyfriend that ultimately has nothing to do with the plot, sexual 'tension' with every single woman on screen and for some reason there are a bounty of young, immensely attractive females who want to bang Al Pacino even though he honestly looks like he's about to fall into his coffin throughout the entire film.
series, even though a young child I could grasp that it was not serious.
But even though director Tom Laughlin (of "Billy Jack" and "Master Gunfigher" fame) had previously managed to make some involving (if contrived) movies, here he couldn't pace a dramatic scene to save his life, and he definitely didn't have the know-how or the talent to make these uncharismatic actors carry the movie.
And when Tiuri meets the lord of the toll I got an emotional response from this performance, even though it doesn't really make sense in light of the book.
This is Japanese SciFi cult ( even though they used American actors, they STILL dubbed it...badly ) coming to you straight out of the era when cinema actually had evoluated a lot.
Collins looks incredibly glamorous for a woman in her early forties, but nevertheless manages to turn in one of the worst performances of her career, even though she could at times be very effective in horror films like "Tales from the Crypt".
Sadly, this film falls short, even though every actor I've seen before (especially Ms. Ng, Ms. Yau and Mr. Tsang) has impressed me with their acting ability.
But if you happen to have serious issues with homosexuality, you will probably NOT want to see this movie, even though it isn't about being gay in the ordinary sense.
I've seen much worse- but at least those movies had the guts to try something new (even though they tanked doing it).
What the story lacks in imagination (as it does draw upon a predictable amalgam) and coherence, it makes up for in durable performances (a likable Andrew Stevens, George Kennedy, John Lafayette, Starr Andreeff and Terri Treas all keeping it straight) and gruesomely tacky splatter (even though it doesn't have much impact in engineering the deaths and tawdry jolts).
Yamaguchi is tall, handsome and compassionate Â even though he is taunting the fleeing Allied soldiers over loudspeakers spread throughout the jungle.
And finally, the fact they said at the beginning this was the true sequel to the first film, even though it pales in comparison to the films that came before.
Unbelievably, Joshua isn't the worst actor in the film - even though everyone in this movie either screams or mumbles his or her casual lines , and even though Joshua's mum looks like a crack addict psychopath during most of her scenes, the real Dung Beetle award for incompetent acting has to go to Deborah Reed.
*********I'm ashamed to say this about such a stupid movie, but this review contains SPOILERS******************   The movie involves a family moving to a town named Nilbog (that's right it's goblin spelled backwards even though the movie is called Troll, not Goblin) and swapping houses with some hillbillies.
This unbelievably bad little piece of $hit, flick pi$$ed me off even though I only paid a dollar to rent it.
I give credit to the director for atleast attempting to make a semi-accurate adaptation...even though he failed miserably.
Let's also get one of the hotter black stars of the era to play the "hero," too, and have him show all those corrupt politicians how it should be done, even though that "good guy."
The film gets a few stars for that alone, even though most people prefer the wise-ass Murphy.
The music isn't too bad, even though they may have overused the "Uh-Oh" song by putting it in three different scenes.
The ending is also pretty bad since it randomly ends with Lohan kissing Sam even though they hardly focused on this romantic subplot.
Cube is expressionless, for the most part, and the action becomes pretty ridiculous and Bond-like even though we're dealing with too close to home locations like the Capitol building and people being involved like the President of our good-old United States of America.
The supporting players just seem to be along for the ride and don't add much even though they include a few talented people like Samuel L. Jackson, Willem Dafoe, and Scott Speedman(who was great in the Underworld movies but is horrible here).
So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen.
So even though a cast this good promises something epic, it hardly delivers.
I often wish that someone would attempt a version that is truer to the original book, even though it was penny-dreadful claptrap.
The acting was often awkward and felt unrealistic even though the style of film-making was cinema-verite.
He really was a "boy "General" in the Civil War and even though most West Point Grads who were like Custer, in the right place at the right time for promotions; his rise in rank was phenomenal.
SECRETS has an entirely different feel to it , in many ways it feels neither like a cynical marketing excersise nor a feature film but more like a theater play , and even though I haven`t bothered to check I`m probably right in saying SECRETS started life off as a play .
Now, even though its dancing zombies are timeless, it must loose its crown.
The only shows I like are Lost and 24, even though they aren't Christian.
Besides, he's obviously portraying the smartest character of the bunch (even though that role should be Pullman's), so it's hard not to root for him to beat all the idiots.
An X-ray, blood test, or any number of medical procedures would quickly disclose their less than human nature, however a simple test was just to take a pulse which would give the appearance that they were dead even though they were fully conscious and ambulatory.
From some freak co-incidence one of the feral cannibals has survived from the first movie, even thought we saw em' all get killed, and this time he's accompanied by his uncle, which was something of surprise, as he wasn't mentioned in the first film and the daddy of original head of the cannibal family mentioned only having two children, a daughter who died and the bloodthirsty psychopath son.
People went out to cuddle even though they knew, that their friends were missing.
It was only when Melody stopped wishing and actually did something that all the pieces fell into place: like going to that swanky restaurant even though she had no escort, and joining in the fun with the other diners.
Paul Bettany plays the villain and he gives a good performance even though his character is a little weak and not very scary.
The son tries to remove it and the mom tells him not to - even though they are held captive in their own home and I'm not sure how the dog would run away to need a GPS tracker anyway.
And Brian Thompson, even though a credible screen bad guy, is no Tagawa.
Bad guy suddenly comes back, even though MK1 stated it was over and done with.
Even the soundtrack was not as good as the first movie even though KMFDM were involved in both.
Or one where the military so predictably wants to blow up the thing-we-don't-understand with a nuke ordered by a panicked President even though the resident scientist (who's of course a totally smug jerk) says not to.
One knows one is in further trouble when there is not one single note of Mancini music in the film, even though he receives credit for Original Music.
Karen Black looked remarkably old even though this is one of her earliest films.
A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place).
I don't mean the major plot point, about the mars mission, but rather an accumulation of little details that just seemed totally unrealistic even though I was able to buy the overall idea of the movie.
It is unfortunate that Hollywood quickly lost interest in the complexity of producing good stereoscopic films (which are most often now featured in specialist theatres such as the IMAX), and instead has followed what I feel has been a largely disasterous attempt to explore the potential of anthropomorphic lenses even though in the majority of cases these have no conceivable artistic contribution to make to the final product.
However, even though it's a horrible scene, just get a load of that old lady as she watches the attack!
I think the actors performed with all seriousness in their roles, even though it seems to me that the script was poking fun at them, having them ride miniature ponies (which is hilarious to see) and having them walk under normal size barroom doors and the like.
The Great American Snuff Film seems to be a ultra serious attempt to get into the mind of a sick f*ck like Grone as it almost relies totally on his constant tedious & clichÃ©d monologues for it's narrative even though not much happens anyway.
And even though I have called this a sequel (for ease of writing) I do not recognise it as such.
As far as I am concerned we left the world of Bateman in the novel when the final page was turned (even though I never read it properly), and in the film when the end credits began rolling.
I had my doubts about this even before it saw release, but my assumptions turned out correct--I masochistically sat through this idiotic mess, even though I felt compelled to turn it off at least once every five minutes.
He picks a lady who has nothing to do with the movie industry and blindly listens to everything she says even though she has no idea what she's talking about.
I observed a BAD Humphrey Bogart recently that actually had a much higher percentage of scores of 10 than CASABLANCA--even though the overall score was still quite low.
On the bright side, effects were solid, Ivonova still rocks, and the audio commentary was fun to listen to even though not enlightening.
And I almost burst out laughing when Seth said "red... COLOR" after he became human even though the whole film was shot in color and nothing hinted that he couldn't see colors.
With cinematography by frequent Pedro AlmodÃ³var collaborator JosÃ© Luis Alcaine, the Greek locations are refreshing, even though the environs around Valencia, Spain, apparently doubled for much of the country.
Aside from the three leads (Jenna, Whitney, Clay), I cringed at most of the one-dimensional, obnoxious characters, even though the acting were fine.
A couple good touches, such as the topless skiing scene (even though that didn't show off what it could've) and the ax kill (now THAT was pure Jason) can even begin to save this pile of sludge.
So, even though I didn't like it much, I'm glad movies are still being made that a kid can watch and get lost in.
"Hysteria" is a modern and plausible explanation for religious visions, but there is no historical evidence to serve as background -- and I found the modern day psycho-babble more than a little jarring, even though Dustin Hoffman does his best with the role.
Now, even though they most likely couldn't afford a special effects shot to show a dissolve from the drawing to the door opening, they could have easily made the door they built resemble the one Richard drew.
But to make things worse, even though many people have just died, the lead actor begins to sing (a la Arch Hall, Jr. in EEGAH!)!
Well, that's not exactly true because even though the film initially had me rolling my eyes over and over, by the end I was actually quite enjoying the movie, as shallow as it may be.
Group encounter living threat that wants to kill them all for no real reason at all, group run low on ammo even though they never actually run out & have to come up with other ways to defeat their enemy in a nail-biting (not) climax, been done yeah?
I had a lot of fun trying to be the whining, miserable wife for the movie, even though in real life I am nothing like that character.
It was made by the TV animation studio and it kind of has that look and feel to it with it's incomplete, un-realistic backgrounds but otherwise looks OK. Robin Williams as the Genie is funny at times(but overbearing at others)and some of the other minor characters brings some laughs but the movie tries to be too grand and too good even though it wasn't meant to be.
Caught this tonight on cable and have to say it surprised me - didn't figure out what was really going on, even though I knew that what was being shown wasn't the entire story, and I have seen so many films like this, where what you see isn't exactly what you get, where you can't take anything at face value, so it shouldn't have fooled me.
OK this is the 2nd appearance of The Pink Panther even though there were several other titles with that name it has nothing to do with it it was only in for a cameo where someone steals it and Cluesau is kidnapped (after the abomination of the first one I'm celebrating) and some journalist asks questions about Cluesau (Cluesau isn't in this one only in Archive Footage I know a complete ripoff even though so was the rest of the series) and they ask even Charles the real "Phantom" makes an appearance we see Clueseau's childhood and all this other crap which has nothing to do with anything if the journalist was really an author writing bio's about detectives who are so stupid it isn't funny (the only other thing in that category is FAMILY GUY) OK Clueseau isn't found.
The first half which Sellers is in excels (even though one can easily tell that all his scenes are just deleted scenes), but once he's gone, every goes downhill.
For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous.
For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.
For some reason, Quastel insists on using the "Blurry Cam" and "Distorto-Cam" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.
While Pinhead's greater presence in this one than in the last is a welcome change, the Hellraiser movies were never originally about him or the Cenobites, even though they seemed to have evolved in that direction, which, with proper directing and writing, could have been a good thing.
and find an old movie and watch it even though you know it's bad.
Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there.
The sad thing about this though is that not many people saw this film that are a part of the new generation, except they saw the new version of the film and refuse to see this masterpiece because it's old even though to this reviewer, this film is without a doubt a timeless masterpiece that will never be topped no matter how hard anyone tries.
But the hero has one flaw, he's an agnostic, even though he was brought up in a Catholic family.
Too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'Ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters.
Maybe I just haven't kept with the time and it's the new humor that I don't get, even though I'm only 20 years old.
But the direction by Tobe Hooper is inspired brilliance and even though Hooper often injected bits of black humor here and there which could have made the film less authentic, the humor never overtakes the story (which is probably what many didn't like about the sequel, which, btw, I recommend too) because the rawness of what's occurs on screen is never pulled back.
Ryan grew up planning his whole life perfectly even though he was a geek through out high school, dated a fellow geek played by Alyson Hannigan and yet for some strange reason the most popular girl in his school Jennifer always seemed to be around him all the time.
It also shows that even though Disney is making shorts again, they're still sentimental fluff on topics the maker's don't really know that much about.
I was looking forward to watching it, even though I have grown wary of British films with the 'classic' tag attached.
This is not a funny short, as others on this sit have suggested - it is not amusing or entertaining or even thought-provoking.
Even hard core Duke Wayne fans should pass on Jet Pilot, it's a flameout; The Hunters will fire your afterburner (even though F-86s didn't have afterburners...)
Let me make it clear here Â that for me, this movie even though not so good, was better than the original Memento.
Moments like this (and Sylvia) make the movie bearable, but it is definitely quite tiresome, even though it's not even 90 minutes long.
I dislike films that are obvious about the "we are all just brothers under the skin, so won't you just like me even though we're different because I am deferring to you" politically correct party line.
Although most people miss it, there was a real reason for this battle, even though it happened right before the ceasefire.
For what it really is, this is not a bad movie, even though I kept expecting to see Betty White leading a water buffalo down to the river's edge.
Spoilers:   The ending revelation that the title refers to is the fact that Bobby isn't allergic to mangos, even though the tape says that he is.
And even though her plan doesn't even make sense, because in all seriousness, there shouldn't be only one fruit vendor in a given city.
You see men determined to win even though they know they might die (and for what?
The fighting scenes for one was very slow, it seemed like they were both scared of injuring each other when they were fighting, even though they were wearing god knows what inches thick.
I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
the only thing stopping me rating it so low is the cast, even though they didn't do a good job its nice to see them all in one film.
I was rooting for all the "8 Films To Die For" even though I thought they should at least have made them double features or something to give an incentive for going to them all (they were all full price for unproven films/filmmakers...huh?)
The budget of "Dark Ride" was obviously low but not THAT low; they got the universal back-lot and locations at the Santa Monica Pier and the dark ride itself is really pretty cool--even though technically it doesn't look like a "ride" at all--the tracks disappeared early on and never returned, technically the "ride" is a walk through then...isn't it?
Where there are indeed many parts of the story that border on funny and is sometimes even thought-provoking, the overall feel of this movie is as arid as the Outback.
Better watch "Jaws" again, even though it's for the 200th time.
The director in my opinion should have focused more on the shark attacks because in the movie there isn't enough to satisfy the audience, even though the sharks shown in the movie are actually real and cool to watch, the movie lacks any thrill or scary moments when the main cast actually comes face to face with the sharks.
The three daredevils then swear vengeance against 39013, and are hired by Granville to hunt him down, even though the impersonation is in effect.
L'Ultimo Squalo had it's own scenes filmed, and (even though some were taken from JAWS), they made their own scenes, their own mediocre shark and their own dialogue.
I saw this when I was 11 and even though they say kids will laugh at anything,that's not necessarily true.
Dafoe is in on the deal, but is also falling in love with Sandii, even though he knows she is prone to lying about almost everything.
It never really got going and even though the impressive cast do well with a patchy script, you never really believe it because it's clearly bunkum.
It also doesn't help that the majority of the characters are essentially uninteresting and unlikable (even though the actors for the most part are actually better than expected), and when they die, you don't feel anything other than indifference.
Take absolutely no notice of positive reviews or quotes made about this film to save yourself 100 minutes; even though you'll most probably give up on this film before the end, if you ever pluck up the courage to watch it as a frightful joke (and even then I'm concerned for your sanity).
Maintenance completely lacks originality and substance even though the storyline could very well of worked out with a better cast of characters and better direction.
This just didn't seem very funny at all and even though it's been a number of years since I've seen it, it still reminds the standard against which I measure how bad a movie is.
The cast features some familiar faces, Malcolm McDowell is in it for about three minutes maximum even though he gets near top-billing in the credits, Chris Penn makes for a sleazy bad guy & is criminally wasted throughout, Costas Mandylor didn't convince me as the most evil man on Earth, Clint Howard makes an appearance as Stalin one of Lord Shin's henchmen, Melvin Van Peebles was here somewhere but I don't know who he played & as for leading man Gary Daniels he is about as wooden & unconvincing as I expected.
There isn't much blood or gore & disappointingly not a single on screen exploding head even though Chris Penn's head almost explodes but unfortunately the scene cuts away just at the vital moment, there is a cool looking zombie though who's in it for a couple of minutes & a few blood spraying wounds.
There are a million movies around like this and I happen to be a fan of predictable romantic comedies(if their good) but I found the characters and humor very weak and even though the movie's not DECADES old or anything it looks dated now, especially the hairstyles.
She mopes around about how much she loves him (even though she's been having an affair with one of his clients), but we learn nothing about her except that she has no personality.
And even though he's admittedly spent more time on his abs than on his marriage, after she runs off on a fling with another man, she'll spend the rest of the script trying to get back into his arms.
The worst, though, was probably the bright red hairdos of Susan Hayward and Agnes Morehead also from THE CONQUERER--even though they were clearly playing Mongolians!!
But, for no reason, director Scott feels that even though we had that good opening signaling grand things, we could have done without it for another thirty or forty minutes, which in common sense land is a large portion of a film that doesn't even hit the two hour mark, and that makes zero sense.
(1) I figured out about halfway through the movie who they were going to identify as the werewolf, even though it made absolutely no sense because the person (who shall remain nameless in this review for fear of spoiling the "suspense" for others) did seem otherwise occupied during several of the attacks.
Even the background score makes us think that something is going to happen next even though nothing interesting after that.
Christina Applegate is great in her role but for some reason her role isn't really that big, even though he character plays a big part in the movie its story.
He seems to serve no purpose in the movie, even though I was preparing myself for a big role from him in this movie, after he made his first (and only) appearance.
Candice Bergen tried desperately to reprise her Miss Congeniality role even though her character was written without any personal depth.
Too bad he was killed, because the writers (even though none are credited... surprise surprise) cannot think up a good story.
I mean i had a Public Access Show in Atlanta GA in 1999 where people sent me stuff (for you kids, Public Access is how you got stuff played before YouTube), and even though the movies were cheap and low budget and technically 'bad', it was for that type of genre.
Erin Brown actually does a pretty good job (I would have liked to see more of her character), and Tony Todd is decent enough (even though he looks too much like an evil version of Lee "Scratch" Perry-not exactly something that will strike fear into men's hearts), but everybody else seems unrehearsed or bored, spewing forth terrible dialog and bad one liners.
It looks very dated ( even though it is set at the turn of the century ) it looks like it was filmed in the sixties instead of 1982.
If you can find a letterbox transfer of this movie, BUY IT if you enjoy the Handmade Films genre; if you like Time Bandits even though it isn't Jurassic Park.
The good looking teen hero & his girlfriend who becomes the damsel in distress & who both manage to solve the murders even though the combined efforts of the Italian police can't & check out the 'crowd pleasing' comedy scene with the dwarfs in the police station.
A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place).
My friend rented it thinking it would be hardboiled, it of course wasn't, even though the clerk at the store assured him it was and said he had rented it before.
The other day i watched the war film Sophie Scholl - and even though it didn't have half the 'big' name actors in it and was foreign produced and acted it was the most brilliant film I have seen for awhile and the fact that stupid stupid films such as the last drop (more like the last war film for these film makers) are made, do not do justice to the real stories and real suffering that the occupied countries went through when the Third Reich was in power.
Bad acting worries no-one, even though this movie is full of it.
I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
I try to classify movies as they manage to get what they want, example: John Woo's a better tomorrow is far better than The Matrix, just because, even though a better tomorrow is just about nonstoping action, unfolds in its essence something deeper, and it amuses at 100%, meanwhile The Matrix, tries to get you into a new level of action cinema, tries to do a more reflective exercise in the audience, and that's something impossible to get just by splatting on, between gun shots, the basics of the Platon theories (the myth of the cavern).
I didn't automatically assume it would be crap even though it was more than likely, but instead went into it hoping for the best.
But even though Rochelle Swanson is an exceptionally voluptuous woman, not even her wonderful body was enough to keep me interested in the film.
And even though the seams from stock footage are pretty obvious, the film is well produced with locations at Fort Carson, Colorado, where the terrain was said to resemble that of Korea.
I didn't even care all that much when the guy dies in the beginning, even though they tell us we should.
Every time I watch it, it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen, even though I remember all what happens by heart.
Cabaret deals a lot with the Nazis coming into power in Germany in the early 1930's,even though it looks like a secondary theme in the movie.The closing shot is off a room full of Nazis shown through a mirror.It leaves no questions about the future of Germany.I haven't seen that many films dealing with pre nazi Germany before and I thought this one did it quite well.
It never shows that spark between Openly Gator and Queer Duck, even though we know they had been in a committed relationship for some time.
I enjoyed seeing the Misfits play at the end, even though the camera was flying about all the time so you couldn't quite get a grasp on them being there.
And then a deputy who is southern (even though nobody else in the scene is) agrees to investigate the stalker for No Name.
And even though neither of them is capable of producing full sentences, we're supposed to believe that they're intelligent enough to trick health inspections and a pair of private investigators?
He is somewhat appealing in a geeky way and even though he flips out and turns into a stalker, you feel a bit sorry for him.
We see the same window over and over even though the people comment about the "maze" they get lost in.
However, it is still historical of course to see Chaplin in his first film, even though he is not honed.
But the interactions were "conversational," even though from the screen display the three principals were often actually separated by thousands of miles.
I'll certainly still check out more films from Rollin based on the positives here even though I was less than enthusiastic about this effort.
Gooding visits him in prison to try to find out what happened even though it's none of his business.
She deserved a million dollars, even though she didn't win.
The action is neat even though the FX are slightly weak my modern standards.
Quicksilver Highway tells two lame and tedious stories, even though the respected authors Stephen King and Clive Barker wrote them.
All us fans of that Edwoodsian mega-flop are praying (even though I'm an atheist!)
Written and directed by Rene Daalder I really didn't like this much at all, even though I know it gets a lot of good reviews.
I saw this film right on the day it opened in a large theater and even though I wasn't familiar with the original German TV Series I at least expected decent action entertainment and hoped to experience some two hours of fun and adrenaline.
This is even more lamentable, as the film presents its assets in a very loose and disadvantageous manner: even though it contains some extremely strong elaborate stunts, explosions (of choppers, cars and even entire planes) and shootouts, which certainly would be worthy of a true Hollywood action production, these supposed assets are not presented as eye candy at all.
It stinks I can't give this less then 1-star but since I can't this will have to do even though it deserves a -10.
I didn't automatically assume it would be crap even though it was more than likely, but instead went into it hoping for the best.
For example, just when the rich guy is about to kill the wolf, his wife inexplicably stops him from shooting it--even though this wolf is tearing apart their doggy.
Another huge problem with Grizzly Rage is that the suppose threat just comes across as really tame, the Bear never really does anything other than stand on it's hind legs & there's this obviously dubbed roaring noise even though you can clearly see the Bear is just not angry or aggressive.
She can't off these idiots fast enough, even though the footage of the bear is obviously some unused documentary footage from Animal Planet.
probably half-assed the script thinking it was so great even though the movie was way too overrated, it's just such a terrible movie.
The cartoon cat then sets out with the other animals into the big city (which is populated by cartoon animals even though the farm has a human family) to find Chanticleer, who has turned into an Elvis parody and is being seduced by a sexy chicken.
Over and over, this show has repeatedly tried very hard to promote interracial relationships even though they are statistically rare (about 3%) yet oddly enough - they never address the racial component of a relationship.
For a long time I only owned Lethal Weapons 1,2 and 4 and only bought this because it was dirt cheap and people always moaned at me for missing it out, even though they understand that it is a rubbish film.
One may miss the jangling ambient noise of Platform and Unknown Pleasures, though, and particularly the informative TV broadcasts of the latter, which always fit in context even though they may speak to us more than to the characters.
For some reason Silent Predators was shot in Australia even though it was an American produced & financed film supposedly set in America?
Some romances develop, a foreign Russian worker Anna is introduced to the group even though she and another Chinese girl Tao don't share the same language.
Kari is the best-developed character in the film, even though she gets less screen time than Philip or Erik.
About the director, he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it, everything doesn't have to be so dumb.
Anyway, all this just to illustrate that the mission is half dead by the time they reach the monster and YOU just sat and watched an hour of wilderness documentary footage even though you counted on seeing a Sci-Fi monster movie.
- The U.S. government is relying on the scientific advice of two scientists, even though the end of the world is about to happen.
without knowing much by the DVD cover i didn't know what to expect even though it said "in the vein of dawn of the dead, Shaun of the dead as well as other zombie movies."
Iris slowly gains confidence through such comradery and at one point she doesn't want to leave, even though her father has higher career expectations for his daughter.
I think the film's biggest misstep is not featuring Price as the central character, even though Kenny Everett has some shining moments.
If Hitler had won, my own family (the Dutch side) would have been 'resettled' in Poland as farmers, to clear out the subhuman Poles (even though going back 250 years, their common ancestor was a shepard from Silezia).
The point being that racism makes no sense, even though it is very much incorporated into the fabric of this series.
The bad guys all wear black so you know they're the bad guys; the baddest of the baddies (and the leader) always wears black suits, even though all the action is at a beach or on the water.
This is one of my favorite rides, even though it is not in any sense a great ride, nor is it one of the better attractions that Lucas worked on with Disney, EO of course being his best.
The attraction is a decent, if not great ride, and even though the only character in ride you see is R2, you will still hear some memorable quotes, and see memorable faces during the preflight safety videos.
(I love it when the woman and the security guard suspect a killer is in the multi-story building and the guard insists she stay in the lab with the door locked while he checks the place out, even though the door to the lab has a flimsy glass window on it).
Particularly Ted's character is good for a couple of laughs, as he sees himself as God's gift to women even though he's the most annoying Star Wars nerd imaginable.
I read the back cover, and even though Joey Lawrence of Blossom fame (if you could call it that) was in it, I decided to give it a try, just for once, to pick a movie, that might be one of those that might just surprise me in being a good movie.
This even though she lived next to a lake all that time!
The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.)
Don't get me wrong (I'm sure you will anyway)...this is a well-made Hollywood product with good performances by all (I even thought Melanie Griffith was half-way believable) but the whole construct is made by cynical minds who want to neuter the people of this town with a treacly gloss that would have embarrassed Frank Capra.
Platoon isn't a favourite of mine either even though its rated high.
"; then he removes from their silly huge open vat of cooling liquid the ship's preposterously big computer components and suffers not the least touch of frostbite-- even though frostbite fatally mauls the poor schmuck saddled with the task of re-dunking those components.
It's low-budget dreck, that is certain--but through its persistent incoherence, it kept my attention, even though the one feeling I had when the credits started to roll was absolute indifference.
Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film.
It begins and finishes on an upbeat note, but the leaden handling drags its midsection down, even though the cast is quite good.
The crew of the submarine Lorelei believe that they are fighting for their homeland and the future of Japan and hence sacrifice themselves at the end of the movie by surfacing on the water (even though the area is surrounded by US fleets) so that they can take down the US airplane which was carrying the third atom bomb heading for another drop in Japan.
Assemble a cast too physically unappealing (and too sleazy) to get work in the porn industry even though their acting skills are on that level.
Always brushing it out of her face even thought it continues to fall in her face.
I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I was a fan of the Donnie & Marie Show...However, even though I was only 15 when I saw it, I was shocked and disappointed at how bad this film was.
It is being suggested that even though the film contains hardly (if any) entertainment value, it should be accepted because of its artistic quality.
Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.
What really slowed the series down to a crawl was the need to force certain other characters back into the plot, even though they no longer had any purpose, and should in fact have died in the season finale.
After his shoes break in the last game of the year, he quits after the game even though the team made the playoffs?
I've done things that can be interpreted as anti-mainstream-religion and pro-Satanist in my own artwork (even though it's not meant quite that simply).
This is one of those type of movies you watch, and when you leave you get pissed at the movie theater employees, even though they relatively had nothing to do with why you're mad.
The movie itself revolved around some historical battles and politics which are really unknown for me, and even though mr Amirkulov pointed out before the film began that we in the audience could expect some obscure historical talk in the film, i was surprised about the lack of many things in the movie.
No, for some reason they don't, even though they were all there the first time.
Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic.
Perhaps this explains why there were considerable leaps from reality, hoping the viewer would not mind the 'jumps & jerks' from what was supposed to be a realistic 'peek' at the unique world of 'witches' even though they be of good heart and purpose.
It's just that the movie is boggled down with so many sports and rags-to-riches movie clichÃ©s that by the end, the movie seems far from original even though the premise is.
The substantial profit garnered by this movie prompted production of three sequels, each continuing the amourous adventures of young Will and his trusty spy cameras, and even though their potential merits cannot be determined by this viewer, the first number in the series does provide an unexpected element of suspense in addition to capable costuming from Ha Nguyen, fine stunt performing, and a polished turn from Carr.
Instead, the character encounters no real hardship even though he is appears to be staggering around ineffectually, and even appears to outrun people on horses who catch him supposedly trying to steal cows?
They also discuss how the past victims were all killed outside of their homes, which apparently brings them a sense of safety...even though none of the windows are locked, these women seem 100% convinced that the murderer is not going to break-in and kill them.
Even in the most tranquil image, the director creates a sense of palpable menace, as though the air is tinged with the smells of blood and gore even though the shot may be of a perfectly kept garden.
It is also interesting that even though this film barely clocks in at an hour and twenty minutes, it feels like it goes on for an eternity.
The fourth Massacre movie is much easier to sit through, even though it's one of the strangest, dumbest, worst movies of all time.
The acting is poor, no story line (...even though I knew that there was not going to be much of one), the script was shocking and the jokes, which the film all about, simply NOT FUNNY.
Let's begin with the fact that most of its ninjas are white, even though that some are Chinese.
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that Mark Jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film, it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better I've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no.
In every scene there are children playing in their houses and outside even thought school was in session during the time this occurred.
My favorite plot point is Bobby's aspiration to become an Olympic roller skating gold medalist...even though no one tells him it isn't an Olympic event.
But it is a very elegant movie, and along the way you become quite sympathetic, even though all the stories describe infidelity and frigid bourgeous lives.
The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.
I was a male prostitute when i was young and this movie is so way off that i can't believe someone even thought of making it.
Don't overlook the first five minutes even though it's an uneventful set-up for what follows.
By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running.
So, even though you won't want to watch it, you could at least see the action.
Megan Gallagher is the only actor/actress in this movie that's actually believable even though Debbie Ann Thomas (Nurse Washington) was extremely good for the little she acted.
I imagine the creatures would be queued in right after the couple promises to survive for one another and hang on no matter what even though they fought non-stop for the first 100 minutes of the movie just like Bud and Lindsay.
First off, the cast has the same racial make up as USA for Africa with a Latino girl hanging out with an Asian girl, a black girl, and what I originally thought was some lost member of the Russian Aristocricy but ended up being poor even though she had a huge house and her introduction to the movie dealt w/ her enormous shoe collection: funny, a movie that tries to break down walls still has plenty of stereotypes.
even though we're in high school, we were expecting to find something that we'd be able to watch, but instead we found ourselves laughing hysterically at every single word that came out of each character's mouth.
the storyline jumped all over the place, beginning with the girls entering their freshman years, then all of a sudden it flashes "two years later", and we're supposed to believe they're juniors, even though they look exactly the same and have no physical change whatsoever.
Meredith - even though a freshman - has divided the entire academy into clicks (emo's, skaters, geeks, potheads, jocks, tree-huggers and other assorted losers).
Minor spoilers below:  - Bertrand had less direction for Marc Barbe, but she did ask him to not play his scenes with Kurylenko like he wanted to seduce her, even though the character seems to know exactly what she needs.
The judge who presided over Haley's plagiarism case admitted that "I did not want to destroy him" and so allowed him to settle quietly - even though, he acknowledged, Haley had repeatedly perjured himself in court.
Only Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley are worth watching, even though Foley is tragically underused yet again.
I was lying, this film is pretty awful even though a scene in a doctors waiting room is quite freaky.
The parents hate each other, joined together only to get through this, even though they fight terribly.
While it does end OK (I guess, even though it's sort of doggie incest), I personally was disgusted by the unhappy nature of this movie.
The mysterious killer is also there, he most definitely resists arrest & even though Grant repeatedly shoots him he kills Phil by biting his neck.
Much like other people here, I was disgusted by the superficial and petty characters (even though at first glance the story lines appear to offer some good values).
And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature.
It's still on though even though during a recent live Halloween investigation it became clear that head investigator Grant was guilty of trying to pass off a fake voice and on the same show tried making it seem like his jacket was pulled on by a ghost, when it was clear he was doing it himself by something rigged in his pocket.
So, even though I'm not keen to watch the movie again, I would like to see the TV trailers for it!
No fingerprints appeared to have been taken or checked for (even though at the denouement it could clearly be seen that "dabs" were left all over said murder scene), and any reference to or collection of written statements were completely overlooked.
The characer "Wet" has a faded scar in one scene; a few scenes later another character is commenting on how she just got a bad scar on her face from a beating, then, minutes later (days later in movie-speak), her scars are all red a fresh, even though she had them way before the mention of any beating.
Bentley had none of Farfrae's charisma, which disappointed me, even though I know that the movie didn't have to copy the book.
The leading kid is a real doofus and the kid in the wheelchair seems to know so much about what's going on, even though he doesn't appear until later in the story.
If this was the kind of movie intended to keep viewers away from their TVs, I can't imagine it succeeded in doing so -- even though I understand it was a box office hit in its time.
The character development was terrible the direction was all over the place and the acting is probably some of the worst i have ever seen in anything plus add shoddy camera work and you have the likes of wicked lake even though there are some nice nude scenes there just anit nothing here i can recommend this is seriously bad.
This movie also feels totally fresh, even though it features all of the formulaic elements, such as a saloon-fight, cattle-driving, card-playing, a hero who becomes sheriff, scruffy looking villains and stuff like that.
This is one of Wayne's poorest films, even though it's refreshing to see him in a different sort of movie.
There probably was no way to do the multi-leveled story lines justice except maybe in a ten-hour miniseries, but even so, what can account for Mandy Patemkin's daughter never growing older even though he has made three successful films since the start of the movie?
E.L Doctorow hoped that "Ragtime" would be made into a t.v miniseries which is really the only way i could ever see it working, even though the musical version in 1998 did an impressive job of adapting the novel.
Likewise, the story of the immigrant Tateh (a fine performance from Mandy Patinkin) is too briefly seen, even though they do include the episode of him kicking out his unfaithful wife (played by an unknown Fran Drescher), which was eliminated from the Musical.
Another example (a large one at that) is that even though one person in the film claims he is haunted by what happened everyday and that he is against the church (due to a lawsuit he's filed about 18 years later), the Church is still a big part of his life.
Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones.
Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say: "They could be anything"!!!
(In the event, so honourable that Caine is prepared to shoot Churchill in cold blood, even though he realises that Hitler's regime is evil and the war is lost.)
This is NOT a gay romance, or gay love story (even though there is a kiss and some meaningful / longing looks).
The cast isn't necessary all bad either - especially Lee de Broux (RoboCop) is nice to see, even though he doesn't have much to work with.
The acting is, even though you wouldnt think it's possible, worse then the script.
Davis's boyfriend (John Hodiak) is uncomfortable with the attention Davis is giving to Milland, even though there is no romantic angle to it.
Kirk beams down to the planet Gideon and finds himself on an exact duplicate of the Enterprise but doesn't realise this since the 'set up' is so convincing--even though he meets Odona, its lone occupant.
Odona was a wonderful actor--and a good foil for captain Kirk even though their romance has little basis in fact.
The camp factor needle hits "HIGH" as soon as we are introduced to Mercedes McCambridge appearing in a warden's uniform, barking orders in a faux-German accent (even though her name is Thelma Diaz) and giving Marie a backhand across the face for using her name instead of her number, "99".
4/10...and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea of how to spell his name!
They have a blow-hard boarder, Pat O'Brien, living with them and the boy idolizes and believes in this man--even though practically everything he tells them is pure bull.
Despite all this, the boy remains convinced that O'Brien is his friend--even though at any point O'Brien COULD have gone to the police and told him the truth and had the boy released.
Unfortunately, since "The Ring Two" is rated PG-13, there should be no expectations that she will do any of the stuff she did in "Mulholland Dr.," even though she does tease all the guys in the audience by asking her son if he wants her to get in the tub with him.
Not one person looked like they new any martial arts except Gary Daniels, who even though is a pro-fighter never threw a punch the whole movie.
this sparked my attention because later in the movie they saw white dragon on a Japanese comic, they were wondering who he was, even though they were informed of him in the first FIVE MINUTES of the movie.
They rarely ever do anything to the engine so even though you have car that has a TV in every seat and a stereo system that could cause permanent hearing loss, you are still driving the same old car underneath.
even though the violence was unrealistic (I mean, severing a head with a kitchen knife?
I've seen a solid handful of the Gemser 'Emmanuelle' films by this point, and I've had this one laying around for years-so I figured I'd finally give it a shot (even though it's an 'Emmanuelle' film in name only).
So, 1 out of 10, even though it deserves a 0.
All in all, this was a "coming of age" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from "boys to men".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound.
The guy who runs the general store sells beer, even though it's in a dry county--but the kids don't know.
This is a dreary TV movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a "Charlie's Angels" deal,it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent C.A.
And even though I would never refer to myself as a liberal or a Democrat, I was opposed to the war in Iraq from day one.
When and if I go to New York City, I'm going to stay there, even though I know it's expensive.
Krrish is being promoted as Indias first superhero movie even though that genre is probably the oldest in Indian film history.
One thing I noticed about this cheese wedge was that it tried to look like it was taking place in North America even though it was made in Spain: 1- A portrait of George Washington hangs on the wall in the main setting.
The band doesn't like Laura very much, even though she's pretty much the only fan the band will ever have.
This "movie" made me laugh even though it wasn't meant to be a comedy (I think).
And yes, you can still identify CG even though the shaders are extremely good and I do not want to know how much post-processing they put over it.
However, it is Pandey that gives a stand out performance even though his role is mediocre and pale in comparison to Benicio Del Toro in "Snatch".
even though they lack everything else, but it was still nicely done in animation wise.
This film is unforgivably bad, what's worse is that nobody can sense the force within Palpatine (even though he is a Sith Lord).
(*SPOILER*)I had trouble believing Russell didn't see through that old-man getup and didn't think the ending was very likely, even though it does seem like a heck of an idea for a conclusion.
And it goes on: Abe gives up the crown piece to Prince Nuada even though his hostage (the princess) isn't in ANY danger whatsoever; for some reason, Princess Nuala sacrifices herself AND her brother to save the life of Hellboy, who she wouldn't even care about if it weren't for the fact that he's the main protagonist and the audience is supposed to be rooting for him; Selma Blair's character tells Hellboy that she's pregnant to give him a reason to live (this whole scene was about as subtle as a brick.
Not to mention seeing Bela Lugosi in color (even though the color is gangrenous and blotchy).
Every character in Scared to Death acts so suspiciously it becomes both irritating & distracting, I mean do these people want to be suspected of murder even though it hasn't even happened yet?!
What is weird is that while the show has obviously turned in to a train wreck, it is still on even though you can tell no one cares anymore... Their daughter has been replaced twice, even going from a brune girl to a blonde girl between 2 episodes, but if you can't tell that it's a sign even the producers don't care anymore then keep watching by all means!
"Reefer Madness" falls into the same category, even though the production of it was somewhat better, with an added bonus for the folks involved with the making of it ...It was also meant to be used as a "teaching" tool.
There's also the painfully comic Maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals).
I just wish I'd never seen it........... For all of those who really love the book (and know it from childhood like I do) steer clear from this production even though the package might catch your attention.
--even though he looks defeated.
Sangster regretfully reverts to all the dreadful genre-clichÃ©s (secrets in the attic, slamming doors, hidden roomsÂ) and he depicts his native country England like one gigantic stereotype where everyone stops their activities to drink tea and where people continue to talk with a sophisticated tone of voice even though they're pure evil.
And telling Mr Carrey to get off the screen (even though he can't here me) because his interpretation of Count Olaf was dire.
Thus ensuring that a few Doors fans like myself would give it a try even though we were well aware after his awful LA Woman interpretation that Ray Manzarek had the directing talent of a half drunk chimp on crack.
I am probably being harsh, but just like all kinds of white rappers showed up after Eminem took the world by storm, so has some other wannabes trying to become the next Tony Jaa, (even though his success here in the states has at the very least been limited) Granted this kid did O.K.
He was supposed (debatedly) to have been a 5th or 6th century Ancient Briton, some say with Roman ancestry, and to have lived long before the Norman Conquest was even thought of.
Sean Connery was not a good choice for playing Arthur, they got a Scot playing an English King and even though I'm a Bond fan, Sean Connery is a particularly good actor after that.
They don't shock too much even though the film tries it very much.
The acting is again non existent and the film was pretty hard to sit through for the second time, even though the film runs only slightly over one hour.
This movie will bore you to tears if you try to watch the whole thing (even though it's relatively short...it's THAT bad).
I have nothing against films being shot on video or digital, even though the sound is often awful.
This movie never gets interesting even though that the beginning try to hook you up.
Unfortunately the script and elaboration are far too messy to make it become a memorable film and I simply can't recommend it wholeheartedly, even though I really wanted to.
I think I was way too confident that I would like "Underworld", even though I wasn't expecting an absolute classic.
The only somewhat decent thing I can say for this turkey is that it was semi-interesting to see Patric Knowles cast as an insensitive jerk for a change, and the 3 measly minutes we spend in Dr. Rx's laboratory with a chained gorilla is a tad unsettling ... even though I can't for the life of me see how it fits into the rest of this picture!
And it's done to death in this remake, even though, in the original Andromeda Strain, it was done just right.
So even though I feel that it is an important topic, it could have been covered in a better way, or at least it should have had a Long message in the end.
So good in fact, that they decide to market it as a new kind of ice cream treat, even though it's "not" ice cream.
Abbott does the familiar bit where he thinks Lou has been killed and delivers a long, mournful monologue about what a great guy Lou was and how he, Abbott, is to blame... even though Lou's standing right there.
They see things that they can relate to in their personal lives, and that endears the characters to them, even though the characters are merely personality templates.
The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good.
-When they are filling up with gas, i find it very curious that even though they know not to go anywhere alone, Jim decides to go wandering into a dark shack by himself for absolutely no reason.
The script is solid and the characters are believable (there are some real-life situations thrown in as well, so there is some sort of viewer-character connections that can be made), even though about ninety-nine percent of this film is something of pure fantasy.
the characters are dull and even though it may be trying to create a retro feeling, it is out dated and no longer pleasant to the tastes of viewers.
I think that this series tells you that it is alright for men to beat up their wives which may lead to the wives beating their children, or they could be forced to admit they do by their animal husbands, but the wives should still be punished, even though they're being led to believe this is the way to treat people.
BRIAN DENNEHY at least gets a big hand, and JOHN HURT is reminded that two heads are better than one, even though the other one is very small and seems to have originally belonged to KLAUS KINSKI.
And even though it's too late for ONJ and Kelly, it would be great to see Hollywood remake this film as the frantic screwball comedy it should have been.
Case in point: the fact that Olivia Newton John rarely sings on screen, even though this is a musical and we hear songs sung by Olivia and yet Olivia is probably seen performing her songs just a couple of times on screen.
I just watched Superman III and was excited to see Richard Pryor on the cover, but then I even thought as I was paying for the rental "wait, why am I excited to see Richard Pryor more than Christopher Reeve?
I sat through this film even though around the 20 minute mark I wanted it to be over.
The later TV adaptations, coming into being alongside Christopher Awdry's extension of the book series, wandered somewhat further afield from the feel of the originals, but were still recognisably on-model even though I am aware that Wilbert became somewhat frosty towards Britt Allcroft for deviating from his vision.
The dialogue is absolutely horrible, there is no plot, and even though there are some decent actors, Freddie Prinze Jr ruins it by coming off as a big dope.
The cast was alright, even though the acting was more or less worthless.
But, Slade wasn't Robin's father, even though the series made slight hints at that.
If you're supposedly making a "horror" movie, learn about what is scary, not simply "ooh, it's zombies, and even though it's been done now a thousand times, people will think ours are great!"
You could tell that the director did not have real control over the film, even thought the idea was interesting he just shoot from the hip.
One of the films main problems is the talkative dialogue; even though it's French, there are so many useless scenes of non stop talking, that you can go to sleep, wake up, and you would have missed nothing.
I can accept the fact that this librarian will take him in, treat his wounds, and put herself in extreme amounts of danger even though he is a complete stranger and, probably, is the last person you should trust, all because he saved her life.
Almost as if he assumed that we wouldn't see El Mariachi, even though Columbia, according to Robert Rodriguez' diaries in Rebel Without a Crew, said they'd package both movies together when they were negotiating for the rights.
OK maybe it's supposed to be there just because no-one ever even thought about editing the sound and that reality works that way: what you don't alter is most likely to stay the way it is.
I will say this, the acting was quite good and I liked all the performances even though Stapleton bore an uncanny resemblance to Jack Nicholson (probably intended) but this was one of those movies I was waiting to end so I could put something else in.
I seriously recommend this movie purely because you will laugh/cringe so much, even though you most likely won't last all the way through.
To me it has the potential of a good plot and even though there wasn't a big name cast, I really thought it would be okay.
steals a video tape that wouldn't have excused Jackson's behaviour anyway, even though the film plainly thinks so.
This picture definitely belongs on a top ten list or top one hundred list even though you never see it on any list.
Interestingly, even though most of the people hated Anne for what had happened to Katherine, Henry's actions made the people sympathetic to Anne as they did not believe her guilty of what she was accused.
Portman does an acceptable job portraying the character from the bookÂeven though this character is not the true Anne Boleyn.
I even thought the end, reminiscent of The Sentinel, was just quirky enough to be interesting.
It's not funny (even though it's supposed to be a spy spoof), it has little story, and the "romance" the movie hinges on, is contrived nonsense.
If someone like me with no scriptwriting talent was writing this movie, and I wanted to show that even though the leading man looks like a bit of a playboy, he has the potential to be a committed and caring husband and father, I might think of having him mentor a cute kid and taking him to baseball games and stuff, and that would have comic potential because when the character needed to be told certain things, I could have the kid saying it and it would be precocious and funny and cute.
The British agents put on the Germans uniforms that are, miraculously, perfect fits for Owens Falken & Hall even though the three are different in hight weight pants and suite size.
It shows up that a lot of American chicks are shallow, as they still go for the dropkicks, even though most of them have slept with heaps of women.
The plot trudges along through double-crosses and betrayals involving various police officers, mobsters, and the obligatory love interest (Kathryn Harrold, given little do since, even though his wife is awful to him and he's technically dead, he's still a dutiful married man).
Both of whom are in their early fifties and love lorn, even though they won't admit it.
His films have enamoured critics for 10 years now and this one is no different even though it is a shadow of the opulence that we are used to from him.
I can quite often enjoy a movie even though I know it's pretty bad, because there is usually something there worth enjoying.
The way rednecks quickly turn zombie-hunting into a cheerful sporting exercise in "Dawn Of The Dead" (1976) has far more realism, even though that movie was a bit of a comedy, too.
When I saw it in the store I grabbed it and payed $14 (even though i usually buy used films much cheaper) for it seeing that I was already interested in the film and it was attractively packaged.
I am not sure what the director was thinking.... Was was his objective and I even thought this was pieces of a movie that never made it to the theater.
Claude Rains, Fay Bainter, and Donald Crisp were capable of saving just about any film, but even though they ganged up on this one, it was hopeless, not least because the movie's arteries are again clogged with the frothy Lane sisters and three feeble counterparts (Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn).
And even though they've added new scenes that change the storyline slightly here and there, the scenes that they cut out would not have conflicted with the "new" material at all!
Chantal Janzen's character is for some odd reason extremely underused, even though her character plays an important role in the story.
Eventually he can take no more, divorces his wife and goes off to write what he pleases in peace, leaving his wife to marry a long-time admirer (Irving Pichel) who provides her with money and status even though she is not in love with him.
In short, I hated his character, which ruined the film for me, even though without those qualities there would not have been a film.
The problem is that even though the characters actions made no sense through the movie, it wasn't funny.
Oh, she can't renounce her vows (even though technically she *can*).
Of course even though he's married to a stunning women, he feels chemistry with Laura and vice versa.
It begins almost at the outset where a police patrol plane begins to strafe the smugglers plane with machine gun fire even though it suspects it has people hidden in it, continues as the smuggling pilot remedies the situation and then goes on from there.
And this rich lady is less interesting, being more one-dimensional, than the one appearing in Swept Away, even though both were played by the same fine actress, Mariangela Melato.
Guy's brother dies so he comes out of retirement to take his place (even though he hasn't flown in years and can just simply hop a plane) and avenge him, female pilot gets heckled for being a female and calls them on it, guy falls in love with female and everyone sees it coming, and my favorite....guy breaks out of prison and proceeds to take out 30 guys single handedly armed with barely anything.
Camera is the piece of film that made me realise the genius of David Cronenberg, even though I had loved most of the films I have seen by him I now have a more profound respect for him and I'm going to watch all of his work that I can get my hands into.
And even though almost every character in this film is repugnant, it's even more repugnant to cut their legs off and ask them to walk.
There's not much to say about this one; every single gag falls completely flat - even though it's parodying a lot of the same flicks that Not Another Teen Movie went after.
Alas, although the knight's role is little more than a cameo in Alice, the writers here have mercilessly expanded the part, even though it meant treading on the lines of more capable players like break-your-heart Rita La Roy (a most engaging and super-attractively regal young duchess) and Kay Hughes' pleasing Cheshire Cat who, as we might expect, disappears from the action, alas, for long spells.
It showed that even though those girls have kids they are still just like us.
Alida Valli is the placid widow of a wealthy, blind British Colonel who was poisoned; she's charged with his murder and is defended by barrister Gregory Peck, a married man with an impeccable courtroom track record who immediately becomes obsessed with her even though she seems to regard him with disdain.
It deals with being isolated even though you have family.
The granddaughter is forbidden to see the grandmother as an eleven year old child but then makes no effort to see her as an adult even though she professes undying love for her?
Was she in love with both of them or just in love with love, even though she commented, continuously, about not believing in love.
The film is mostly a one-lady show where Julie Harris plays a 12 year-old even though she was in her mid-late 20s when she did this.
And even though they are supposed to be hiding in the country they spend a lot of time driving around in a fire engine red mustang, going to the park and stuff.
However, I don't like the film very much, even though it is quite faithful to the book in both content and tone; for in spite of this, it has lost the spark, and the vision, that the writing possessed, and appears coarse and clumsy in comparison.
But that's a big deal, since I've never even thought about giving a Troma film anything higher than a 1.
The film fails to generate any kind of sympathy for it's characters, and even though the acts being committed are horrifying and sick, it's hard to care...which just makes it boring.
And even though I love war movies/series such as Band of Brothers, even put in that light, this series has little or nothing to recommend it.
I feel that, even though I really don't want to, I should maybe watch this film again - to maybe see if I missed out any important details or something because from my experience this film has very little to redeem its creation.
Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more.
I expect something better with the prequel that is coming out this summer even though I don't think the people they chose to be the new Flintstones look like them as the first cast did.
However it was fun seeing Adam Ant and Mary Woronov as part of the tribe (even though they have no dialogue).
I just don't understand how this show was even thought about putting it on air, because its just so bad.
The only thing worthwhile in this movie is a) the soundtrack (which was fitting), b) the cinematography (which was mostly fitting, good high key lighting, good color combination, fitting aura.. even though the Mise en Scene lacked originality or thought.. docks and guns..
And even though his Irish(yes, apparently Bison is Irish) parents died just after he was born and he was raised on the streets of Bangkok with nothing but Thai people, adult Bison somehow managed to retain a spot-on Irish accent.
The film ends with Gen meeting Chun Li with an ad for the "Street Fighter" tournament, hinting that Bison is behind it even though he was (seemingly?)
Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li, even though she had a privileged life, and a loving mother?
Doesn't pretend to feel pity, and even though the beginning might be even considered dramatic, it made me laugh out loud several times.
Edward G Robinson never disappoints (even though he does kind of sound like Chico Marx in this) and Richard Conte is great.
I saw "The Bachelor" tonight with my boyfriend at the dollar theater tonight, and even though I loved the classic romantic story, and even got a few laughs out of it, I noticed some subtle messages in the movie that disturb me.
And Renee Zellweger is fine, even though her cinematic persona has by now overstayed its welcome.
Somehow this bright, beautiful 20-year-old has managed to get through her entire life, including four years of college, without once meeting a person who has affirmed her intelligence and her creativity, even though she's smart enough to have been accepted into Harvard Law.
Simply put: even though he had cowed to the Amerikan Way, the military would NOT have left Lancaster to live in peace in his newly-created outer 'burb of White-Man-Ville.
As some other reviewers have pointed out, even though this character is meant to be satirical it quickly becomes irritating and one-note.
This movie, even though it was animated, was serious, realistic, and had a great plot.
The Mother of Mena and her brother can understand the radio, even though she's a zombie.
Inexplicably, Maj. John Pitcairn, commanding the advance party, picks a fight with the men, even though they do not block his path.
I remember forcing myself to look at their "masterpieces" and compliment them, even though they had little or no talent.
The film is dubbed even though you can see Jackie talking english, the backgrounds and action scenes are very low quality, and most of all, Jackie Chan shows us once again that his humor gets old all because of his lack of acting skills.
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
The 80's series was a classic even though I do think that David Hasselhoff is an absolutely shambolic actor, which really comes through when he plays two roles in the episodes "Goliath" and "Goliath Returns".
Sorority House Massacre just has to be the most hysterical slasher movie of the mid to late 80's even though it was never intended to be this way!
Still, I'd watch this movie again and again, it's as good as any horror spoof even though we're not supposed to snigger when one of the girls gets butchered and her stud boyfriend runs into the house naked except for some sneakers and cheesy white socks, sprouting, in a deep jock voice with twitching eyebrows "Some guy just killed Tracy"...Classic!!!
Of course, this "program-clip" is referred to as a virus, a generic Hollywood name for anything that is not from AOL or Microsoft, even though it is the precise opposite of a virus - not only does it not replicate, but it removes itself.
Now don't get me wrong even though I am a guy I still enjoy some chick flicks like Down to You, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Boys and Girls.
I didn't like the plot and even though they tried to dramatize it a little bit at the end it doesn't compensate and it will leave instead of Âwanting more', Âwanting something'.
But since its sci-fi, I can't go into much detail because at the end it's just not real even though some sci-fi films seem more believable than this.
I caught it from around the beginning and thought it was a Japanese movie somehow on the foreign movie channel - Japanese actors, Japanese dialog (even though the lead still had a bit of an accent).
even though the characters names are the same they look nothing alike, it isn't the same person.
Don't ask me how I did it, but even though this is technically a botched and splicey patchwork of a movie, I had a good time with it.
It was the first programme in a while that I couldn't sit all the way through, I even thought there was funny moments in the 'Green Green Grass' (only fools spin off).
It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little if any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that.
says the elderly woman slyly after Uncle Charlie introduces himself, and believe me, you will know every sundry detail of Uncle Charlie's hard knock life, even though it's probably better that you didn't.
I won't ruin it for anyone (even though there's nothing to really ruin), but you pretty much know how the story is going play out within the first five minutes.
My favourite scene in the film is when Mr. No Legs is facing up to someone who wants to kill him, Mr. No Legs climbs out of his chair & puts his fists up to the guy even though without legs Mr. No Legs doesn't reach past his waist!
There are some neat car stunts, a few nice fight scenes & some truly memorable sequences featuring Mr. No Legs as the toughest & meanest guy in the film even though he hasn't any legs.
There are some good special effects, I didn't think Farrell was that bad, and even though the premise of a blind superhero is ridiculous nonsense, there is still some fun to be had.
The only thing remotely okay in this movie is the FX, even though it's all used to show disgusting gore that the viewing audience doesn't really want to see.
Oh man...  For better entries in this sub-genera (I'm picking more obscure ones) try, "Death Weekend," "Fortress," or even "Rituals" even though that last one is more of a "Deliverance" copy than anything else.
I won't give out any spoilers even though I hated this movie...but here's why!
Well once again a DVD box at the rental store drew me into a wasted night.Who could resist a movie that claims to have been banned in 37 countries?So ,even though by now I should know better,I rent this thing and take it home.
But still, even though the idea was great in the end it was the ham fisted execution of the concept that will probably make any self respecting movie go-er recoil in horror the most.
or that andie would quit her job or even the story because of how she feels (even though she hated it anyway).
The plot such as it is is strange in that there are no vampires next door even though plot synopsis of the movie says there is.
The really crazy clothes, definitely the 80's hair styles (even though this was done in the 90's), and acting are at the bottom of the barrel and highly worth viewing.
I went to see my ageing parents and it was on, at around the halfway mark - "Hello," I thought, "even though I've never seen this before, it looks unmistakeably like Irwin Allen."
Somehow, he is able to see that eruption is imminent, even though the head of the lab, John Webster (John Considine), doesn't.
Kris Marshall is particularly unconvincing and looks uncomfortable in the role, even though this is the second series.
The story makes no sense even though its very obviously inspired (stolen) by other famous movies and uses the same clichÃ©s all over again.
I had an attack of the giggles part way through the movie, and it worsened with the ludicrous plot developments, culminating in a full-fledged laughing attack when the Tibetan monk at the end spoke so badly they had to subtitle him... even though he was attempting to speak English.
Leslie Nielsen is not quite up to his usual Frank Drebin deadpan comedy routines, and even though Peter MacNicol delivers a note perfect Dwight Frye (Renfield in the 1931 version), as well as good turns from Harvey Korman and Brooks himself, the final result is depressingly unfunny.
Supposedly based on this Paganini document, the band produce a new (and equally awful) song, and decide to make a video-clip in Paganini's old mansion - The mansion in which the famous violin virtuoso had once signed a pact with the devil... Sound cheesy, and it is, but not only is it very, very dumb cheese, even though the film is only 80 minutes long, the temptation to fast-forward becomes bigger with each passing minute after a while.
Gooding visits him in prison to try to find out what happened even though it's none of his business.
There is no plot line, no events that will lead them to even change their views of each other at this point of time(half the movie gone)and seriously, there are such little chemistry or sexual tension between the two leads that I for one, even though knowing that this is to come, still can't quite imagine them falling for each other.
i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year.
Part 3 was decent, as was part 4, even though it had absolutely NOTHING to do with The Gods Must Be Crazy, except that it was crazy for them to associate it to the series.
I'm a real fan of Woody Allen's, and I even thought that "Interiors", which the critics carved up, wasn't so bad.
Howard (Denholm Elliott) loves Lane, who loves Peter (Sam Waterston), who has a thing for Stephanie (Diane Wiest), who is married but returns Peter's feelings even though she knows that she is betraying Lane, blah, blah, blah.
Meanwhile Diane loves only Diane, even though she is partnered with Lloyd (Jack Warden), a melancholy physicist who is depressed over how utterly meaningless existence is.
The girl then shakes her head in dismay, even though she wanted her brother to save her in the first place.
do not see it even though it is free.do not waste your time with this.the age limit must be +18 for this silly show.if you don't have psychological problems,you can not laugh any of the jokes.
The reason this deserves a 3, is because I did enjoy some of the songs (which were spread out, making us wait through nonsensical sub-plots), and even though it was totally random, some of the daydreams amused me.
The songs are simple and, even though the Paul and Linda McCartney hit "Wonderful Christmas Time" is listed as one of them, it is only a small snip-it version of perhaps 30 seconds.
Overall, it's a sad commentary on the lack of originality and quality of the film when the likes of Monroe, Gaynor and especially O'Connor can't even save it, even though individually and collectively they do have their moments; the problem is those moments are just too few and far between.
It jumps from idea to idea (and even though to thought), hoping to grip onto something that sticks.
I am the bride of Jesus", which just cracked me up, even though I think it was supposed to be a serious moment.
"Triple Cross" is one of the movies Terence Young wished he'd never done, and it is bad indeed, even though it had all the ingredients a good box office hit needs: an international all-star cast (Christopher Plummer, Romy Schneider, Yul Brynner, Trevor Howard, Gert FrÃ¶be, Jess Hahn, Claudine Auger from "Thunderball", Howard Vernon and Bernard Fresson), a massive budget, a director at the height of his international fame, a Bond-like story, a Bond-like score (Georges Garvarentz) and Bond-like locations (Jersey, London, Paris, Lisbon, Southern France).
The occasional good moments and the reason why I don't give it an even lower rating happen thanks to the narration and an inspired, brief black-and-white footage from the 60's, the great soundtrack, plus Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances (even though I could never relate to their characters, they fitted them perfectly).
It's hard to really hate the film, because you know it means well....but that doesn't mean that you won't be looking at your watch frequently, even though it runs only 80 minutes.
This movie can claim to be a low, low budget gore movie without any attempt to actually any talent even though it thinks it has.
Michael O'Keefe had sex with a minor, even though he had children himself.
People felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society.
None of the torpedoes hit the sub, even though no decoys are fired, and yet the sub still takes hits.
and even though none of the fighting in this film is too well done, the setups are creative, and the grittyness of them helps make them entertaining.
The second story, a slapstick vampire story which is actually a film in the film, is the worst of the three, very simple and even more silly, even though it is this one which stars both Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland.
Marc Anthony captured Lavoe's on stage mannerisms perfectly, and even though I would have preferred to hear actual Lavoe recordings, he did sing well.
The Imp is the most annoying character even though he is supposed to be the most lovable.
It's the only cute thing in the movie, even though it is all about her unsuccessful attempts at controlling the weather.
Donald Gibb shows up to reprise his role, even though he's play a different character.
The 'wonder' and awe is not there... even though you're led up to the wall and bashed into it at the end.
The ending of the film, even though it's a bit downbeat, was just what the film needed when you realize that dreams are best kept to oneself and in their right place.
Jody never tells the police that her stepfather abuses her - even though she has the bruises to prove it.
The Alien-queen is blown up, even though she's already been blown up FOUR F-CKING TIMES!!!!

And even though the story of Orlando could have been interesting this 90 minute film seemed like it was well over 2hrs.
The writing is quite lousy... clichÃ©s are plentiful, it was drenched in naivety, predictability abounds, the story never really captivates(in spite of its title, I could easily see people falling asleep during it), even though it manages to rip off far more established sci-fi titles(including Independence Day and The Day The Earth Stood Still... the latter being from when obvious messages in this genre were at least more accepted and usual, and actually a well-produced piece of celluloid; this was simplistic, offensive... modern propaganda).
I don't think either is all that great but given the choice to watch either again, I'd take the Garbo film, even though it's always good to watch Astaire and Charisse stepping out, so to speak.
If you like Austin Powers, you will probably like this, even though it is not as popular.
Time and time again these girls absolutely refuse to leave the house even though there is a driller killer on the loose and they are "afraid" for their lives.
The Left will cheer it to high heavens, even though it is neither a good film, nor an unbiased representation of facts.
If everyone would watch this movie, take a second to think about what they feel, and then take out of it the message that rings true to them, this movie will have had the effect a journalistic piece should have, even though I doubt that is the effect it was aiming at.
Kirk, always the first to kill a god (see the awful STAR TREK V movie and the "Val" episode for more about this), orders a sexy crew member to refuse Apollo's love in order to tick him off--even though she really does think the guy is pretty buff and sweet.

There is one scene that is constructed and shot in such a way that it could resemble a sex scene in a film even though it's not.
in the early '80's, and even though I was still kind of young, I thought it was awful.
Jimmy got the sh*t end of the stick, in the money he robbed, even though he was the one who put his a** on the line doing the robberies and at the same taking an eager, looking for both action and excitement, Sally along with him on his crime spree.
I've seen all the other St Trinians films, and the superb (and superior) forerunner The Happiest Days Of Their Lives, so I felt that I should watch the 1980 film, even though I'd read somewhere that it was poor.
Elliot Gould did M*A*S*H that same year, and built a well-deserved reputation as an excellent actor, even though he's had his cinematic ups-and-downs since then, like most actors.
He paints with a broad brush that even though the people working in corporations may be moral, the institution of the corporation is inherently evil.
There are other bits & pieces that I didn't understand either like the 'dead' body Rosy shows Marvin under the drain cover at the start yet even though he takes photos of it it never mentioned or seen again, maybe I did miss something I don't know.
Susan Sarandon is almost invisible in the action of the movie, even though her relationship with Woodcock (now that's a name!)
This disconnect made the movie seem not very gory, even though I guess if you bought what they were selling, it was pretty gory.
Basically it's their way of saying, 'this could possibly happen, so we'll say it did happen and make people believe it happened, even though it never really did happen.'
Some inventive touch that would surpass the original, but even though every scene has a counterpart in Friedkins film, the Turkish version of the scene is always vastly inferior to the point were it's almost depressing.
One soldier shows another soldier a war wound that he says could have gotten him discharged with 10% pay, but decided to remain in the service so that he could collect his full pay, even though he apparently hates the war and feels his country is neglecting him.
The scenery is really nice (even though I personally can't stand being in the north of Sweden because of all the snow and the freezing cold), but lovely nature pictures of it doesn't make up for the complete lack of anything resembling a proper plot.
Granted the movie "Zardoz" was strange too, and it made no sense as well, but it had a certain style and actually seemed to work even though there are still parts of it I have no clue as to what they were about.
This movie is a disaster from beginning to end and I justify my summary because even though it is suppose to be a terror movie there is not terror anywhere.
Heres where we get into spoilerville...  1) John is an excellent marksman, yet he manages to miss one dog randomly and hit a girls leg even though every other shot in the movie he makes is dead on.
Too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'Ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters.
Persons with a strong curiosity about that period might find this movie interesting, even though this is by no means one of the better movies dealing with that subject matter.
Gay is an impossibility in that era and not even eluded to even though one of her friends seems ever so lesbian to me.
The first segment is appropriately spooky; the second ingenious and unconventional (for TV); and the third, even though it is the weakest, a worthy capper on this film.
I remember thinking that Wing Commander 3 would have made a great movie (even though the video game was among the first video games to have a full cast of actors and sets).
Also, even though the script is week, the direction is good.
It's a good story and well worth watching, even though it was mildly let down by the acting.
I guess the spark is gone, even though they shared the steamiest kiss in the entire series.
I felt it lost a point for the ending, which even though I had a feeling was coming to some extent, was still disappointing.
I thought this was a very well done movie even though it had one of those disjointed plots that are so common with European flicks,(the ending had me totally confused).
I've got to say that I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Ãlex de la Iglesia's films, as this guy has an absolutely great sense of humour; and even though this movie is only half a comedy, it's far funnier than many films designed only to make its audience laugh.
And YES I do enjoy the first 30 minutes where the characters are in their teens, even though it seems a little far-fetched how short time it takes for the boys to start killing the competition (I am not spoiling anything this is 20 minutes into the movie or something).
It is such a great change to see a new show on television that has nothing to do with "reality" or superheroes {even though I like one or two of them} It is refreshing to watch a show where the idea hasn't been done to death, I think the originality is one of the major things I like about this show.
Unfortunately its surfer subject matter did not draw many non-enthusiasts to the theatre; even though the film is a lot more than surfing, containing a very original universal message about the process of living and changing.
The ghost is what makes the story interesting even though Katherine(Elisha) is the only person in town who "believes" him.
I also found the killer clown's remarks entertaining, even though none of them really had much to do with the story.
There's zero suspense, or what else did you expect, and the screenplay stupidly enough often hints at supernatural powers even though there's no logical explanation for this.
The moneybag at the end leaves some hope for tomorrow, even though the hope is for most of the protagonists themselves too late.
The ending a wonderful elegiac surprise and even though the film is experimental it remains truly mainstream in its vision overall.
This made the conclusion so much more heart-wrenching, even though the consequences did seem a little clichÃ©d.
And of course there's the great Bela Lugosi in what seemed like a cameo, even though he's on the screen almost as much as the star of the movie the gorilla, role as Uncle Stevens creepy butler Peter.
I pretty much have to say that, even though these type of movies are so clichÃ©d, I was rooting for the young couple and half expected them to elope together to annoy her their respective parents.

Henry's condition makes him look like a selfish person, even though he has no control over the circumstances.

My favorite characters are Kate and Chelsea even though they aren't known as the nicest people at least they they are believable.
Nigel is intrigued by an entwining and serpentine tale Oscar tells him, and so are we, and even though it starts to sound incredulous, he has to return to Oscar's quarters to hear more.

DeSica still wanted to show the world what it was like in Italy during the darker times and even though he had a larger budget and professional actors in his films his attitude never really shifted.
Possibly Adamson's most famous film, and even though it's cheap, silly, trashy and completely nonsensical, there's enough going on here (and an interesting enough cast) to qualify it as a must see to die-hard horror fans.
The actors are really, really bad - and even though the main character plays a villain, he seems more like a sissy retarded wimp.
This is a mystery that is solved in the end, but it's not a simple explanation; even though the motives and means for Mike's murder are revealed, nothing is really settled; only more, deeper questions on top of questions emerge.

It is refreshing that the jurisdictional conflict between local police and the military does not take a stereotypic turn of heavy handed conspiracy and cover-up even though the military investigators are not cast in the best light.
Charlize Theron is beautiful even though she is playing a woman who is forced to act as non-sexy as possible to get on in her job in a male police force.
I have seen Kitano's latter films, Hana-bi, Brother, Tokyo Eyes & Gonin, and even though production values have improved, especially with Brother and Hana-Bi, I personally feel that Sonatine still remains Beat's best film to date.
Mickey tries them & says even though they're sh*t, he's in a slump & will try anything.
this is a great movie and i think it will be considered a classic the thing that pisses me off is that Marris isn't in the Hall of fame most people who don't know much about him think he only had that one good year when he broke the record but he was the MVP of the 1960 season and he played well throughout most of his career he should be in the hall of fame without a doubt there's four people that aren't in the hall of fame that should be shoeless Joe Jackson isn't there because he threw the world series even though he played excellent and Pete rose should be in there to it doesn't matter what he did off the field its what he did on the field that counts Marris is the next person not in i already explained why but the most shocking person not to be in the hall of fame is frank Robinson what the hell happened there
For example, the Yankees' last game of the regular season, which they hosted, drew a crowd of just 22,000 even though Maris entered the game tied with Ruth and even though the Yankees went on to win the World Series that year.
This is a sharp contrast to 1998, when McGwire regularly filled stadiums in pursuit of Maris' record even though McGwire's team didn't even make the playoffs that season.
I however can only give it 7 out of 10, even though I would like to give it more.
First of all, only Hitchcock would come out with something that could be termed a "light comedy" when the central figure in the film from beginning to end is a dead body, but a lot of Hitchcock's standard themes are very prevalent in the film, even though it differs so much from his traditional style.
Even she was unable to get herself into this one and only finished the movies because, even though you know how it will end, you just have to see it... well, because.
And now I go and watch this "Romasanta", waiting for some excitement, even though the cast wasn't that good (Elsa Pataky, Julian SandsÂ).
Film-making in Mexico hasn't changed a bit as far as content from the drug dealer and prostitute movies of the eighties, even though is a little bit more polished (to the point of being pretentious and exclusive).
That hormonal piece that gets excited at the gates of Heaven even though what awaits me is just another Battle.
Why (even though murder is a "deadly sin" and cannot be redeemed)?
Joe plays a jingle writer who dreams of being a serious musician, even though all of his "serious" songs still sound like extended jingles, and the classical piece he composes to show off his true talent would be better suited for a group of musical saw players instead of an orchestra.
Instead, come in for the great dialogue and a potential step towards making more computer-animated flicks for just teenagers and adults---even though this genre is almost always marketed towards the "rugrats."

It's important to remember that even though this is a US anti drugs film it was brought by a Hong Kong based distributor (Panorama Entertainment).
At first, this is an unlikely pairing but you know if you know anything about the great Dame Judi Dench (even though she prefer you call her just Judi, no Dame Judi or Ms. Dench).

Then back to Dave, Victor a completely unconcerned Fire Chief, even though his men have been missing for ages and the obligatory Dave's wife ringing him to find out where he is shot.
The plot jumped around non-stop, and it was practically impossible to follow, even though it was incredibly simplistic.
Of course, the film itself is low budget, contains mediocre acting, writing and directing (even though there are some surprisingly OK moments) but when Ernest is on the screen you can't help but smile and who cares if a film is good or not as long as it's funny?
The other girls may laugh, but when she gets into a fight with one of them, she manages to win her over afterwards so that they are friends, even though their parents are not.
There was something sincerely loving between them even though one's moral sensibilities are assaulted from the get go.
But definitely not for anyone, not for those who need special effects or to be blasted from the chair by action or violence... for a mature audience even though the message is about the kids the movie is for their parents, to change how sex is taught in school...
By the way, although it looked cool, why did Shaft bother to blow up the bunker at the end of the film even though the bad guy and all his men were dead?!
(Actually, Richard Jaeckel, Skip Homeier and Richard Boone played numerous bad guys who I still enjoyed watching even though I wanted them to 'get theirs'.)
Naturally the film caused a hystery due to its sadistic and graphic (but not gratuitous) violence and many producers and directors started to rip that film off in order to "satisfy" the audience that liked the violence in Deodato's film so much even though that is definitely not even the film's point, it is its theme, and everyone watching Holocaust because of its violence are closer to the film's message than they could have ever (dared to) thought.
It's very primal and hits the audience on a subconscious-level, even though it owes a debt to Romero.
Hammer folded shortly afterwards, and this movie contributed to that - even though it made a healthy profit.
It still is even though the year is 2005.
I have this movie 9 even though I could have easily given it 10.
Lastly, even though their acting may not be real hot, Gutterboy and Skank are fairly believable (and hilarious) characters.
If you accept that it takes two of the characters a long time to figure out who Jake really is, even though the evidence of his past is written on his back, the film is a decent revenge film.
When she awakes people think she has amnesia and even though she hasn't - she goes along with it.
I watched it with subtitles; even though the script is very substantial, it isn't necessary to follow up each conversation.
However, they're really disgusting also, and the final scene; even though the 'monster' is a doll, really is nightmarish.
His first 'Doctor Dolittle' movie was pretty decent, even though he'll never be able to truly replace Rex Harrison.
And I liked the whole concept of the curse (even though it doesn't make any sense).
The only thing that i think is bad with this movie is the child actors, they just look bored going round the mansion with straight faces even though they follow ghostly orbs into unknown places.
We sympathize with Marcus's situation, even though his actions are illegal.
It is definitely a psychological thriller and I felt like it gave me lots to think about after it ended even though I felt as though I was missing something during the movie.
Go see this movie, but be forewarned: even though most people are aware from the media or their own experience of what's going on today, watching this movie may make you become motivated enough to go out and help change things, if even in some small, personal way.
The answer is the pretty mysterious case of bodybuilder Sam Pasco, who seem to have appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared (having never acted in a film since) even though he really isn't bad at all in this movie.
Oddly, when confronted, they have no recollection that he had one, even though the audience saw he had one and saw pictures of the man with the mustache!
We have to realize that even though there is so much that makes Disturbia unique, at heart it is a very commercial effort.
Watch "Clerks" first (even though this one takes place first in chronological order).
But these things don't take away from sarcastic interplay and skits that are generated throughout the running time, even though it really seems like an eccentric melodrama with humorous overtones at times.
Also, a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall, rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.
The atmosphere is really dense and even though you barely see anything than blurry photos I was pretty creeped out in the first half of the movie.
I did, even though I was no fan of hers.

The best Sherlock Holmes films tend to be the ones with a horror element (such as The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Scarlet Claw), but even though this one offers nothing in the way of horror; it still manages to present an excellent mystery for Holmes to unravel.
I appreciate that they did not have to use fowl language and even though Hilda shows "some" bosom, It is not overly used.
It also was actually a good whodunit movie even though that was exactly what this movie was trying to spoof to a certain degree.
I especially liked his role in the movie even though he was a train robber and killed nearly everyone he met.
Again contrast this with the treatment of the Crusades where it is referred to as the Christian army (not European/French/Italian) even though the majority were mercenaries and Christian only because they were born in Europe.
This is one seriously incoherent mess of a film, and even though the 'Landmaster' truck still remains an ultra-cool method of transportation, the rest of the scenery and special effects are pathetic and not the least bit convincing.
To describe my relation to Hook in just a few words: A fantastic movie, even though I've never been fascinated by the Peter Pan stories.
At the end of Barrie's play, Wendy cannot return to Neverland, even though she would like to, because Neverland is reserved for children.
Maybe because this is a film that I truly enjoyed, even though its flaws stuck out a mile when I started writing the review.
Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast, even though he doesn't appear (almost, one might think, as a lark) until halfway through the movie!
Pretty good work from the Coens as the theme and concept was neat and funny even though it may not be a critical success the star power of Pitt, Clooney, McDormand, Malkovich, and Swinton will make it a commercial success.
Good one here indeed hence the 10 stars I'd give it even though it ain't win no Oscars or nothing of 'em nice awards.
In fact when you think about it even though you may fall out of your seat laughing in any scene (they normally require buildups which are rare in modern comedies) you are either laughing or smiling in this film.
An excellent soundtrack also help this movie along even though its not needed.
Cinderella III also gives the character of the Prince a chance to develop (even though they still don't give him a name!)
But the point remains that in 1973 ciggie packets carried government health warnings and everyone knew of the dangers even though they didn't want to admit it .
They go in and work, even though they have to wear special masks, they're pretty safe.
And the supersonic Maiden One plane looks absolutely stunning, even though it is 70's B-TV-movie material.
When many first see this film, they will be surprised when they notice that it is a silent film even though made in 1931.
Oh, as for my guest, the honest-to-God prodigy: she said the music was magnificent (it was) even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing, it was well done.
I too saw this movie in the 80s, even though I was a child I could see that this was a special movie.
"The Movie Hero" is so smart about movies, too, that I even thought about the wonderful film "Adaptation" during the movie.
If you watch the early scenes with Doomed FiancÃ© and Love Interest, you'll see that even though they're engaged and try to believe they're happy together, they're not.
If they can't even keep a straight face or tone of voice while making this, then why should I when I watch it, even though it's not meant to be comedy.
Even if you manage to look past all that and try to enjoy it for the fights, it still disappoints: no original moves, lousy stunt work and 'enemies suddenly distracting each other so the main character can get away, even though all exits are locked' are some of the things that come into mind.
But Razzle Dazzle is refreshing enough that you'll never think of it as a Guest ripoff, even though it fits right in.
Edge has always been tremendous in the ring, and even though he faces off with the talentless Marc Mero, he still manages to put on a decent match.
This film will give you some very interesting things to see, and I don't mean naked women, even though there is plenty of that.
The film is pretty close to "School on Fire" even though it is not as fierce and pessimistic as that film which was made one year later.
Though we never learn exactly what happened to Casey and how that affected her relationship with her father, it is apparent that the relationship is strained even though there is still love between the two.
Anyway this is nitpicking, mostly the storyline is engrossing, even though the inclusion of the mole is really questionable.
To all people who like The Shawshank Redemption and people thinking that Tim Robbins actually saved his career with Shawshank Redemption (even though I've never seen the film): Tim Robbins ####ed up his career with this movie  The Only Reason I Gave It A 2 Is Because Unlike Most Book Movies It Didn't Spawn 8 Sequels (I'm Talking To You Harry Potter)
In my opinion, he had a big depression, he was forced to go to the psychiatrist who happened to be his father's friend, he abused him and he wasn't able to talk about it with his father even though it seemed that he was a good father and was open to hear everything his son wanted to say The boy felt too bad and desperate that he prefer to die than to speak... On the other hand, there's people who told me that they think the boy was depressed and forced to go with his father's friend and when he started abusing him, he started to feel dirty but at the same time he liked it, so he got confussed by the feeling of being gay, that he commited suicide.
When the movie was presented to us, the organizer said that even though the main character is dying, it's not a depressing movie.
Most of the girls in the village have a crush on the handsome hunter Gaston (voice of Richard White), but he desires Belle.... even though she thinks he is nothing more than a brainless, muscle-headed fool.
It shows a new format in Colombian films, the story is fresh even though it does deal with drugs, and the conflicts of the characters are perfectly plotted and put together into a delightful, artistic movie.
The Beatles are still a very popular act (even though they haven't really performed together since 1970) and this movie helps to debunk the moptop myth and shows two and a half very creative musicians creating songs still that people still enjoy listening to.
This, I thought, was good news even though I wasn't really aware that they had permanently split.
This movie has depth that some people might not be able to see...and even though sometimes it might get slow maybe they did it on purpose for you to reflect or so you can say yeah I'm not just watching another mindless movie.
I should, though, pay my respect to the actors, that didn't suck, even though the directing, the images and the script were totally under any level of tolerance.
All the characters are developed in such a way that we empathize with them even though some are a bit absurd, such as the dancer who wants to be a comedian but just isn't funny (played here by Paul Draper and on Broadway by Gene Kelly) and a black man (Reginald Beane) who's astonished at the mere idea of being paid to play piano.
This film is beautiful and even though the basic genre is horror this film plays out one of the greatest love stories played out in film history.
It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time, even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion.
He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend (Geena Davis) is seeing someone else (John Getz), even though his belief is wrong.
It involves the story of Charlie Brown,who invites to Thanksgiving dinner the rest of the gang which includes Peppermint Patty,her best friend Marcy,Franklin (the only African-American character on the show),Linus and his sister Lucy,and others to Charlie's house for Thanksgiving dinner even though the Brown family has other plans.

Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
Like with most of the fans of this movie,I fairly enjoyed it,as a guy -I enjoyed the eye-candy..Especially Sofi'a,even though she emulated that "cuchi-cuchi" Charo style,with her comical antics and Sofi'a over doing her hot and sexy colombian accent!!
Of course Al-Quada exists, and of course they planned 9/11 and executed it - even though you conspiracy theorists wants it to be Americans.
Many conspiracy theorists believed that USA or others planned 9/11, even though they had not examined the subject - it was their prejudge, that USA or Jews are behind every bad thing happening in human history, from the biblical-flood, to the plague in the middle-ages to finally 9/11.
It's clear to see who the lead players are and even though you know who's gonna go, you still root for them like they have a chance, something you don't see too often.
But for most of the action sequences the creatures are CGI but even though it's easy to tell, it still looks good since they move so fast.
If you get a chance give this one a watch, even though you may have seen this type of story before, it's more fun then you may think.
It's fun to watch, even though you know how it's probably going to turn out in the end.
The writing is quite good and even though there requires a certain suspension of disbelief in the plot, the characters remain true to form.
So, even though this movie takes us through some familiar territory, I still thought it was a lovely ride.
Saw it before, and watched it again last night, even though I normally don't watch films twice.
