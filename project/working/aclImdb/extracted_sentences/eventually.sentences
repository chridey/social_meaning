Mario Landi's "Patrick Still Lives" has to be one of the sleaziest exploitation sickies ever made in Italy.It's filled with incredible amount of nudity and masturbation.Gianni Dei plays Patrick,a young man who is sent into coma as the result of the random act of violence.He lies in his bed looking into space for the most part and killing people with his telekinetic powers.The script is pretty bad,but the gore is mildly shocking.Still the scene where Maria Angela Giordano has a long metal pole pushed into her vagina is a real jaw dropper...Another offensive murder scene involves a lovely black-haired woman killed by her own dogs:they chase her all over the grounds before biting,licking and chewing her around the genitals,eventually killing her.The masturbation scene of stunningly beautiful Anna Venziano is also worth mentioning.Like earlier Mario Landi's sleazefest "Giallo a Venezia"(1979),"Patrick Still Lives" is cheap,shoddy,misogynistic and gleefully disgusting.It's just a pure exploitation film,so you should enjoy it as such.Highly recommended,if you like sleaze and extreme gore.

Since childhood I've found the actors playing the bad guys more interesting than the main characters,at least till about 1970 or so.Many that I viewed in the 1950's didn't last long in a movie or TV program because they were an early victim to the star.Some eventually went on to make names for their selves but for the most part I liked them more when playing minor roles.Some of those minor role villains are in this movie and I found them very entertaining.There's Neville Brand playing King Fisher,a good performer but sometimes a little bit to scary even for me when dealing out punishment.Others like Faro (Lee Van Cleef),Sundown Whipple(John Doucette) and Blackburn(Claude Akins) are in top menacing form.While not a household name another quality performer is Robert Middleton playing Ben Ryerson.Whether playing a politician or a mob boss he gives a quality performance.In this movie he's a bit grubby looking but handy with both a gun and a knife.Then there's Willie (Elisha Cook Jr) one of Fisher's men.He usually bursts into a room big eyed bearing news but has to grab a quick drink before speaking.So much to my delight the cast includes a rouge's gallery of personal favorites,almost like a dream come true.For those who like the good guys the movie leans more towards a nightmare.Jack Palance plays Jacob Wade the main character.As usual he has the look of a strong tough looking man.His performance is better than usual but that just means it's not as stiff as usual.The story lacks a bit of direction also.Those two points are forgotten because of Anthony Perkins who plays Jacob Wade's son Riley.His part lacks direction or maybe a director as it seems like he or someone else wants to sabotage this movie.First off he's too old and big to be playing the part of the son.When he does show some sign of a emotion it's fitting more for someone at least 10 years younger than him.To the simple statement that his mother(deceased) was a fine woman he responds blandly"talk about my mother again and I'll kill you",really off the wall.Elaine Aiken gives a good performance and is nice looking.In another comment it was basically said her character with it's good qualities has no reason to be interested romantically in the wimpy Perkins character,that's hitting the nail on the head.So this movie was just about what I expected,the minor roles out shining the main characters.One of the main characters looked like a good friend must of gave them the part.
