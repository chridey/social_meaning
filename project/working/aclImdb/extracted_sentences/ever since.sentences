When I first saw this movie(Vampire) on TV some years ago, and have looked for it ever since, I was enthralled with Richard Lynch, his portrayal is 'right on' in this role..............now some of you may not agree with me, but I also put Rutger Hauer in a similar category, delightful to watch, downright scary in some of his roles,(Nighthawks) but the ultimate romantic, if given half a chance...........of course, my all-time favorite love story movie is Ladyhawke, so I admit to being a tad prejudiced.......I have seen Richard Lynch in a number of TV movies, series, etc, but have lost track of him over the recent years......  there are also websites for Rutger Hauer where his fans can go to keep up with his movie roles, etc........He also is the founder of an organization that helps AIDS victims, mostly children, i believe.....called STARFISH.

I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, ever since his "Even Stevens" days, and knew he could give it credibility.
I saw this about 14 years ago in a stroke of luck ( a local TV station had picked up a print, and my mother, horror buff that she is, decided to tape it), and the film has stuck with me ever since.
Hello,I just wanted to say that I loved the movie,the ending with the duet song was just great,I cried.I love movies like that.I have been trying to find the movie to buy ever since I seen it,please tell me how I can order it.Thank you so much,God Bless.Naomi was just great in the movie and the young lady that sang with her has a great voice,I am surprised that I haven't seen a album out of her.It was as if it could be real life.All the actors and actress were just great.I have also seen Naomi in Touched by an Angel she does so good in movies like this.I cant wait to see more movies like this,thats what we need on TV more family stuff.
I've been a Sleepy Hollow affectionado ever since i saw the animated Disney classic as a kid, and I suppose I've seen pretty much every version from TV, movies, and cartoons since the 1950's.
This movie was one of the best Aussie movies that I have ever seen and I have been looking for a copy of it ever since I was in a teenager but with no success, now I know why.
This definitely is what music documentaries have used as the measuring stick to define themselves ever since.
ever since that show finished there's been a much need of something that measures even halfway.
I had been hyping myself up a great deal for Lust, Caution ever since I first heard of the project, so I'm glad to say that it did not disappoint.
It has stayed with me ever since.
It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status.
The movie was incredible, ever since I saw it in 1977 I told my wife she had to see it, it was really funny.
